15925,organisms constantly ingest microplastics directly from the environment or indirectly via trophic transfer due to the pervasiveness of microplastic pollution however most previous studies have only focused on waterborne exposure at the individual level while few studies have investigated the contribution of trophic transfer to the exposure in organisms we comprehensively evaluated the differences in microplastic ingestion and toxic effects in zebrafish exposed to microplastics via two concurrent routes waterborne and foodborne the polyethylene microplastics 40 47 μm 0 1 10 mg l concentration used here was set in a range closed to the environmentally relevant microplastic concentrations especially considering the extreme high concentration scenarios in wastewater the concentration of microplastics resulting from foodborne exposure 0 01 0 01 μg mg 0 1 0 1 particles mg was significantly lower than that through waterborne exposure 0 06 0 02 μg mg 0 8 0 3 particles mg suggesting the ingestion of microplastics in their tissues occurs mainly through direct environmental uptake rather than food chain transfer though the initial microplastic concentration was 1000 folds lower however more sublethal impacts including the significant abnormal hyperactive swimming behaviour 107 5 induction p 0 05 were observed in the foodborne group than waterborne group additionally ingenuity pathway analysis predicted both exposure routes caused obvious nervous system interference but through opposite modes of action this was further verified by the alteration of neurotransmitter biomarkers that neurotoxicity mechanisms were completely different for the two exposure routes the neurotoxic effects of microplastics are non negligible and can exert together through both water and foodborne exposure routes which deserves further attention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic waterborne food chain uptake neurotoxic effects 1 introduction microplastics plastic particles with diameters smaller than 5 mm have received extensive attention in recent years since they are ubiquitous in the environment mathalon and hill 2014 urban environments represent a condensed area of human activities including the production and use of plastic materials and urban rivers may therefore be a key transporter of microplastic pollution e g niu et al 2021 tibbetts et al 2018 xu et al 2021b some studies also imply that densely populated areas e g urban areas have higher microplastic concentrations compared to remote areas xu et al 2021b wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered to be the main recipients of terrestrial microplastics before entering natural aquatic systems sun et al 2019 which are also considered to be the main sources of microplastic contaminants in the aquatic environments liu et al 2021a it has been proven that untreated microplastics are commonly discharged from wwtps enter water bodies and evenly accumulate in the environment carr et al 2016 additionally microplastics have aroused increasing concerns in aquatic ecosystems as marine organisms can directly ingest and rapidly accumulate microplastics in water according to a previous review the abundance of microplastics in 256 aquatic species in china ranges from 0 07 to 164 items individual and from 0 1 to 168 5 items g w w fu et al 2020b note that the increase in the abundance of microplastics may enhance their bioavailability to organisms living in different locations and those at different trophic levels wang et al 2019 given the circumstances the risks of these untreated microplastics to the aquatic environment should be also evaluated organisms can ingest microplastics directly from their ambient environment or indirectly via trophic transfer hasegawa and nakaoka 2021 due to their small size buoyancy and ubiquity in the aquatic environment microplastics are inevitably ingested by aquatic organisms from the water jovanovic 2017 and subsequently accumulate in different tissues goldstein and goodwin 2013 li et al 2016 mathalon and hill 2014 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 meanwhile there is still being researched that small microplastics can translocate from the digestive system into internal tissues and exert adverse physiological effects browne et al 2008 hasegawa and nakaoka 2021 prokić et al 2021 previous studies have indicated that microplastics are able to be taken and remain in organisms following a short term waterborne exposure 1 h 7 days gray and weinstein 2017 watts et al 2016 sikdokur et al 2020 for instance microplastics from seawater 1 0 103 items ml can accumulate in crabs charybdis japonica with a bioconcentration factor bcf of 5 20 103 wang et al 2021 moreover several studies have reported that microplastics can even be indirectly taken up via food chain transfer from lower trophic levels to higher trophic levels such as from fish to seal and sea lion eriksson and burton 2003 from brine shrimp larvae artemia nauplii to zebrafish danio rerio batel et al 2016 or from copepods eurytemora affinis to opossum shrimp mysis relicta setälä et al 2014 thus how microplastics affect marine ecosystems has drawn increasing attention over the last few years although some investigations suggested trophic transfer played an important role in the uptake similar to the waterborne exposure and temporary presence of microplastics was found in consumers there were additional issues to be resolved for example some did not provide direct evidence that the presence of microplastics in higher trophic animals is due to dietary exposure farrell and nelson 2013 fred ahmadu et al 2019 von moos et al 2012 some did not monitor the whole process of microplastics uptake and depuration triebskorn et al 2019 and some used very high exposure concentrations which were several orders of magnitude higher than the concentration in the real aquatic environment chae et al 2018 kim et al 2018 setälä et al 2014 zuccarello et al 2019 therefore information on the biomagnification potential of microplastics is still lacking the accumulation of microplastics in aquatic organisms can affect the physiological health of individuals au et al 2017 wang et al 2019 including decreasing feeding rates inhibiting growth and causing mortality chen et al 2020 gambardella et al 2017 wang et al 2019 waterborne exposure to microplastics has been verified to cause a reduction in energy supplying substances and an increase in amino acid amounts in zebrafish chen et al 2020 and false satiety caused by digestive tract blockage can further result in energy reserve depletion cole et al 2013 lusher et al 2017 recently some studies have also found that waterborne microplastic exposure can even cause neurotoxicity and behavioural abnormalities in zebrafish chen et al 2020 wan et al 2019 fewer studies have investigated the toxic effects of trophic transferred microplastics on aquatic organisms but behavioural alteration patterns have been demonstrated da costa araújo et al 2020 mattsson et al 2017 although a previous study has reported that increased amount of microplastics via trophic transfer could aggravate plastic mediated adverse effects i e disturbance of energy metabolism at an upper trophic level in comparison to aqueous microplastic exposure hasegawa and nakaoka 2021 the underlying reasons are largely unknown and a comprehensive evaluation of the molecular mechanisms is needed another important research motivation originates from the inconsistency of behavioural and neuronal effects in previous studies microplastic exposure can lead to hyperactive swimming behaviour and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity of fish with low food feeding 2 of body weight daily chen et al 2020 limonta et al 2019 oliveira et al 2013 whereas similar microplastic exposure experiments but with higher food feeding 5 or 6 of body weight daily showed opposite effects tongo and erhunmwunse 2022 yin et al 2019 we hypothesize that this inconsistency may be due to the different proportions of the two routes water and foodborne during the exposure thus the current study aims to examine the ingestion and remaining amounts of microplastics in zebrafish through the waterborne route and the foodborne microplastic contaminated daphnids route separately and to study the consequent toxicity in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 polyethylene pe microplastic particles pe was selected as our model microplastic as it is more common in surface water andrady 2011 due to its high yield and wide application plasticseurope 2020 pe was used at concentrations of 0 1 10 mg l equal to 103 105 plastic particles l a range that includes environmentally relevant concentrations fu et al 2020a the stock solution stored in brown glass bottles in dark was prepared in methanol at 10 000 mg l and diluted with the artificial freshwater afw table s1 to the exposure concentrations before use the final methanol concentration used in experiments was maintained at 0 1 v v to avoid any solvent influence the exposure solution was stirred thoroughly with glass rods for 10 min twice daily to resuspend particles in the exposure solutions fluorescent microplastic particles pe 1 045 g cm3 diameter 40 47 μm were purchased from cospheric co santa barbara usa the characteristics of the particles were confirmed using a stereomicroscope szh olympus japan the particle size was consistent with the lorentz distribution figure s1 and scanning electron microscopy revealed the particles were uniformly spherical shaped figure s2 according to the supplier the particles consisted of pure pe material with no additives to evaluate whether the pe materials would leach fluorescence dyes we added pe particles into a glass beaker with 1 l milli q water to obtain three pe concentrations of 0 1 1 and 10 mg l after 24 h the samples were filtered through a nylon membrane 10 μm ny2004700 millipore usa and no fluorescent particles were found on the filters under a fluorescence microscope olympus bx53 japan figure s3 2 2 experimental organisms and treatment 2 2 1 test organisms daphnids daphnia magna obtained from qingxiang aquarium yantai china and 6 month old adult zebrafish danio rerio figure s4 obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china were continuously cultured in the afw as shown in the supporting information sm text s1 2 2 2 waterborne exposure the waterborne exposure experiment was divided into the uptake and depuration periods zebrafish n 120 30 fish per group who fed on non exposed daphnids were separated into four groups the control afw and 0 1 mg l 1 mg l and 10 mg l microplastics in afw groups one mg l microplastics was equivalent to 1 4 104 items l microplastics 1 fish per replicate and 3 replicates at each sampling point per group during the uptake process zebrafish were sampled on days 1 2 3 5 and 7 the exposure solutions were replaced daily to ensure semi static exposure following microplastic exposure the fish were transferred to clean afw for depuration and sampled at 4 8 12 24 and 48 h the experiment was run with three replicates per time point after sampling the zebrafish were rinsed immediately with milli q water three times to remove microplastics that had adhered to the fish skin and then euthanized with 0 4 g l benzocaine the gills and gits were excised for further microplastic quantification and the livers and brains were separated flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c for further biological analysis 2 2 3 foodborne exposure to obtain microplastic contaminated daphnids we selected medium sized daphnids and examined their microplastic uptake pattern according to a pilot experiment text s2 the microplastic concentration in daphnids exposed to 1 mg l microplastics which is an environmentally relevant concentration almost achieved bioconcentration equilibrium 0 2 0 1 µg mg after 24 h figure s5b therefore we chose daphnids exposed to 1 mg l microplastics for 24 h as food source for the subsequent foodborne exposure experiment additionally one group of fish fed clean daphnids not exposed to microplastics was used as control zebrafish ate all daphnids 10 daphnids 3 zebrafish which we put into the tank per day approximately 5 of the wet weight of one zebrafish in our preliminary experiment no daphnids were left in the tanks after 20 min three replicates were run for the control and the foodborne treatments the foodborne exposure experiment was divided into uptake and depuration periods similar to the waterborne exposure zebrafish were sampled on days 1 2 3 5 and 7 during the uptake period and at 4 8 12 24 and 48 h during the depuration period the subsequent procedures were the same as those for the waterborne exposure experiment 2 2 4 microplastic particles measurement in organisms daphnids and the gills and gastrointestinal tracts gits of zebrafish exposed to microplastics were rinsed with milli q water and transferred to 15 ml centrifuge tubes corning usa containing 5 ml 30 h2o2 for digestion the h2o2 digestion conditions in the previous study did not impact the ability to correctly identify the pe characters based on a fluorescence microscope karami et al 2017a digestion was conducted in an incubator hz 9612 k taicang china at 65 c and 80 rpm for 24 h after digestion the samples were diluted 1 2 v v with milli q water and filtered through filters 20 μm nylon millipore uk the filtrates were analysed under a fluorescence microscope for quantification the fluorescently labeled microplastics were counted numerically one by one and the recovery rate was between 95 4 and 111 8 2 3 uptake and depuration kinetics models and calculations the uptake and depuration rates and the mean residence time mrt the average time that microplastics stayed in fish were calculated using equations according to alava 2020 and liu et al 2021b for calculation details see text s3 2 4 behavioural monitoring to investigate whether the swimming behaviour of zebrafish was affected after microplastic exposure the movement of zebrafish was monitored at the end of the uptake period using a daniovision video tracking system equipped with ethovision xt software noldus netherlands which has been successfully applied to analyse the ecotoxicological effects of particulate pollutants in previous studies chen et al 2017a legradi et al 2018 each experiment was carried out in a 24 12 cm length width water tank containing 400 ml of afw and three female or male zebrafish before monitoring the fish were acclimatized in the dark under quiet conditions for 10 min then behavioural endpoints moved distance and time of different swimming status of adult zebrafish were recorded for five minutes in a soundproofed environment 2 5 rna sequencing rna seq and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr to determine the genes potentially responsible for behavioural abnormalities induced by pe microplastics in zebrafish total rna was extracted from the liver samples by using trizol reagent invitrogen usa subsequent cdna library construction and rna seq were performed by majorbio biotechnology co shanghai china detailed information on the rna seq and ingenuity pathway analysis ipa procedures is provided in the sm text s4 total rna was also used to perform qrt pcr according to a previously described method xu et al 2021a specific primers for the selected differentially expressed genes degs were synthesized by shenggong biotech shanghai china and the sequences are listed in table s3 a mixture of 8 μl sybr master mix 1 μl forward primer 1 μl reverse primer 5 μl ultrapure water and 1 μl reverse transcription product was used for polymerase chain reaction the thermocycler cfx 6 bio rad usa conditions were as follows 95 c for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 c 30 s at 60 c and 5 s at 54 c gapdh was used as a reference gene and the relative expression of each gene was calculated by the 2 δδct method livak and schmittgen 2001 2 6 neurotransmitter level measurement each fish brain sample stored at 80 c was immediately homogenized on ice in phosphate buffered saline ph 7 4 and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min at 4 c and the supernatants were collected for further analysis 3 brain samples per replicate and 3 replicates the levels of neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter related molecules acetyl coa carboxylase acc dopamine da 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 ht neuraminic acid na were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits jiancheng biotech nanjing china following the manufacturer s protocols the levels of molecules related to the cholinergic system acetylcholinesterase ache acetylcholine ach choline acetyltransferase chat cholinesterase che were determined using diagnostic kits jiancheng biotech nanjing china according to the manufacturer s instructions one replicate of each group was pooled together from three brains of female zebrafish and three replicates were calculated as one group n 3 the enzyme activities are expressed in μg per mg of protein for elisa analysis the intra assay and inter assay coefficients of variance cv were 10 and 12 2 7 oxidative stress biomarker and adenosine 5 triphosphate atp content measurement part of the liver samples was homogenized for determination of the activities of the superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and glutathione peroxidase gsh px the level of the reduced form of glutathione gsh and the contents of oxygen species ros and atp according to the manufacturer s protocols with commercial kits jiancheng biotech nanjing china to integrate all measured biomarker responses into one general stress index the integrated biomarker response version 2 ibrv2 was calculated according to sanchez et al 2013 the detailed ibrv2 calculation method is presented in the sm text s5 2 8 statistical analysis in this study the results are presented as the mean standard error se all data were confirmed to be normally distributed by utilizing the kolmogorov smirnov test and a t test or one way anova was used to compare the differences between the control and treatment groups the level of significance was set at the 95 confidence level all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics ver 25 0 ibm usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 ingestion and remaining amounts of pe microplastics during the uptake period zebrafish can ingest microplastics through both the waterborne and foodborne routes whose exposure concentrations were environmentally relevant fig 1 a during the whole process the blank control tissues were also measured and no fluorescent particles were found in the blank controls the results showed that the git was the main tissue in which microplastics remained after waterborne exposure as the microplastic concentration in the git was significantly higher than that in the gills p 0 05 fig 1 the microplastic concentration in the git peaked on day 7 at which point it was 0 3 0 1 and 5 2 1 2 μg mg 10 fold and 1 9 fold higher than the concentration in the gills in the 1 and 10 mg l waterborne exposure groups respectively microplastic concentration peaked on day 5 in the 0 1 mg l waterborne group fig 1b probably due to the low and unstable burden of microplastics on the body which lead to relatively large data differences xu et al 2021a in the depuration stage microplastics were quickly excreted from the fish git and gills and the equilibrium concentration was generally reached after 12 h of depuration the remaining microplastic concentrations in zebrafish in the 1 mg l and 10 mg l groups after 48 h of depuration were 0 06 0 02 git 0 04 0 01 gill 0 01 0 01 μg mg and 0 3 0 1 git 0 2 0 1 gill 0 7 0 2 μg mg respectively accounting for 17 1 3 6 and 3 4 0 6 of the total uptake amount respectively figs 1c d in the 0 1 mg l group no microplastics were detected during the first 12 h and a very small amount of microplastics 0 02 0 01 μg mg was detected in the git at the end of depuration fig 1b which was mainly attributed to the low uptake amounts and fast depuration rate in the fish the microplastic body concentrations were obtained based on three replicates at each sampling time point and the differences in organism individuals ingestion amounts resulted in the data fluctuation zebrafish fed microplastic contaminated daphnids showed a similar trend in microplastic uptake as those in the waterborne exposure groups however the amount of microplastics that remained following foodborne exposure was significantly lower than that in the 1 mg l waterborne exposure group p 0 05 after 7 days of foodborne exposure the microplastic concentration was 0 03 0 01 μg mg in the git and 0 02 0 01 μg mg in the gill fig 1e which were only 8 6 2 7 and 12 8 12 8 respectively of the levels in the 1 mg l waterborne exposure group fig 1c the concentrations of microplastics remaining in the git and gill after foodborne exposure were 0 001 0 001 and 0 008 0 007 μg mg respectively accounting for 15 7 9 1 and 42 3 11 4 respectively of the total uptake amount after 48 h of depuration fig 1e therefore we deduced that microplastics can remain in zebrafish due to direct uptake from water or the ingestion of microplastic contaminated zooplankton at lower trophic levels such as d magna at the same aqueous concentration 1 mg l however the ingested and remaining amounts of microplastics resulting from foodborne exposure was significantly lower than that resulting from waterborne exposure p 0 05 figure s6 it is noteworthy that the absolute microplastic concentration in 1 mg l foodborne group is 1000 folds lower than the 1 mg l waterborne group therefore this study did not carry out similar exposure concentrations of microplastics in the tank for the two treatments but just to compare the effects of water and foodborne exposure routes that occurred simultaneously the uptake and depuration processes for microplastics observed in this study differ from those of traditional organic pollutants the interaction between organisms and microplastics insoluble and poorly dispersed particulates is dynamic and it is difficult to reach a steady state gouin 2020 therefore the ingestion of microplastics by aquatic organisms is often followed by rapid depuration dawson et al 2018 which is consistent with the findings of our study fig 1 table s2 moreover previous studies have shown that the consumption of microplastics is greater when fish are exposed to higher concentrations hoang and felix kim 2020 jeong et al 2017 malinich et al 2018 which explains why the highest uptake rate was observed in the 10 mg l group the uptake rates of microplastics following exposure through the waterborne route were high kd 8 12 and 38 73 l g d and the remaining concentration in the body decreased rapidly after depuration resulting in low mrts 1 55 and 0 63 d in the 1 and 10 mg l groups respectively table s2 interestingly although significantly fewer microplastics remained following foodborne exposure kd 0 05 g g day than waterborne exposure the longer residence time 1 81 d of the particles ingested through foodborne exposure enhanced the effects of the microplastics fred ahmadu et al 2019 3 2 transcriptomic responses of microplastics predict neurotoxicity significant degs obtained from rna seq in each exposure group with 1136 1787 1194 and 813 genes significantly differentially expressed in the 0 1 mg l 1 mg l and 10 mg l waterborne and 1 mg l foodborne exposure when compared to controls respectively figure s7 according to ipa of affected pathways using rna seq data the neurotoxicity related creb camp response element binding protein signalling in neurons pathway was the most strongly affected pathway fig 2 a furthermore other pathways such as cardiac hypertrophy signalling synaptogenesis signalling oestrogen receptor signalling and role of nfat in cardiac hypertrophy were also significantly affected this indicates that exposure to microplastics had a systematic effect on zebrafish particularly neurotoxicity this was corroborated in a previous study limonta et al 2019 where they reported that adult zebrafish were exposed to two concentrations 0 1 and 1 mg l similar to our study of pe for twenty days and they found the transcriptomic expression in the immune system related to epithelium integrity and lipid metabolism of zebrafish were all changed ipa also suggested that the key factor for upstream regulation was ccaat enhancer binding protein β cebpb fig 2b which is a transcription factor related with neurotransmission immune response and life processes millward et al 2007 thus microplastic exposure was suggested to activate cebpb and then interfere with downstream genes and induced progressive neurological disorder and creb signalling in neurons interference fig 2c of note the effects and mechanisms of waterborne and foodborne exposure were completely different fig 2a c which were first indicated by our results a cluster analysis of the degs expression profiles showed that most degs were altered in inconsistent directions between the waterborne and foodborne treatment furthermore the 8 significantly degs col1a1a myca gpr63 bir5a bc12a appa caspa and adra1aa were also differently expressed between the waterborne and foodborne exposure as both rna seq and qrt pcr results showed fig 2d in particular although the concentration of microplastics in fish through the foodborne exposure was significantly lower than that through the waterborne approx 10 the effects of foodborne exposure should not be ignored because of its obvious neurotoxicity 3 3 effects of microplastics on neurotransmitter impacts as prediction of rna seq analysis in neurotoxicity we verified the levels of the monoamines 5 ht na and da in the brains of zebrafish fig 3 we found that foodborne exposure significantly increased the levels of 5 ht and da compared with the control p 0 05 similarly significantly increased da and na levels were only observed in the 0 1 mg l waterborne group compared with the control p 0 01 fig 3a we also found waterborne microplastic exposure led to ache che and chat activity increment in the brains of zebrafish compared with the control which increased gradually with increasing microplastic concentration p 0 05 fig 3e g h considering that the degs would be altered in different directions our result showed that exposure to pe microplastics through the foodborne route may have induced significant changes in da and 5 ht concentrations in zebrafish whereas the cholinergic system was the main system affected by waterborne exposure besides this is likely that the processes of microplastic attachment ingestion and depuration in daphnia sufficiently altered the microplastic surfaces i e corona formation on microplastics geitner et al 2016 which can also affect the toxicity effects of microplastics to zebrafish the neurotoxic effects of xenobiotics on the cholinergic system and its mechanism have been previously elucidated morley 2005 wessler et al 2019 after ach being synthesized by chat and released into synaptic cleft it is rapidly degraded by ache and butyrylcholinesterase into acetic acid and water dal forno et al 2013 afterwards activation of the cholinergic signalling pathway contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability leading to behavioural responses wu et al 2016 the dysregulation of ach chat and ache have been widely applied as indicators of neurotoxicity in zebrafish agostini et al 2017 to our surprise there were no significant changes in ache activity some studies used as a representative neurotoxic biomarker guerrera et al 2021 either through foodborne or waterborne routes implying solely ache measurement may not be sufficient to identify microplastic neurotoxicity in the cholinergic system this might also be because the inhibition of ache was often observed after nanoplastic exposure but not occurred after micron sized plastics exposure chu et al 2019 ding et al 2018 karami et al 2017b although both particles can cause locomotory behaviour alteration moreover extensive evidence indicated that dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of developmental behavioural and physiologic processes including anxiety and affective states in zebrafish padilla and macphail 2011 we previously found da increased during the co exposure of nanoplastics and bisphenol a chen et al 2017b few other studies have focused on these non cholinergic neurotransmitters prüst et al 2020 but 5 ht and da also increased significantly here especially for the foodborne exposure thus our results implied that we should evaluate the neurotoxicity caused by microplastics with multiple biomarkers and more systematically 3 4 neurotransmitter disorder induces locomotion behaviour alterations after microplastics exposure the distance travelled by female zebrafish exposed to either waterborne or foodborne microplastics was significantly longer than that of control p 0 01 fig 4 a the heatmap of swimming tracks figure s11 also indicated that zebrafish became hyperactive after microplastic exposure which is consistent with our previous findings that the locomotion of zebrafish was significantly increased after exposure to 5 μm microplastics chen et al 2020 moreover the most severe hyperactivity occurred at the highest concentration of 10 mg l p 0 01 fig 4a moreover it is noteworthy that although the ingestion of microplastics in zebrafish through foodborne exposure was very low hyperactivity in these fish was similar to that in the fish exposed to waterborne exposure the manic and active states of zebrafish in the waterborne groups were largely prolonged especially with the increase of exposure concentration fig 4b p 0 01 similarly there were statistically longer durations for fish staying in manic and active states of fish in the foodborne group than the control p 0 01 locomotion behaviour alterations may be caused by oxidative damage energy and lipid metabolisms and neurotoxicity chen et al 2017a 2020 2017b ding et al 2018 but we did not find significant oxidative stress in zebrafish by assaying five biomarkers sod cat gsh gsh px and ros in liver samples figure s9 microplastics exposure could affect the enzyme activity of the antioxidant system in zebrafish but no serious oxidative damage was found according to the integrated ibr result figure s10 additionally we also did not find a correlation between atp content and the swimming behaviour alterations fig 2c thus the swimming behavioural changes were very likely to be causal linked with neurotoxicity behaviours are highly affected by neural function regulation and neurotransmission which processes are involved by many molecular components such as neurotransmitters da belongs to dopaminergic neuronal system and the overstimulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission leads to hyperactivity of organisms padilla and macphail 2011 staller and faraone 2007 additionally 5 ht is a typical serotoninergic system component whose levels were often stable during fish development and thus its alteration could be an important indicator for neurotoxicity padilla and macphail 2011 tufi et al 2016 in our study levels of da and 5 ht in the brain increased significantly in the foodborne treatment which was in accordance with the behaviour alteration of zebrafish after foodborne exposure the activation of ach pathways was only found in the waterborne exposure groups suggesting the neurotoxicity in cholinergic system will be aggravated after waterborne microplastic treatment therefore the mechanisms for behavioural performance were different between the two exposure scenarios which coincided with the differentially expressed genes although our results cannot provide a definitive proof that the changes in monoaminergic synaptic function were causally linked to the behavioural alterations however earlier work in the zebrafish model showed that acute challenge with nicotine which similarly evoked an increase in synaptic monoamine release has the same effect on behaviour alterations as that seen here eddins et al 2009 consequently in our study the probable reason for the change in locomotor behaviour in waterborne exposure was the interference of the cholinergic system similar result was found in 14 dpf zebrafish larvae exposed to microspheres and cu whose dysfunctional swimming activity observed was indicative of alterations in the neurological function in part seemed to be associated with the significant inhibition of the enzyme ache moreover microspheres alone and co exposed with cu exerted a higher effect on ache than cu alone santos et al 2021 it should be noted that we analysed the alterations of genes and neurotransmitters in female zebrafish which is because the swimming behaviour results indicated that female zebrafish swimming behaviour became more significantly hyperactive than the male ones figure s12 a probable reason for the differences was that the gonadal hormones and trait anxiety may influence the sensitivity to the anti anxiety effect of microplastics in female organisms sarasamma et al 2020 and these differences may be due in part to their distinct distribution of gaba containing interneurons ravenelle et al 2014 therefore the neurotoxicity of microplastics obtained has not been verified in male zebrafish and further research is necessary 3 5 environmental implications microplastics also may accumulate along food chains and cause detrimental effects on aquatic organisms especially those at higher trophic levels however most previous studies of microplastic ingestion or toxicity only focused on the effects of waterborne exposure at the individual level and only a few studies focused on trophic transfer of microplastics between aquatic organisms elizalde velázquez et al 2020 hasegawa and nakaoka 2021 nelms et al 2018 a recent study showed that biomagnification of microplastics is unlikely to occur because they can be rapidly excreted from organisms and do not accumulate in the body walkinshaw et al 2020 similar results were found in our study but the abnormal swimming behaviour and neurotoxic effects induced even at low microplastic concentrations deserve further attention such knowledge of the differences in microplastic ingestion and toxic effects in zebrafish exposed to microplastic through waterborne and foodborne routes would undoubtedly contribute to the best understanding of the impacts caused by these pollutants on aquatic ecosystems our study confirmed that direct environmental uptake 40 47 μm pe microplastics and food chain transfer d magna and d rerio as a model prey predator system can cause neurotoxicity and behavioural abnormalities however our study is only an exposure experiment with non weathered particles which will have different physico chemical properties and conducted in a lab environment with a model fish this phenomenon is species or plastic type specific and deserves further investigation for instance exposure to polyvinyl chloride microplastics can cause oxidative damage in gold fish carassius auratus romano et al 2020 but does not affect the physiological performance of mussels perna perna santana et al 2018 other factors such as the shape size and composition of the microplastics the environment e g the extent of local urbanization the exposure period the physiological characteristics of the exposed organisms and food chain complexity may also be closely related to bioaccumulation capacity and toxic effects conclusions our study showed that zebrafish exposed to the highest concentration 10 mg l ingested more microplastics than other treatments although rapid excretion of microplastics was observed exposure to microplastics negatively affected the physiological functions of zebrafish microplastic exposure through either the waterborne or foodborne route caused severe hyperactivity in zebrafish although the abnormal motor behaviours induced by waterborne and foodborne microplastics looked similar the neurotoxicity mechanisms were completely different exposure to pe microplastics through the foodborne route may have induced significant changes in da and 5 ht concentrations in zebrafish whereas the cholinergic system was the main system affected by waterborne exposure additionally the water and foodborne exposure often occur simultaneously and therefore the joint neurotoxic effects of these two exposure routes should be

only focused on waterborne exposure at the individual level while few studies have investigated the contribution of trophic transfer to the exposure in organisms we comprehensively evaluated the differences in microplastic ingestion and toxic effects in zebrafish exposed to microplastics via two concurrent routes waterborne and foodborne the polyethylene microplastics 40 47 μm 0 1 10 mg l concentration used here was set in a range closed to the environmentally relevant microplastic concentrations especially considering the extreme high concentration scenarios in wastewater the concentration of microplastics resulting from foodborne exposure 0 01 0 01 μg mg 0 1 0 1 particles mg was significantly lower than that through waterborne exposure 0 06 0 02 μg mg 0 8 0 3 particles mg suggesting the ingestion of microplastics in their tissues occurs mainly through direct environmental uptake rather than food chain transfer though the initial microplastic concentration was 1000 folds lower however more sublethal impacts including the significant abnormal hyperactive swimming behaviour 107 5 induction p 0 05 were observed in the foodborne group than waterborne group additionally ingenuity pathway analysis predicted both exposure routes caused obvious nervous system interference but through opposite modes of action this was further verified by the alteration of neurotransmitter biomarkers that neurotoxicity mechanisms were completely different for the two exposure routes the neurotoxic effects of microplastics are non negligible and can exert together through both water and foodborne exposure routes which deserves further attention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic waterborne food chain uptake neurotoxic effects 1 introduction microplastics plastic particles with diameters smaller than 5 mm have received extensive attention in recent years since they are ubiquitous in the environment mathalon and hill 2014 urban environments represent a condensed area of human activities including the production and use of plastic materials and urban rivers may therefore be a key transporter of microplastic pollution e g niu et al 2021 tibbetts et al 2018 xu et al 2021b some studies also imply that densely populated areas e g urban areas have higher microplastic concentrations compared to remote areas xu et al 2021b wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered to be the main recipients of terrestrial microplastics before entering natural aquatic systems sun et al 2019 which are also considered to be the main sources of microplastic contaminants in the aquatic environments liu et al 2021a it has been proven that untreated microplastics are commonly discharged from wwtps enter water bodies and evenly accumulate in the environment carr et al 2016 additionally microplastics have aroused increasing concerns in aquatic ecosystems as marine organisms can directly ingest and rapidly accumulate microplastics in water according to a previous review the abundance of microplastics in 256 aquatic species in china ranges from 0 07 to 164 items individual and from 0 1 to 168 5 items g w w fu et al 2020b note that the increase in the abundance of microplastics may enhance their bioavailability to organisms living in different locations and those at different trophic levels wang et al 2019 given the circumstances the risks of these untreated microplastics to the aquatic environment should be also evaluated organisms can ingest microplastics directly from their ambient environment or indirectly via trophic transfer hasegawa and nakaoka 2021 due to their small size buoyancy and ubiquity in the aquatic environment microplastics are inevitably ingested by aquatic organisms from the water jovanovic 2017 and subsequently accumulate in different tissues goldstein and goodwin 2013 li et al 2016 mathalon and hill 2014 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 meanwhile there is still being researched that small microplastics can translocate from the digestive system into internal tissues and exert adverse physiological effects browne et al 2008 hasegawa and nakaoka 2021 prokić et al 2021 previous studies have indicated that microplastics are able to be taken and remain in organisms following a short term waterborne exposure 1 h 7 days gray and weinstein 2017 watts et al 2016 sikdokur et al 2020 for instance microplastics from seawater 1 0 103 items ml can accumulate in crabs charybdis japonica with a bioconcentration factor bcf of 5 20 103 wang et al 2021 moreover several studies have reported that microplastics can even be indirectly taken up via food chain transfer from lower trophic levels to higher trophic levels such as from fish to seal and sea lion eriksson and burton 2003 from brine shrimp larvae artemia nauplii to zebrafish danio rerio batel et al 2016 or from copepods eurytemora affinis to opossum shrimp mysis relicta setälä et al 2014 thus how microplastics affect marine ecosystems has drawn increasing attention over the last few years although some investigations suggested trophic transfer played an important role in the uptake similar to the waterborne exposure and temporary presence of microplastics was found in consumers there were additional issues to be resolved for example some did not provide direct evidence that the presence of microplastics in higher trophic animals is due to dietary exposure farrell and nelson 2013 fred ahmadu et al 2019 von moos et al 2012 some did not monitor the whole process of microplastics uptake and depuration triebskorn et al 2019 and some used very high exposure concentrations which were several orders of magnitude higher than the concentration in the real aquatic environment chae et al 2018 kim et al 2018 setälä et al 2014 zuccarello et al 2019 therefore information on the biomagnification potential of microplastics is still lacking the accumulation of microplastics in aquatic organisms can affect the physiological health of individuals au et al 2017 wang et al 2019 including decreasing feeding rates inhibiting growth and causing mortality chen et al 2020 gambardella et al 2017 wang et al 2019 waterborne exposure to microplastics has been verified to cause a reduction in energy supplying substances and an increase in amino acid amounts in zebrafish chen et al 2020 and false satiety caused by digestive tract blockage can further result in energy reserve depletion cole et al 2013 lusher et al 2017 recently some studies have also found that waterborne microplastic exposure can even cause neurotoxicity and behavioural abnormalities in zebrafish chen et al 2020 wan et al 2019 fewer studies have investigated the toxic effects of trophic transferred microplastics on aquatic organisms but behavioural alteration patterns have been demonstrated da costa araújo et al 2020 mattsson et al 2017 although a previous study has reported that increased amount of microplastics via trophic transfer could aggravate plastic mediated adverse effects i e disturbance of energy metabolism at an upper trophic level in comparison to aqueous microplastic exposure hasegawa and nakaoka 2021 the underlying reasons are largely unknown and a comprehensive evaluation of the molecular mechanisms is needed another important research motivation originates from the inconsistency of behavioural and neuronal effects in previous studies microplastic exposure can lead to hyperactive swimming behaviour and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity of fish with low food feeding 2 of body weight daily chen et al 2020 limonta et al 2019 oliveira et al 2013 whereas similar microplastic exposure experiments but with higher food feeding 5 or 6 of body weight daily showed opposite effects tongo and erhunmwunse 2022 yin et al 2019 we hypothesize that this inconsistency may be due to the different proportions of the two routes water and foodborne during the exposure thus the current study aims to examine the ingestion and remaining amounts of microplastics in zebrafish through the waterborne route and the foodborne microplastic contaminated daphnids route separately and to study the consequent toxicity in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 polyethylene pe microplastic particles pe was selected as our model microplastic as it is more common in surface water andrady 2011 due to its high yield and wide application plasticseurope 2020 pe was used at concentrations of 0 1 10 mg l equal to 103 105 plastic particles l a range that includes environmentally relevant concentrations fu et al 2020a the stock solution stored in brown glass bottles in dark was prepared in methanol at 10 000 mg l and diluted with the artificial freshwater afw table s1 to the exposure concentrations before use the final methanol concentration used in experiments was maintained at 0 1 v v to avoid any solvent influence the exposure solution was stirred thoroughly with glass rods for 10 min twice daily to resuspend particles in the exposure solutions fluorescent microplastic particles pe 1 045 g cm3 diameter 40 47 μm were purchased from cospheric co santa barbara usa the characteristics of the particles were confirmed using a stereomicroscope szh olympus japan the particle size was consistent with the lorentz distribution figure s1 and scanning electron microscopy revealed the particles were uniformly spherical shaped figure s2 according to the supplier the particles consisted of pure pe material with no additives to evaluate whether the pe materials would leach fluorescence dyes we added pe particles into a glass beaker with 1 l milli q water to obtain three pe concentrations of 0 1 1 and 10 mg l after 24 h the samples were filtered through a nylon membrane 10 μm ny2004700 millipore usa and no fluorescent particles were found on the filters under a fluorescence microscope olympus bx53 japan figure s3 2 2 experimental organisms and treatment 2 2 1 test organisms daphnids daphnia magna obtained from qingxiang aquarium yantai china and 6 month old adult zebrafish danio rerio figure s4 obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china were continuously cultured in the afw as shown in the supporting information sm text s1 2 2 2 waterborne exposure the waterborne exposure experiment was divided into the uptake and depuration periods zebrafish n 120 30 fish per group who fed on non exposed daphnids were separated into four groups the control afw and 0 1 mg l 1 mg l and 10 mg l microplastics in afw groups one mg l microplastics was equivalent to 1 4 104 items l microplastics 1 fish per replicate and 3 replicates at each sampling point per group during the uptake process zebrafish were sampled on days 1 2 3 5 and 7 the exposure solutions were replaced daily to ensure semi static exposure following microplastic exposure the fish were transferred to clean afw for depuration and sampled at 4 8 12 24 and 48 h the experiment was run with three replicates per time point after sampling the zebrafish were rinsed immediately with milli q water three times to remove microplastics that had adhered to the fish skin and then euthanized with 0 4 g l benzocaine the gills and gits were excised for further microplastic quantification and the livers and brains were separated flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c for further biological analysis 2 2 3 foodborne exposure to obtain microplastic contaminated daphnids we selected medium sized daphnids and examined their microplastic uptake pattern according to a pilot experiment text s2 the microplastic concentration in daphnids exposed to 1 mg l microplastics which is an environmentally relevant concentration almost achieved bioconcentration equilibrium 0 2 0 1 µg mg after 24 h figure s5b therefore we chose daphnids exposed to 1 mg l microplastics for 24 h as food source for the subsequent foodborne exposure experiment additionally one group of fish fed clean daphnids not exposed to microplastics was used as control zebrafish ate all daphnids 10 daphnids 3 zebrafish which we put into the tank per day approximately 5 of the wet weight of one zebrafish in our preliminary experiment no daphnids were left in the tanks after 20 min three replicates were run for the control and the foodborne treatments the foodborne exposure experiment was divided into uptake and depuration periods similar to the waterborne exposure zebrafish were sampled on days 1 2 3 5 and 7 during the uptake period and at 4 8 12 24 and 48 h during the depuration period the subsequent procedures were the same as those for the waterborne exposure experiment 2 2 4 microplastic particles measurement in organisms daphnids and the gills and gastrointestinal tracts gits of zebrafish exposed to microplastics were rinsed with milli q water and transferred to 15 ml centrifuge tubes corning usa containing 5 ml 30 h2o2 for digestion the h2o2 digestion conditions in the previous study did not impact the ability to correctly identify the pe characters based on a fluorescence microscope karami et al 2017a digestion was conducted in an incubator hz 9612 k taicang china at 65 c and 80 rpm for 24 h after digestion the samples were diluted 1 2 v v with milli q water and filtered through filters 20 μm nylon millipore uk the filtrates were analysed under a fluorescence microscope for quantification the fluorescently labeled microplastics were counted numerically one by one and the recovery rate was between 95 4 and 111 8 2 3 uptake and depuration kinetics models and calculations the uptake and depuration rates and the mean residence time mrt the average time that microplastics stayed in fish were calculated using equations according to alava 2020 and liu et al 2021b for calculation details see text s3 2 4 behavioural monitoring to investigate whether the swimming behaviour of zebrafish was affected after microplastic exposure the movement of zebrafish was monitored at the end of the uptake period using a daniovision video tracking system equipped with ethovision xt software noldus netherlands which has been successfully applied to analyse the ecotoxicological effects of particulate pollutants in previous studies chen et al 2017a legradi et al 2018 each experiment was carried out in a 24 12 cm length width water tank containing 400 ml of afw and three female or male zebrafish before monitoring the fish were acclimatized in the dark under quiet conditions for 10 min then behavioural endpoints moved distance and time of different swimming status of adult zebrafish were recorded for five minutes in a soundproofed environment 2 5 rna sequencing rna seq and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr to determine the genes potentially responsible for behavioural abnormalities induced by pe microplastics in zebrafish total rna was extracted from the liver samples by using trizol reagent invitrogen usa subsequent cdna library construction and rna seq were performed by majorbio biotechnology co shanghai china detailed information on the rna seq and ingenuity pathway analysis ipa procedures is provided in the sm text s4 total rna was also used to perform qrt pcr according to a previously described method xu et al 2021a specific primers for the selected differentially expressed genes degs were synthesized by shenggong biotech shanghai china and the sequences are listed in table s3 a mixture of 8 μl sybr master mix 1 μl forward primer 1 μl reverse primer 5 μl ultrapure water and 1 μl reverse transcription product was used for polymerase chain reaction the thermocycler cfx 6 bio rad usa conditions were as follows 95 c for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 c 30 s at 60 c and 5 s at 54 c gapdh was used as a reference gene and the relative expression of each gene was calculated by the 2 δδct method livak and schmittgen 2001 2 6 neurotransmitter level measurement each fish brain sample stored at 80 c was immediately homogenized on ice in phosphate buffered saline ph 7 4 and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min at 4 c and the supernatants were collected for further analysis 3 brain samples per replicate and 3 replicates the levels of neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter related molecules acetyl coa carboxylase acc dopamine da 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 ht neuraminic acid na were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits jiancheng biotech nanjing china following the manufacturer s protocols the levels of molecules related to the cholinergic system acetylcholinesterase ache acetylcholine ach choline acetyltransferase chat cholinesterase che were determined using diagnostic kits jiancheng biotech nanjing china according to the manufacturer s instructions one replicate of each group was pooled together from three brains of female zebrafish and three replicates were calculated as one group n 3 the enzyme activities are expressed in μg per mg of protein for elisa analysis the intra assay and inter assay coefficients of variance cv were 10 and 12 2 7 oxidative stress biomarker and adenosine 5 triphosphate atp content measurement part of the liver samples was homogenized for determination of the activities of the superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and glutathione peroxidase gsh px the level of the reduced form of glutathione gsh and the contents of oxygen species ros and atp according to the manufacturer s protocols with commercial kits jiancheng biotech nanjing china to integrate all measured biomarker responses into one general stress index the integrated biomarker response version 2 ibrv2 was calculated according to sanchez et al 2013 the detailed ibrv2 calculation method is presented in the sm text s5 2 8 statistical analysis in this study the results are presented as the mean standard error se all data were confirmed to be normally distributed by utilizing the kolmogorov smirnov test and a t test or one way anova was used to compare the differences between the control and treatment groups the level of significance was set at the 95 confidence level all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics ver 25 0 ibm usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 ingestion and remaining amounts of pe microplastics during the uptake period zebrafish can ingest microplastics through both the waterborne and foodborne routes whose exposure concentrations were environmentally relevant fig 1 a during the whole process the blank control tissues were also measured and no fluorescent particles were found in the blank controls the results showed that the git was the main tissue in which microplastics remained after waterborne exposure as the microplastic concentration in the git was significantly higher than that in the gills p 0 05 fig 1 the microplastic concentration in the git peaked on day 7 at which point it was 0 3 0 1 and 5 2 1 2 μg mg 10 fold and 1 9 fold higher than the concentration in the gills in the 1 and 10 mg l waterborne exposure groups respectively microplastic concentration peaked on day 5 in the 0 1 mg l waterborne group fig 1b probably due to the low and unstable burden of microplastics on the body which lead to relatively large data differences xu et al 2021a in the depuration stage microplastics were quickly excreted from the fish git and gills and the equilibrium concentration was generally reached after 12 h of depuration the remaining microplastic concentrations in zebrafish in the 1 mg l and 10 mg l groups after 48 h of depuration were 0 06 0 02 git 0 04 0 01 gill 0 01 0 01 μg mg and 0 3 0 1 git 0 2 0 1 gill 0 7 0 2 μg mg respectively accounting for 17 1 3 6 and 3 4 0 6 of the total uptake amount respectively figs 1c d in the 0 1 mg l group no microplastics were detected during the first 12 h and a very small amount of microplastics 0 02 0 01 μg mg was detected in the git at the end of depuration fig 1b which was mainly attributed to the low uptake amounts and fast depuration rate in the fish the microplastic body concentrations were obtained based on three replicates at each sampling time point and the differences in organism individuals ingestion amounts resulted in the data fluctuation zebrafish fed microplastic contaminated daphnids showed a similar trend in microplastic uptake as those in the waterborne exposure groups however the amount of microplastics that remained following foodborne exposure was significantly lower than that in the 1 mg l waterborne exposure group p 0 05 after 7 days of foodborne exposure the microplastic concentration was 0 03 0 01 μg mg in the git and 0 02 0 01 μg mg in the gill fig 1e which were only 8 6 2 7 and 12 8 12 8 respectively of the levels in the 1 mg l waterborne exposure group fig 1c the concentrations of microplastics remaining in the git and gill after foodborne exposure were 0 001 0 001 and 0 008 0 007 μg mg respectively accounting for 15 7 9 1 and 42 3 11 4 respectively of the total uptake amount after 48 h of depuration fig 1e therefore we deduced that microplastics can remain in zebrafish due to direct uptake from water or the ingestion of microplastic contaminated zooplankton at lower trophic levels such as d magna at the same aqueous concentration 1 mg l however the ingested and remaining amounts of microplastics resulting from foodborne exposure was significantly lower than that resulting from waterborne exposure p 0 05 figure s6 it is noteworthy that the absolute microplastic concentration in 1 mg l foodborne group is 1000 folds lower than the 1 mg l waterborne group therefore this study did not carry out similar exposure concentrations of microplastics in the tank for the two treatments but just to compare the effects of water and foodborne exposure routes that occurred simultaneously the uptake and depuration processes for microplastics observed in this study differ from those of traditional organic pollutants the interaction between organisms and microplastics insoluble and poorly dispersed particulates is dynamic and it is difficult to reach a steady state gouin 2020 therefore the ingestion of microplastics by aquatic organisms is often followed by rapid depuration dawson et al 2018 which is consistent with the findings of our study fig 1 table s2 moreover previous studies have shown that the consumption of microplastics is greater when fish are exposed to higher concentrations hoang and felix kim 2020 jeong et al 2017 malinich et al 2018 which explains why the highest uptake rate was observed in the 10 mg l group the uptake rates of microplastics following exposure through the waterborne route were high kd 8 12 and 38 73 l g d and the remaining concentration in the body decreased rapidly after depuration resulting in low mrts 1 55 and 0 63 d in the 1 and 10 mg l groups respectively table s2 interestingly although significantly fewer microplastics remained following foodborne exposure kd 0 05 g g day than waterborne exposure the longer residence time 1 81 d of the particles ingested through foodborne exposure enhanced the effects of the microplastics fred ahmadu et al 2019 3 2 transcriptomic responses of microplastics predict neurotoxicity significant degs obtained from rna seq in each exposure group with 1136 1787 1194 and 813 genes significantly differentially expressed in the 0 1 mg l 1 mg l and 10 mg l waterborne and 1 mg l foodborne exposure when compared to controls respectively figure s7 according to ipa of affected pathways using rna seq data the neurotoxicity related creb camp response element binding protein signalling in neurons pathway was the most strongly affected pathway fig 2 a furthermore other pathways such as cardiac hypertrophy signalling synaptogenesis signalling oestrogen receptor signalling and role of nfat in cardiac hypertrophy were also significantly affected this indicates that exposure to microplastics had a systematic effect on zebrafish particularly neurotoxicity this was corroborated in a previous study limonta et al 2019 where they reported that adult zebrafish were exposed to two concentrations 0 1 and 1 mg l similar to our study of pe for twenty days and they found the transcriptomic expression in the immune system related to epithelium integrity and lipid metabolism of zebrafish were all changed ipa also suggested that the key factor for upstream regulation was ccaat enhancer binding protein β cebpb fig 2b which is a transcription factor related with neurotransmission immune response and life processes millward et al 2007 thus microplastic exposure was suggested to activate cebpb and then interfere with downstream genes and induced progressive neurological disorder and creb signalling in neurons interference fig 2c of note the effects and mechanisms of waterborne and foodborne exposure were completely different fig 2a c which were first indicated by our results a cluster analysis of the degs expression profiles showed that most degs were altered in inconsistent directions between the waterborne and foodborne treatment furthermore the 8 significantly degs col1a1a myca gpr63 bir5a bc12a appa caspa and adra1aa were also differently expressed between the waterborne and foodborne exposure as both rna seq and qrt pcr results showed fig 2d in particular although the concentration of microplastics in fish through the foodborne exposure was significantly lower than that through the waterborne approx 10 the effects of foodborne exposure should not be ignored because of its obvious neurotoxicity 3 3 effects of microplastics on neurotransmitter impacts as prediction of rna seq analysis in neurotoxicity we verified the levels of the monoamines 5 ht na and da in the brains of zebrafish fig 3 we found that foodborne exposure significantly increased the levels of 5 ht and da compared with the control p 0 05 similarly significantly increased da and na levels were only observed in the 0 1 mg l waterborne group compared with the control p 0 01 fig 3a we also found waterborne microplastic exposure led to ache che and chat activity increment in the brains of zebrafish compared with the control which increased gradually with increasing microplastic concentration p 0 05 fig 3e g h considering that the degs would be altered in different directions our result showed that exposure to pe microplastics through the foodborne route may have induced significant changes in da and 5 ht concentrations in zebrafish whereas the cholinergic system was the main system affected by waterborne exposure besides this is likely that the processes of microplastic attachment ingestion and depuration in daphnia sufficiently altered the microplastic surfaces i e corona formation on microplastics geitner et al 2016 which can also affect the toxicity effects of microplastics to zebrafish the neurotoxic effects of xenobiotics on the cholinergic system and its mechanism have been previously elucidated morley 2005 wessler et al 2019 after ach being synthesized by chat and released into synaptic cleft it is rapidly degraded by ache and butyrylcholinesterase into acetic acid and water dal forno et al 2013 afterwards activation of the cholinergic signalling pathway contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability leading to behavioural responses wu et al 2016 the dysregulation of ach chat and ache have been widely applied as indicators of neurotoxicity in zebrafish agostini et al 2017 to our surprise there were no significant changes in ache activity some studies used as a representative neurotoxic biomarker guerrera et al 2021 either through foodborne or waterborne routes implying solely ache measurement may not be sufficient to identify microplastic neurotoxicity in the cholinergic system this might also be because the inhibition of ache was often observed after nanoplastic exposure but not occurred after micron sized plastics exposure chu et al 2019 ding et al 2018 karami et al 2017b although both particles can cause locomotory behaviour alteration moreover extensive evidence indicated that dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of developmental behavioural and physiologic processes including anxiety and affective states in zebrafish padilla and macphail 2011 we previously found da increased during the co exposure of nanoplastics and bisphenol a chen et al 2017b few other studies have focused on these non cholinergic neurotransmitters prüst et al 2020 but 5 ht and da also increased significantly here especially for the foodborne exposure thus our results implied that we should evaluate the neurotoxicity caused by microplastics with multiple biomarkers and more systematically 3 4 neurotransmitter disorder induces locomotion behaviour alterations after microplastics exposure the distance travelled by female zebrafish exposed to either waterborne or foodborne microplastics was significantly longer than that of control p 0 01 fig 4 a the heatmap of swimming tracks figure s11 also indicated that zebrafish became hyperactive after microplastic exposure which is consistent with our previous findings that the locomotion of zebrafish was significantly increased after exposure to 5 μm microplastics chen et al 2020 moreover the most severe hyperactivity occurred at the highest concentration of 10 mg l p 0 01 fig 4a moreover it is noteworthy that although the ingestion of microplastics in zebrafish through foodborne exposure was very low hyperactivity in these fish was similar to that in the fish exposed to waterborne exposure the manic and active states of zebrafish in the waterborne groups were largely prolonged especially with the increase of exposure concentration fig 4b p 0 01 similarly there were statistically longer durations for fish staying in manic and active states of fish in the foodborne group than the control p 0 01 locomotion behaviour alterations may be caused by oxidative damage energy and lipid metabolisms and neurotoxicity chen et al 2017a 2020 2017b ding et al 2018 but we did not find significant oxidative stress in zebrafish by assaying five biomarkers sod cat gsh gsh px and ros in liver samples figure s9 microplastics exposure could affect the enzyme activity of the antioxidant system in zebrafish but no serious oxidative damage was found according to the integrated ibr result figure s10 additionally we also did not find a correlation between atp content and the swimming behaviour alterations fig 2c thus the swimming behavioural changes were very likely to be causal linked with neurotoxicity behaviours are highly affected by neural function regulation and neurotransmission which processes are involved by many molecular components such as neurotransmitters da belongs to dopaminergic neuronal system and the overstimulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission leads to hyperactivity of organisms padilla and macphail 2011 staller and faraone 2007 additionally 5 ht is a typical serotoninergic system component whose levels were often stable during fish development and thus its alteration could be an important indicator for neurotoxicity padilla and macphail 2011 tufi et al 2016 in our study levels of da and 5 ht in the brain increased significantly in the foodborne treatment which was in accordance with the behaviour alteration of zebrafish after foodborne exposure the activation of ach pathways was only found in the waterborne exposure groups suggesting the neurotoxicity in cholinergic system will be aggravated after waterborne microplastic treatment therefore the mechanisms for behavioural performance were different between the two exposure scenarios which coincided with the differentially expressed genes although our results cannot provide a definitive proof that the changes in monoaminergic synaptic function were causally linked to the behavioural alterations however earlier work in the zebrafish model showed that acute challenge with nicotine which similarly evoked an increase in synaptic monoamine release has the same effect on behaviour alterations as that seen here eddins et al 2009 consequently in our study the probable reason for the change in locomotor behaviour in waterborne exposure was the interference of the cholinergic system similar result was found in 14 dpf zebrafish larvae exposed to microspheres and cu whose dysfunctional swimming activity observed was indicative of alterations in the neurological function in part seemed to be associated with the significant inhibition of the enzyme ache moreover microspheres alone and co exposed with cu exerted a higher effect on ache than cu alone santos et al 2021 it should be noted that we analysed the alterations of genes and neurotransmitters in female zebrafish which is because the swimming behaviour results indicated that female zebrafish swimming behaviour became more significantly hyperactive than the male ones figure s12 a probable reason for the differences was that the gonadal hormones and trait anxiety may influence the sensitivity to the anti anxiety effect of microplastics in female organisms sarasamma et al 2020 and these differences may be due in part to their distinct distribution of gaba containing interneurons ravenelle et al 2014 therefore the neurotoxicity of microplastics obtained has not been verified in male zebrafish and further research is necessary 3 5 environmental implications microplastics also may accumulate along food chains and cause detrimental effects on aquatic organisms especially those at higher trophic levels however most previous studies of microplastic ingestion or toxicity only focused on the effects of waterborne exposure at the individual level and only a few studies focused on trophic transfer of microplastics between aquatic organisms elizalde velázquez et al 2020 hasegawa and nakaoka 2021 nelms et al 2018 a recent study showed that biomagnification of microplastics is unlikely to occur because they can be rapidly excreted from organisms and do not accumulate in the body walkinshaw et al 2020 similar results were found in our study but the abnormal swimming behaviour and neurotoxic effects induced even at low microplastic concentrations deserve further attention such knowledge of the differences in microplastic ingestion and toxic effects in zebrafish exposed to microplastic through waterborne and foodborne routes would undoubtedly contribute to the best understanding of the impacts caused by these pollutants on aquatic ecosystems our study confirmed that direct environmental uptake 40 47 μm pe microplastics and food chain transfer d magna and d rerio as a model prey predator system can cause neurotoxicity and behavioural abnormalities however our study is only an exposure experiment with non weathered particles which will have different physico chemical properties and conducted in a lab environment with a model fish this phenomenon is species or plastic type specific and deserves further investigation for instance exposure to polyvinyl chloride microplastics can cause oxidative damage in gold fish carassius auratus romano et al 2020 but does not affect the physiological performance of mussels perna perna santana et al 2018 other factors such as the shape size and composition of the microplastics the environment e g the extent of local urbanization the exposure period the physiological characteristics of the exposed organisms and food chain complexity may also be closely related to bioaccumulation capacity and toxic effects conclusions our study showed that zebrafish exposed to the highest concentration 10 mg l ingested more microplastics than other treatments although rapid excretion of microplastics was observed exposure to microplastics negatively affected the physiological functions of zebrafish microplastic exposure through either the waterborne or foodborne route caused severe hyperactivity in zebrafish although the abnormal motor behaviours induced by waterborne and foodborne microplastics looked similar the neurotoxicity mechanisms were completely different exposure to pe microplastics through the foodborne route may have induced significant changes in da and 5 ht concentrations in zebrafish whereas the cholinergic system was the main system affected by waterborne exposure additionally the water and foodborne exposure often occur simultaneously and therefore the joint neurotoxic effects of these two exposure routes should be

issues we provided an efficient strategy by using ferric chloride fc to aid nitrite pretreatment experimental results showed that the maximal scfas production of 211 3 3 1 mg cod g vs was achieved with 4 mmol l of fc integrated with 250 mg l of nitrite pretreatment on day 5 which was 4 1 fold higher than that of the blank control 52 5 mg cod g vs day 7 besides the enrichment of acetic acid was observed in the combined system which accounted for 54 6 3 5 of total scfas while the proportion was only 31 5 4 9 in the blank control propionic acid isobutyric acid n butyric acid n valeric acid and isovaleric acid accounted for 14 7 1 5 6 9 1 4 7 4 1 5 13 1 1 0 and 3 3 1 5 of total scfas in the combined system and 22 8 4 0 11 9 3 0 6 7 3 1 17 6 2 0 and 9 5 3 9 of total scfas in the blank control respectively it was found that soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the combined system were higher than those in the blank control suggesting that fc and nitrite pretreatment was beneficial for was disintegration the fluorescence spectrum results suggested that fc and nitrite pretreatment improved the biodegradability of released organics which provided more biodegradable substances for the subsequent scfas production this was because the addition of fc induced the formation of free nitrous acid from nitrite besides fc induced iron reduction also promoted the conversion of recalcitrant organics to biodegradable organic matter microbial community structure analysis demonstrated that the functional bacteria involved in acetogenesis process such as enterococcus proteiniclasticum and petrimonas were highly enriched due to the pretreatment of fc and nitrite indicating this method could improve the relative abundance of scfas producers overall this study revealed that the pretreatment of fc and nitrite promoted the formation of free nitrous acid and increased the yield of scfas which provided a novel method for wastewater treatment plants to ameliorate the sewage treatment craft and rationally use the existing substances in was to enhance resource recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords short chain fatty acids anaerobic fermentation ferric chloride free nitrous acid 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a by product of sewage treatment and its production has rapidly increased in china the production of was 80 moisture content was estimated to exceeded 11 million tons per year li et al 2020a if was is not effectively treated the residual pollutants in it can easily return to the environment thereby threatening environmental safety and human health su et al 2019 luo et al 2021a besides was contains a large number of organic matters e g proteins and carbohydrates accounting for more than 50 of sludge microbial cells which was also considered as a renewable bioenergy source xu et al 2019 liu et al 2021a in recent years many studies reported the production of valuable products such as short chain fatty acids scfas methane ch4 and hydrogen h2 via was fermentation liu et al 2020b niu et al 2019 besides scfas were primordial substrates for the production of biodegradable plastic and the preferred carbon source for microbial fuel cells and biological nutrient removal bnr zhao et al 2015 however the production of scfas via anaerobic fermentation af of was was rather limited mainly attributing to the complex structure of sludge floc low solubilization of organic matters and marked consumption of hydrolyzed or acidified biodegradable substrates by methanogens he et al 2016 nie et al 2021 in order to overcome these weaknesses various control strategies or pretreatment methods have been developed and applied such as chemical biological mechanical and thermal methods among which free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 pretreatment has been demonstrated as an effective technique ahn et al 2009 feng et al 2009 previous studies revealed that fna at a level of one part per million ppm mg n l had a strong biocidal effect on anaerobic and aerobic bacteria wang et al 2014b zhang et al 2019 wang and his colleagues demonstrated that the hydrolysis rate of was significantly increased after being pretreated with 2 13 mg l fna for 24 h wang et al 2014a fan et al 2020 additionally fna pretreatment with continuous af achieved extra benefits including the rise of dehydration and digestion capacity meng et al 2020 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 this good attempt provided a novel way for applying the intermediate product i e nitrite of the af liquid to improve the efficiency of acid production in was fermentation however two chemicals no 2 and h were normally required to produce fna and the hydrochloric acid hcl concentration of 1 2 mol kg vs needed to be added in order to acidify was to the ph 5 calderon et al 2021 ferric chloride fc is a flocculant and commonly used in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps niu et al 2013 the addition of fc to the primary sedimentation tank in wwtps could enhance the removal of particulate organic matter and phosphorus and its addition to the sewage pipe controlled h2s formation ge et al 2013 li et al 2021 li et al 2020b in af process fc could provide iron element for essential ferric enzymes and acted as electron acceptor to gather fe iii reducing bacteria and degraded various complex organics in was through microbial iron reduction liu et al 2021b zhao et al 2020 besides fe iii could be reduced to fe ii and then combined phosphate to form ferrous phosphate i e fe3 po4 2 8h2o which was a valuable product recognized for phosphorous recovery prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 noteworthily the hydrogen ions h produced from fe iii hydrolysis might contribute to the formation of fna stefánsson 2007 hence the main purpose of this study was to explore the impacts of different doses of fc and nitrite combination on the production of scfas in af of sludge we hypothesized that the addition of fc and nitrite to sludge as pretreatment step and followed by af treatment could promote the generation of fna and increase the yield of scfas firstly the effects of fc and nitrite on yields of scfas were evaluated secondly via further evaluating the effects of fc on was solubilization scfas production and microbial community structure as well as the potential mechanism of acetic acid accumulation in was were explored this study provided key information to strengthen our understanding of scfas produced by was fermentation and served as a potential energy recovery strategy for carbon neutral operation of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 the source and characteristics of was the sludge for this study was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtps in changsha china with the application of a2 o operation process the raw was was firstly filtered with 4 0 mm sifter mesh and then deposited in a 4 refrigerator for 24 h and after that the supernatant was removed to get the condensed was luo et al 2021b the main characteristics of the condensed was were shown in table 1 sodium nitrite and ferric chloride used in this work were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china with a purity 99 2 2 setup and operation of anaerobic reactors in this experiment five anaerobic fermentation reactors reactor 1 5 working volume 1 l were setup in each batch and a total of 15 fermentation reactors were prepared for three batches the other two batches were parallel samples 300 ml of was was added to each fermentation reactor with the addition of different volumes 2 43 4 87 and 7 30 ml of fc stock solution 40 mg ml initial fc concentration as 2 4 and 6 mmol l mm was achieved in reactor 3 5 respectively reactor 1 was set as the blank control and then 3 ml nano2 stock solution 25 g l of no 2 n shorten as n and used below was added to reactor 2 5 labelled as n n 2 mm fc n 4 mm fc and n 6 mm fc to achieve the final concentration of no 2 n as 250 mg l and the initial fna concentration in reactor 2 5 were 0 09 0 22 1 51 and 3 78 mg l respectively the calculation formula of fna were shown in supporting information total fifteen reactors were placed in a shaker 35 0 0 5 160 rpm for pretreatment 24 h based on the optimization of the pretreatment time during the experiment wang et al 2014a the ph in these reactors was not adjusted after pretreatment all reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 2 min sealed with rubber plugs and wrapped with a parafilm to ensure anaerobic condition and then ran under the same shaking condition the fermentation time was 8 days during which scfas ph oxidation reduction potential orp scod soluble protein soluble carbohydrate and 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem were measured periodically samples on day 5 were selected to measure microbial community diversity since the production of scfas in the experimental group reached its maximum at this timepoint all treatments were carried out in triplicates and was was used as the substrate for fermentation 2 3 degradation assays of propionic acid and butyric acid in order to determine the effect of fc on the degradation rates of propionic acid and butyric acid in af process of was twelve anaerobic reactors working volume 1 l were used in this test these reactors were divided into two groups the blank control and experimental group with six in each batch firstly 30 ml of was 270 ml synthetic wastewater three of which contained 1 g l propionate and the other three contained 1 g l butyrate and 3 ml nano2 stock solution 25 g l of no 2 n were added to each group reactors yang et al 2019 fc stock solution 40 mg ml was supplied to experimental reactors to obtain an initial fc concentration of 4 mm after that twelve reactors were placed in a shaker 35 0 0 5 160 rpm for pretreatment 24 h then all of them were purged with nitrogen gas for 2 min to ensure anaerobic condition before being sealed with rubber plugs and wrapped with a parafilm and then placed under the same shaking condition for three days finally the levels of propionate and butyrate in reactors were measured daily 2 4 analytical methods tcod scod ts and vs were determined as previously reported eaton et al 1966 a digital ph meter phs 3c leici co ltd shanghai china was applied to measure orp and ph value supporting information based on the modified lowry

spectroscopy was used to determine the degradability of soluble organics in supernatant liu et al 2021b in 3d fluorescence detection the excitation ex wavelength was increased from 200 nm to 500 nm by 5 nm s and the corresponding scanning emission em spectrum was increased from 200 nm to 500 nm the excitation and emission slits were held at 5 nm and the scanning speed for all measurements was set at 10 000 nm min illumina miseq sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community diversity of four reactors liu et al 2020a su et al 2021 the was samples were first collected and then

significant difference test was applied for statistical analysis and p 0 05 was indicated as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 short chain fatty acids production from fermentation of ferric chloride and nitrite pretreated sludge in this study five anaerobic reactors were set up as the blank control n n 2 mm fc n 4 mm fc and n 6 mm fc with the different supplement of fc and n fc n the yield of scfas from the anaerobic reactors was studied in the presence of different fc contents and fc n caused a significantly effect on the production of scfas p 0 05 fig 1 a by comparing the blank control and the n reactor it was found that the production of scfas in the n reactor increased greatly in the initial phase and then decreased tardily similar decline separate n pretreatment was also reported in previous studies possibly due to the consumption of scfas by methanogens liu et al 2020a for other reactors with different concentration of fc the production of scfas also showed a similar tendency while the variation degree was disparate for instance the maximal yield of scfas in the blank control and the n reactor was 52 4 5 1 and 155 6 4 4 mg cod g vs respectively when the sludge containing 4 mm of fc and 250 mg l of n was fermented for five days the maximum yield of scfas was 211 3 3 1 mg cod g vs which was 4 03 and 1 36 fold higher than that of the blank control and the n reactor respectively however when the concentration of fc increased to 6 mm the maximum yield of scfas declined to 191 1 4 5 mg cod g vs mainly due to the fact that the excessive fc hydrolyzed into polymerization chains causing the aggregation of sludge floc and affecting the process of af lin et al 2017 except the blank control other reactors also required five days to reach the maximum yield of scfas these results clearly showed that fc concentration in was significantly affected scfas production when the ph of was was not under control total scfas include six independent acids i e acetic propionic n butyric isobutyric n valeric and isovaleric acids and the impact of fc n on the composition of scfas was further investigated within five days of fermentation fig 1b with the increase of fc dose the percentage of acetic acid in total scfas rose slowly while that of propionic isobutyric n butyric isovaleric and n valeric acids declined specifically when the concentration of n rose up to 250 mg l and fc increased from 0 to 6 mm the per centum of acetic acid in total scfas profile increased from 31 5 4 9 to 61 1 5 0 and that of propionic acid declined from 22 8 4 1 to 11 4 3 0 previous studies also reported that fc could cause acetic accumulation by accelerating acetic acid producing bacteria and inhibiting acetic acid utilizers van bodegom et al 2004 these results indicated that the dose of fc had a certain impact on the yield and composition of scfas in the process of af however higher fc level not always led to the further accumulation of scfas for example in those reactors with n addition a lower level of fc e g 2 and 4 mm enhanced the scfas production while the maximum yield of scfas declined when the fc level reached 6 mm in order to explore the mechanism of the acetic acid accumulation in was after fc n amendment a series of fermentation tests were conducted with propionate or butyrate as substrate in the blank control group the degradation rates of propionate and butyrate within three days were 0 080 0 004 g l d and 0 160 0 004 g l d respectively while that of experimental group were 0 102 0 003 g l d and 0 177 0 003 g ld indicating the presence of 4 mm fc promoted the degradation of propionic acid and butyric acid into acetic acid during af of was fig 2 b several literatures had confirmed that iron could accelerate the process of homoacetogenesis which was beneficial to create a favourable condition for propionate decomposition and to promote the conversion of propionic acid to acetic acid under anaerobic conditions fig 2a meng et al 2013 meanwhile the decrease of propionic acid and butyric acid might also attribute to the influence of acid producing microorganisms e g petrimonas grabowski et al 2005 3 2 impact of ferric chloride and nitrite pretreatment on solubilization of sludge was solubilization is the first step of af and has been considered as the chief rate limiting processes he et al 2021 in this work the effect of fc n on was solubilization was discussed by comparing the contents of soluble carbohydrates soluble proteins and soluble cod the shift of soluble cod during the first six days of fermentation was observed in different reactors fig 3 a soluble cod in the blank control was 852 0 120 4 mg l on day 5 and in other reactors it was in the range of 2320 0 139 9 to 3456 0 95 5 mg l these results suggested that the pretreatment of fc n had a significant effect on was solubilization besides with the calculation of available data a partial cod mass balance analysis was conducted as shown in table s1 the percentage of scfas carbohydrates and proteins of the n 4 mm fc reactor on the third and fifth days of fermentation were higher than those of the n reactor indicating that fc n pretreatment resulted in an increase in soluble cod and soluble carbohydrates compared with sole n treatment in order to further supported this finding the carbohydrate and protein content of was were measured in reactors after two days of af fig 3b the contents of protein and carbohydrate in the blank control were 249 0 8 3 mg l and 45 0 7 9 mg l respectively when different amount of initial fc was supplied their concentration significantly increased as 411 8 11 5 and 88 0 7 8 mg l after 4 mm fc amendment and 487 2 8 2 and 141 4 10 4 mg l after 6 mm fc amendment respectively all of these results indicated that the pretreatment of fc n had a positive synergistic effect on was solubilization leading to abundant soluble substrates released from was pretreatment and fermentation which contributed to the follow up scfas production 3 3 impact of ferric chloride and nitrite pretreatment on the biodegradability and organics release of sludge was microbial cells were composed of various organic compounds and some of which were found recalcitrant to biodegradation therefore in this work we further investigated whether fc n could cause changes in the biodegradability of organic compounds that released by was wang et al 2009 the 3d eem spectrum was roughly split into five regions based on excitation and emission wavelengths and the relevant abundance of different organic compounds was represented with a percentage of fluorescence response in table s2 he et al 2021 as shown in fig 4 the eem spectra of the released organic matters in different reactors during one day fermentation the fluorescence intensity of eem peak e g ex em 273 330 nm of was supernatant pretreated with n and 4 mm fc was higher than that of the blank control indicating that soluble organic matter increased distinctly besides the structure of organic matter released by was also had an important influence on utilization of scfas by acid producing microorganisms wu et al 2010 the fluorescence response percentages of region i and region iv were 21 36 and 25 25 in the blank control and 19 20 and 44 21 in the n 4 mm fc reactor respectively fig 4 besides the sum of pⅰ n and pⅳ n in the n 4 mm fc reactor was 63 41 which was 1 36 fold higher than that of the blank control these results confirmed that the n 4 mm fc reactor further raised the proportion of biodegradable organic matter in fermentation liquid region iv supplying more biodegradable organics for subsequent scfas production compared with the blank control moreover the pⅲ n and pⅴ n decreased from 16 63 to 7 84 and 23 23 to 12 28 in the n 4 mm fc reactor respectively which showed that fc n pretreatment reduced the content of non biodegradable substances like fulvic acid and humic acid substances in total organics while the reduction or transformation pathway was not been fully revealed and further exploration is required 3 4 impact of ferric chloride and nitrite pretreatment on microflora structure the abundance and community structure of microorganisms were related to the performance of af process in order to explore the effect of fc n on microflora in af process high throughput gene sequencing technology was used to analyze microflora in two reactors the blank control and the n 4 mm fc as shown in fig s1 venn diagram analysis revealed that the amount of otus in the n 4 mm fc reactor was lower than that of the blank control 781 versus 913 and the shared otus in two reactors was 661 as shown in fig 5 bacteria belonging to the phylum of firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteriota chloroflexi bacteroidota and patescibacteria were the dominant microbial populations both in the blank control and the n 4 mm fc reactor accounting for 93 32 to 96 58 of the total microflora however their relative abundance was different in these two reactors fig s2 compared with the blank control the relative abundance of firmicutes in the n 4 mm fc reactor was higher 44 06 versus 5 71 while that of proteobacteria actinobacteriota chloroflexi bacteroidota and patescibacteria were significantly lower 17 08 versus 25 74 15 38 versus 20 83 3 87 versus 22 91 12 00 versus 12 87 and 4 19 versus 5 26 respectively previous studies reported that firmicutes microorganisms such as lactococcus and enterococcus were able to generate scfas by utilizing easily biodegradable organic matters such as carbohydrates and proteins moreover proteobacteria and bacteroidota microorganisms were capable to degrade refractory organic matters liu et al 2021b these facts further verified that the addition of fc n shifted the microbial community in was and promoted the formation of acid producing bacteria the composition of bacterial community at the genus level were shown in fig 6 and table 2 compared with the blank control the relative abundance of bacteria such as enterococcus and proteiniclasticum in the n 4 mm fc reactor significantly promoted while that of caldilineaceae and other bacteria declined slightly both reactors contained caldilineaceae and rhodobacter that belonging to hydrolytic microbes the sum of their relative abundance was 3 96 and 1 07 in the blank control and the n 4 mm fc reactor table 2 respectively which suggested the addition of fc n led to relatively small impact on hydrolytic bacteria in the community several microorganisms associated with the production of scfas were detected in the n 4 mm fc reactor and their total relative abundance was 40 97 which was 84 fold higher than that of the blank control as only 0 49 table 2 besides the proportions of enterococcus clostridium petrimonas and proteiniclasticum were 10 32 14 16 5 16 and 5 66 respectively which in the blank control was only 0 05 0 19 and 0 20 respectively the remaining genera e g petrimonas were not detected previous studies reported that enterococcus species were facultative anaerobes with optimal growth temperature as around 35 which were able to use glucose for fermentation with l lactic acid as final product schleifer and kilpper balz 1984 in this study the control temperature was set up as 35 0 0 5 which was conducive to the growth of enterococcus the proteiniclasticum belonging to anaerobic gram negative bacteria were capable to produce acetic acid propionic acid and isobutyric acid from amino acids as carbon and nitrogen sources zhang et al 2010 besides the petrimonas was known as gram negative and strictly anaerobic bacteria which could utilize carbohydrates and some other organic acids e g 2 oh and 3 oh fatty acids for fermentation grabowski et al 2005 also the relative abundance of other microbes related to the production of scfas i e macellibacteroides in the n 4 mm fc reactor was all higher than that in the blank control the above data analysis proved that the addition of fc n promoted the predominance of acid producing bacteria 3 5 overall understanding and implication af technology has attracted distinct attention in recent years while its large scale application in wwtps is often restricted by low yields of scfas in this study we verified that the pretreatment of was with fc n increased the yield of scfas that produced by af and this joint method expedited the dissolution of sludge and improved the conversion of refractory organic matters compared with previous studies this work found that with pretreatment by 250 mg l of n and 4 mm of fc the maximum scfas production of 211 3 3 1 mg cod g vs was obtained at day 5 which was 1 36 fold higher than that of sole n pretreatment indicating that fc n amendment greatly enhanced the yield of scfas besides adding fc to the primary settling tank of wwtps raised the removal effect of particulate organic matter and phosphorus conventionally in urban water management fc is often applied to promote coagulation flocculation therefore fc is expected to be used as a substitute of hcl in order to promote the formation of fna this study aimed to test the feasibility of fc n pretreatment of was for the improvement of scfas production thus no further technical optimizations were made here still comprehensive optimization studies e g mathematical modeling are expected to achieve higher yield of scfas in the end a fermentation treatment strategy based on fc n pretreatment was proposed from an environmental and economic perspective fig s4 was generated in both primary and secondary settling tanks was first pretreated with fc n for one day under aerobic conditions and then was was fermented to produce scfas note that nitrogen and phosphorus were also released into the fermentation broth during fermentation which could increase the nitrogen and phosphorus load in wastewater treatment therefore fermentation liquid containing scfas was first transferred to the recovery and separation system of nitrogen and phosphorus and then to the biochemical reaction tank for improving bnr previous studies also showed that struvite precipitation could be formed after af of sludge which effectively recovered the release of nitrogen and phosphorus tong and chen 2007 reduced the nitrogen and phosphorus load and partially compensated the operation cost of wwtps through these measurements higher resource utilization and lower amount of vs could be effectively achieved which might benefit to the sustainable operation of wwtps 4 conclusion in this study we proposed a new strategy to increase the production of scfas and meanwhile to shorten fermentation time by pretreating was with fc n the fc n combining system improved total yield of scfas as well as the percentage of acetic acid and shortened the total fermentation time with 250 mg l of n and 4 mm of fc pretreatment for one day and af for five days was produced an optimal yield of scfas as 211 3 3 1 mg cod g vs moreover the synergistic effect of fc n on sludge solubilization hydrolysis and acidification was significant mainly attributing to the fact that they promoted the formation of fna which destroyed was microbial cells and decreased the concentration of refractory substances combining with the effect of fe ⅲ reducing bacteria microbial community structure analysis revealed that the fc n pretreatment promoted the predominance of acid producing microorganisms rather than that of hydrolytic bacteria overall these results extended the practical scope of fc and provided a novel insight into the application of fc n in af process of was declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they had no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

issues we provided an efficient strategy by using ferric chloride fc to aid nitrite pretreatment experimental results showed that the maximal scfas production of 211 3 3 1 mg cod g vs was achieved with 4 mmol l of fc integrated with 250 mg l of nitrite pretreatment on day 5 which was 4 1 fold higher than that of the blank control 52 5 mg cod g vs day 7 besides the enrichment of acetic acid was observed in the combined system which accounted for 54 6 3 5 of total scfas while the proportion was only 31 5 4 9 in the blank control propionic acid isobutyric acid n butyric acid n valeric acid and isovaleric acid accounted for 14 7 1 5 6 9 1 4 7 4 1 5 13 1 1 0 and 3 3 1 5 of total scfas in the combined system and 22 8 4 0 11 9 3 0 6 7 3 1 17 6 2 0 and 9 5 3 9 of total scfas in the blank control respectively it was found that soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the combined system were higher than those in the blank control suggesting that fc and nitrite pretreatment was beneficial for was disintegration the fluorescence spectrum results suggested that fc and nitrite pretreatment improved the biodegradability of released organics which provided more biodegradable substances for the subsequent scfas production this was because the addition of fc induced the formation of free nitrous acid from nitrite besides fc induced iron reduction also promoted the conversion of recalcitrant organics to biodegradable organic matter microbial community structure analysis demonstrated that the functional bacteria involved in acetogenesis process such as enterococcus proteiniclasticum and petrimonas were highly enriched due to the pretreatment of fc and nitrite indicating this method could improve the relative abundance of scfas producers overall this study revealed that the pretreatment of fc and nitrite promoted the formation of free nitrous acid and increased the yield of scfas which provided a novel method for wastewater treatment plants to ameliorate the sewage

recognized for phosphorous recovery prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 noteworthily the hydrogen ions h produced from fe iii hydrolysis might contribute to the formation of fna stefánsson 2007 hence the main purpose of this study was to explore the impacts of different doses of fc and nitrite combination on the production of scfas in af of sludge we hypothesized that the addition of fc and nitrite to sludge as pretreatment step and followed by af treatment could promote the generation of fna and increase the yield of scfas firstly the effects of fc and nitrite on yields of scfas were evaluated secondly via further evaluating the effects of fc on was solubilization scfas production and microbial community structure as well as the potential mechanism of acetic acid accumulation in was were explored this study provided key information to strengthen our understanding of scfas produced by was fermentation and served as a potential energy recovery strategy for carbon neutral operation of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 the source and characteristics of was the sludge for this study was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtps in changsha china with the application of a2 o operation process the raw was was firstly filtered with 4 0 mm sifter mesh and then deposited in a 4 refrigerator for 24 h and after that the supernatant was removed to get the condensed was luo et al 2021b the main characteristics of the condensed was were shown in table 1 sodium nitrite and ferric chloride used in this work were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china with a purity 99 2 2 setup and operation of anaerobic reactors in this experiment five anaerobic fermentation reactors reactor 1 5 working volume 1 l were setup in each batch and a total of 15 fermentation reactors were prepared for three batches the other two batches were parallel samples 300 ml of was was added to each fermentation reactor with the addition of different volumes 2 43 4 87 and 7 30 ml of fc stock solution 40 mg ml initial fc concentration as 2 4 and 6 mmol l mm was achieved in reactor 3 5 respectively reactor 1 was set as the blank control and then 3 ml nano2 stock solution 25 g l of no 2 n shorten as n and used below was added to reactor 2 5 labelled as n n 2 mm fc n 4 mm fc and n 6 mm fc to achieve the final concentration of no 2 n as 250 mg l and the initial fna concentration in reactor 2 5 were 0 09 0 22 1 51 and 3 78 mg l respectively the calculation formula of fna were shown in supporting information total fifteen reactors were placed in a shaker 35 0 0 5 160 rpm for pretreatment 24 h based on the optimization of the pretreatment time during the experiment wang et al 2014a the ph in these reactors was not adjusted after pretreatment all reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 2 min sealed with rubber plugs and wrapped with a parafilm to ensure anaerobic condition and then ran under the same shaking condition the fermentation time was 8 days during which scfas ph oxidation reduction potential orp scod soluble protein soluble carbohydrate and 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem were measured periodically samples on day 5 were selected to measure microbial community diversity since the production of scfas in the experimental group reached its maximum at this timepoint all treatments were carried out in triplicates and was was used as the substrate for fermentation 2 3 degradation assays of propionic acid and butyric acid in order to determine the effect of fc on the degradation rates of propionic acid and butyric acid in af process of was twelve anaerobic reactors working volume 1 l were used in this test these reactors were divided into two groups the blank control and experimental group with six in each batch firstly 30 ml of was 270 ml synthetic wastewater three of which contained 1 g l propionate and the other three contained 1 g l butyrate and 3 ml nano2 stock solution 25 g l of no 2 n were added to each group reactors yang et al 2019 fc stock solution 40 mg ml was supplied to experimental reactors to obtain an initial fc concentration of 4 mm after that twelve reactors were placed in a shaker 35 0 0 5 160 rpm for pretreatment 24 h then all of them were purged with nitrogen gas for 2 min to ensure anaerobic condition before being sealed with rubber plugs and wrapped with a parafilm and then placed under the same shaking condition for three days finally the levels of propionate and butyrate in reactors were measured daily 2 4 analytical methods tcod scod ts and vs were determined as previously reported eaton et al 1966 a digital ph meter phs 3c leici co ltd shanghai china was applied to measure orp and ph value supporting information based on the modified lowry folin and phenol sulfuric method wang et al 2019 soluble protein and carbohydrate were detected an agilent 6890 gc agilent usa with an aflame ionization detector and a dbwaxtre column was applied to detect the contents of six individual scfas i e acetic propionic n butyric isobutyric n valeric and isovaleric in each reactor for details see supporting information the 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the degradability of soluble organics in supernatant liu et al 2021b in 3d fluorescence detection the excitation ex wavelength was increased from 200 nm to 500 nm by 5 nm s and the corresponding scanning emission em spectrum was increased from 200 nm to 500 nm the excitation and emission slits were held at 5 nm and the scanning speed for all measurements was set at 10 000 nm min illumina miseq sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community diversity of four reactors liu et al 2020a su et al 2021 the was samples were first collected and then centrifuged at 4000 centrifugal forces for 15 min then the sediment was collected and sent to shanghai meggie biomedical technology co ltd for sequencing total genomic dna was extracted by fastdna

significant difference test was applied for statistical analysis and p 0 05 was indicated as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 short chain fatty acids production from fermentation of ferric chloride and nitrite pretreated sludge in this study five anaerobic reactors were set up as the blank control n n 2 mm fc n 4 mm fc and n 6 mm fc with the different supplement of fc and n fc n the yield of scfas from the anaerobic reactors was studied in the presence of different fc contents and fc n caused a significantly effect on the production of scfas p 0 05 fig 1 a by comparing the blank control and the n reactor it was found that the production of scfas in the n reactor increased greatly in the initial phase and then decreased tardily similar decline separate n pretreatment was also reported in previous studies possibly due to the consumption of scfas by methanogens liu et al 2020a for other reactors with different concentration of fc the production of scfas also showed a similar tendency while the variation degree was disparate for instance the maximal yield of scfas in the blank control and the n reactor was 52 4 5 1 and 155 6 4 4 mg cod g vs respectively when the sludge containing 4 mm of fc and 250 mg l of n was fermented for five days the maximum yield of scfas was 211 3 3 1 mg cod g vs which was 4 03 and 1 36 fold higher than that of the blank control and the n reactor respectively however when the concentration of fc increased to 6 mm the maximum yield of scfas declined to 191 1 4 5 mg cod g vs mainly due to the fact that the excessive fc hydrolyzed into polymerization chains causing the aggregation of sludge floc and affecting the process of af lin et al 2017 except the blank control other reactors also required five days to reach the maximum yield of scfas these results clearly showed that fc concentration in was significantly affected scfas production when the ph of was was not under control total scfas include six independent acids i e acetic propionic n butyric isobutyric n valeric and isovaleric acids and the impact of fc n on the composition of scfas was further investigated within five days of fermentation fig 1b with the increase of fc dose the percentage of acetic acid in total scfas rose slowly while that of propionic isobutyric n butyric isovaleric and n valeric acids declined specifically when the concentration of n rose up to 250 mg l and fc increased from 0 to 6 mm the per centum of acetic acid in total scfas profile increased from 31 5 4 9 to 61 1 5 0 and that of propionic acid declined from 22 8 4 1 to 11 4 3 0 previous studies also reported that fc could cause acetic accumulation by accelerating acetic acid producing bacteria and inhibiting acetic acid utilizers van bodegom et al 2004 these results indicated that the dose of fc had a certain impact on the yield and composition of scfas in the process of af however higher fc level not always led to the further accumulation of scfas for example in those reactors with n addition a lower level of fc e g 2 and 4 mm enhanced the scfas production while the maximum yield of scfas declined when the fc level reached 6 mm in order to explore the mechanism of the acetic acid accumulation in was after fc n amendment a series of fermentation tests were conducted with propionate or butyrate as substrate in the blank control group the degradation rates of propionate and butyrate within three days were 0 080 0 004 g l d and 0 160 0 004 g l d respectively while that of experimental group were 0 102 0 003 g l d and 0 177 0 003 g ld indicating the presence of 4 mm fc promoted the degradation of propionic acid and butyric acid into acetic acid during af of was fig 2 b several literatures had confirmed that iron could accelerate the process of homoacetogenesis which was beneficial to create a favourable condition for propionate decomposition and to promote the conversion of propionic acid to acetic acid under anaerobic conditions fig 2a meng et al 2013 meanwhile the decrease of propionic acid and butyric acid might also attribute to the influence of acid producing microorganisms e g petrimonas grabowski et al 2005 3 2 impact of ferric chloride and nitrite pretreatment on solubilization of sludge was solubilization is the first step of af and has been considered as the chief rate limiting processes he et al 2021 in this work the effect of fc n on was solubilization was discussed by comparing the contents of soluble carbohydrates soluble proteins and soluble cod the shift of soluble cod during the first six days of fermentation was observed in different reactors fig 3 a soluble cod in the blank control was 852 0 120 4 mg l on day 5 and in other reactors it was in the range of 2320 0 139 9 to 3456 0 95 5 mg l these results suggested that the pretreatment of fc n had a significant effect on was solubilization besides with the calculation of available data a partial cod mass balance analysis was conducted as shown in table s1 the percentage of scfas carbohydrates and proteins of the n 4 mm fc reactor on the third and fifth days of fermentation were higher than those of the n reactor indicating that fc n pretreatment resulted in an increase in soluble cod and soluble carbohydrates compared with sole n treatment in order to further supported this finding the carbohydrate and protein content of was were measured in reactors after two days of af fig 3b the contents of protein and carbohydrate in the blank control were 249 0 8 3 mg l and 45 0 7 9 mg l respectively when different amount of initial fc was supplied their concentration significantly increased as 411 8 11 5 and 88 0 7 8 mg l after 4 mm fc amendment and 487 2 8 2 and 141 4 10 4 mg l after 6 mm fc amendment respectively all of these results indicated that the pretreatment of fc n had a positive synergistic effect on was solubilization leading to abundant soluble substrates released from was pretreatment and fermentation which contributed to the follow up scfas production 3 3 impact of ferric chloride and nitrite pretreatment on the biodegradability and organics release of sludge was microbial cells were composed of various organic compounds and some of which were found recalcitrant to biodegradation therefore in this work we further investigated whether fc n could cause changes in the biodegradability of organic compounds that released by was wang et al 2009 the 3d eem spectrum was roughly split into five regions based on excitation and emission wavelengths and the relevant abundance of different organic compounds was represented with a percentage of fluorescence response in table s2 he et al 2021 as shown in fig 4 the eem spectra of the released organic matters in different reactors during one day fermentation the fluorescence intensity of eem peak e g ex em 273 330 nm of was supernatant pretreated with n and 4 mm fc was higher than that of the blank control indicating that soluble organic matter increased distinctly besides the structure of organic matter released by was also had an important influence on utilization of scfas by acid producing microorganisms wu et al 2010 the fluorescence response percentages of region i and region iv were 21 36 and 25 25 in the blank control and 19 20 and 44 21 in the n 4 mm fc reactor respectively fig 4 besides the sum of pⅰ n and pⅳ n in the n 4 mm fc reactor was 63 41 which was 1 36 fold higher than that of the blank control these results confirmed that the n 4 mm fc reactor further raised the proportion of biodegradable organic matter in fermentation liquid region iv supplying more biodegradable organics for subsequent scfas production compared with the blank control moreover the pⅲ n and pⅴ n decreased from 16 63 to 7 84 and 23 23 to 12 28 in the n 4 mm fc reactor respectively which showed that fc n pretreatment reduced the content of non biodegradable substances like fulvic acid and humic acid substances in total organics while the reduction or transformation pathway was not been fully revealed and further exploration is required 3 4 impact of ferric chloride and nitrite pretreatment on microflora structure the abundance and community structure of microorganisms were related to the performance of af process in order to explore the effect of fc n on microflora in af process high throughput gene sequencing technology was used to analyze microflora in two reactors the blank control and the n 4 mm fc as shown in fig s1 venn diagram analysis revealed that the amount of otus in the n 4 mm fc reactor was lower than that of the blank control 781 versus 913 and the shared otus in two reactors was 661 as shown in fig 5 bacteria belonging to the phylum of firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteriota chloroflexi bacteroidota and patescibacteria were the dominant microbial populations both in the blank control and the n 4 mm fc reactor accounting for 93 32 to 96 58 of the total microflora however their relative abundance was different in these two reactors fig s2 compared with the blank control the relative abundance of firmicutes in the n 4 mm fc reactor was higher 44 06 versus 5 71 while that of proteobacteria actinobacteriota chloroflexi bacteroidota and patescibacteria were significantly lower 17 08 versus 25 74 15 38 versus 20 83 3 87 versus 22 91 12 00 versus 12 87 and 4 19 versus 5 26 respectively previous studies reported that firmicutes microorganisms such as lactococcus and enterococcus were able to generate scfas by utilizing easily biodegradable organic matters such as carbohydrates and proteins moreover proteobacteria and bacteroidota microorganisms were capable to degrade refractory organic matters liu et al 2021b these facts further verified that the addition of fc n shifted the microbial community in was and promoted the formation of acid producing bacteria the composition of bacterial community at the genus level were shown in fig 6 and table 2 compared with the blank control the relative abundance of bacteria such as enterococcus and proteiniclasticum in the n 4 mm fc reactor significantly promoted while that of caldilineaceae and other bacteria declined slightly both reactors contained caldilineaceae and rhodobacter that belonging to hydrolytic microbes the sum of their relative abundance was 3 96 and 1 07 in the blank control and the n 4 mm fc reactor table 2 respectively which suggested the addition of fc n led to relatively small impact on hydrolytic bacteria in the community several microorganisms associated with the production of scfas were detected in the n 4 mm fc reactor and their total relative abundance was 40 97 which was 84 fold higher than that of the blank control as only 0 49 table 2 besides the proportions of enterococcus clostridium petrimonas and proteiniclasticum were 10 32 14 16 5 16 and 5 66 respectively which in the blank control was only 0 05 0 19 and 0 20 respectively the remaining genera e g petrimonas were not detected previous studies reported that enterococcus species were facultative anaerobes with optimal growth temperature as around 35 which were able to use glucose for fermentation with l lactic acid as final product schleifer and kilpper balz 1984 in this study the control temperature was set up as 35 0 0 5 which was conducive to the growth of enterococcus the proteiniclasticum belonging to anaerobic gram negative bacteria were capable to produce acetic acid propionic acid and isobutyric acid from amino acids as carbon and nitrogen sources zhang et al 2010 besides the petrimonas was known as gram negative and strictly anaerobic bacteria which could utilize carbohydrates and some other organic acids e g 2 oh and 3 oh fatty acids for fermentation grabowski et al 2005 also the relative abundance of other microbes related to the production of scfas i e macellibacteroides in the n 4 mm fc reactor was all higher than that in the blank control the above data analysis proved that the addition of fc n promoted the predominance of acid producing bacteria 3 5 overall understanding and implication af technology has attracted distinct attention in recent years while its large scale application in wwtps is often restricted by low yields of scfas in this study we verified that the pretreatment of was with fc n increased the yield of scfas that produced by af and this joint method expedited the dissolution of sludge and improved the conversion of refractory organic matters compared with previous studies this work found that with pretreatment by 250 mg l of n and 4 mm of fc the maximum scfas production of 211 3 3 1 mg cod g vs was obtained at day 5 which was 1 36 fold higher than that of sole n pretreatment indicating that fc n amendment greatly enhanced the yield of scfas besides adding fc to the primary settling tank of wwtps raised the removal effect of particulate organic matter and phosphorus conventionally in urban water management fc is often applied to promote coagulation flocculation therefore fc is expected to be used as a substitute of hcl in order to promote the formation of fna this study aimed to test the feasibility of fc n pretreatment of was for the improvement of scfas production thus no further technical optimizations were made here still comprehensive optimization studies e g mathematical modeling are expected to achieve higher yield of scfas in the end a fermentation treatment strategy based on fc n pretreatment was proposed from an environmental and economic perspective fig s4 was generated in both primary and secondary settling tanks was first pretreated with fc n for one day under aerobic conditions and then was was fermented to produce scfas note that nitrogen and phosphorus were also released into the fermentation broth during fermentation which could increase the nitrogen and phosphorus load in wastewater treatment therefore fermentation liquid containing scfas was first transferred to the recovery and separation system of nitrogen and phosphorus and then to the biochemical reaction tank for improving bnr previous studies also showed that struvite precipitation could be formed after af of sludge which effectively recovered the release of nitrogen and phosphorus tong and chen 2007 reduced the nitrogen and phosphorus load and partially compensated the operation cost of wwtps through these measurements higher resource utilization and lower amount of vs could be effectively achieved which might benefit to the sustainable operation of wwtps 4 conclusion in this study we proposed a new strategy to increase the production of scfas and meanwhile to shorten fermentation time by pretreating was with fc n the fc n combining system improved total yield of scfas as well as the percentage of acetic acid and shortened the total fermentation time with 250 mg l of n and 4 mm of fc pretreatment for one day and af for five days was produced an optimal yield of scfas as 211 3 3 1 mg cod g vs moreover the synergistic effect of fc n on sludge solubilization hydrolysis and acidification was significant mainly attributing to the fact that they promoted the formation of fna which destroyed was microbial cells and decreased the concentration of refractory substances combining with the effect of fe ⅲ reducing bacteria microbial community structure analysis revealed that the fc n pretreatment promoted the predominance of acid producing microorganisms rather than that of hydrolytic bacteria overall these results extended the practical scope of fc and provided a novel insight into the application of fc n in af process of was declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they had no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

introduction brine is a byproduct of desalination and several industrial processes e g oil and gas petrochemical aquaculture pharmaceutical and textile production panagopoulos 2021a that contains high concentration of dissolved salts and other chemicals and can have an adverse impact on the environment if not managed properly e g marine environment pollution groundwater pollution soil salinization giwa et al 2017 panagopoulos and haralambous 2020a panagopoulos et al 2019 due to increased public concerns about these environmental issues wastewater discharge regulations are increasingly mandating desalination plants and industries to treat produced brine to minimum liquid discharge mld and zero liquid discharge zld which increases the overall process costs cappelle et al 2015 mickley 2006 panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b conventional brine management technologies such as brine concentrators bc and mechanical vapor compression mvc are energy intensive and have high investment cost which limit their implementation and adoption panagopoulos 2021b panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b these constraints are particularly challenging for small scale producing less than 10 m3 day decentralized desalination plants and industrial systems as small size works against thermal efficiency jones et al 2019 narayan et al 2010b peter varbanets et al 2009 therefore there is a need for the development of modular cost effective technologies for on site brine management there are several emerging technologies that are promising for concentrating high salinity brine such as forward osmosis fo osmotically assisted reverse osmosis oaro and membrane distillation md fo is a membrane based technology that uses an osmotic pressure gradient to induce water flow through the membrane fo is a two step process in the first step a draw solution is used to draw clean water through a semipermeable membrane and in the second step the draw solution is recovered via a thermal decomposition process where operating temperatures range from 60 c to 190 c ahmed et al 2019 mcginnis and elimelech 2007 oaro is a new pressure driven membrane based technology that integrates the principles of reverse osmosis ro and fo panagopoulos et al 2019 oaro applies hydraulic pressure to transport water molecules across a semipermeable membrane similar to ro but a lower osmotic pressure sweep solution is added on the membrane s permeate side to decrease the difference in osmotic pressure and increase water flux md is another emerging technology that is based on transmembrane evaporation driven by the gradient in partial vapor pressure between the hot feed stream side and the cold permeate stream side of a hydrophobic membrane banat et al 2007 evaporation ponds are a common brine disposal method for processes that produce brine in arid and semi arid areas with high evaporation rates panagopoulos et al 2019 schmack et al 2013 the main drawbacks of evaporation ponds are the need for large land area the high capital cost associated with construction and lining the risk of potential contamination of underground water and limitation to dry climates panagopoulos et al 2019 pond footprint area can be reduced by adding mechanical misting equipment to enhance evaporation u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2009 this concept is known as enhanced evaporation and it works by spraying brine into the atmosphere as tiny droplets which increases the liquid gas surface contact area and thus increases the evaporation rate the net evaporation rate could increase by a factor of 5 to 7 reducing the pond surface area required mickley 2009 however misters can triple the operation and maintenance cost of the evaporation pond and have raised concerns related to the potential hazard of small salt particulates drifting away from the pond causing air quality issues mickley 2009 u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2009 wind aided intensified evaporation waiv is another brine volume reduction technology proposed to reduce the physical footprint area of the evaporation ponds gilron et al 2003 2019 waiv units incorporate large numbers of vertically mounted and continuously wetted evaporation surfaces wind induced airflow passes between the surfaces enhancing evaporation in one study a 10 fold reduction in footprint area was achieved in comparison to a standard evaporation pond gilron et al 2003 the modular design of this technique is an advantage while a major drawback is its dependence on wind availability studies thus far have been limited to experimental testing further investigation is still needed to optimize the primary factors affecting the evaporation process such as wind speed flow rate packing density etc arnal et al 2005 u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2009 convection enhanced evaporation cee was presented and discussed by the authors in kaddoura et al kaddoura et al 2021 which builds on the previous studies of evaporative brine volume reduction techniques and proposes active optimization and control of the primary factors affecting evaporation the proposed system utilizes convective evaporation of saline liquid films from horizontally packed flat evaporation surfaces preheated liquid brine is sprayed over each surface forming thin films and air flow over the films is forced by means of a fan as air flows over the films the difference in vapor pressure between the air and the liquid surfaces induces evaporation kaddoura et al 2021 a detailed mathematical model was presented and experimentally validated which allowed for parametric evaluation of the effect of each factor on the evaporation performance brine inlet temperature brine injection rate and air speed were identified to be the primary factors affecting evaporation nevertheless achieving a cost optimal system requires identifying the optimal combination of these factors that achieves the target evaporation performance at minimal cost for example increasing the fan speed and preheating the brine increase the evaporation rate per surface which reduces the capital cost however these changes would also increase the electric and thermal energy consumption and thus increases the operating cost kaddoura et al 2021 the tradeoff between the operating conditions of cee illustrates the need for numerical optimization to reach a modular cost optimal brine management system reducing the cost of brine management volume reduction and disposal would encourage the use of inland desalination and promote safe management of industrial waste effluents dudchenko et al 2021b several cost optimization studies for brine management and desalination processes are presented in the literature onishi et

liquid discharge the normalized cost of water was 23 m3 for high energy cost 8 3 m3 for low energy cost and 2 8 m3 if the energy was provided from waste heat wang and lior presented economic performance analysis of multi effect evaporation water desalination system and accommodated for different thermal energy costs by simulating four values for unit steam cost wang and lior 2011 beckman presented a dewvaporation system for wastewater treatment and presented the results for two distinct costs of input natural gas thermal energy cost beckman 2008 however these studies are still limited to the simulated energy prices on the other hand chehayeb et al presented design optimization for electrodialysis desalination and generalized their results by normalizing the material cost by the electric energy cost chehayeb et al 2017 this approach makes the formulation applicable to any situation in which the costs can be represented by the given ratio nevertheless their system was electrically driven and their approach accounted only for the compromises between material and electric energy costs without discussing how to include thermal energy cost in such cost generalization moreover most studies have neglected the discussion about the required footprint area and the modularity of their systems to fill this gap this study presents a method to generalize system cost modeling to include the compromises between material electric energy and thermal energy prices in addition to discussing the modularity of the proposed system which is beneficial for modeling of distinct desalination processes in this study the problem of achieving a cost optimal design of a cee system is setup as a multi objective optimization using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to the best of authors knowledge this is the first study to present cost modeling and optimization of cee system furthermore this study introduces a method of cost normalization for water treatment systems having trade offs between electric energy thermal energy and materials more generally the method formulates the objective functions as cost ratios which generalizes the optimization results the primary contributions are summarized as follows a method for formulating objective functions as cost ratios instead of absolute costs of mixed thermal and electric energy water treatment systems is presented the method generalizes the study results to applications with varying material and energy prices the operation of cee system is characterized and two operation modes are identified 1 all electric mode and 2 heating mode the study results in a series of pareto optimal designs of cee that demonstrate the compromises between capital cost operating energy cost and footprint area of the system and provide basic guidelines for future design and implementation of cee systems the study compares the cost and energy consumption of the optimized cee designs to other technologies presented in the market and literature the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 illustrates the cee system configuration section 3 reviews the mathematical model of cee kaddoura et al 2021 introduces the cost normalization method and establishes the multi objective optimization framework the results are presented and analyzed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 system description fig 1 presents a schematic of the proposed cee system the full system is comprised of a set of evaporation modules each containing horizontally stacked evaporation surfaces each of size l w at uniform vertical spacing d refer to table 4 for dimensions of the physical system a heating source such as solar thermal waste heat natural gas etc is used to preheat the brine to the set inlet temperature and a pump circulates the brine between the brine tank and the modules brine is released over each surface forming thin films an axial fan is affixed to each module to drive air flow over the brine films at the desired speed the difference in vapor pressure between the flowing air and liquid surfaces induces evaporation the humid air leaves the evaporator and the remaining liquid that is not evaporated is recycled to the brine tank for an efficient use of land area two modules are placed above each other energy use is dominated by the electric energy required to drive the fans and the thermal energy required to preheat the brine the goal of the present optimization study is to select the optimal combination of brine flow rate brine inlet temperature and air speed which results in minimal cost for a desired target system evaporation rate the total number of surfaces required in the system n sur is also determined by the optimization resulting in a set of modular designs 3 methodology the modeling required for cee cost optimization consists of two parts 1 prediction of the evaporation performance and energy use of cee under different operating conditions and 2 estimation of the associated costs with each set of operating conditions 3 1 performance modeling the model used in this study to predict the performance and energy use of cee was developed and compared to experimental results in kaddoura et al 2021 while detailed derivation of the model is therefore out of the scope of this study the fundamental relationships behind cee required to understand the optimization results are summarized here with the assumptions listed in appendix a the main goal of the cee model is to estimate the evaporation rate and energy use electric and thermal per single evaporation surface under different operating conditions a control volume taken above a segment of a surface is shown in fig 2 both air and liquid brine flow through the control volume in the same direction conservation of mass and energy equations and interface transport equations are applied to the control volume to simulate the heat and mass transfer occurring along the evaporation surface the conservation of mass for the control volume is expressed as 1 d m l m a d ω g where m l and m a are the liquid and dry air mass flow rates per evaporation surface respectively and ω g is the moisture content of the moist air this equation indicates that the rate of evaporated liquid equals to the rate of moisture content gained by the air the driving force for mass transfer is the difference in moisture content between the air layer immediately adjacent to the interface and the mean stream air the rate of mass transfer at the interface is given by 2 d m l k ω int ω g d a where k is the mass transfer coefficient ω int is the moisture content of the air layer immediately adjacent to the interface and d a is the interfacial area heat and mass transfer of the control volume substituting eq 2 into eq 1 yields 3 d ω g k m a ω int ω g d a the rate of change of air enthalpy is due to the combination of the simultaneous sensible convection and latent evaporation heat transfer occurring at the air liquid interface therefore the conservation of energy for the air side of the control volume is expressed as 4 m a d i g h t l t g d a i v k ω int ω g d a where i g is the enthalpy of the moist air h is the heat transfer coefficient t l and t g are the temperatures of the liquid and the moist air respectively and i v is the enthalpy of water vapor the conservation of energy for the entire control volume is expressed as 5 c p l m l d t l c p l t l d m l m a d i g 0 where c p l is the specific heat of the liquid substituting eq 1 into eq 5 then substituting eq 4 into the resulting equation yields 6 d t l da m l c p l k ω int ω g c p l t l i v h t l t g finally the local salinity of the liquid at position x along the surface is updated as 7 s x s in m l in m l x where s in and s x are the liquid salinity at the inlet and at location x respectively and the evaporation rate per evaporation surface is the difference in liquid flow rate between the inlet and the exit expressed as 8 e vap sur m l in m l e eqs 2 3 4 6 7 and 8 constitute the cee performance model and can be simulated to determine the evaporation rate based on the ambient temperature and humidity the finite difference method is utilized to solve the governing differential equations a grid independence study identified a resolution of n x 500 grid points in the flow direction and the fourth order runge kutta method is utilized to solve the governing equations kaddoura et al 2021 the electric power consumption per evaporation surface due to fan operation is estimated as 9 p e l s u r δ p v a η f a n where δ p is the pressure drop along an evaporation surface v a is the air volumetric flow rate per evaporation surface and η f a n is the fan efficiency in this study a fan efficiency of 67 is assumed chen et al 2017 the thermal power consumption per evaporation surface due to liquid preheating is estimated as 10 p th sur m l c p l δ t where δ t is the temperature rise due to heating refer to appendix b for the correlations used to compute the enthalpy of water vapor interface moisture content and specific heat of the liquid it is to be noted that liquid specific heat and vapor pressure are functions of the local salinity for a more complete understanding of the model and more details about calculating the thermophysical properties of the air and liquid brine see kaddoura et al 2021 3 2 performance parameters the gained input ratio gir evaluates the energy efficiency of an evaporative system and is expressed as huang et al 2019 11 g i r i fg m evap p th where i fg is the latent heat of vaporization m evap is the mass flow rate water evaporated and p th is the total thermal energy input as the value of gir increases the heat needed to evaporate a unit mass of water decreases which corresponds to higher energy efficiency gir is slightly different from the commonly used parameter in thermal desalination systems known as the gained output ratio gor which is defined as 12 g o r i fg m cond p th where m cond is the mass flow rate of water condensed recovered gir focuses on evaporation rate which is applicable for cee while gor focuses on water production which is used in this study to report other desalination methods in the literature 3 3 cost modeling the capital cost of cee is assumed proportional to the total number of evaporation surfaces the annualized capital cost cc is obtained by multiplying the direct capital cost by the capital recovery factor crf as follows chauvel et al 2003 13 c c k m n s u r crf and 14 crf j 1 j n 1 j n 1 where k m is the system material cost per evaporation surface n s u r is the total number of evaporation surfaces n is the lifetime of the system and j is the interest rate in this study the lifetime is assumed to be 25 years with interest rate of 5 vince et al 2008 wang and lior 2011 this corresponds to a crf of 7 1 eq 13 can be divided by the cost of electric energy unit k e l to get a normalized capital cost 15 c c c c k e l r 1 n s u r crf where r 1 is the material cost ratio defined as 16 r 1 k m k e l the operating cost of cee is assumed to consist only of the energy costs associated with brine preheating thermal energy and fan operation electric energy as a result the annual operating cost oc is expressed as 17 o c p e l k e l δ t p t h k t h δ t where k t h is the cost of a thermal energy unit δ t is the operation time duration of one year in hours and the total electric and thermal power demand are given as 18 p e l n s u r p e l s u r and 19 p t h n s u r p t h s u r respectively eq 17 can be divided by the cost of electric energy unit k e l to get a normalized operating cost 20 o c o c k e l p e l s u r p t h s u r r 2 n s u r δ t where r 2 is the energy cost ratio defined as 21 r 2 k t h k e l the total number of surfaces in the cee system is estimated as 22 n s u r e v a p t a r g e t e v a p s u r where e v a p t a r g e t is the desired targeted total evaporation from the system the evaporation rate per surface e v a p s u r is estimated from eq 8 which is a function of the operating conditions of cee finally the normalized total cost is the sum of the normalized operating and capital costs expressed as 23 t c o c c c this formulation makes the capital cost eq 15 a function of the material cost ratio r 1 irrespective of the material cost factors of individual components similarly the formulation makes the operating cost eq 20 a function of the energy cost ratio r 2 irrespective of the individual cost or source of the electric and thermal energy if the values of k m k t h and k e l are changed such that their ratios r 1 and r 2 are held constant the normalized operating capital and total costs are not affected this is beneficial because material thermal and electric costs may vary significantly by location application economic inflation etc the presented formulation allows the results of the current study to be generalizable to any combination of k m k t h and k e l scale formation can affect the performance and operating cost associated with brine evaporators scale formation and its effect on operating cost in distinct desalination systems has been studied by several scholars cui et al 2003 jiang et al 2020 madaeni and ghaemi 2007 qasim et al 2018 shirazi et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 in cee systems scale formation on the evaporation surfaces depends primarily on 1 the initial salinity and composition of the brine and 2 the extent of the brine volume reduction if the process is continued until or post saturation salts may precipitate on the evaporation surfaces resulting in the need for regular cleaning of those surfaces the cost of cleaning the evaporation surfaces over the lifetime of the surface is a function the number of surfaces n s u r and can be incorporated in the material cost per surface k m and material cost ratio r 1 scale formation might also decrease the lifetime of the evaporation surfaces and increase replacement rate this will result in a distinct capital recovery factor crf for the surfaces versus other components in the cee system refer to appendix c for the discussion on distinct lifetime for each component 3 3 1 example cost ratio calculation to illustrate how the normalized costs in the results section should be interpreted example calculation values are presented in tables 1 and 2 in this example the system material cost per surface k m includes the material cost of the evaporation surfaces and of the fans only for simplicity the cost of other components such as the pump or installation costs could also be included in the material cost as explained in appendix c for the given example capital cost is estimated as 24 c c n s u r c s u r n f a n c f a n crf where 25 n f a n n s u r n s 1 which leads to 26 c c c s u r c f a n n s 1 n s u r crf where 27 k m c s u r c f a n n s 1 where n f a n is the total number of fans also equals to the total number of modules n s 1 is the number of evaporation surfaces per module c s u r is material cost of an evaporation surface c f a n is the cost of a fan thus considering an electric energy unit cost k el 0 1 kwh el along with the costs of the evaporation surfaces and fans presented in the table 1 the material cost ratios are calculated to be r 1 13 75 55 55 65 and 110 kwhel surface respectively according to eq 16 example materials having costs of 0 375 surface and 10 surface would be polypropylene extruded sheet beckman 2008 and and nylon 6 respectively thermal energy required to preheat the brine can be delivered from several sources including electricity natural gas industrial waste heat recovery solar thermal etc to account for different scenarios four values of thermal energy cost along with different values of electric energy are listed in table 2 listed thermal energy unit costs are values commonly used in the literature beckman 2008 0 1 kwh th 0 05 kwh th 0 025 kwh th and 0 0125 kwh th note that different combinations of thermal and electric energy costs can result in the same value for the energy cost ratios r 2 this is the advantage of using cost ratios instead of absolute values simulated ratios can be translated into different energy cost scenarios finally note that the unit of the cost given in the results section m3 per kwhel can be converted to the more standard unit m3 by multiplying it by the local electric energy unit cost k e l for example assuming a commonly reported electric energy unit cost of 0 1 kwhel beckman 2008 reliance energy 0000 the value of 2 10 m3 per kwhel is equivalent to 2 m3 3 4 multi objective optimization the standard notation for a multi objective optimization problem is denoted as 28 min x j x p s t g x p 0 h x p 0 x lb x x ub where x is the design vector to be optimized p is the vector of constant model parameters j x is the vector of objective functions g x and h x are the inequality and equality constraints respectively the design vector is bounded from below and above by x lb and x ub respectively the optimization block diagram is shown in fig 3 conventional gradient based algorithms could cause the solution to converge at local minima evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm have higher ability of converging at the global minima however they are computationally expensive in this study the selected optimization algorithm is the multi objective genetic algorithm implementation in matlab gamultiobj which uses a controlled elitist genetic algorithm a variant of nsga ii deb 2001 matlab 2020 probability of crossover and mutation are 80 and 20 respectively deb 2001 matlab 2020 population size is 50 and pareto fraction is 0 75 3 4 1 objective functions in this multi objective optimization problem the two objective functions in j j 1 j 2 are 1 minimization of the normalized operating cost and 2 minimization of the normalized capital cost such that 29 j 1 o c and 30 j 2 c c 3 4 2 design variables parameters and constraints each design permutation is defined by a design vector x consisting of three individual design variables listed in table 3 the selected design variables are the air speed brine flow rate per evaporation surface and brine inlet temperature these variables were found to have the greatest affect on the evaporation performance and energy consumption in our previous work kaddoura et al 2021 the constant model parameters are assigned in the parameter vector p table 4 shows a subset of these optimization parameters kaddoura et al found that evaporation surface lengths of greater than 0 6 m led to diminishing evaporation rates and that a vertical spacing between evaporation surfaces of 2 4 cm maximized evaporation over a wide range of temperature difference relative humidity and air speeds kaddoura et al 2021 the ambient temperature and relative humidity parameters are related to the geographical location static values are assumed then alternative ambient conditions are explored in section 4 7 according to the k o ppen geiger climate classifications the target evaporation rate e v a p t a r g e t in this study is set to 10 m3 brine per day to ensure this condition the inequality constraint in g g 1 0 to be imposed is 31 g 1 e v a p t a r g e t e v a p s u r n s u r no equality constraints h were required in this formulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 the effect of design variables on the objective functions fig 4 shows the objective functions the operating cost and capital cost as a function of the decision variables as the liquid inlet temperature and air speed increase the capital cost decreases while the operating cost increases this is due to the associated increase in the evaporation rate per surface which leads to a lower number of surfaces lower capital cost and the associated increase in the thermal and electric energy use higher operating cost in addition as the liquid flow rate increases the operating cost increases while the capital cost decreases this is due to the increase in thermal energy required for preheating higher flow rates more operating cost but also due to the lower number of surfaces needed lower capital cost the trade off between the two objective functions demonstrates the need for multi objective optimization in multi objective optimization a set of non dominating solutions known as a pareto front is obtained rather than a unique global optimum because pareto fronts are a visual and quantitative representation of the compromise between the objective functions they provide insight to decision makers in selecting the specific optimal design solution 4 2 pareto front solutions fig 5 shows the pareto fronts for four different energy cost ratios r 2 at three different material cost ratios r 1 marker size represents the air speed value marker color represents the temperature difference between the liquid and the ambient and the lines represent the best fit curves at three distinct material cost ratios r 1 at r 1 110 kwhel surface and r 2 1 for an operating cost less than 2 5 10 m3 per kwhel the optimizer selects a temperature difference of zero and a low air speed resulting in the lowest values of the operating cost and highest values of the capital cost 0 77 10 to 2 10 m3 per kwhel for an operating cost ranging from 2 5 10 to 20 10 m3 per kwhel the operating temperature is still low but the optimizer starts to increase the air speed which results in lower capital costs down by approximately half to 0 29 10 m3 per kwhel for operating cost greater than 20 10 m3 per kwhel the optimizer starts increasing the temperature while maintaining high air speed which results in a significant increase in operating costs and cuts down the capital cost further at r 1 110 kwhel surface and r 2 0 5 for an operating cost less than 110 m3 per kwhel the optimizer selects zero temperature difference while gradually increasing the air speed resulting in a gradual increase in operating cost and gradual decrease in capital cost for operating cost greater than 11 10 m3 per kwhel the upper bound of the air speed 10 m s is reached so the optimizer starts preheating the liquid to further decrease the capital cost which in turn increases the operating cost similar trends are observed at r 1 110 kwhel surface and r 2 0 25 but the optimizer does not reach the upper bound of air speed because the cost of thermal energy is lower after an air speed of 8 7 m s the optimizer starts to increase the temperature difference at this point decreasing the capital cost by preheating is more cost effective than increasing the air speed electric energy consumption further finally at r 1 110 kwhel surface and r 2 0 125 it is observed that the optimizer either operates at a zero temperature difference or at a very high temperature difference close to maximum this is because the optimizer takes the advantage of the low cost of thermal energy to increase the evaporation rate per evaporation surface at this energy cost ratio the optimizer do not reach the upper bound for air speed and limits it to 9 m s similar trends for the design variables are observed at r 1 55 kwhel surface and r 1 13 75 kwhel surface lower material cost ratio decreases the associated capital cost to reach a capital cost lower than 0 25 10 m3 per kwhel at r 1 13 75 kwhel surface the presented pareto fronts allows us to define two operation modes the all electric mode where the optimizer operates at a zero temperature difference thus the total energy consumption given by the electric energy to drive the fan and the heating mode where the optimizer preheats the brine before injection over the evaporation surfaces thus the total energy consumption is a combination of thermal and electric energy in our previous work we showed that increasing air speed from 1 m s to 10 m s increases the evaporation rate by a factor of 5 while increasing the temperature difference from 0 c to 80 c increases the evaporation rate by a factor of 5 to 13 however energy consumption at 80 c is three times higher than the energy consumption at air speed of 10 m s meaning that preheating the brine costs more than increasing air speed kaddoura et al 2021 it was also shown that after overcoming a certain temperature difference threshold the evaporation rate increases without causing the specific thermal energy consumption to increase kaddoura et al 2021 this justifies the optimizer behavior regarding the quick increase in temperature difference when switching from all electric mode to heating mode it can be concluded that an increase in the operating air speed cuts down the capital cost significantly while only slightly increasing the operating cost whereas increasing the operating temperature difference cuts down the capital cost significantly but also increases the operating cost significantly therefore increasing the air speed should be considered first to decrease the capital cost because it has a lower contribution to the operating cost than preheating the liquid if increasing the air speed further is not feasible then preheating should be considered the optimum upper bound for air speed will depend on the energy cost ratio r 2 finally it is important to reiterate that all points on the pareto front can be considered optimal solutions the selection of a specific design solution will depend on the decision maker s selection criteria ahmadi et al 2012 4 3 total cost and footprint area in the all electric and heating modes the total specific cost m3 is a key factor in determining whether the system is economically advantageous fig 10a shows the normalized total cost of the optimized solutions and their corresponding normalized capital and normalized operating costs at material cost ratio r 1 55 kwhel surface and at four different energy cost ratios r 2 it is observed that the operating cost is significantly greater than the capital cost in the all electric mode a total cost in the range of 1 4 10 to 5 10 m3 per kwhel is achievable in this operation mode all energy cost ratios result in similar total costs because the total energy consumption is just the electric energy injecting the brine at ambient temperature decreases the evaporation rate per evaporation surface which requires having more evaporation surfaces to achieve the target evaporation rate per day kaddoura et al 2021 consequently this operation mode is characterized by the highest capital cost lowest operating cost and lowest total cost furthermore because more evaporation surfaces are required the corresponding footprint area in this region is expected to be the highest ranging from 0 5 to 1 8 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume as shown in fig 10b equivalent to 28 to 100 modules respectively to evaporate the target evaporation rate of 10 m3 per day for a total cost greater than 5 10 m3 per kwhel the heating mode is activated the brine is preheated resulting in an increase in the evaporation rate per surface and thus fewer surfaces are required which corresponds to a lower capital cost this reduces the footprint area to a range of 0 072 to 0 5 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume equivalent to 4 to 28 modules respectively the highest energy cost ratio r 2 1 results in the highest footprint values in this region this is expected as the optimizer at this cost ratio selects to operate at a lower temperature difference i e less heating due to the high cost of a thermal energy unit resulting in a higher number of evaporation surfaces the lowest footprint 0 072 m2 per m3 corresponding to 4 evaporation modules is achieved at a total cost of 6 5 10 m3 per kwhel and at an energy cost ratio r 2 0 125 on the other hand preheating the brine increases the thermal energy consumption which in turns increases the operating cost and consequently increases the total cost as well higher energy cost ratios r 2 result in higher operating and total costs because they correspond to higher cost of thermal energy unit it is concluded that in addition to the compromise between the operating and capital cost noted in previous sections there is also a compromise between total cost and the corresponding footprint area as the capital cost contribution to total cost is small in comparison to the operating cost decision makers should place more importance on the trade off between the total cost and footprint area the lowest total cost corresponds to the highest footprint area and lower energy cost ratios decrease the footprint and the total cost 4 4 effect of material cost ratio on total cost the minimum total cost is achieved in the all electric mode as shown in fig 10a this makes the total cost a function of material cost ratio r 1 only and independent of energy cost ratio r 2 fig 7 shows the effect of material cost ratio on the minimum normalized total cost the minimum normalized total cost decreases linearly as the material cost ratio decreases at r 1 13 75 kwhel surface a competitive normalized cost of 0 6 10 m3 per kwhel can be achieved which is equivalent to 0 6 m3 at electric energy unit cost k e l of 0 1 kwhel this cost example corresponds to the first row of table 1 also a total cost of 1 10 m3 per kwhel can be achieved at a material cost ratio of r 1 20 kwhel surface which is equivalent to 1 m3 of evaporated volume at electric energy unit cost k e l of 0 1 kwhel these low costs are competitive to exiting technologies available in the market and literature as is discussed in section 4 6 hydrophilic material is preferred for the evaporation surfaces as it encourages the liquid to spread into a thin film in our previous study kaddoura et al 2021 we included two materials polypropylene and nylon 6 nylon visually provides a more even distribution of liquid than polypropylene surfaces which is desired the development of low cost hydrophilic material for the evaporation surfaces could enhance the evaporation performance and decrease the capital cost of the cee system 4 5 selected system designs it is important to point out that each solution on the pareto front differs not only in cost but also in the footprint area fig 8 shows the normalized operating and capital costs of six selected system designs with different footprint areas at a material cost ratio r 1 55 kwhel surface designs were selected based on the associated footprint area of each design to highlight modularity of cee design design d1 corresponds to the minimum footprint area with the highest normalized total cost and design d6 corresponds to the minimum normalized total cost with maximum footprint area designs d1 to d3 operate in the heating mode while designs d4 to d6 operate in the all electric mode it is observed that as the footprint area increases the contribution of the capital cost to the total cost increases while the operating cost decreases in designs d1 to d4 the operating cost dominates the capital cost as the footprint area increases to 1 m2 per m3 of evaporated brine in design d5 the capital cost becomes comparable to but still lower than the operating cost finally in design d6 with the highest footprint area the capital cost dominates the operating cost because higher footprint area corresponds to more evaporation surfaces and modules which increases the capital cost it is noticed that smaller footprint area results in higher total cost as discussed in fig 10b design d1 has the minimal footprint area of 0 072 m2 per m3 of evaporated brine corresponding to 4 evaporation modules in this design the optimizer tends to minimize the capital cost while maximizing the operating cost this is achieved by preheating the brine to increase the evaporation rate per evaporation surface in order to reach the target evaporation rate per day resulting in the highest thermal energy consumption cost compared to other designs at r 2 1 the cost of thermal energy consumption is 43 10 m3 per kwhel which results in a total cost of 44 10 m3 per kwhel this cost is high compared to other market technologies as is discussed in section 4 6 and therefore design d1 is not feasible at high r 2 fig 9 competitive price points are achieved at r 2 0 25 and 0 125 where the cost of thermal energy consumption is 11 5 m3 and 5 5 m3 resulting in total cost of 11 9 10 m3 per kwhel and 6 5 10 m3 per kwhel respectively designs d2 and d3 are also limited to low energy cost ratios designs d4 to d6 operate in the all electric mode thus all energy cost ratios result in the same total cost the slight difference in total cost among different energy ratios in these designs is due to the stochastic nature of the genetic algorithm design 4 has a total cost around 3 7 10 m3 per kwhel and designs d5 and d6 have total costs around 2 10 m3 per kwhel and 1 4 10 m3 per kwhel respectively design 6 has the highest footprint area 18 m2 per m3 corresponding to 97 evaporation modules while having the lowest total cost 1 4 10 m3 per kwhel fig 9 shows a component wise breakdown for the operating and capital costs component costs used in this breakdown correspond to the second row in table 1 along with an electric energy unit cost k e l of 0 1 kwhel in all designs the surfaces constitute the largest contribution to the capital cost fig 9b in designs d1 to d3 the thermal energy consumption cost dominates the electric energy consumption cost in these designs the optimizer is preheating the brine which increases the thermal energy consumption in these designs the capital costs of surfaces and fans are significantly lower than those in the other designs because fewer evaporation surfaces are required because designs d4 to d6 belong to the all electric mode thermal energy consumption is zero and all energy consumption is electric leading to similar results for different cost ratios the capital cost of the surfaces and fans is significantly higher than those in the first three designs because more evaporation modules are needed the discussed cee system designs illustrate the wide range of potential specific footprint area 0 072 m2 per m3 to 1 8 m2 per m3 and demonstrate the modularity of cee the trade off between footprint area and the corresponding total cost allows decision makers to design their system based on their local site requirements which may include available space total specific cost targets and availability and cost of electric and thermal energy 4 6 comparison to other technologies fig 10a shows energy use comparison between cee and other brine concentration technologies studied in the literature the cee system is represented by three distinct designs at different specific footprint areas d3 d5 d6 at an energy cost ratio r 2 0 25 d5 and d6 of footprint areas of 1 8 and 1 m2 m3 respectively operate in all electric mode and d3 with footprint areas of 0 4 m2 m3 operates in heating mode it should be noted that the energy and gir values reported for cee are calculated based on the volume of water evaporated as cee does not include a water recovery unit in its current configuration additionally both gir and gor by definition are calculated using thermal energy consumption only the technologies shown in fig 10a are ro

more electric energy in the present cee system the length of the evaporation surfaces was selected such that the temperature of the non evaporated brine leaves the surfaces at a temperature close to ambient temperature liquid loses heat by evaporation more discussion are found in kaddoura et al 2021 this allows the system to take advantage of most of the heat added to the liquid maximizing evaporation and resulting in higher gained input ratio gir the 3 effect mee represents a small scale system similar to ones targeted in this study mee is expected to have high thermal energy use at this size scale as mee aims to recover the latent heat of vaporization after each stage making it energy efficient only at large scale fo recovers its draw solution via a thermal decomposition process which requires operating temperature ranging from 60 c to 190 c which significantly increases its thermal energy use mcginnis and elimelech 2007 similarly the operating temperatures reported in hdh process was around 80 c with no process optimization lower thermal energy use makes the gor of hdh higher than that of fo finally md is based on a transmembrane evaporation process that consumes a significant amount of thermal energy in it current configuration which decreases its gor the technology is under development and better energy performance is expected in the future banat et al 2007 moreover it is observed that cee designs d6 and d5 consume less or equal electric energy and at a smaller footprint area compared to ro and mvc it is to be noted that all other technologies reported can recover water while cee can not in its current configuration this could justifies the higher energy requirement by other technologies for example mvc uses an electric compressor to recover water vapor which increases its energy use a condensing unit could be incorporating into a cee system to recover the evaporated water in this case the system should also be optimized to minimize the specific entropy generation for the cycle which will results in peak gor mistry et al 2010 more discussion on second law efficiency is available in mistry et al 2010 narayan et al 2010a thiel et al 2015 two commercially available brine evaporators concentrators that use concepts and configurations similar to cee are manufactured by saltworks inc www saltworkstech com in canada and by altela inc in new mexico usa beckman 2008 fig 10b shows a comparison between cee and the two other technologies in terms of energy consumption footprint area and total cost of evaporated volume the values shown in the fig 10b for altela inc are from a pilot plant constructed in phoenix arizona beckman 2008 while the values for saltworks are those reported in the datasheet offered by the manufacturer saltworks evaporator has the highest footprint area 3 m2 per m3 which is 7 5 times larger than that of cee of specific footprint area of 0 4 m2 m3 and has significantly higher energy use also saltworks footprint is 1 6 times larger than cee of specific footprint area of 1 8 m2 m3 and has 5 times larger thermal input but about half electric energy use cost data for the saltworks system is not available in the literature so the the comparison is limited to energy consumption and footprint area the cost estimation used by altela evaporator assumes thermal energy cost of 0 027 kwhth and electric energy of 0 1 kwhel beckman 2008 which is equivalent to an energy cost ratio of r 2 0 27 reported values by altela are therefore compared to the cee results at energy cost ratio r 2 0 25 at an equal specific footprint area 1 m2 m3 to ensure a fair comparison cee cost 1 6 m3 is 4 times less than altela cost 6 4 m3 cee electric energy use 10 kwhel m3 is slightly higher than that of altela 7 6 kwhel m3 and cee has zero thermal energy input while altela requires significant amount 202 kwhth m3 these comparisons indicate the potentials of the optimized cee system to have an improved energetic and economic performance over existing technology note that the cee results assumes non saline liquid while altela considered salinity of 45 g kg kaddoura et al kaddoura et al 2021 reported an approximate 5 decrease in evaporation rate at liquid salinity of 45 g kg which would increases the reported cost and energy consumption of the optimal cee designs in this work by an equivalent percentage more discussion in section 4 8 yet the reported values for the optimized cee are still favorable compared to those reported by altela and saltworks the cee costs presented do depend on the assumed material cost ratio a lower material cost ratio r 1 would result in a lower total cost cee system and vice versa 4 7 effect of climate conditions various climate conditions according to the k o ppen geiger climate type classification system kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 are used as parameters in the optimization possible climate types are divided into 4 categories tropical a arid b temperate c and cold d and polar e polar climate is not taken into consideration in this study due to scarce data available and due to probable freezing of fluid flow one representative city is selected for each climate and the temperature and humidity of the ambient air in each city are defined by the design conditions given by ashrae ashrae 2017 and listed in table 5 fig 11 shows the evaporation performance and the optimization results for 11 distinct climatic conditions it is noted that climates with the highest evaporation rate per surface result in the lowest total cost and footprint area this is because fewer evaporation surfaces are needed to reach the evaporation rate target arid dessert bwh semi arid bsk and oceanic cfb climates resulted in the best performance for cee with lowest total cost and footprint area due to low ambient humidity while mediterranean hot summer csa and tropical af climates result in lower performance due to high humidity which limits the evaporation however all considered climates result in potentials of low total cost less than 1 m3 per kwhel with small footprint area less than 1 3 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume 4 8 effect of liquid salinity the results reported throughout this study correspond to the simulation of zero salinity liquid as a reference case which can be employed to predict the associated costs for distinct salinity values fig 12 shows the effect of liquid salinity on the evaporation rate at three unique temperature differences as salinity increases the evaporation rate relative to the zero salinity case decreases this is to be expected due to the reduction in latent heat of vaporization associated with salinity increase eq b 2 sharqawy et al 2010 at temperature difference of 0 c the evaporation rate decreases by 13 as salinity is increased to 100 g kg and by 23 at salinity of 180 g kg as temperature difference increases to 70 c the negative effect of salinity becomes smaller with the largest decrease in evaporation rate is 10 at salinity of 180 g kg achieving the targeted evaporation rate per day is accomplished by the optimization constraint eq 31 so the decrease in the evaporation performance due to salinity increase will be reflected in the cee system as an increase in the number of surfaces required because the number of surfaces required is inversely proportional to the evaporation rate per surface eq 22 on the other hand the normalized capital and operating costs are directly proportional to number of surfaces eqs 15 and 20 respectively therefore the increase in brine salinity will both decrease the evaporation rate and increase the capital and operating costs at similar rates this in turns will reduce the gained input ratio gir due to the greater heat input required 5 conclusion multi objective optimization of a cee system is presented with the goal of achieving a cost optimal design and operation cee systems represent a modular brine volume reduction method for decentralized desalination plants and small industrial processes a method for formulating objective functions as cost ratios instead of absolute costs for mixed thermal and electric energy water treatment systems is presented the costs of cee are normalized to generalize the results of the study to distinct locations and applications with varying material thermal and electric energy costs two operation modes were characterized the all electric mode corresponds to a lower total specific cost ranging from 1 4 10 to 5 10 m3 per kwhel and higher footprint area ranging from 0 5 to 1 8 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume the heating mode corresponds to a higher total specific cost up to 6 5 10 m3 per kwhel at low energy cost ratios a compact footprint area ranging from 0 072 to 0 5 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume is achieved this facilitates the possibility of designing cee over a wide range of footprint areas with the heating mode being considered for designs limited by the available space it is observed that the operating cost dominates the capital cost of cee which makes the design a compromise between total cost driven by operating cost and the footprint area the material cost is dominated by the cost of evaporation surfaces illustrating the need for low cost evaporation surfaces at a material cost ratio of 13 kwhel surface a normalized total cost of 0 6 10 m3 per kwhel can be achieved which is equivalent to 0 6 m3 at an electric energy unit cost of 0 1 kwhel certain cee designs were found to have lower predicted total cost energy consumption and footprint areas than those of commercially available evaporators these factors encourage continued investigation of cee technology as it is expected to be applicable in different climates the results obtained in this study are based on simplifying assumptions that need to be explored in future work first the operating cost is calculated as a function of energy cost only while maintenance costs are neglected due to the simple construction of the device physical pilot plants will help inform the inclusion of these costs second results in sections 4 1 to 4 6 assume static weather conditions as listed in table 4 future work should include real time optimization and control of the operating settings as a function of hourly variation in ambient conditions third the liquid simulated in this study is a non saline water as a reference case even with these limitations the figures in this work provide guidance on cee design that are generalizable to scenarios where material and energy costs

model assumptions the presented performance model in section 3 1 was developed based on the following assumptions for heat and mass transfer modeling kaddoura et al 2021 1 steady state one dimensional heat and mass transfer 2 heat and mass are transferred in the direction normal to the evaporation surface diffusion of heat and vapor in the x direction is neglected 3 fully developed flow is considered viscous dissipation and spatial variations in pressure are neglected 4 the evaporation surface is entirely wetted by the liquid film 5 liquid film is thin so the thermal resistance on the

15927,brine is a byproduct of desalination plants and several industrial processes which can have an adverse impact on the environment if not managed properly conventional brine management technologies are energy intensive and costly which limit their adoption this study presents the first cost optimization of convection enhanced evaporation cee system to achieve a modular cost

introduction brine is a byproduct of desalination and several industrial processes e g oil and gas petrochemical aquaculture pharmaceutical and textile production panagopoulos 2021a that contains high concentration of dissolved salts and other chemicals and can have an adverse impact on the environment if not managed properly e g marine environment pollution groundwater pollution soil salinization giwa et al 2017 panagopoulos and haralambous 2020a panagopoulos et al 2019 due to increased public concerns about these environmental issues wastewater discharge regulations are increasingly mandating desalination plants and industries to treat produced brine to minimum liquid discharge mld and zero liquid discharge zld which increases the overall process costs cappelle et al 2015 mickley 2006 panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b conventional brine management technologies such as brine concentrators bc and mechanical vapor compression mvc are energy intensive and have high investment cost which limit their implementation and adoption panagopoulos 2021b panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b these constraints are particularly challenging for small scale producing less than 10 m3 day decentralized desalination plants and industrial systems as small size works against thermal efficiency jones et al 2019 narayan et al 2010b peter varbanets et al 2009 therefore there is a need for the development of modular cost effective technologies for on site brine management there are several emerging technologies that are promising for concentrating high salinity brine such as forward osmosis fo osmotically assisted reverse osmosis oaro and membrane distillation md fo is a membrane based technology that uses an osmotic pressure gradient to induce water flow through the membrane fo is a two step process in the first step a draw solution is used to draw clean water through a semipermeable membrane and in the second step the draw solution is recovered via a thermal decomposition process where operating temperatures range from 60 c to 190 c ahmed et al 2019 mcginnis and elimelech 2007 oaro is a new pressure driven membrane based technology that integrates the principles of reverse osmosis ro and fo panagopoulos et al 2019 oaro applies hydraulic pressure to transport water molecules across a semipermeable membrane similar to ro but a lower osmotic pressure sweep solution is added on the membrane s permeate side to decrease the difference in osmotic pressure and increase water flux md is another emerging technology that is based on transmembrane evaporation driven by the gradient in partial vapor pressure between the hot feed stream side and the cold permeate stream side of a hydrophobic membrane banat et al 2007 evaporation ponds are a common brine disposal method for processes that produce brine in arid and semi arid areas with high evaporation rates panagopoulos et al 2019 schmack et al 2013 the main drawbacks of evaporation ponds are the need for large land area the high capital cost associated with construction and lining the risk of potential contamination of underground water and limitation to dry climates panagopoulos et al 2019 pond footprint area can be reduced by adding mechanical misting equipment to enhance evaporation u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2009 this concept is known as enhanced evaporation and it works by spraying brine into the atmosphere as tiny droplets which increases the liquid gas surface contact area and thus increases the evaporation rate the net evaporation rate could increase by a factor of 5 to 7 reducing the pond surface area required mickley 2009 however misters can triple the operation and maintenance cost of the evaporation pond and have raised concerns related to the potential hazard of small salt particulates drifting away from the pond causing air quality issues mickley 2009 u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2009 wind aided intensified evaporation waiv is another brine volume reduction technology proposed to reduce the physical footprint area of the evaporation ponds gilron et al 2003 2019 waiv units incorporate large numbers of vertically mounted and continuously wetted evaporation surfaces wind induced airflow passes between the surfaces enhancing evaporation in one study a 10 fold reduction in footprint area was achieved in comparison to a standard evaporation pond gilron et al 2003 the modular design of this technique is an advantage while a major drawback is its dependence on wind availability studies thus far have been limited to experimental testing further investigation is still needed to optimize the primary factors affecting the evaporation process such as wind speed flow rate packing density etc arnal et al 2005 u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2009 convection enhanced evaporation cee was presented and discussed by the authors in kaddoura et al kaddoura et al 2021 which builds on the previous studies of evaporative brine volume reduction techniques and proposes active optimization and control of the primary factors affecting evaporation the proposed system utilizes convective evaporation of saline liquid films from horizontally packed flat evaporation surfaces preheated liquid brine is sprayed over each surface forming thin films and air flow over the films is forced by means of a fan as air flows over the films the difference in vapor pressure between the air and the liquid surfaces induces evaporation kaddoura et al 2021 a detailed mathematical model was presented and experimentally validated which allowed for parametric evaluation of the effect of each factor on the evaporation performance brine inlet temperature brine injection rate and air speed were identified to be the primary factors affecting evaporation nevertheless achieving a cost optimal system requires identifying the optimal combination of these factors that achieves the target evaporation performance at minimal cost for example increasing the fan speed and preheating the brine increase the evaporation rate per surface which reduces the capital cost however these changes would also increase the electric and thermal energy consumption and thus increases the operating cost kaddoura et al 2021 the tradeoff between the operating conditions of cee illustrates the need for numerical optimization to reach a modular cost optimal brine management system reducing the cost of brine management volume reduction and disposal would encourage the use of inland desalination and promote safe management of industrial waste effluents dudchenko et al 2021b several cost optimization studies for brine management and desalination processes are presented in the literature onishi et

desalination in reverse osmosis vince et al 2008 electrodialysis shah et al 2018 and multi effect distillation thermal vapor compression med tvc desalination janghorban esfahani et al 2012 however the aforementioned studies have used particular prices of material and energy in their cost models which narrows their results to the specified cost scenarios other studies have aimed to expand their economic modeling to account for varying energy cost scenarios jiang et al conducted an operational cost optimization of a full scale seawater reverse osmosis ro process taking into consideration the variability of electricity prices and freshwater demand jiang et al 2015 the problem was set as a nonlinear programming problem to select the optimal feed pressure and feed flow rate that minimizes

energy was estimated by simulating distinct values for steam costs to maximize the total amount of water recovered the outlet brine salinity was fixed close to saturation conditions to approach zero liquid discharge the normalized cost of water was 23 m3 for high energy cost 8 3 m3 for low energy cost and 2 8 m3 if the energy was provided from waste heat wang and lior presented economic performance analysis of multi effect evaporation water desalination system and accommodated for different thermal energy costs by simulating four values for unit steam cost wang and lior 2011 beckman presented a dewvaporation system for wastewater treatment and presented the results for two distinct costs of input natural gas thermal energy cost beckman 2008 however these studies are still limited to the simulated energy prices on the other hand chehayeb et al presented design optimization for electrodialysis desalination and generalized their results by normalizing the material cost by the electric energy cost chehayeb et al 2017 this approach makes the formulation applicable to any situation in which the costs can be represented by the given ratio nevertheless their system was electrically driven and their approach accounted only for the compromises between material and electric energy costs without discussing how to include thermal energy cost in such cost generalization moreover most studies have neglected the discussion about the required footprint area and the modularity of their systems to fill this gap this study presents a method to generalize system cost modeling to include the compromises between material electric energy and thermal energy prices in addition to discussing the modularity of the proposed system which is beneficial for modeling of distinct desalination processes in this study the problem of achieving a cost optimal design of a cee system is setup as a multi objective optimization using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to the best of authors knowledge this is the first study to present cost modeling and optimization of cee system furthermore this study introduces a method of cost normalization for water treatment systems having trade offs between electric energy thermal energy and materials more generally the method formulates the objective functions as cost ratios which generalizes the optimization results the primary contributions are summarized as follows a method for formulating objective functions as cost ratios instead of absolute costs of mixed thermal and electric energy water treatment systems is presented the method generalizes the study results to applications with varying material and energy prices the operation of cee system is characterized and two operation modes are identified 1 all electric mode and 2 heating mode the study results in a series of pareto optimal designs of cee that demonstrate the compromises between capital cost operating energy cost and footprint area of the system and provide basic guidelines for future design and implementation of cee systems the study compares the cost and energy consumption of the optimized cee designs to other technologies presented in the market and literature the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 illustrates the cee system configuration section 3 reviews the mathematical model of cee kaddoura et al 2021 introduces the cost normalization method and establishes the multi objective optimization framework the results are presented and analyzed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 system description fig 1 presents a schematic of the proposed cee system the full system is comprised of a set of evaporation modules each containing horizontally stacked evaporation surfaces each of size l w at uniform vertical spacing d refer to table 4 for dimensions of the physical system a heating source such as solar thermal waste heat natural gas etc is used to preheat the brine to the set inlet temperature and a pump circulates the brine between the brine tank and the modules brine is released over each surface forming thin films an axial fan is affixed to each module to drive air flow over the brine films at the desired speed the difference in vapor pressure between the flowing air and liquid surfaces induces evaporation the humid air leaves the evaporator and the remaining liquid that is not evaporated is recycled to the brine tank for an efficient use of land area two modules are placed above each other energy use is dominated by the electric energy required to drive the fans and the thermal energy required to preheat the brine the goal of the present optimization study is to select the optimal combination of brine flow rate brine inlet temperature and air speed which results in minimal cost for a desired target system evaporation rate the total number of surfaces required in the system n sur is also determined by the optimization resulting in a set of modular designs 3 methodology the modeling required for cee cost optimization consists of two parts 1 prediction of the evaporation performance and energy use of cee under different operating conditions and 2 estimation of the associated costs with each set of operating conditions 3 1 performance modeling the model used in this study to predict the performance and energy use of cee was developed and compared to experimental results in kaddoura et al 2021 while detailed derivation of the model is therefore out of the scope of this study the fundamental relationships behind cee required to understand the optimization results are summarized here with the assumptions listed in appendix a the main goal of the cee model is to estimate the evaporation rate and energy use electric and thermal per single evaporation surface under different operating conditions a control volume taken above a segment of a surface is shown in fig 2 both air and liquid brine flow through the control volume in the same direction conservation of mass and energy equations and interface transport equations are applied to the control volume to simulate the heat and mass transfer occurring along the evaporation surface the conservation of mass for the control volume is expressed as 1 d m l m a d ω g where m l and m a are the liquid and dry air mass flow rates per evaporation surface respectively and ω g is the moisture content of the moist air this equation indicates that the rate of evaporated liquid equals to the rate of moisture content gained by the air the driving force for mass transfer is the difference in moisture content between the air layer immediately adjacent to the interface and the mean stream air the rate of mass transfer at the interface is given by 2 d m l k ω int ω g d a where k is the mass transfer coefficient ω int is the moisture content of the air layer immediately adjacent to the interface and d a is the interfacial area heat and mass transfer of the control volume substituting eq 2 into eq 1 yields 3 d ω g k m a ω int ω g d a the rate of change of air enthalpy is due to the combination of the simultaneous sensible convection and latent evaporation heat transfer occurring at the air liquid interface therefore the conservation of energy for the air side of the control volume is expressed as 4 m a d i g h t l t g d a i v k ω int ω g d a where i g is the enthalpy of the moist air h is the heat transfer coefficient t l and t g are the temperatures of the liquid and the moist air respectively and i v is the enthalpy of water vapor the conservation of energy for the entire control volume is expressed as 5 c p l m l d t l c p l t l d m l m a d i g 0 where c p l is the specific heat of the liquid substituting eq 1 into eq 5 then substituting eq 4 into the resulting equation yields 6 d t l da m l c p l k ω int ω g c p l t l i v h t l t g finally the local salinity of the liquid at position x along the surface is updated as 7 s x s in m l in m l x where s in and s x are the liquid salinity at the inlet and at location x respectively and the evaporation rate per evaporation surface is the difference in liquid flow rate between the inlet and the exit expressed as 8 e vap sur m l in m l e eqs 2 3 4 6 7 and 8 constitute the cee performance model and can be simulated to determine the evaporation rate based on the ambient temperature and humidity the finite difference method is utilized to solve the governing differential equations a grid independence study identified a resolution of n x 500 grid points in the flow direction and the fourth order runge kutta method is utilized to solve the governing equations kaddoura et al 2021 the electric power consumption per evaporation surface due to fan operation is estimated as 9 p e l s u r δ p v a η f a n where δ p is the pressure drop along an evaporation surface v a is the air volumetric flow rate per evaporation surface and η f a n is the fan efficiency in this study a fan efficiency of 67 is assumed chen et al 2017 the thermal power consumption per evaporation surface due to liquid preheating is estimated as 10 p th sur m l c p l δ t where δ t is the temperature rise due to heating refer to appendix b for the correlations used to compute the enthalpy of water vapor interface moisture content and specific heat of the liquid it is to be noted that liquid specific heat and vapor pressure are functions of the local salinity for a more complete understanding of the model and more details about calculating the thermophysical properties of the air and liquid brine see kaddoura et al 2021 3 2 performance parameters the gained input ratio gir evaluates the energy efficiency of an evaporative system and is expressed as huang et al 2019 11 g i r i fg m evap p th where i fg is the latent heat of vaporization m evap is the mass flow rate water evaporated and p th is the total thermal energy input as the value of gir increases the heat needed to evaporate a unit mass of water decreases which corresponds to higher energy efficiency gir is slightly different from the commonly used parameter in thermal desalination systems known as the gained output ratio gor which is defined as 12 g o r i fg m cond p th where m cond is the mass flow rate of water condensed recovered gir focuses on evaporation rate which is applicable for cee while gor focuses on water production which is used in this study to report other desalination methods in the literature 3 3 cost modeling the capital cost of cee is assumed proportional to the total number of evaporation surfaces the annualized capital cost cc is obtained by multiplying the direct capital cost by the capital recovery factor crf as follows chauvel et al 2003 13 c c k m n s u r crf and 14 crf j 1 j n 1 j n 1 where k m is the system material cost per evaporation surface n s u r is the total number of evaporation surfaces n is the lifetime of the system and j is the interest rate in this study the lifetime is assumed to be 25 years with interest rate of 5 vince et al 2008 wang and lior 2011 this corresponds to a crf of 7 1 eq 13 can be divided by the cost of electric energy unit k e l to get a normalized capital cost 15 c c c c k e l r 1 n s u r crf where r 1 is the material cost ratio defined as 16 r 1 k m k e l the operating cost of cee is assumed to consist only of the energy costs associated with brine preheating thermal energy and fan operation electric energy as a result the annual operating cost oc is expressed as 17 o c p e l k e l δ t p t h k t h δ t where k t h is the cost of a thermal energy unit δ t is the operation time duration of one year in hours and the total electric and thermal power demand are given as 18 p e l n s u r p e l s u r and 19 p t h n s u r p t h s u r respectively eq 17 can be divided by the cost of electric energy unit k e l to get a normalized operating cost 20 o c o c k e l p e l s u r p t h s u r r 2 n s u r δ t where r 2 is the energy cost ratio defined as 21 r 2 k t h k e l the total number of surfaces in the cee system is estimated as 22 n s u r e v a p t a r g e t e v a p s u r where e v a p t a r g e t is the desired targeted total evaporation from the system the evaporation rate per surface e v a p s u r is estimated from eq 8 which is a function of the operating conditions of cee finally the normalized total cost is the sum of the normalized operating and capital costs expressed as 23 t c o c c c this formulation makes the capital cost eq 15 a function of the material cost ratio r 1 irrespective of the material cost factors of individual components similarly the formulation makes the operating cost eq 20 a function of the energy cost ratio r 2 irrespective of the individual cost or source of the electric and thermal energy if the values of k m k t h and k e l are changed such that their ratios r 1 and r 2 are held constant the normalized operating capital and total costs are not affected this is beneficial because material thermal and electric costs may vary significantly by location application economic inflation etc the presented formulation allows the results of the current study to be generalizable to any combination of k m k t h and k e l scale formation can affect the performance and operating cost associated with brine evaporators scale formation and its effect on operating cost in distinct desalination systems has been studied by several scholars cui et al 2003 jiang et al 2020 madaeni and ghaemi 2007 qasim et al 2018 shirazi et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 in cee systems scale formation on the evaporation surfaces depends primarily on 1 the initial salinity and composition of the brine and 2 the extent of the brine volume reduction if the process is continued until or post saturation salts may precipitate on the evaporation surfaces resulting in the need for regular cleaning of those surfaces the cost of cleaning the evaporation surfaces over the lifetime of the surface is a function the number of surfaces n s u r and can be incorporated in the material cost per surface k m and material cost ratio r 1 scale formation might also decrease the lifetime of the evaporation surfaces and increase replacement rate this will result in a distinct capital recovery factor crf for the surfaces versus other components in the cee system refer to appendix c for the discussion on distinct lifetime for each component 3 3 1 example cost ratio calculation to illustrate how the normalized costs in the results section should be interpreted example calculation values are presented in tables 1 and 2 in this example the system material cost per surface k m includes the material cost of the evaporation surfaces and of the fans only for simplicity the cost of other components such as the pump or installation costs could also be included in the material cost as explained in appendix c for the given example capital cost is estimated as 24 c c n s u r c s u r n f a n c f a n crf where 25 n f a n n s u r n s 1 which leads to 26 c c c s u r c f a n n s 1 n s u r crf where 27 k m c s u r c f a n n s 1 where n f a n is the total number of fans also equals to the total number of modules n s 1 is the number of evaporation surfaces per module c s u r is material cost of an evaporation surface c f a n is the cost of a fan thus considering an electric energy unit cost k el 0 1 kwh el along with the costs of the evaporation surfaces and fans presented in the table 1 the material cost ratios are calculated to be r 1 13 75 55 55 65 and 110 kwhel surface respectively according to eq 16 example materials having costs of 0 375 surface and 10 surface would be polypropylene extruded sheet beckman 2008 and and nylon 6 respectively thermal energy required to preheat the brine can be delivered from several sources including electricity natural gas industrial waste heat recovery solar thermal etc to account for different scenarios four values of thermal energy cost along with different values of electric energy are listed in table 2 listed thermal energy unit costs are values commonly used in the literature beckman 2008 0 1 kwh th 0 05 kwh th 0 025 kwh th and 0 0125 kwh th note that different combinations of thermal and electric energy costs can result in the same value for the energy cost ratios r 2 this is the advantage of using cost ratios instead of absolute values simulated ratios can be translated into different energy cost scenarios finally note that the unit of the cost given in the results section m3 per kwhel can be converted to the more standard unit m3 by multiplying it by the local electric energy unit cost k e l for example assuming a commonly reported electric energy unit cost of 0 1 kwhel beckman 2008 reliance energy 0000 the value of 2 10 m3 per kwhel is equivalent to 2 m3 3 4 multi objective optimization the standard notation for a multi objective optimization problem is denoted as 28 min x j x p s t g x p 0 h x p 0 x lb x x ub where x is the design vector to be optimized p is the vector of constant model parameters j x is the vector of objective functions g x and h x are the inequality and equality constraints respectively the design vector is bounded from below and above by x lb and x ub respectively the optimization block diagram is shown in fig 3 conventional gradient based algorithms could cause the solution to converge at local minima evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm have higher ability of converging at the global minima however they are computationally expensive in this study the selected optimization algorithm is the multi objective genetic algorithm implementation in matlab gamultiobj which uses a controlled elitist genetic algorithm a variant of nsga ii deb 2001 matlab 2020 probability of crossover and mutation are 80 and 20 respectively deb 2001 matlab 2020 population size is 50 and pareto fraction is 0 75 3 4 1 objective functions in this multi objective optimization problem the two objective functions in j j 1 j 2 are 1 minimization of the normalized operating cost and 2 minimization of the normalized capital cost such that 29 j 1 o c and 30 j 2 c c 3 4 2 design variables parameters and constraints each design permutation is defined by a design vector x consisting of three individual design variables listed in table 3 the selected design variables are the air speed brine flow rate per evaporation surface and brine inlet temperature these variables were found to have the greatest affect on the evaporation performance and energy consumption in our previous work kaddoura et al 2021 the constant model parameters are assigned in the parameter vector p table 4 shows a subset of these optimization parameters kaddoura et al found that evaporation surface lengths of greater than 0 6 m led to diminishing evaporation rates and that a vertical spacing between evaporation surfaces of 2 4 cm maximized evaporation over a wide range of temperature difference relative humidity and air speeds kaddoura et al 2021 the ambient temperature and relative humidity parameters are related to the geographical location static values are assumed then alternative ambient conditions are explored in section 4 7 according to the k o ppen geiger climate classifications the target evaporation rate e v a p t a r g e t in this study is set to 10 m3 brine per day to ensure this condition the inequality constraint in g g 1 0 to be imposed is 31 g 1 e v a p t a r g e t e v a p s u r n s u r no equality constraints h were required in this formulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 the effect of design variables on the objective functions fig 4 shows the objective functions the operating cost and capital cost as a function of the decision variables as the liquid inlet temperature and air speed increase the capital cost decreases while the operating cost increases this is due to the associated increase in the evaporation rate per surface which leads to a lower number of surfaces lower capital cost and the associated increase in the thermal and electric energy use higher operating cost in addition as the liquid flow rate increases the operating cost increases while the capital cost decreases this is due to the increase in thermal energy required for preheating higher flow rates more operating cost but also due to the lower number of surfaces needed lower capital cost the trade off between the two objective functions demonstrates the need for multi objective optimization in multi objective optimization a set of non dominating solutions known as a pareto front is obtained rather than a unique global optimum because pareto fronts are a visual and quantitative representation of the compromise between the objective functions they provide insight to decision makers in selecting the specific optimal design solution 4 2 pareto front solutions fig 5 shows the pareto fronts for four different energy cost ratios r 2 at three different material cost ratios r 1 marker size represents the air speed value marker color represents the temperature difference between the liquid and the ambient and the lines represent the best fit curves at three distinct material cost ratios r 1 at r 1 110 kwhel surface and r 2 1 for an operating cost less than 2 5 10 m3 per kwhel the optimizer selects a temperature difference of zero and a low air speed resulting in the lowest values of the operating cost and highest values of the capital cost 0 77 10 to 2 10 m3 per kwhel for an operating cost ranging from 2 5 10 to 20 10 m3 per kwhel the operating temperature is still low but the optimizer starts to increase the air speed which results in lower capital costs down by approximately half to 0 29 10 m3 per kwhel for operating cost greater than 20 10 m3 per kwhel the optimizer starts increasing the temperature while maintaining high air speed which results in a significant increase in operating costs and cuts down the capital cost further at r 1 110 kwhel surface and r 2 0 5 for an operating cost less than 110 m3 per kwhel the optimizer selects zero temperature difference while gradually increasing the air speed resulting in a gradual increase in operating cost and gradual decrease in capital cost for operating cost greater than 11 10 m3 per kwhel the upper bound of the air speed 10 m s is reached so the optimizer starts preheating the liquid to further decrease the capital cost which in turn increases the operating cost similar trends are observed at r 1 110 kwhel surface and r 2 0 25 but the optimizer does not reach the upper bound of air speed because the cost of thermal energy is lower after an air speed of 8 7 m s the optimizer starts to increase the temperature difference at this point decreasing the capital cost by preheating is more cost effective than increasing the air speed electric energy consumption further finally at r 1 110 kwhel surface and r 2 0 125 it is observed that the optimizer either operates at a zero temperature difference or at a very high temperature difference close to maximum this is because the optimizer takes the advantage of the low cost of thermal energy to increase the evaporation rate per evaporation surface at this energy cost ratio the optimizer do not reach the upper bound for air speed and limits it to 9 m s similar trends for the design variables are observed at r 1 55 kwhel surface and r 1 13 75 kwhel surface lower material cost ratio decreases the associated capital cost to reach a capital cost lower than 0 25 10 m3 per kwhel at r 1 13 75 kwhel surface the presented pareto fronts allows us to define two operation modes the all electric mode where the optimizer operates at a zero temperature difference thus the total energy consumption given by the electric energy to drive the fan and the heating mode where the optimizer preheats the brine before injection over the evaporation surfaces thus the total energy consumption is a combination of thermal and electric energy in our previous work we showed that increasing air speed from 1 m s to 10 m s increases the evaporation rate by a factor of 5 while increasing the temperature difference from 0 c to 80 c increases the evaporation rate by a factor of 5 to 13 however energy consumption at 80 c is three times higher than the energy consumption at air speed of 10 m s meaning that preheating the brine costs more than increasing air speed kaddoura et al 2021 it was also shown that after overcoming a certain temperature difference threshold the evaporation rate increases without causing the specific thermal energy consumption to increase kaddoura et al 2021 this justifies the optimizer behavior regarding the quick increase in temperature difference when switching from all electric mode to heating mode it can be concluded that an increase in the operating air speed cuts down the capital cost significantly while only slightly increasing the operating cost whereas increasing the operating temperature difference cuts down the capital cost significantly but also increases the operating cost significantly therefore increasing the air speed should be considered first to decrease the capital cost because it has a lower contribution to the operating cost than preheating the liquid if increasing the air speed further is not feasible then preheating should be considered the optimum upper bound for air speed will depend on the energy cost ratio r 2 finally it is important to reiterate that all points on the pareto front can be considered optimal solutions the selection of a specific design solution will depend on the decision maker s selection criteria ahmadi et al 2012 4 3 total cost and footprint area in the all electric and heating modes the total specific cost m3 is a key factor in determining whether the system is economically advantageous fig 10a shows the normalized total cost of the optimized solutions and their corresponding normalized capital and normalized operating costs at material cost ratio r 1 55 kwhel surface and at four different energy cost ratios r 2 it is observed that the operating cost is significantly greater than the capital cost in the all electric mode a total cost in the range of 1 4 10 to 5 10 m3 per kwhel is achievable in this operation mode all energy cost ratios result in similar total costs because the total energy consumption is just the electric energy injecting the brine at ambient temperature decreases the evaporation rate per evaporation surface which requires having more evaporation surfaces to achieve the target evaporation rate per day kaddoura et al 2021 consequently this operation mode is characterized by the highest capital cost lowest operating cost and lowest total cost furthermore because more evaporation surfaces are required the corresponding footprint area in this region is expected to be the highest ranging from 0 5 to 1 8 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume as shown in fig 10b equivalent to 28 to 100 modules respectively to evaporate the target evaporation rate of 10 m3 per day for a total cost greater than 5 10 m3 per kwhel the heating mode is activated the brine is preheated resulting in an increase in the evaporation rate per surface and thus fewer surfaces are required which corresponds to a lower capital cost this reduces the footprint area to a range of 0 072 to 0 5 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume equivalent to 4 to 28 modules respectively the highest energy cost ratio r 2 1 results in the highest footprint values in this region this is expected as the optimizer at this cost ratio selects to operate at a lower temperature difference i e less heating due to the high cost of a thermal energy unit resulting in a higher number of evaporation surfaces the lowest footprint 0 072 m2 per m3 corresponding to 4 evaporation modules is achieved at a total cost of 6 5 10 m3 per kwhel and at an energy cost ratio r 2 0 125 on the other hand preheating the brine increases the thermal energy consumption which in turns increases the operating cost and consequently increases the total cost as well higher energy cost ratios r 2 result in higher operating and total costs because they correspond to higher cost of thermal energy unit it is concluded that in addition to the compromise between the operating and capital cost noted in previous sections there is also a compromise between total cost and the corresponding footprint area as the capital cost contribution to total cost is small in comparison to the operating cost decision makers should place more importance on the trade off between the total cost and footprint area the lowest total cost corresponds to the highest footprint area and lower energy cost ratios decrease the footprint and the total cost 4 4 effect of material cost ratio on total cost the minimum total cost is achieved in the all electric mode as shown in fig 10a this makes the total cost a function of material cost ratio r 1 only and independent of energy cost ratio r 2 fig 7 shows the effect of material cost ratio on the minimum normalized total cost the minimum normalized total cost decreases linearly as the material cost ratio decreases at r 1 13 75 kwhel surface a competitive normalized cost of 0 6 10 m3 per kwhel can be achieved which is equivalent to 0 6 m3 at electric energy unit cost k e l of 0 1 kwhel this cost example corresponds to the first row of table 1 also a total cost of 1 10 m3 per kwhel can be achieved at a material cost ratio of r 1 20 kwhel surface which is equivalent to 1 m3 of evaporated volume at electric energy unit cost k e l of 0 1 kwhel these low costs are competitive to exiting technologies available in the market and literature as is discussed in section 4 6 hydrophilic material is preferred for the evaporation surfaces as it encourages the liquid to spread into a thin film in our previous study kaddoura et al 2021 we included two materials polypropylene and nylon 6 nylon visually provides a more even distribution of liquid than polypropylene surfaces which is desired the development of low cost hydrophilic material for the evaporation surfaces could enhance the evaporation performance and decrease the capital cost of the cee system 4 5 selected system designs it is important to point out that each solution on the pareto front differs not only in cost but also in the footprint area fig 8 shows the normalized operating and capital costs of six selected system designs with different footprint areas at a material cost ratio r 1 55 kwhel surface designs were selected based on the associated footprint area of each design to highlight modularity of cee design design d1 corresponds to the minimum footprint area with the highest normalized total cost and design d6 corresponds to the minimum normalized total cost with maximum footprint area designs d1 to d3 operate in the heating mode while designs d4 to d6 operate in the all electric mode it is observed that as the footprint area increases the contribution of the capital cost to the total cost increases while the operating cost decreases in designs d1 to d4 the operating cost dominates the capital cost as the footprint area increases to 1 m2 per m3 of evaporated brine in design d5 the capital cost becomes comparable to but still lower than the operating cost finally in design d6 with the highest footprint area the capital cost dominates the operating cost because higher footprint area corresponds to more evaporation surfaces and modules which increases the capital cost it is noticed that smaller footprint area results in higher total cost as discussed in fig 10b design d1 has the minimal footprint area of 0 072 m2 per m3 of evaporated brine corresponding to 4 evaporation modules in this design the optimizer tends to minimize the capital cost while maximizing the operating cost this is achieved by preheating the brine to increase the evaporation rate per evaporation surface in order to reach the target evaporation rate per day resulting in the highest thermal energy consumption cost compared to other designs at r 2 1 the cost of thermal energy consumption is 43 10 m3 per kwhel which results in a total cost of 44 10 m3 per kwhel this cost is high compared to other market technologies as is discussed in section 4 6 and therefore design d1 is not feasible at high r 2 fig 9 competitive price points are achieved at r 2 0 25 and 0 125 where the cost of thermal energy consumption is 11 5 m3 and 5 5 m3 resulting in total cost of 11 9 10 m3 per kwhel and 6 5 10 m3 per kwhel respectively designs d2 and d3 are also limited to low energy cost ratios designs d4 to d6 operate in the all electric mode thus all energy cost ratios result in the same total cost the slight difference in total cost among different energy ratios in these designs is due to the stochastic nature of the genetic algorithm design 4 has a total cost around 3 7 10 m3 per kwhel and designs d5 and d6 have total costs around 2 10 m3 per kwhel and 1 4 10 m3 per kwhel respectively design 6 has the highest footprint area 18 m2 per m3 corresponding to 97 evaporation modules while having the lowest total cost 1 4 10 m3 per kwhel fig 9 shows a component wise breakdown for the operating and capital costs component costs used in this breakdown correspond to the second row in table 1 along with an electric energy unit cost k e l of 0 1 kwhel in all designs the surfaces constitute the largest contribution to the capital cost fig 9b in designs d1 to d3 the thermal energy consumption cost dominates the electric energy consumption cost in these designs the optimizer is preheating the brine which increases the thermal energy consumption in these designs the capital costs of surfaces and fans are significantly lower than those in the other designs because fewer evaporation surfaces are required because designs d4 to d6 belong to the all electric mode thermal energy consumption is zero and all energy consumption is electric leading to similar results for different cost ratios the capital cost of the surfaces and fans is significantly higher than those in the first three designs because more evaporation modules are needed the discussed cee system designs illustrate the wide range of potential specific footprint area 0 072 m2 per m3 to 1 8 m2 per m3 and demonstrate the modularity of cee the trade off between footprint area and the corresponding total cost allows decision makers to design their system based on their local site requirements which may include available space total specific cost targets and availability and cost of electric and thermal energy 4 6 comparison to other technologies fig 10a shows energy use comparison between cee and other brine concentration technologies studied in the literature the cee system is represented by three distinct designs at different specific footprint areas d3 d5 d6 at an energy cost ratio r 2 0 25 d5 and d6 of footprint areas of 1 8 and 1 m2 m3 respectively operate in all electric mode and d3 with footprint areas of 0 4 m2 m3 operates in heating mode it should be noted that the energy and gir values reported for cee are calculated based on the volume of water evaporated as cee does not include a water recovery unit in its current configuration additionally both gir and gor by definition are calculated using thermal energy consumption only the technologies shown in fig 10a are ro thiel et al 2015 mechanical vapor compression mvc thiel et al 2015 3 effect mee thiel et al 2015 humidification dehumidification hdh minier matar et al 2016 xu et al 2013 forward osmosis fo kolliopoulos et al 2018 mcginnis et al 2013 and membrane distillation md thiel et al 2015 cee design d3 consumes significantly less thermal energy than other thermal technologies mee hdh fo md but more electric energy in the present cee system the length of the evaporation surfaces was selected such that the temperature of the non evaporated brine leaves the surfaces at a temperature close to ambient temperature liquid loses heat by evaporation more discussion are found in kaddoura et al 2021 this allows the system to take advantage of most of the heat added to the liquid maximizing evaporation and resulting in higher gained input ratio gir the 3 effect mee represents a small scale system similar to ones targeted in this study mee is expected to have high thermal energy use at this size scale as mee aims to recover the latent heat of vaporization after each stage making it energy efficient only at large scale fo recovers its draw solution via a thermal decomposition process which requires operating temperature ranging from 60 c to 190 c which significantly increases its thermal energy use mcginnis and elimelech 2007 similarly the operating temperatures reported in hdh process was around 80 c with no process optimization lower thermal energy use makes the gor of hdh higher than that of fo finally md is based on a transmembrane evaporation process that consumes a significant amount of thermal energy in it current configuration which decreases its gor the technology is under development and better energy performance is expected in the future banat et al 2007 moreover it is observed that cee designs d6 and d5 consume less or equal electric energy and at a smaller footprint area compared to ro and mvc it is to be noted that all other technologies reported can recover water while cee can not in its current configuration this could justifies the higher energy requirement by other technologies for example mvc uses an electric compressor to recover water vapor which increases its energy use a condensing unit could be incorporating into a cee system to recover the evaporated water in this case the system should also be optimized to minimize the specific entropy generation for the cycle which will results in peak gor mistry et al 2010 more discussion on second law efficiency is available in mistry et al 2010 narayan et al 2010a thiel et al 2015 two commercially available brine evaporators concentrators that use concepts and configurations similar to cee are manufactured by saltworks inc www saltworkstech com in canada and by altela inc in new mexico usa beckman 2008 fig 10b shows a comparison between cee and the two other technologies in terms of energy consumption footprint area and total cost of evaporated volume the values shown in the fig 10b for altela inc are from a pilot plant constructed in phoenix arizona beckman 2008 while the values for saltworks are those reported in the datasheet offered by the manufacturer saltworks evaporator has the highest footprint area 3 m2 per m3 which is 7 5 times larger than that of cee of specific footprint area of 0 4 m2 m3 and has significantly higher energy use also saltworks footprint is 1 6 times larger than cee of specific footprint area of 1 8 m2 m3 and has 5 times larger thermal input but about half electric energy use cost data for the saltworks system is not available in the literature so the the comparison is limited to energy consumption and footprint area the cost estimation used by altela evaporator assumes thermal energy cost of 0 027 kwhth and electric energy of 0 1 kwhel beckman 2008 which is equivalent to an energy cost ratio of r 2 0 27 reported values by altela are therefore compared to the cee results at energy cost ratio r 2 0 25 at an equal specific footprint area 1 m2 m3 to ensure a fair comparison cee cost 1 6 m3 is 4 times less than altela cost 6 4 m3 cee electric energy use 10 kwhel m3 is slightly higher than that of altela 7 6 kwhel m3 and cee has zero thermal energy input while altela requires significant amount 202 kwhth m3 these comparisons indicate the potentials of the optimized cee system to have an improved energetic and economic performance over existing technology note that the cee results assumes non saline liquid while altela considered salinity of 45 g kg kaddoura et al kaddoura et al 2021 reported an approximate 5 decrease in evaporation rate at liquid salinity of 45 g kg which would increases the reported cost and energy consumption of the optimal cee designs in this work by an equivalent percentage more discussion in section 4 8 yet the reported values for the optimized cee are still favorable compared to those reported by altela and saltworks the cee costs presented do depend on the assumed material cost ratio a lower material cost ratio r 1 would result in a lower total cost cee system and vice versa 4 7 effect of climate conditions various climate conditions according to the k o ppen geiger climate type classification system kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 are used as parameters in the optimization possible climate types are divided into 4 categories tropical a arid b temperate c and cold d and polar e polar climate is not taken into consideration in this study due to scarce data available and due to probable freezing of fluid flow one representative city is selected for each climate and the temperature and humidity of the ambient air in each city are defined by the design conditions given by ashrae ashrae 2017 and listed in table 5 fig 11 shows the evaporation performance and the optimization results for 11 distinct climatic conditions it is noted that climates with the highest evaporation rate per surface result in the lowest total cost and footprint area this is because fewer evaporation surfaces are needed to reach the evaporation rate target arid dessert bwh semi arid bsk and oceanic cfb climates resulted in the best performance for cee with lowest total cost and footprint area due to low ambient humidity while mediterranean hot summer csa and tropical af climates result in lower performance due to high humidity which limits the evaporation however all considered climates result in potentials of low total cost less than 1 m3 per kwhel with small footprint area less than 1 3 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume 4 8 effect of liquid salinity the results reported throughout this study correspond to the simulation of zero salinity liquid as a reference case which can be employed to predict the associated costs for distinct salinity values fig 12 shows the effect of liquid salinity on the evaporation rate at three unique temperature differences as salinity increases the evaporation rate relative to the zero salinity case decreases this is to be expected due to the reduction in latent heat of vaporization associated with salinity increase eq b 2 sharqawy et al 2010 at temperature difference of 0 c the evaporation rate decreases by 13 as salinity is increased to 100 g kg and by 23 at salinity of 180 g kg as temperature difference increases to 70 c the negative effect of salinity becomes smaller with the largest decrease in evaporation rate is 10 at salinity of 180 g kg achieving the targeted evaporation rate per day is accomplished by the optimization constraint eq 31 so the decrease in the evaporation performance due to salinity increase will be reflected in the cee system as an increase in the number of surfaces required because the number of surfaces required is inversely proportional to the evaporation rate per surface eq 22 on the other hand the normalized capital and operating costs are directly proportional to number of surfaces eqs 15 and 20 respectively therefore the increase in brine salinity will both decrease the evaporation rate and increase the capital and operating costs at similar rates this in turns will reduce the gained input ratio gir due to the greater heat input required 5 conclusion multi objective optimization of a cee system is presented with the goal of achieving a cost optimal design and operation cee systems represent a modular brine volume reduction method for decentralized desalination plants and small industrial processes a method for formulating objective functions as cost ratios instead of absolute costs for mixed thermal and electric energy water treatment systems is presented the costs of cee are normalized to generalize the results of the study to distinct locations and applications with varying material thermal and electric energy costs two operation modes were characterized the all electric mode corresponds to a lower total specific cost ranging from 1 4 10 to 5 10 m3 per kwhel and higher footprint area ranging from 0 5 to 1 8 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume the heating mode corresponds to a higher total specific cost up to 6 5 10 m3 per kwhel at low energy cost ratios a compact footprint area ranging from 0 072 to 0 5 m2 per m3 of evaporated volume is achieved this facilitates the possibility of designing cee over a wide range of footprint areas with the heating mode being considered for designs limited by the available space it is observed that the operating cost dominates the capital cost of cee which makes the design a compromise between total cost driven by operating cost and the footprint area the material cost is dominated by the cost of evaporation surfaces illustrating the need for low cost evaporation surfaces at a material cost ratio of 13 kwhel surface a normalized total cost of 0 6 10 m3 per kwhel can be achieved which is equivalent to 0 6 m3 at an electric energy unit cost of 0 1 kwhel certain cee designs were found to have lower predicted total cost energy consumption and footprint areas than those of commercially available evaporators these factors encourage continued investigation of cee technology as it is expected to be applicable in different climates the results obtained in this study are based on simplifying assumptions that need to be explored in future work first the operating cost is calculated as a function of energy cost only while maintenance costs are neglected due to the simple construction of the device physical pilot plants will help inform the inclusion of these costs second results in sections 4 1 to 4 6 assume static weather conditions as listed in table 4 future work should include real time optimization and control of the operating settings as a function of hourly variation in ambient conditions third the liquid simulated in this study is a non saline water as a reference case even with these limitations the figures in this work provide guidance on cee design that are generalizable to scenarios where material and energy costs

model assumptions the presented performance model in section 3 1 was developed based on the following assumptions for heat and mass transfer modeling kaddoura et al 2021 1 steady state one dimensional heat and mass transfer 2 heat and mass are transferred in the direction normal to the evaporation surface diffusion of heat and vapor in the x direction is neglected 3 fully developed flow is considered viscous dissipation and spatial variations in pressure are neglected 4 the evaporation surface is entirely wetted by the liquid film 5 liquid film is thin so the thermal resistance on the liquid side is negligible as a result the local temperature of the liquid gas interface is assumed equal to the local temperature of the liquid 6 air at the interface is saturated at the local liquid temperature 7 air is treated as an ideal gas 8 all phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium and homogeneous flow is assumed 9 the simulated liquid is water as a reference performance case the effect of

15928,the photochemical reactivity of dissolved organic carbon from biochar dbc was higher than dissolved organic matter dom but the photo transformation of dbc in the presence of dom under various conditions are poorly understood here we studied the effects of ca2 and ph on the photo induced changes in the optical and structural properties of dom in source water with biochar during dbc photobleaching the dbc released from bulk dbc while the humic like component formed the release of dbc and the formation of humic like component were inhibited by the presence of ca2 attributed to the inhibition of triplet excited state of dom 3dom and singlet oxygen 1o2 generation moreover the 3dom yield increased while the 1o2 generation decreased as ph decreased from neutral resulting in the increased formation of humic like component and decreased release of dbc the characterizations of ultrafiltration isolated colloidal dom after irradiation showed that hydrophilicity and the colloidal size of released dbc decreased in the presence of ca2 additionally the colloidal size of released dbc decreased while the hydrophilicity of dbc enhanced with increasing ph from neutral this study not only gives insight into the dbc photo transformation in the presence of dom under various conditions but also reveals the influence of dbc on the variation of dom properties during irradiation graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source water dissolved biochar photoreaction ca2 humic like component 1 introduction biochar is a quantitatively significant by product of incomplete combustion of terrestrial organic carbon roebuck et al 2018 wagner et al 2019 the water soluble fraction of biochar is the dissolved organic carbon from biochar dbc it has the higher photochemical reactivity compared with dissolved organic matter dom and makes the light absorption of dom increased therefore the presence of dbc would induce a great change in the formation and yields of reactive species such as triplet excited state of dom 3dom and singlet oxygen 1o2 in surface water chen et al 2020 black carbon such as soot could release dbc into the aqueous phase in the absence of dom during photoreactions li et al 2019 but since the dom is the important absorber of light radiation in surface water it is necessary to study the dbc transformation in the presence of dom during photoreactions sharpless et al 2014 however it has not been well recognized and the effects of ca2 and ph on it still remain poorly understood the photochemistry of dbc was found to be important in its transformation because the fused ring cores of dbc make it easily absorb solar light to result in photochemical reactions berg et al 2019 maizel et al 2017 walpen et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 furthermore dbc has small fused aromatic clusters extensively substituted with polar functional groups mainly carboxylic and phenolic groups which may lead to strong photoreactivity li et al 2019 the aromatic and methyl moieties of dbc would be transformed to ch2 ch c and carboxyl ester quinone functional groups in the photoreactions fu et al 2016 the reactive species such as triplet excited state of dbc 3dbc has much higher apparent quantum yields than the triplet excited state of nom 3nom for one electron transfer reactions wang et al 2020 moreover the natural organic matter nom in source water may alter the photochemical activity of dbc in particular affecting the electron transfer process aeschbacher et al 2012 li et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 since the transformation of dom was affected by the reactive species such as 3dom and 1o2 remucal et al 2020 the presence of dbc would make a great impact on the photo transformation of dom the calcium ion ca2 is a naturally abundant cation in drinking water sources and could form complexes with carboxyl groups of dbc resulting in decreased hydrophilicity through bridging effect furthermore the complexation capacity of cations with dom was positively correlated with the quenching of the 3dom wan et al 2019 the generation of 3dom could be influenced by the solution ph chen et al 2018 and the change in the structure of phenolic compounds was dependent on the solution ph pace et al 2012 in addition the generation of other reactive species such as 1o2 from 3dom through electron transfer would also be affected by ca2 and ph however the effect of ca2 and ph on the dom photo transformation in the presence of dbc has not yet been investigated in contrast to the solid phase extraction or xad resins for compositional and structural dom fractionation requiring the acidification of natural waters the ultrafiltration isolated dom is based on physical separation without chemical alteration to the dom lin and guo 2020 the ultrafiltration could be applied to provide new insights into the dbc transformation independently from humic substances in dom it is because the dbc has a size ranging from several to hundred nanometers chen et al 2020 uzun et al 2020 and the molecular size of humic substances in source water is less than 100 kda yang et al 2018 thus the dbc before and after irradiation were filtrated by the 100 kda membrane to elucidate the transformation of dbc size and hydrophilic hydrophobic property through studying the variations in filtration efficiency and the structural property of the membrane the main objectives of this study were as follows i investigate the effects of ca2 and ph on the photoreaction induced optical variations of dom with dbc ii probe into their impacts on the structural characteristics of the dom iii examine their influences on the variations of photo transformed dbc this work is imperative for properly understanding the effects of ca2 and ph on the photo transformation of dom in the presence of dbc 2 materials and methods 2 1 source water and dbc the source water is obtained from the river jingmi jm which is a drinking water source for beijing china during the summer of 2020 and were prefiltered with a 0 45 µm filter membrane dow chemical usa to remove any natural colloids the filtered water was stored in glass bottles at 4 c in the dark since nom is the main composition of source water the doc of source water is called nom pinewood sawdust harbin heilongjiang province china was selected as the raw material for black carbon production prior to use the pinewood was washed with deionized di water for several times to remove surface impurities and oven dried at 80 c then it was passed through a 100 mesh sieve finally the powder was fed into a tube furnace gsl 1100x kejin co ltd hefei china and slowly pyrolyzed 10 c min at 500 c for 2 h under continuous n2 flow to maintain an oxygen limited conditions the obtained bc was ground sieved through a 150 μm mesh the fresh carbon black was immersed in di water at a ratio of 1 500 w v and stirred for 48 h then sonicated in a bath sonicator at 100 w for 1 h to make dbc completely leached the obtained suspension was filtered with 0 2 µm cellulose acetate membrane to model dbc solution finally the dbc was diluted by di water to make its doc same as that of jingmi river sample 11 0 mg l the dissolved organic carbon from biochar is noted as dbc the dbc was filtrated by the 0 1 µm membrane to obtain the nano sized bc with the size less than 100 nm some water quality parameters are given in table s1 nom and dbc were negatively charged with ζ potential values of 4 31 0 16 mv and 18 1 0 2 mv at ph 8 3 respectively since the nom and dbc were prepared by the 0 45 µm and 0 22 µm membranes filtration respectively there is no microorganism in samples therefore the effect of microorganism could be omitted in the experiment under the conditions of acidic alkaline and neural before and after irradiation 2 2 irradiation experiments all irradiation experiments were conducted under defined laboratory conditions using a solar simulator cel pe300e 3a ceaulight beijing china equipped with a 300w xe lamp without light filters which was calibrated to a light intensity of 100 mw cm2 on water surface the full spectrum of solar simulator and analytical methods were shown in figure s1 and text s2 respectively irradiation experiments were conducted with an uncovered glass beaker containing 90 ml of solution solution depth 1 8 cm in the air or anaerobic atmosphere through nitrogen gas n2 sparging and the solution was stirred at 400 rpm to ensure uniform light exposure the photochemical reactor was equipped with a water circulating jacket for temperature control which was maintained at 25 0 1 c the exposure time for irradiation is 4 hours the impact of dbc on the dom photo transformation was studied through changing the dbc content 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 in jm the studies on dom and dbc photo transformation were conducted using jm and di water with different dbc content 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 at various ph values respectively to study the effect of calcium ion cacl2 was spiked into samples giving ca2 concentration of 1 15 mm the initial solution ph before irradiation was adjusted to various values 8 3 7 2 6 3 5 3 and 4 2 by 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh to detect the impact of the ph on the dom photo transformation as shown in figure s2 the fluorescent components were extracted from the excitation emission matrix eem datasets based on the parallel factor analysis parafac modeling as shown in text s3 the s275 295 and s350 400 were calculated through measuring uv visible light absorbance of samples specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg c m is the absorbance per unit carbon and the absorption coefficient at 254 nm divided by doc concentration the number of suva254 is associated with the aromatic content the variations of s275 295 s350 400 suva254 and fluorescence intensity of major fluorescence components were calculated to analyze the change of dom molecular characteristics after irradiation 2 3 data analysis spearman s correlation analysis tukey s multiple comparison tests and principal component analysis pca were performed using r to compare the relationship and the difference between the variations of various indexes for individual control treatment pairs optical indices were extracted from absorbance and fluorescence data using matlab r2019a mathworks the 3dom and 1o2 were detected to analyze the variations of 3dom and 1o2 during irradiation text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 pristine dbc and nom characterization the components of the samples were characterized using fluorescent spectroscopy from figure s2 and s3 the primary and secondary fluorescence peaks at 300 340 nm in component 1 c1 are categorized as tyrosine like substance trubetskoj et al 2018 component 2 c2 with characteristic peaks at 350 420 nm could be assigned to humic substances originated from terrestrial environment and possibly reprocessed by microorganisms mladenov et al 2011 component 3 c3 presents a fluorescence peak at the excitation emission wavelength ex em of 270 320 330 nm which is attributed to tryptophan like substance mladenov et al 2011 the tyrosine like substance and tryptophan like substance are classified as protein like component from table s2 there was much higher content of humic like component for nom than for dbc but the c1 content of dbc was much more than that of nom furthermore the s275 295 of nano sized bc is much higher than the s350 400 suggesting that the s350 400 would decrease while the s275 295 would increase in the process of dbc dissolution the contents of c1 and c3 and the intensity of c2 for nano sized bc are similar with those for dbc indicating that those would not be influenced by the dbc dissolution from table s4 as the ph varied in the range of 4 2 to 8 3 before irradiation the intensity differences of various fluorescence components for 10 dbc in the presence of nom are generally minor it verified that the ph would make little influence on the fluorescence properties for samples in dark 3 2 the variation of dom optical properties during irradiation from figure 1 a the pc1 axis described 48 9 of the variation in the species composition while the pc2 axis described 35 8 of the variation thus the two axes were responsible for 84 7 of the variation in the dataset the samples were mainly distributed around suva254 in dark which indicated the suva254 were strongly correlated with the samples before irradiation it verified the variation of suva254 was impacted significantly by the irradiation furthermore the irradiated samples were clustered near c2 illustrating the impact of irradiation on c2 was the greatest compared with other variables therefore tukey s multiple comparison tests were performed to compare the difference between the means of the suva254 and c2 for individual control treatment pairs figures 1b and 1c after irradiation the suva254 decreased greatly suggesting the aromaticity of dbc decreased it was because compared with nom dbc with condensed aromatics is more susceptible to partial photodegradation through ring cleavage wang et al 2020 in addition the c2 increased significantly after irradiation indicating that humic like component generated during dbc photobleaching it might be because the phenolic compounds with electron donating capacity edc could be transformed by 3dbc leading to the formation of the phenoxyl radical pho which could undergo dimerization during dbc photobleaching berto et al 2018 janssen et al 2014 remucal et al 2020 vione et al 2019 wang et al 2020 as shown in figure s4 a f the variations of suva254 and humic like component for samples at various dbc content with and without ca2 and 10 dbc at different ph values were much lower in the absence of nom than in the presence of nom after irradiation it indicated that the dbc photobleaching and humic like component formation were promoted by nom during photochemical reaction due to the increased light absorbance since there is a difference in photochemical reactivity between nano sized bc with size smaller than 100 nm and bulk dbc the photo transformation of nano sized bc in the presence of nom was also studied from figure s4d and h the variation of optical properties for nano sized bc is lower than that for dbc suggesting that the photochemical reactivity of nano sized bc is much lower than bulk dbc 3 3 the effect of ca2 and ph on the variation of dom optical properties from figure 2 a the relationship coefficient between suva254 and s275 295 0 62 was much less than that between suva254 and s350 400 0 02 indicating the aromaticity and molecular weight of s275 295 were much lower than those of s350 400 furthermore as the content of dbc increased from 0 to 10 the variation of s275 295 increased while that of s350 400 decreased which is parallel to a continued decrease of suva254 variation figure s4d and the increased decline extent of average hydrodynamic diameter after irradiation figure s5a these suggested that small molecules released from large molecules during dbc photobleaching li et al 2020a the variations of s275 295 and s350 400 for dbc without nom were less than those for dbc with nom figure s4a and d indicating the release of small molecules was promoted by nom the c1 content of dbc was much more than that of nom table s2 and c1 was negatively correlated with s350 400 0 96 indicating the small molecules released from bulk dbc after irradiation moreover the c3 intensity of nom was larger than that of dbc and the c3 was positively correlated with s350 400 0 82 and s275 295 0 90 suggesting the small and large molecules generated figure 1c presents the c2 increased after irradiation and the c2 content related negatively with the suva254 0 84 it indicated the dimerization of phenolic compounds was in accompany with the photobleaching of dbc in comparison to that without ca2 addition the variation of suva254 decreased more slightly with increasing dbc content after ca2 addition figure s4e and there was no statistically great difference of suva254 between before and after light irradiation figure 1b figure 2b presented that the absolute coefficient values of c1 and s350 400 c3 and s350 400 are less in the presence of ca2 than that in the absence of ca2 the decline extent of average hydrodynamic diameter for samples with ca2 is less than that without ca2 with the dbc content increasing figure s5b these indicated the presence of ca2 made the dbc photobleaching inhibited furthermore s275 295 and s350 400 decreased at the lower dbc content while the s275 295 increased and s350 400 decreased at the higher dbc content figure s4b illustrating that the inhibitory effect of dbc photobleaching by ca2 alleviated with increasing dbc content the variation of c2 was less than that without ca2 addition figure s4e and figure 1c presents that in contrast to that without ca2 addition the c2 increased slightly after ca2 addition moreover the absolute coefficient value of suva254 and c2 0 72 was less than that without ca2 addition these suggested the dimerization of phenolic compounds was inhibited after ca2 addition from figures 1b and 1c there were large differences of suva254 and c2 between before and after light irradiation with varying ph indicating that the variations of the aromaticity and humic like component were affected greatly by ph from figure 2c the relationship coefficients of c1 and s275 295 c1 and s350 400 were 0 88 and 0 76 respectively suggesting the release of small molecules from bulk dbc furthermore the suva254 was positively and negatively related with s350 400 and s275 295 respectively which was due to the photobleaching of dbc from figure s4c the variation of suva254 reached the lowest and the highest at ph 5 3 and 8 3 respectively indicating the photobleaching efficiency was the lowest and the highest at ph 5 3 and 8 3 it might be because the molecular structures of dom are elongated in alkaline solution to facilitate light absorption pace et al 2012 moreover the carboxylic groups of dom were mostly not deprotonated to make the configuration of dom compact via hydrogen bonding resulting in the lowest light absorption of dom at ph 5 3 pace et al 2012 from figure 2c the relationship coefficients between c2 and s275 295 s350 400 suva254 c1 were 0 88 0 78 0 76 and 0 95 respectively it indicated the dimerization process was positively related with the photobleaching the variation of humic like component was the highest at 8 3 figure s4f indicating the dimerization of phenolic compounds was promoted under alkaline condition it might be because the phenolic compounds in nom are deprotonated and become much better electron donors than their neutral forms pace et al 2012 the figure s4g showed that there was little variation in optical properties for nom at various ph suggesting the presence of dbc was responsible for the variation of optical properties for 10 dbc at various ph values 3 4 the variation of structural characteristics during irradiation from figure 3 the xps c1 c2 c3 and c4 peaks at about 285 0 285 6 288 0 and 289 5 binding energy ev were assigned to c h or c c c o or o c o and o c o groups respectively furthermore the xps o1 and o2 peaks at 532 3 and 532 6 ev were attributed to c o and c o groups respectively as shown in figure 3a and table 1 the intensities and atomic percent at of c2 c3 and c4 decreased greatly after irradiation in anaerobic atmosphere indicating the nom photosensitizing chromophores were selectively destructed during photobleaching process sharpless et al 2014 additionally the intensity of c2 and c2 c3 ratio decreased greatly while the intensity of o1 and the o1 o2 increased it indicated that the c o group of the phenolic compound was reduced to c o group of the quinone compound by 3dbc and the o c o group generated due to the dimerization of phenolic compounds the c o ratio increased after irradiation table 1 and the semicircle radius of the sample at ph 8 3 after irradiation was larger than that before irradiation figure s9 it indicated that the mediated electron transfer by quinone groups and direct electron transfer by the graphitic structures decreased due to the decomposition of condensed aromatics in dbc which was more susceptible to photodegradation than nom jing et al 2020 moreover the o1 o2 ratio increased slightly due to the oxidation of c o group for the quinone compound by 1o2 the decrease of c4 intensity was attributed to the further destruction of the nom chromophores during photobleaching process sharpless et al 2014 3 5 impacts of ca2 and ph on the variation of structural characteristics the effects of irradiation ca2 and ph on functional groups of dom were studied by comparing the ftir spectra in the air or anaerobic atmosphere the bands at 3400 cm 1 2900 cm 1 1050 and 1150 cm 1 were assigned to o h aliphatic c h c o and ether link c o c groups respectively laszakovits et al 2020 from figure s6 the intensity ratio of c o band to c o c band decreased after irradiation for nom and dbc it was because the pho and dbc derived reducing intermediates dbc were formed via the electron transfer reaction of phenolic compounds with 3dbc and underwent self coupling to form phenol oligomers wan et al 2021 moreover the intensity of aliphatic c h stretching vibrations for dbc was much greater than that for nom after irradiation due to the release of dbc it was because dbc had more c h groups than nom due to the cleavage of alkyl linkages in pyrolized lignin song et al 2021 from figure 4 a the intensity ratios of the aliphatic c h to bonded o h group for samples at various dbc contents were larger in air atmosphere than in anaerobic atmosphere after irradiation indicating the released dbc increased in the presence of o2 xu et al 2017 furthermore the intensity ratios of c o band to c o c band decreased after irradiation in anaerobic atmosphere attributed to the dimerization of phenolic compounds from figure s7a there was no obvious difference for suva254 between before and after irradiation in the anaerobic atmosphere suggesting the photobleaching of dbc was inhibited figure s7b shows the c2 variations for samples were higher in the anaerobic atmosphere than that in the air atmosphere after irradiation the 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp was employed as a probe molecule to investigate the electron transfer of 3dbc the degradation rate constant k of tmp ktmp was calculated through the fit of experiment data to a pseudo first order model and positively related to the quantum yields of the 3dbc formation therefore it is very important for analyzing the generation of 3dbc by using ktmp during irradiation the ktmp was greater in anaerobic atmosphere than that in air atmosphere figure s8a these indicated that the 3dbc was not quenched in the absence of o2 therefore the dimerization of phenolic compounds was promoted and the dbc photooxidation by 1o2 was inhibited figure 4b presents that the intensity ratio of c h group to the o h group increased with increasing dbc content in the presence of ca2 after irradiation and it was less than that in the absence of ca2 its difference between the absence and the presence of ca2 decreased as the dbc increased it suggested that the dbc release was inhibited by ca2 and the inhibitory effect of dbc release by ca2 was alleviated at higher dbc content the intensity ratio of c o to the ether link c o c increased after irradiation with increasing dbc content due to the increased release of dbc with high ratio of c o to the c o c it covered the decreased intensity ratio of c o to the c o c due to the increased c2 at higher dbc content while it was obvious at lower dbc content due to the inhibitory effect of ca2 on dbc release compared with the absence of ca2 the ktmp decreased in the presence of ca2 which was in accordance with the above result that the photobleaching efficiency of dbc was inhibited by the ca2 it might be because the generated reactive species quenched due to the complexation of ca2 with dbc wan et al 2019 as shown in figure 4c there was little difference in the relative distribution of c h and o h groups at various ph values it was because both of dbc and nom contained the cooh group which could be deprotonated at all the ph and the amount of deprotonated cooh increased with the ph increasing the intensity ratio of c h to the o h group reached the highest at ph 7 2 indicating the largest amount of dbc released from bulk dbc moreover the intensity ratio of c o to the ether link c o c at ph 7 3 was much greater than those at other ph values due to the lowest efficiency of phenolic compounds dimerization from figure s8b the ktmp value increased as the ph decreased from 7 2 to 4 2 indicating the 3dbc increased with decreasing ph from neutral furthermore the kffa decreased with decreasing ph from neutral and the difference between the presence and the absence of nom became larger with the increasing ph indicating the 1o2 generation was promoted by the presence of nom figure s8c 3 6 the tem evidence of dbc transformation induced by light irradiation as shown in figure 5 a1 and 5b1 the products of dbc before and after irradiation with the addition of ca2 were carefully studied with a transmission electron microscope tem in order to provide direct evidence of dbc photo transformation eds spectra of a6 and b6 were obtained based on the element mapping of samples presented in a2 a3 a4 and b2 b3 b4 respectively the block shaped substance with the edge of the thin layer substance were observed in tem of the dbc before and after irradiation the selected region of a1 and b1 were observed by high resolution tem and were shown in figures a5 and b5 respectively compared with the sample before irradiation the sample after irradiation was composed of weaker lattice structures furthermore the thin layer regions of a and b were denoted in figure a5 and b5 respectively which included short c layers forming an amorphous structure after irradiation the sample appeared to show a decrease in amorphous structures amorphous carbon structures caused both a high inner resistance and an energy barrier that limited electron transfers through carbon matrices to the surface of dbc sun et al 2017 figure s9 showed that the semicircle radius of the sample at ph 8 3 in the presence of ca2 after irradiation was less than that before irradiation it suggested the transition from a mediated electron transfer by quinone groups to a direct electron transfer dominated by the carbon matrices as a result of greater graphitic structures with higher c o figure a6 and b6 sun et al 2017 it also verified the decomposition of dbc was inhibited by ca2 3 7 effects of ca2 and ph on the photo transformation of dbc through ultrafiltration the samples before and after irradiation were filtrated by ultrafiltration membrane to study effects of ca2 and ph on the dbc release during irradiation because most of humic acid with the molecular weight of less than 30k da could not be removed by the ultrafiltration while most of dbc with the average hydrodynamic diameter greater than 10 nm would be filtrated by the ultrafiltration membrane therefore the dbc release could be studied by the ultrafiltration independently from humic acid as shown in figure 6 a compared with other components the removal rate of tyrosine like component was the highest suggesting a large part of dbc was removed because the tyrosine like component content of dbc was larger than that of nom from figure s10a toc concentration of ultrafiltration effluent was stable with increasing dbc content before irradiation indicating that most of dbc could be filtrated by ultrafiltration membrane as seen in figure 6d as dbc content increased the o h band at around 3300 cm 1 assigned to phenolic o h stretching and o h from carbohydrates increased after irradiation furthermore the flux decreased greatly after irradiation and the suva254 variation of filtrate enhanced figure s11a due to the release and the photobleaching of dbc during irradiation these indicated the released dbc was more hydrophilic than bulk dbc and increased with increasing dbc content from figure s12a the surface charge decreased with increasing dbc content after irradiation due to the dimerization of phenolic compounds and the photobleaching of dbc the removal efficiencies of tyrosine like and tryptophan like components decreased with increasing dbc content indicating that the size of released dbc decreased as the dbc content increased from figure 6b the removal rates of tyrosine like and tryptophan like components after irradiation in the presence of ca2 were higher than those in the absence of ca2 figure s10b showed that the effluent toc concentration with ca2 was similar with that without ca2 before irradiation suggesting the ultrafiltration performance of dbc was influenced slightly by the addition of ca2 prior to irradiation furthermore the flux decreased slightly and then greatly as the dbc content increased figure s11b and the zeta potential increased slightly figure s12b after irradiation in the presence of ca2 these indicated that the release of dbc was inhibited by ca2 and the inhibitory effect of ca2 was alleviated at higher dbc content the suva254 variation of filtrate in the presence of ca2 was less than that in the absence of ca2 from figure 6e as the dbc content increased from 0 to 5 in the presence of ca2 the intensities of the o h band decreased after irradiation which were much less than those without ca2 addition these were correlated with the decreased photobleaching efficiency in conjunction with the decrease of dbc release from figure s13 the membrane fouling was mitigated by the ca2 addition at various dbc contents compared with no ca2 addition from figure 6c the removal efficiencies of tryrosine like and tryptophan like components at ph 5 3 were the highest the semicircle radius of the sample at ph 5 3 in the presence of ca2 after irradiation was much less than that before irradiation figure s9 indicating the light induced decomposition of quinone groups and graphitic structures was significantly inhibited at ph 5 3 the figure s10c presented that toc concentration was very stable with decreasing ph before irradiation illustrating the ultrafiltration of dbc was not affected by varying ph furthermore the flux decline and the suva254 variation of filtrate reached the lowest figure s11c and the zeta potential was the largest figure s12c these indicated the release and photobleaching of dbc were significantly inhibited at ph 5 3 figure 6f presents that there is a big increase in the intensity of o h band after irradiation at ph 6 3 illustrating the improved hydrophilicity of the dom surface in contrast to ph 6 3 the intensity of o h band decreased greatly at ph 5 3 after irradiation due to the least release of dbc from figure s12c the dom aggregated via hydrogen bonding of the carboxylic groups at ph 5 3 to make the surface charge reach the lowest before the irradiation moreover the surface charge was largest and the decline extent in surface charge was the smallest at ph 6 3 after irradiation due to the least dimerization of phenolic compounds and photobleaching of dbc 3 8 the influential mechanism of ca2 and ph figure 7 shows the influential mechanism of ca2 and ph on the dimerization of phenolic compounds and the photobleaching of dbc absorption of sunlight by dbc leads to the formation of 3dbc which makes the dimerization of phenolic compounds to form the humic like component moreover the 3dbc could react with dissolved oxygen to form 1o2 resulting in the decomposition of dbc during the decomposition of dbc the ratio of carbon to oxygen increased and graphitic structures decomposed the 3dbc was quenched by ca2 and increased with the decreasing ph resulting in the less and more humic like component formation respectively furthermore the ca2 inhibit the generation of 1o2 to make the less dbc released and the 1o2 generation decreased as ph decreased from neutral resulting in the decreased decomposition of dbc future studies could investigate the impacts of other factors on dom transformation of source water with biochar 4 conclusion dbc is more susceptible to partial degradation through ring cleavage to make its aromaticity decreased and the phenolic compounds could undergo dimerization to form the humic like component during irradiation the dimerization of phenolic compounds was inhibited after ca2 addition and the photobleaching efficiency was the lowest at ph 5 3 the inhibitory effect of dbc release by ca2 was alleviated at higher dbc content and the intensity ratio of c o to the ether link c o c in neutral ph was much greater than those at other ph values due to the lowest efficiency of phenolic compounds dimerization tem showed that compared with the sample before irradiation the sample was composed of weaker lattice structures and appeared to show a decrease in amorphous structures after irradiation the filtration experiment by ultrafiltration membrane showed the inhibitory effect of ca2 was alleviated at higher dbc content and the release and photobleaching of dbc were significantly inhibited at ph 5 3 to our knowledge this is the first report of the impacts of solution properties on the dbc phototransformation in the presence of dom allowing us to distinguish the influential factors the study can provide the new insights into the source water management and the water treatment the membrane fouling caused by the release of dbc during the photoreaction could be alleviated

15928,the photochemical reactivity of dissolved organic carbon from biochar dbc was higher than dissolved organic matter dom but the photo transformation of dbc in the presence of dom under various conditions are poorly understood here we studied the effects of ca2 and ph on the photo induced changes in the optical and structural properties of dom in source water with biochar during dbc photobleaching the dbc released from bulk dbc while the humic like component formed the release of dbc and the formation of humic like component were inhibited by the presence of ca2 attributed to the inhibition of triplet excited state of dom 3dom and singlet oxygen 1o2 generation moreover the 3dom yield increased while the 1o2 generation decreased as ph decreased from neutral resulting in the increased formation of humic like component and decreased release of dbc the characterizations of ultrafiltration isolated colloidal dom after irradiation showed that hydrophilicity and the colloidal size of released dbc decreased in the presence of ca2 additionally the colloidal size of released dbc decreased while the hydrophilicity of dbc enhanced with increasing ph from neutral this study not only gives insight into the dbc photo transformation in the presence of dom under various conditions but also reveals the influence of dbc on the variation of dom properties during irradiation graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source water dissolved biochar photoreaction ca2 humic like component 1 introduction biochar is a quantitatively significant by product of incomplete combustion of terrestrial organic carbon roebuck et al 2018 wagner et al 2019 the water soluble fraction of biochar is the dissolved organic carbon from biochar dbc it has the higher photochemical reactivity compared with dissolved organic matter dom and makes the light absorption of dom increased therefore the presence of dbc would induce a great change in the formation and yields of reactive species such as triplet excited state of dom 3dom and singlet oxygen 1o2 in surface water chen et al 2020 black carbon such as soot could release dbc into the aqueous phase in the absence of dom during photoreactions li et al 2019 but since the dom is the important absorber of light radiation in surface water it is necessary to study the dbc transformation in the presence of dom during photoreactions sharpless et al 2014 however it has not been well recognized and the effects of ca2 and ph on it still remain poorly understood the photochemistry of dbc was found to be important in its transformation because the fused ring cores of dbc make it easily absorb solar light to result in photochemical reactions berg et al 2019 maizel et al 2017 walpen et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 furthermore dbc has small fused aromatic clusters extensively substituted with polar functional groups mainly carboxylic and phenolic groups which may lead to strong photoreactivity li et al 2019 the aromatic and methyl moieties of dbc would be transformed to ch2 ch c and carboxyl ester quinone functional groups in the photoreactions fu et al 2016 the reactive species such as triplet excited state of dbc 3dbc has much higher apparent quantum yields than the triplet excited state of nom 3nom for one electron transfer reactions wang et al 2020 moreover the natural organic matter nom in source water may alter the photochemical activity of dbc in particular affecting the electron transfer process aeschbacher et al 2012 li et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 since the transformation of dom was affected by the reactive species such as 3dom and 1o2 remucal et al 2020 the presence of dbc would make a great impact on the photo transformation of dom the calcium ion ca2 is a naturally abundant cation in drinking water sources and could form complexes with carboxyl groups of dbc resulting in decreased hydrophilicity through bridging effect furthermore the complexation capacity of cations with dom was positively correlated with the quenching of the 3dom wan et al 2019 the generation of 3dom could be influenced by the solution ph chen et al 2018 and the change in the structure of phenolic compounds was dependent on the solution ph pace et al 2012 in addition the generation of other reactive species such as 1o2 from 3dom through electron transfer would also be affected by ca2 and ph however the effect of ca2 and ph on the dom photo transformation in the presence of dbc has not yet been investigated in contrast to the solid phase extraction or xad resins for compositional and structural dom fractionation requiring the acidification of natural waters the ultrafiltration isolated dom is based on physical separation without chemical alteration to the dom lin and guo 2020 the ultrafiltration could be applied to provide new insights into the dbc transformation independently from humic substances in dom it is because the dbc has a size ranging from several to hundred nanometers chen et al 2020 uzun et al 2020 and the molecular size of humic substances in source water is less than 100 kda yang et al 2018 thus the dbc before and after irradiation were filtrated by the 100 kda membrane to elucidate the transformation of dbc size and hydrophilic hydrophobic property through studying the variations in filtration efficiency and the structural property of the membrane the main objectives of this study were as follows i investigate the effects of ca2 and ph on the photoreaction induced optical variations of dom with dbc ii probe into their impacts on the structural characteristics of the dom iii examine their influences on the variations of photo transformed dbc this work is imperative for properly understanding the effects of ca2 and ph on the photo transformation of dom in the presence of dbc 2 materials and methods 2 1 source water and dbc the source water is obtained from the river jingmi jm which is a drinking water source for beijing china during the summer of 2020 and were prefiltered with a 0 45 µm filter membrane dow chemical usa to remove any natural colloids the filtered water was stored in glass bottles at 4 c in the dark since nom is the main composition of source water the doc of source water is called nom pinewood sawdust harbin heilongjiang province china was selected as the raw material for black carbon production prior to use the pinewood was washed with deionized di water for several times to remove surface impurities and oven dried at 80 c then it was passed through a 100 mesh sieve finally the powder was fed into a tube furnace gsl 1100x kejin co ltd hefei china and slowly pyrolyzed 10 c min at 500 c for 2 h under continuous n2 flow to maintain an oxygen limited conditions the obtained bc was ground sieved through a 150 μm mesh the fresh carbon black was immersed in di water at a ratio of 1 500 w v and stirred for 48 h then sonicated in a bath sonicator at 100 w for 1 h to make dbc completely leached the obtained suspension was filtered with 0 2 µm cellulose acetate membrane to model dbc solution finally the dbc was diluted by di water to make its doc same as that of jingmi river sample 11 0 mg l the dissolved organic carbon from biochar is noted as dbc the dbc was filtrated by the 0 1 µm membrane to obtain the nano sized bc with the size less than 100 nm some water quality parameters are given in table s1 nom and dbc were negatively charged with ζ potential values of 4 31 0 16 mv and 18 1 0 2 mv at ph 8 3 respectively since the nom and dbc were prepared by the 0 45 µm and 0 22 µm membranes filtration respectively there is no microorganism in samples therefore the effect of microorganism could be omitted in the experiment under the conditions of acidic alkaline and neural before and after irradiation 2 2 irradiation experiments all irradiation experiments were conducted under defined laboratory conditions using a solar simulator cel pe300e 3a ceaulight beijing china equipped with a 300w xe lamp without light filters which was calibrated to a light intensity of 100 mw cm2 on water surface the full spectrum of solar simulator and analytical methods were shown in figure s1 and text s2 respectively irradiation experiments were conducted with an uncovered glass beaker containing 90 ml of solution solution depth 1 8 cm in the air or anaerobic atmosphere through nitrogen gas n2 sparging and the solution was stirred at 400 rpm to ensure uniform light exposure the photochemical reactor was equipped with a water circulating jacket for temperature control which was maintained at 25 0 1 c the exposure time for irradiation is 4 hours the impact of dbc on the dom photo transformation was studied through changing the dbc content 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 in jm the studies on dom and dbc photo transformation were conducted using jm and di water with different dbc content 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 at various ph values respectively to study the effect of calcium ion cacl2 was spiked into samples giving ca2 concentration of 1 15 mm the initial solution ph before irradiation was adjusted to various values 8 3 7 2 6 3 5 3 and 4 2 by 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh to detect the impact of the ph on the dom photo transformation as shown in figure s2 the fluorescent components were extracted from the excitation emission matrix eem datasets based on the parallel factor analysis parafac modeling as shown in text s3 the s275 295 and s350 400 were calculated through measuring uv visible light absorbance of samples specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg c m is the absorbance per unit carbon and the absorption coefficient at 254 nm divided by doc concentration the number of suva254 is associated with the aromatic content the variations of s275 295 s350 400 suva254 and fluorescence intensity of major fluorescence components were calculated to analyze the change of dom molecular characteristics after irradiation 2 3 data analysis spearman s correlation analysis tukey s multiple comparison tests and principal component analysis pca were performed using r to compare the relationship and the difference between the variations of various indexes for individual control treatment pairs optical indices were extracted from absorbance and fluorescence data using matlab r2019a mathworks the 3dom and 1o2 were detected to analyze the variations of 3dom and 1o2 during irradiation text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 pristine dbc and nom characterization the components of the samples were characterized using fluorescent spectroscopy from figure s2 and s3 the primary and secondary fluorescence peaks at 300 340 nm in component 1 c1 are categorized as tyrosine like substance trubetskoj et al 2018 component 2 c2 with characteristic peaks at 350 420 nm could be assigned to humic substances originated from terrestrial environment and possibly reprocessed by microorganisms mladenov et al 2011 component 3 c3 presents a fluorescence peak at the excitation emission wavelength ex em of 270 320 330 nm which is attributed to tryptophan like substance mladenov et al 2011 the tyrosine like substance and tryptophan like substance are classified as protein like component from table s2 there was much higher content of humic like component for nom than for dbc but the c1 content of dbc was much more than that of nom furthermore the s275 295 of nano sized bc is much higher than the s350 400 suggesting that the s350 400 would decrease while the s275 295 would increase in the process of dbc dissolution the contents of c1 and c3 and the intensity of c2 for nano sized bc are similar with those for dbc indicating that those would not be influenced by the dbc dissolution from table s4 as the ph varied in the range of 4 2 to 8 3 before irradiation the intensity differences of various fluorescence components for 10 dbc in the presence of nom are generally minor it verified that the ph would make little influence on the fluorescence properties for samples in dark 3 2 the variation of dom optical properties during irradiation from figure 1 a the pc1 axis described 48 9 of the variation in the species composition while the pc2 axis described 35 8 of the variation thus the two axes were responsible for 84 7 of the variation in the dataset the samples were mainly distributed around suva254 in dark which indicated the suva254 were strongly correlated with the samples before irradiation it verified the variation of suva254 was impacted significantly by the irradiation furthermore the irradiated samples were clustered near c2 illustrating the impact of irradiation on c2 was the greatest compared with other variables therefore tukey s multiple comparison tests were performed to compare the difference between the means of the suva254 and c2 for individual control treatment pairs figures 1b and 1c after irradiation the suva254 decreased greatly suggesting the aromaticity of dbc decreased it was because compared with nom dbc with condensed aromatics is more susceptible to partial photodegradation through ring cleavage wang et al 2020 in addition the c2 increased significantly after irradiation indicating that humic like component generated during dbc photobleaching it might be because the phenolic compounds with electron donating capacity edc could be transformed by 3dbc leading to the formation of the phenoxyl radical pho which could undergo dimerization during dbc photobleaching berto et al 2018 janssen et al 2014 remucal et al 2020 vione et al 2019 wang et al 2020 as shown in figure s4 a f the variations of suva254 and humic like component for samples at various dbc content with and without ca2 and 10 dbc at different ph values were much lower in the absence of nom than in the presence of nom after irradiation it indicated that the dbc photobleaching and humic like component formation were promoted by nom during photochemical reaction due to the increased light absorbance since there is a difference in photochemical reactivity between nano sized bc with size smaller than 100 nm and bulk dbc the photo transformation of nano sized bc in the presence of nom was also studied from figure s4d and h the variation of optical properties for nano sized bc is lower than that for dbc suggesting that the photochemical reactivity of nano sized bc is much lower than bulk dbc 3 3 the effect of ca2 and ph on the variation of dom optical properties from figure 2 a the relationship coefficient between suva254 and s275 295 0 62 was much less than that between suva254 and s350 400 0 02 indicating the aromaticity and molecular weight of s275 295 were much lower than those of s350 400 furthermore as the content of dbc increased from 0 to 10 the variation of s275 295 increased while that of s350 400 decreased which is parallel to a continued decrease of suva254 variation figure s4d and the increased decline extent of average hydrodynamic diameter after irradiation figure s5a these suggested that small molecules released from large molecules during dbc photobleaching li et al 2020a the variations of s275 295 and s350 400 for dbc without nom were less than those for dbc with nom figure s4a and d indicating the release of small molecules was promoted by nom the c1 content of dbc was much more than that of nom table s2 and c1 was negatively correlated with s350 400 0 96 indicating the small molecules released from bulk dbc after irradiation moreover the c3 intensity of nom was larger than that of dbc and the c3 was positively correlated with s350 400 0 82 and s275 295 0 90 suggesting the small and large molecules generated figure 1c presents the c2 increased after irradiation and the c2 content related negatively with the suva254 0 84 it indicated the dimerization of phenolic compounds was in accompany with the photobleaching of dbc in comparison to that without ca2 addition the variation of suva254 decreased more slightly with increasing dbc content after ca2 addition figure s4e and there was no statistically great difference of suva254 between before and after light irradiation figure 1b figure 2b presented that the absolute coefficient values of c1 and s350 400 c3 and s350 400 are less in the presence of ca2 than that in the absence of ca2 the decline extent of average hydrodynamic diameter for samples with ca2 is less than that without ca2 with the dbc content increasing figure s5b these indicated the presence of ca2 made the dbc photobleaching inhibited furthermore s275 295 and s350 400 decreased at the lower dbc content while the s275 295 increased and s350 400 decreased at the higher dbc content figure s4b illustrating that the inhibitory effect of dbc photobleaching by ca2 alleviated with increasing dbc content the variation of c2 was less than that without ca2 addition figure s4e and figure 1c presents that in contrast to that without ca2 addition the c2 increased slightly after ca2 addition moreover the absolute coefficient value of suva254 and c2 0 72 was less than that without ca2 addition these suggested the dimerization of phenolic compounds was inhibited after ca2 addition from figures 1b and 1c there were large differences of suva254 and c2 between before and after light irradiation with varying ph indicating that the variations of the aromaticity and humic like component were affected greatly by ph from figure 2c the relationship coefficients of c1 and s275 295 c1 and s350 400 were 0 88 and 0 76 respectively suggesting the release of small molecules from bulk dbc furthermore the suva254 was positively and negatively related with s350 400 and s275 295 respectively which was due to the photobleaching of dbc from figure s4c the variation of suva254 reached the lowest and the highest at ph 5 3 and 8 3 respectively indicating the photobleaching efficiency was the lowest and the highest at ph 5 3 and 8 3 it might be because the molecular structures of dom are elongated in alkaline solution to facilitate light absorption pace et al 2012 moreover the carboxylic groups of dom were mostly not deprotonated to make the configuration of dom compact via hydrogen bonding resulting in the lowest light absorption of dom at ph 5 3 pace et al 2012 from figure 2c the relationship coefficients between c2 and s275 295 s350 400 suva254 c1 were 0 88 0 78 0 76 and 0 95 respectively it indicated the dimerization process was positively related with the photobleaching the variation of humic like component was the highest at 8 3 figure s4f indicating the dimerization of phenolic compounds was promoted under alkaline condition it might be because the phenolic compounds in nom are deprotonated and become much better electron donors than their neutral forms pace et al 2012 the figure s4g showed that there was little variation in optical properties for nom at various ph suggesting the presence of dbc was responsible for the variation of optical properties for 10 dbc at various ph values 3 4 the variation of structural characteristics during irradiation from figure 3 the xps c1 c2 c3 and c4 peaks at about 285 0 285 6 288 0 and 289 5 binding energy ev were assigned to c h or c c c o or o c o and o c o groups respectively furthermore the xps o1 and o2 peaks at 532 3 and 532 6 ev were attributed to c o and c o groups respectively as shown in figure 3a and table 1 the intensities and atomic percent at of c2 c3 and c4 decreased greatly after irradiation in anaerobic atmosphere indicating the nom photosensitizing chromophores were selectively destructed during photobleaching process sharpless et al 2014 additionally the intensity of c2 and c2 c3 ratio decreased greatly while the intensity of o1 and the o1 o2 increased it indicated that the c o group of the phenolic compound was reduced to c o group of the quinone compound by 3dbc and the o c o group generated due to the dimerization of phenolic compounds the c o ratio increased after irradiation table 1 and the semicircle radius of the sample at ph 8 3 after irradiation was larger than that before irradiation figure s9 it indicated that the mediated electron transfer by quinone groups and direct electron transfer by the graphitic structures decreased due to the decomposition of condensed aromatics in dbc which was more susceptible to photodegradation than nom jing et al 2020 moreover the o1 o2 ratio increased slightly due to the oxidation of c o group for the quinone compound by 1o2 the decrease of c4 intensity was attributed to the further destruction of the nom chromophores during photobleaching process sharpless et al 2014 3 5 impacts of ca2 and ph on the variation of structural characteristics the effects of irradiation ca2 and ph on functional groups of dom were studied by comparing the ftir spectra in the air or anaerobic atmosphere the bands at 3400 cm 1 2900 cm 1 1050 and 1150 cm 1 were assigned to o h aliphatic c h c o and ether link c o c groups respectively laszakovits et al 2020 from figure s6 the intensity ratio of c o band to c o c band decreased after irradiation for nom and dbc it was because the pho and dbc derived reducing intermediates dbc were formed via the electron transfer reaction of phenolic compounds with 3dbc and underwent self coupling to form phenol oligomers wan et al 2021 moreover the intensity of aliphatic c h stretching vibrations for dbc was much greater than that for nom after irradiation due to the release of dbc it was because dbc had more c h groups than nom due to the cleavage of alkyl linkages in pyrolized lignin song et al 2021 from figure 4 a the intensity ratios of the aliphatic c h to bonded o h group for samples at various dbc contents were larger in air atmosphere than in anaerobic atmosphere after irradiation indicating the released dbc increased in the presence of o2 xu et al 2017 furthermore the intensity ratios of c o band to c o c band decreased after irradiation in anaerobic atmosphere attributed to the dimerization of phenolic compounds from figure s7a there was no obvious difference for suva254 between before and after irradiation in the anaerobic atmosphere suggesting the photobleaching of dbc was inhibited figure s7b shows the c2 variations for samples were higher in the anaerobic atmosphere than that in the air atmosphere after irradiation the 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp was employed as a probe molecule to investigate the electron transfer of 3dbc the degradation rate constant k of tmp ktmp was calculated through the fit of experiment data to a pseudo first order model and positively related to the quantum yields of the 3dbc formation therefore it is very important for analyzing the generation of 3dbc by using ktmp during irradiation the ktmp was greater in anaerobic atmosphere than that in air atmosphere figure s8a these indicated that the 3dbc was not quenched in the absence of o2 therefore the dimerization of phenolic compounds was promoted and the dbc photooxidation by 1o2 was inhibited figure 4b presents that the intensity ratio of c h group to the o h group increased with increasing dbc content in the presence of ca2 after irradiation and it was less than that in the absence of ca2 its difference between the absence and the presence of ca2 decreased as the dbc increased it suggested that the dbc release was inhibited by ca2 and the inhibitory effect of dbc release by ca2 was alleviated at higher dbc content the intensity ratio of c o to the ether link c o c increased after irradiation with increasing dbc content due to the increased release of dbc with high ratio of c o to the c o c it covered the decreased intensity ratio of c o to the c o c due to the increased c2 at higher dbc content while it was obvious at lower dbc content due to the inhibitory effect of ca2 on dbc release compared with the absence of ca2 the ktmp decreased in the presence of ca2 which was in accordance with the above result that the photobleaching efficiency of dbc was inhibited by the ca2 it might be because the generated reactive species quenched due to the complexation of ca2 with dbc wan et al 2019 as shown in figure 4c there was little difference in the relative distribution of c h and o h groups at various ph values it was because both of dbc and nom contained the cooh group which could be deprotonated at all the ph and the amount of deprotonated cooh increased with the ph increasing the intensity ratio of c h to the o h group reached the highest at ph 7 2 indicating the largest amount of dbc released from bulk dbc moreover the intensity ratio of c o to the ether link c o c at ph 7 3 was much greater than those at other ph values due to the lowest efficiency of phenolic compounds dimerization from figure s8b the ktmp value increased as the ph decreased from 7 2 to 4 2 indicating the 3dbc increased with decreasing ph from neutral furthermore the kffa decreased with decreasing ph from neutral and the difference between the presence and the absence of nom became larger with the increasing ph indicating the 1o2 generation was promoted by the presence of nom figure s8c 3 6 the tem evidence of dbc transformation induced by light irradiation as shown in figure 5 a1 and 5b1 the products of dbc before and after irradiation with the addition of ca2 were carefully studied with a transmission electron microscope tem in order to provide direct evidence of dbc photo transformation eds spectra of a6 and b6 were obtained based on the element mapping of samples presented in a2 a3 a4 and b2 b3 b4 respectively the block shaped substance with the edge of the thin layer substance were observed in tem of the dbc before and after irradiation the selected region of a1 and b1 were observed by high resolution tem and were shown in figures a5 and b5 respectively compared with the sample before irradiation the sample after irradiation was composed of weaker lattice structures furthermore the thin layer regions of a and b were denoted in figure a5 and b5 respectively which included short c layers forming an amorphous structure after irradiation the sample appeared to show a decrease in amorphous structures amorphous carbon structures caused both a high inner resistance and an energy barrier that limited electron transfers through carbon matrices to the surface of dbc sun et al 2017 figure s9 showed that the semicircle radius of the sample at ph 8 3 in the presence of ca2 after irradiation was less than that before irradiation it suggested the transition from a mediated electron transfer by quinone groups to a direct electron transfer dominated by the carbon matrices as a result of greater graphitic structures with higher c o figure a6 and b6 sun et al 2017 it also verified the decomposition of dbc was inhibited by ca2 3 7 effects of ca2 and ph on the photo transformation of dbc through ultrafiltration the samples before and after irradiation were filtrated by ultrafiltration membrane to study effects of ca2 and ph on the dbc release during irradiation because most of humic acid with the molecular weight of less than 30k da could not be removed by the ultrafiltration while most of dbc with the average hydrodynamic diameter greater than 10 nm would be filtrated by the ultrafiltration membrane therefore the dbc release could be studied by the ultrafiltration independently from humic acid as shown in figure 6 a compared with other components the removal rate of tyrosine like component was the highest suggesting a large part of dbc was removed because the tyrosine like component content of dbc was larger than that of nom from figure s10a toc concentration of ultrafiltration effluent was stable with increasing dbc content before irradiation indicating that most of dbc could be filtrated by ultrafiltration membrane as seen in figure 6d as dbc content increased the o h band at around 3300 cm 1 assigned to phenolic o h stretching and o h from carbohydrates increased after irradiation furthermore the flux decreased greatly after irradiation and the suva254 variation of filtrate enhanced figure s11a due to the release and the photobleaching of dbc during irradiation these indicated the released dbc was more hydrophilic than bulk dbc and increased with increasing dbc content from figure s12a the surface charge decreased with increasing dbc content after irradiation due to the dimerization of phenolic compounds and the photobleaching of dbc the removal efficiencies of tyrosine like and tryptophan like components decreased with increasing dbc content indicating that the size of released dbc decreased as the dbc content increased from figure 6b the removal rates of tyrosine like and tryptophan like components after irradiation in the presence of ca2 were higher than those in the absence of ca2 figure s10b showed that the effluent toc concentration with ca2 was similar with that without ca2 before irradiation suggesting the ultrafiltration performance of dbc was influenced slightly by the addition of ca2 prior to irradiation furthermore the flux decreased slightly and then greatly as the dbc content increased figure s11b and the zeta potential increased slightly figure s12b after irradiation in the presence of ca2 these indicated that the release of dbc was inhibited by ca2 and the inhibitory effect of ca2 was alleviated at higher dbc content the suva254 variation of filtrate in the presence of ca2 was less than that in the absence of ca2 from figure 6e as the dbc content increased from 0 to 5 in the presence of ca2 the intensities of the o h band decreased after irradiation which were much less than those without ca2 addition these were correlated with the decreased photobleaching efficiency in conjunction with the decrease of dbc release from figure s13 the membrane fouling was mitigated by the ca2 addition at various dbc contents compared with no ca2 addition from figure 6c the removal efficiencies of tryrosine like and tryptophan like components at ph 5 3 were the highest the semicircle radius of the sample at ph 5 3 in the presence of ca2 after irradiation was much less than that before irradiation figure s9 indicating the light induced decomposition of quinone groups and graphitic structures was significantly inhibited at ph 5 3 the figure s10c presented that toc concentration was very stable with decreasing ph before irradiation illustrating the ultrafiltration of dbc was not affected by varying ph furthermore the flux decline and the suva254 variation of filtrate reached the lowest figure s11c and the zeta potential was the largest figure s12c these indicated the release and photobleaching of dbc were significantly inhibited at ph 5 3 figure 6f presents that there is a big increase in the intensity of o h band after irradiation at ph 6 3 illustrating the improved hydrophilicity of the dom surface in contrast to ph 6 3 the intensity of o h band decreased greatly at ph 5 3 after irradiation due to the least release of dbc from figure s12c the dom aggregated via hydrogen bonding of the carboxylic groups at ph 5 3 to make the surface charge reach the lowest before the irradiation moreover the surface charge was largest and the decline extent in surface charge was the smallest at ph 6 3 after irradiation due to the least dimerization of phenolic compounds and photobleaching of dbc 3 8 the influential mechanism of ca2 and ph figure 7 shows the influential mechanism of ca2 and ph on the dimerization of phenolic compounds and the photobleaching of dbc absorption of sunlight by dbc leads to the formation of 3dbc which makes the dimerization of phenolic compounds to form the humic like component moreover the 3dbc could react with dissolved oxygen to form 1o2 resulting in the decomposition of dbc during the decomposition of dbc the ratio of carbon to oxygen increased and graphitic structures decomposed the 3dbc was quenched by ca2 and increased with the decreasing ph resulting in the less and more humic like component formation respectively furthermore the ca2 inhibit the generation of 1o2 to make the less dbc released and the 1o2 generation decreased as ph decreased from neutral resulting in the decreased decomposition of dbc future studies could investigate the impacts of other factors on dom transformation of source water with biochar 4 conclusion dbc is more susceptible to partial degradation through ring cleavage to make its aromaticity decreased and the phenolic compounds could undergo dimerization to form the humic like component during irradiation the dimerization of phenolic compounds was inhibited after ca2 addition and the photobleaching efficiency was the lowest at ph 5 3 the inhibitory effect of dbc release by ca2 was alleviated at higher dbc content and the intensity ratio of c o to the ether link c o c in neutral ph was much greater than those at other ph values due to the lowest efficiency of phenolic compounds dimerization tem showed that compared with the sample before irradiation the sample was composed of weaker lattice structures and appeared to show a decrease in amorphous structures after irradiation the filtration experiment by ultrafiltration membrane showed the inhibitory effect of ca2 was alleviated at higher dbc content and the release and photobleaching of dbc were significantly inhibited at ph 5 3 to our knowledge this is the first report of the impacts of solution properties on the dbc phototransformation in the presence of dom allowing us to distinguish the influential factors the study can provide the new insights into the source water management and the water treatment the membrane fouling caused by the release of dbc during the photoreaction could be alleviated

15929,an electro enhanced membrane bioreactor embr was constructed with polyaniline based carbon pac separation membrane as the membrane electrode which could realize the in situ electro generation and activation of h2o2 to oh depending on the graphitic and pyridinic n as active sites without metal catalyst after the continuous operation of the bioreactor for 74 days approximately 77 41 irreversible membrane fouling occurred on the electrochemically enhanced membrane which was less than that on the control membrane 85 96 the oh oxidation combined with electrostatic barrier formed by 1 0 v enhanced pac membrane suppressed the extracellular polymeric substances deposition on membrane after operation the strength of total cell proteins β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides on the membrane without bias were 5 17 4 32 9 65 and 16 31 respectively in embr the corresponding strength were 2 03 3 35 2 15 and 6 73 after calculation the unblocked pores accounted for 35 3 and 78 5 of the total membrane surface in mbr and embr respectively indicating the fouling was alleviated obviously meanwhile the embr owned a satisfactory wastewater treatment effect with average effluent chemical oxygen demand and nh4 n around 18 98 mg l and 0 68 mg l the successful implementation of this strategy achieved a green and metal free method for oh production with electrochemical effect for membrane fouling control in mbr graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane electrode oh electric field membrane fouling embr 1 introduction the multiple advantages such as high effluent ssquality small footprint and effective biomass retention of membrane bioreactor mbr make it a promising process for wastewater treatment zhang et al 2020 whereas membrane fouling accompanied by transmembrane pressure tmp increasing and permeate flux decreasing is an inevitable challenge which restricts the application of mbr charfi et al 2012 wang et al 2014 biogas sparging and membrane cleaning replacement were usually conducted for membrane fouling control liu et al 2019 muhammad et al 2014 to a certain degree these strategies would increase the cost of mbr operation hence based on high separation effectiveness and large permeability coefficient improving the membranes anti fouling performance is significant for mbr application to date electrochemical assisted membrane separation is recognized as an environmental friendly and cost effective means to alleviate membrane fouling gharibian and hazrati 2022 electrochemical repulsion could repel the pollutants with the same charges far from the membranes and then reduce their adhesion the electrodynamic and electrowetting phenomena exhibited by some materials also help to improve the separation performance of the membranes sun et al 2013 yang et al 2011 particularly parts of materials could participate in the reaction for oh o2 ho2 production under the electrochemistry which own the ability of removing the contaminants by oxidization or mineralization voinov et al 2011 yang et al 2013 among them oh with a high reactive shows a great potential in wastewater treatment soil remediation etc and involving in plenty of physiological processes gligorovski et al 2015 voinov et al 2011 yang et al 2013 electro fenton is one of the traditional oh generation method under electro assistance li et al 2017 during the electro fenton process for oh generation h2o2 was firstly produced by two electron reduction of dissolved oxygen on the cathode subsequently transformed into oh by the reaction h2o2 and fe3 li et al 2017 however there are inevitable disadvantages of metal leaching and loss which affects the growth of microorganisms and causes secondary pollution in effluent hartmann et al 2010 it is very important to establish a green and metal free method for oh production with electrochemical effect previous researches reported that the polyaniline pani with graphite like structure derived carbonaceous materials could conveniently introduce different nitrogen including pyrrolic graphitic and pyridinic n etc into carbon framework during the process of high temperature pyrolysis wu et al 2011 among them graphitic n and pyridinic n were considered to be the active sites for h2o2 production and its activation to oh su et al 2019 these interesting pioneering discoveries encouraged us to develop metal free membrane with oh production under electrochemistry for membrane fouling control eliminating the need for metal catalyst will resolve the intrinsic drawback of secondary pollution which would ultimately reduce the operation cost for successfully practicing this strategy of applying metal free electro fenton membranes to membrane fouling mitigation in mbr the pani need be prepared with graphite like structure it could introduce pyridinic n and graphitic n into the carbon framework as well as abundant pores which provide carbon membranes with pani as precursor guarantee in permeability from the appearance of pani materials tubular structure or filament structure are preferred to endow membranes a certain degree of flexibility and mechanical strength therefore aim to practice a green and metal free method for oh production with electrochemical effect for membrane fouling control based on pani the performance and the efficiency of oh production of pani based carbon separation membranes remain to be verified and explored as well as the feasibility of using it as the basic separation unit in mbr therefore this research developed a new type of pani based carbon pac membrane the pani was synthesized with aniline as substrate then koh as a green activating agent was used for modifying the material surface properties to enhance the efficiency of in situ generation of h2o2 and its activation to oh su et al 2019 yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 to explore the anti fouling performance a mbr system was constructed with pac membrane as the separation unit and cathode simultaneously during the operation the relationship among electrochemical effect anti fouling ability and characteristics of microorganisms was systematically researched here the successful implementation of this idea will provide a green and environmentally friendly membrane fouling mitigation strategy and lay a certain theoretical foundation for the practical application of electrochemical technology coupled with mbr process 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of pani derived carbons and pac membranes the pani derived carbons were synthesized by chemical polymerization and carbonization masuko et al 2005 firstly pani was made from the polymerization of aniline and ammonium persulfate 98 specifically 60 ml aqueous solution with ammonium persulfate 3 423 g was named as a 60 ml aqueous solution with 1 1 ml aniline was named as b quickly adding a to b under stirring then reaction for 24 h to form pani then the pani solution was washed by pure water until neuter freeze dryer was used to completely removed water of pani subsequently pani derived carbons were obtained by calcinating in a flow of nitrogen 40 sccm at 1000 c for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 in order to enhance the efficiency of in situ generation of h2o2 and its activation to oh yang et al 2018 2019 koh and pani were mixed with the proportion of 2 1 and calcinated in a flow of nitrogen 40 sccm at 700 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 finally the aimed pani derived carbons were washed by 2 m hcl following by pure water until neuter and then dried by freeze dryer the pac membrane was fabricated by loading pani derived carbons 10 mg on the ceramic substrate 300 400 nm and calcinated in a flow of nitrogen 40 sccm at 600 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 to strengthen the binding force between materials and substrate 2 2 characterization the morphology of the pani was observed by scanning electron microscope sem fesem hitachi s 8010 on a microscope with 1 0 nm resolution at 5 kv the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the membrane was evaluated by automatic contact angle meter sl200b kono industrial co ltd usa the pore size of membrane was measured by pore size tester poroluxtm1000 porometer germany dmpo spin trapping electron spin resonance esr spectra was used to record the production of oh with 1 0 v enhanced membrane as cathode the pure water permeate flux was an average value by measuring three times of parallel pure water flux at a constant pressure of 0 2 bar it was calculated as follows 1 j v a δ t where j is the permeation flux l m 2 h 1 v is the volume of the permeate l a is the membrane area m2 and δt is the permeate collection interval h the rejection ratios r could be calculated by the following equation 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp ware the pollutants concentration in influent and in effluent respectively 2 3 electro fenton degradation experiment the feasibility of the electro fenton enhanced pac membrane for pollutants removal and membrane fouling control was verified by filtrating the supernatant of the bioreactor the initial chemical oxygen demand cod of the target was around 70 mg l the removal rate of cod and permeate flux of pac membrane were recorded to evaluate the performance of electro fenton enhanced pac for each group of samples the tests were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility the stability and reusability of pac membrane were also evaluated by the flux recovery f r which was calculated by the following equation 3 f r j m i j m 1 100 where j m 1 is the initial membrane flux j m i is the flux of membrane after recovery 2 4 embr setup and operation fig 1 presents the schematic diagram of the laboratory scale electro fenton enhanced bioreactor embr two parallel bioreactors with 2 0 l working volume were constructed to compare the performance of electro enhanced pac membrane on membrane fouling control for embr pac membrane with 1 0 v was used as the basic separation unit the pac membrane was used as the cathode membrane with the total effective area 1 256 10 3 m2 and the titanium mesh with the dimension of 10 cm 10 cm was choose as anode the sludge in bioreactor was taken from wastewater treatment plant in dalian the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids were maintained as 3000 mg l ph was set around 7 8 by adding nahco3 in the influent dissolved oxygen was kept at 2 4 mg l by air pump hydraulic retention time hrt was 8 h in this study the feed of embr and mbr was simulated municipal wastewater and the compositions were presented in supporting information for the control group mbr experimental setup without potential was maintained a high degree of consistency to the embr in other aspects membranes in both mbr and embr would be conducted hydraulic cleaning each 15 days the extracellular polymeric substances eps including bound eps beps and soluble eps seps also known as soluble microbial products smp as an important factor for reveal the anti fouling mechanisms was mainly focused by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fl4500 hitachi japan seps or smp was from supernatant or effluent and beps was extracted from sludge or cake layer in our experiments the seps from supernatant or effluent has been named as smp and the eps here specifically refers to beps from activated sludge meanwhile the carbohydrate and proteins in seps and beps have been named as smpc smpp and epsc epsp respectively among them the carbohydrate content in seps and beps was measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as a standard masuko et al 2005 the protein content in seps and beps was determined by the bradford method brunelle and green 2014 using bovine serum albumin as a standard moreover the relationship between electrochemical environment and microbial community was researched by high throughput 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing the pyrosequencing was carried out using illumina high throughput sequencing on the miseq platform sangon biotech shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pani derived carbons and pac membrane as previous reports showed the pani nanostructures ranging from the typical fibers tubes and particles to more exotic leafs cubes etc have been successfully documented by self assembly methods han et al 2007 huang et al 2003a qiu et al 2001 stejskal et al 2004 herein nanofibers structure of pani is preferred for forming interconnected and porous conducting network as sem images presented the pani derived carbons with the morphology of cross linked nanofibers have been perfectly prepared fig 2 a even experiencing high temperature pyrolysis with koh zhu et al 2014 cross linking structure of conducting nanofibers was convenient to reduce the internal resistance thereby improve electron transfer at the same time the widened macro pores caused by cross linking and koh activation were beneficial to increase the accessible active and the specific surface area which could enhance reaction by facilitating mass transfer of reactants to the active sites haider et al 2019 from the perspective of practical application the cross linking structure to some extent could provide guarantee for the flexibility of the formed membranes another feature such as chemical composition of the pani derived carbons was analyzed by elemental mapping in fig 2b d indicating c n and o with a uniform distribution were the main elements surface chemistry of this electrode membrane has been gained insights by further x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis in fig 2e three peaks including c1s o1s and n1s were presented in the spectra of pani derived carbons revealing that the materials were successfully doped with element n specifically one main peak appeared at 284 65 ev c c in the c1s spectra of pani derived carbons fig 2f after pani pyrolysis corresponding to graphitic sp2 c atoms indicating successful carbonization of pani derived carbons composite lu et al 2017 another two main peaks were readily identified at 285 6 and 286 85 ev relating to c n and c oh tong et al 2014 these two peaks illustrated n and o functional groups had been successfully incorporated into the carbon matrix in addition the n1s spectra of pani derived carbons was deconvoluted into four characteristic peaks located at 398 6 400 4 401 5 and 402 5 ev fig 2g which were correspondingly attributed to pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and pyridinic n oxides zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 as mentioned before graphitic n and pyridinic n could be used as the active sites for h2o2 generation and its activation to oh su et al 2019 pac membranes based on pani derived carbons were simultaneously conducted as the basic separation unit and cathode under bias oh as the main active substance oxidants was produced from activation of in situ generation h2o2 which generated from simultaneously catalyzing by pac cathode the generation of oh was recorded by dmpo spin trap esr spectra as presented in fig 2h four typical peaks appeared in esr spectra with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 which was a characteristic peak of dmpo oh complex hartmann et al 2010 the specific production process was described in fig 2i graphitic n was firstly used as the active site for converting adsorbed oxygen to h2o2 via 2e orr process at pac membrane cathode surface liu et al 2016 su et al 2019 subsequently oh would be generated by transferring an electron to h2o2 with pyridinic n as an active site on the membrane surface su et al 2019 if some of the produced h2o2 was released and then accumulated in the bulk solution which could still be activated to oh by once touching on the pac cathode surface during the material preparation process carbonization could introduce the defects and edges to serve as another active sites for enhancing catalysis process duan et al 2016 hu et al 2017 yang et al 2018 accordingly the generated oh existed on the pac membrane could directly attack the pollutants adsorbed on the membrane surface or deeply in the pores degrading them into corresponding by products oh produced on around the separation unit owned a weak effect on the microorganisms because the lifetime 20 ns and diffusion length 6 nm of oh is very short zhou et al 2019 that is the main reason for choosing oh as strategy to mitigate membrane fouling other basic properties of the pac membranes were presented in fig s1 contact angle is the angle of gas liquid and solid three phase when micro droplets touching solid sample surface which can characterize membrane hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity for the materials with hydrophilicity the strength of hydrophilicity also could be represented by the spread out speed of water droplet as seen in fig s1a a water droplet 2 μl was completely spread out the pac membrane after 93 ms on the raw membrane about 142 ms was demanded to adsorb the water droplet indicating that the prepared pac membrane has good hydrophilicity kota et al 2012 fig s1b indicates the membranes owned a certain degree of conductivity the average pore sizes of the pac membrane and the raw substrate were approximately 255 9 nm and 281 6 nm respectively the pure water permeate flux of pac membrane was 629 3 l m2 h bar which was a little higher than that of the raw substrate 617 03 l m2 h bar even with a small pore size the reasons could be attributed to the ability of fast transmission of water through carbon materials according to the results of dynamic water contact angle kota et al 2012 wang et al 2007 overall the pac membranes exhibited a relatively better performance from the results of the basic membrane features 3 2 degradation of pollutants by electro enhanced pac membrane the pollutants removal and membrane fouling performance were researched by filtrating the supernatant of the bioreactor with the initial cod of 71 21 mg l overall over 30 of cod from the pollutants could be removed by the interrupting of membranes pores from fig 3 a smaller pore size of pac membranes than the raw substrate could make an obviously enhanced pollutants retaining phenomenon with the cod removal efficiency higher than 40 maybe the adsorption effect of carbon materials also could contribute to the part of cod removal xin et al 2019 however the degradation efficiency of supernatant remained above 67 when applied 1 0 v bias on the pac membrane as previously explained oh produced from activation of h2o2 could help to pollutant degradation haider et al 2019 different kinds of by products from oh degradation possibly made up the remained cod which also could be partly prevented by the membranes therefore this part of by products combined with the pollutants could not be degraded together caused the flux loss of the pac membrane under bias as shown in fig 3b the loss of pure water permeate flux on the 1 0 v enhanced pac membrane was about 153 41 l m2 h bar which was less than those on pac membrane 247 61 l m2 h bar and the raw substrate 330 3 l m2 h bar above results revealed that using electro enhanced pac membrane as cathode could oxidize remove pollutants and mitigate membrane fouling in a metal free oxidation system furthermore this in situ fabricated material without any binder could remain stable for long term operation 3 3 wastewater treatment evaluation of embr fig 4 exhibits the wastewater treatment performance of the embr and mbr during the whole 74 day operation the parallel embr and mbr were continuously fed by simulated municipal wastewater the influent organic strength was stabilized around 500 mg l at an hrt of 8 h the quality of effluent was examined every two days during the period of operation mainly including cod and nh4 n concentration as shown in fig 4a both mbr and embr owned outstanding effluent quality with the cod removal efficiency over than 87 97 specifically the supernatant cod was between 7 03 mg l and 76 15 mg l average 42 85 mg l resulting in a cod removal efficiency between 98 60 and 85 15 91 48 on average in the bioreactor with electrochemical effect embr in mbr the supernatant cod was around 51 70 mg l and the removal rate could obtain about 96 01 from day 60 to 74 it can be speculated electrochemistry as the main difference between mbr and embr could influence the cod removal performance at the same time the residual cod and some high molecular polymers secreted in vitro by microorganism namely extracellular polymeric substances eps including smp combining with suspended particulate matter sludge floc etc will flow out with the effluent among them the main components of eps smp are similar to the intracellular components of microorganisms they are some high molecular substances such as polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids generally eps smp is usually considered to be the main pollutant for forming membrane fouling meng et al 2017 zhang and jiang 2019 the effluent quality could be further improved by the membrane separation the effluent cod was between 7 03 mg l and 59 70 mg l average 33 19 mg l resulting in a cod removal efficiency between 98 60 and 87 97 93 40 on average in mbr it was obviously 7 42 mg l 39 49 mg l lower than supernatant cod especially in embr the highest removal efficiencies of 100 was observed under negative bias the pollutants would be deeply oxidized or mineralized by in situ oh from pani derived carbons when they passed through the membranes su et al 2019 yang et al 2018 2019 non degraded compounds from the original feed and microbial secretions oxidation by product with the diameter less than membranes pore size will became the main source of effluent cod in mbr systems it could be designed systematically from the view of extending the time of through membrane or increasing the oh production efficiency for further reducing the effluent cod fig 4b presents nh4 n removal efficiencies in mbr and embr overall the effluent nh4 n concentration of mbr and embr were relatively steady in mbr the supernatant nh4 n and effluent nh4 n were relatively stable with a changeless influent strength of 25 mg l and constant hrt of 8 h they were around 1 53 mg l in supernatant and 1 00 mg l in effluent indicating the mbr had a good nitrification with the average nh4 n removal rates around 95 96 similar to the cod removal results nitrification in the embr gradually improved with the supernatant nh4 n around 1 27 mg l which was 0 26 mg l lower than that in mbr because of applying electrochemical effect on the system feng et al 2017 the lower supernatant nh4 n at the same time would contribute to reduce the effluent nh4 n on one hand which was around 0 68 mg l on the other hand the supernatant nh4 n would be further oxidized by oh when it passed through the membrane feng et al 2003 in most bioreactors the utilization by microorganisms is the leading role for nh4 n removal however the enhanced microbial activity along with oh oxidation ensure a good nh4 n removal in embr according to above results 3 4 membrane fouling mitigation in embr fig 5 shows the variations of tmp and corresponding membrane permeate flux in embr and control mbr over the operation time during the 74 days of operation tmp was progressively increased from 0 5 to 1 0 bar in five operational stages of all bioreactors with the influent cod around 500 mg l overall the tmp of each cycle was gradually increased with the operation indicating the membrane filtrating ability was lost gradually subsequently it would be rapidly recovering after hydraulic cleaning correspondingly the membrane permeate flux owned an opposite variation with gradually decreasing followed by rapidly improvement after hydraulic cleaning because the interactions between pollutants and the membranes could cause the membrane permeability loss and the tmp increasing blanpain avet et al 2009 lyko et al 2008 skouteris et al 2012 specifically in mbr the tmp increased from 0 6 to 0 89 bar day 1 15 in cycle 1 from 0 7 to 0 92 bar day 16 30 in cycle 2 from 0 8 to 0 95 bar day 31 45 in cycle 3 from 0 85 to 0 96 bar day 46 60 in cycle 4 and from 0 9 to 0 973 bar day 61 74 in cycle 5 table s1 in embr the corresponding tmp variation were from 0 5 to 0 8 bar from 0 68 to 0 86 bar from 0 7 to 0 89 bar from 0 8 to 0 95 bar and from 0 8 to 0 95 bar respectively comparing the first few days of the operation in each cycle a higher and higher initial tmp could be observed both in mbr and embr demonstrating the content of irreversible membrane fouling has heightened which could not be recovered by hydraulic cleaning the values on pac membrane were always higher than those of membrane in embr which demonstrated a better filtrating performance of electro enhanced pac membrane than the control group the prosperities of membrane in embr were almost the same as membrane in mbr however the initial the 1st day tmp in embr was lower than those in mbr it is because that the electrophoretic phenomena such as electrophoresis electroosmosis and electromigration and electrowetting phenomena exhibited by the material under electric bias could help to improve the membrane separation performance sun et al 2013 yang et al 2011 from the results of membrane permeate flux it was 12 62 l m2 h bar after the fourth time hydraulic cleaning in embr after calculation about 77 41 irreversible membrane fouling was occurred on the electrochemically enhanced membrane which was less than that on the control membrane 85 96 this could be attributed to the electrochemical effect which contributed electrons for membrane to produce h2o2 and then activated it to oh su et al 2019 yang et al 2018 2019 the oh promoted the membrane fouling mitigation by in situ pollutants oxidation on the membrane surface or in the deep pores meanwhile the negative bias formed a barrier to repel some negatively charged pollutants mainly released soluble microbial products smp far from the membranes thereby reducing the membrane fouling rates eps including beps and seps smp are products of the metabolism of microorganisms and well known as the main pollutants responsible for leading biological foulants and cake layer flemming et al 1997 ramesh et al 2007 smp and eps are prevalent in the interior and surface of biomass flocs they are polymers of some macromolecules such as carbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids most of which have negative charges sheng et al 2010 among them beps located outside cell surfaces played an essential role in aggregating cells into flocs or granules along with accumulating enzymes for cell utilization and cell cell communication chang and lee 1998 laspidou et al 2002 zheng et al 2018 importantly these secreted products seps also can build a protective barrier for microbial cells to resist unfavorable environments wingender et al 1999 therefore taking a deep insight into the variation of electrochemical effect on smp and eps will be beneficial to clear the membrane fouling mitigation mechanisms in the mbr coupled with electrochemical environment also be help to understand the reasons for the performance variation of mbr in electrochemical environment in this study eps involving smp was critically researched by eem fluorescence spectroscopy and ultraviolet spectrophotometry the relationships between the evolution of membrane fouling and eps smp variation were also discussed the characteristics of the extracted foulants from the samples in embr were further analyzed compared to those in control mbr among plenty of analyses proteins and polysaccharides were gave specific attention to clarify the relative importance of these components to forming membrane fouling in fig s2a the average proteins concentrations in supernatant smpp from mbr were 2 15 mg l 12 17 mg l and 22 68 mg l at 15 30 and 45 days they were 3 51 mg l 17 91 mg l and 24 53 mg l in embr respectively the content of secreted smpp has increased with the stimulating of electrochemical environment however the tmp will rapidly increase with responding to the smpp incensement because the accumulation of smp attaching on membrane surface or deeply in pores could largely reduce membrane permeability in principle actually the epsp content on in membranes was 32 31 mg l in embr at 45 days which was lower than that in mbr 65 29 mg l the possible explanation for the decreased epsp on in membrane must be related to the oxidation of oh coupling the repulsion during filtrating phase resulting in the alleviation bio foulants aggregation and deposition meanwhile correspondingly average 0 mg l 5 93 mg l and 12 16 mg l of the epsp had been separated by membrane in embr effluent the decreased smpp were 2 92 mg l 14 30 mg l and 22 09 mg l at 15 30 and 45 days above varying smpp concentrations demonstrated an alleviated membrane fouling and enhanced effluent quality by the oxidation effect coupling with membrane separation in embr the polysaccharides content in eps and smp were recognized as epsc and smpc here respectively as shown in fig s2d f the overall difference or trend of epsc and smpc was similar with the variation of epsp and smpp in mbr the supernatant smpc were 21 07 mg l 17 21 mg l and 33 19 mg l and the effluent smpc were 21 92 mg l 16 53 mg l and 17 54 mg l at 15 30 and 45 days in embr the supernatant smpc and effluent smpc were 62 80 10 81 mg l 49 68 4 08 mg l and 34 20 9 64 mg l respectively at 15 30 and 45 days meanwhile epsc on in membrane were 235 99 mg l in embr and 297 50 mg l in mbr epsc with negative charged carboxylic acid and phosphoric acid groups could be well excluded by 1 0 v bias enhanced pac cai et al 2004 therefore exceeding 60 mg l epsc was reduced on pac in embr than mbr causing an obviously membrane fouling mitigation aim to explore the variations in characteristics of eps smp under electrochemical environment eem fluorescence spectroscopy of the smp from supernatant and effluent eps from membrane surface pores at 45 days in the two systems were illustrated in fig 6 two main peaks were obviously appearing from the fluorescence spectra of smp in supernatant as shown in fig 6a and b one peak a was located around the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 275 280 332 350 nm which was related to tryptophan protein like substances chen et al 2003 the second main peak b was readily identified at the ex em of 235 240 338 342 nm which was attributed to the simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine baker 2001 the strength of smp was higher in embr than that in mbr which was consistent with the results of fig s2a and d after electrochemical effect in embr the substance of simple aromatic protein has been well removed by oh through 15 days of accumulation the content of protein like substances still at a low level as shown in fig 6c however both simple aromatic proteins and tryptophan protein like substances on in the membrane of mbr have obviously increased previous study showed that the protein like substances indicated by both peak a and b were easily biodegraded by microorganisms for energy requirements and growth he et al 2011 huang et al 2011 meanwhile the protein like substances including tyrosine like peak a and tryptophan like peak b especially the tryptophan protein like substances could be more easily retained captured by the membranes leading to serious membrane fouling wang et al 2009 for embr higher smp content in supernatant but lower deposition on in membrane compared with the eps variation in mbr was in favor of system stability and membrane fouling control after separation all eps and smp content have reduced in effluent as expressed in fig 6e and f another peak appearing in the ex em of 290 350 410 435 nm peak c was also observed which was described as visible humic acid like fluorescence chen et al 2003 actually the humic acid like substance was always existing with covering by the high strength of protein like substance in supernatant fig s3a and b however almost no humic acid like substances could be found on the membrane both in embr and mbr because it could pass the membranes more easily wang et al 2009 it is worth noting that electrochemical effect enhanced bioreactors could completely remove the humic acid like substances without existing in effluent hence it was logical to speculate that the reduced eps smp content and the composition variation of the eps smp under electrochemical environment have a great significance to membrane fouling alleviation confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to characterize the sludge cake layer on membrane after operation the content of total cells pink proteins green β polysaccharides blue and α polysaccharides red in the sludge cake layer were measured by fluorescence intensities with different color the specific percentages of different pollutant and membrane porosity were further summarized in table 1 as presented in fig 7 a the strength of total cell proteins β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides on the membrane without bias were 5 17 4 32 9 65 and 16 31 respectively the total fluorescence intensities of pac membrane in embr fig 7b were significantly weaker than those of the control membrane with the strength of total cell proteins β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides being 2 03 3 35 2 15 and 6 73 the results are provided by shiyanjia lab www shiyanjia com showing that the fouling mainly consisting of cells proteins and polysaccharides was alleviated with the negative potential imposed membrane moreover both the bacteria clusters pink and β polysaccharides blue were found to coexist or overlap on many regions of the membrane surface fig 7c indicating that biofouling is the formation of mature biofilm layer or the accumulation of eps on the membrane surface ng et al 2006 on the surface of pac with 1 0 v the pollutants content was all reduced along with the coexist or overlap breaking thus the membrane pore sizes would be exposed correspondingly the unblocked pores represented by the black area in fig 7d account for 35 3 of the total membrane surface in control mbr 78 5 pores of the membrane were still observed with 1 0 v bias which corresponded to the results of tmp variation above results suggested that pac with 1 0 v bias had obviously alleviated the membrane fouling especially β polysaccharides were more likely to be decomposed compared with other pollutants among these four types of pollutants at the same time the content of α polysaccharides accounted for a large part of the cake layer with the proportion of 46 in mbr and 47 in embr 3 5 microbial community analysis as presented in fig s4a the betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria group at the class level respectively accounting for 47 42 13 69 and 13 03 were the main microbial community in initial activated sludge within the syntrophic community after 74 day culturation in a fixed environment the microbial community structure gradually changed for good growing compared the initial distribution bacteria belong to gammaproteobacteria bacteroidia alphaproteobacteria and gemmatimonadetes group were the dominant species in both mbr and embr fig 8 a the electrochemical environment did not cause the obvious variation of microbial community on distribution at the class level between mbr and embr however there was a little difference on community proportion they successively accounted for 87 76 7 46 1 51 and 1 39 of the syntrophic community in mbr and 83 72 10 88 1 45 and 1 04 in embr the total proportion of these four groups reached 98 12 in mbr and 97 10 in embr it can be said the four groups of microbial community become absolute dominant species after 74 day operation at the genus level fig s4b azohydromonas 38 17 dokdonella 4 36 paracoccus 2 20 occupied the main microbial community in initial activated sludge within the syntrophic community dokdonella is a completely aerobic denitrifier which has been categorized among nitrogen removing organisms du et al 2017 pishgar et al 2019 however the genus dokdonella significantly decreased in abundance from 4 36 to 0 16 and 0 13 of the total relative abundance in the microbial community in the mbr and embr respectively fig 8b above results indicated another means was needed for n further removal among them the biggest difference in distribution is azohydromonas which obviously increased from 38 17 to 76 12 of the total relative abundance in the microbial community in the mbr fig 8b in embr azohydromonas with 67 82 also was the absolute dominant species at genus level fig 8b previous studies indicated that the members of the genus azohydromonas can act as storage materia for the principal fatty acids in addition to cells accumulating poly β hydroxybutyrate granules xie et al 2005 the members are able to fix nitrogen and grow autotrophically with hydrogen xie et al 2005 another main top species was ferruginibacter and luteimonas with the respectively proportion of 5 98 and 3 87 in mbr after 74 days operation fig 8b the percentages of above two communities were 8 72 and 5 12 in embr ferruginibacter was usually found to be core genera in multiple activated samples from biological wastewater treatment plant caporaso et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 which was reported to hydrolyze some organic matter lim et al 2009 luteimonas was the main denitrifying genera in wastewater treatment plant blažková et al 2017 park et al 2011 vaz moreira et al 2007 meanwhile the members of luteimonas were cold adapted vaz moreira et al 2007 above mentioned relative abundance of microbial community could be one of the main reasons for improved cod and nh4 n removal efficiency it is worth noting that the zoogloea under the stimulation of electrochemical environment owned a percentage of 0 95 in embr which was a little higher than that in mbr with the proportion of 0 62 the increased content of genus zoogloea with applying the bias on the membranes could form characteristic cell aggregates often calling zoogloeal matrices fig 8b they embed in extracellular gelatinous matrices and are mainly responsible for the flocculation activated sludge dugan et al 1992 rosselló mora et al 1995 the increasing of zoogloea from another perspective would relieve the membrane fouling by providing colloidal substances to absorb fine particles 4 conclusion in this study an embr was successfully constructed with pani based carbon membrane as the basic electrode and separation unit simultaneously under 1 0 v bias the oh was in situ generated without metal catalyst from activation of h2o2 depending on graphitic n and pyridinic n as the active sites during the 74 day operation applying electric field obviously suppressed membrane fouling levels via driving off the foulants from the membrane surface or oxidizing mineralizing pollutants deeply in the pores mainly including the total cell proteins β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides therefore after operation the unblocked pores accounted for 78 5 of the total membrane surface in embr which was higher than that of mbr 35 3 meanwhile electrochemical repulsion effect together with oh oxidation endowed embr the highest cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies close to 100 specifically the average cod and nh4 n removal rates of embr and mbr were 96 23 97 29 and 93 40 95 96 respectively from an application point of view the electro enhanced mbr with pac membrane could be a potential sustainable strategy for in situ membrane fouling control and wastewater treatment via oh oxidation without adding any external chemicals compared to iron based electro fenton which could avoid the production of secondary pollutant metal sludge however the scale up studies concerning this type electro enhanced mbr with pac membrane deserve

15929,an electro enhanced membrane bioreactor embr was constructed with polyaniline based carbon pac separation membrane as the membrane electrode which could realize the in situ electro generation and activation of h2o2 to oh depending on the graphitic and pyridinic n as active sites without metal catalyst after the continuous operation of the bioreactor for 74 days approximately 77 41 irreversible membrane fouling occurred on the electrochemically enhanced membrane which was less than that on the control membrane 85 96 the oh oxidation combined with electrostatic barrier formed by 1 0 v enhanced pac membrane suppressed the extracellular polymeric substances deposition on membrane after operation the strength of total cell proteins β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides on the membrane without bias were 5 17 4 32 9 65 and 16 31 respectively in embr the corresponding strength were 2 03 3 35 2 15 and 6 73 after calculation the unblocked pores accounted for 35 3 and 78 5 of the total membrane surface in mbr and embr respectively indicating the fouling was alleviated obviously meanwhile the embr owned a satisfactory wastewater treatment effect with average effluent chemical oxygen demand and nh4 n around 18 98 mg l and 0 68 mg l the successful implementation of this strategy achieved a green and metal free method for oh production with electrochemical effect for membrane fouling control in mbr graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane electrode oh electric field membrane fouling embr 1 introduction the multiple advantages such as high effluent ssquality small footprint and effective biomass retention of membrane bioreactor mbr make it a promising process for wastewater treatment zhang et al 2020 whereas membrane fouling accompanied by transmembrane pressure tmp increasing and permeate flux decreasing is an inevitable challenge which restricts the application of mbr charfi et al 2012 wang et al 2014 biogas sparging and membrane cleaning replacement were usually conducted for membrane fouling control liu et al 2019 muhammad et al 2014 to a certain degree these strategies would increase the cost of mbr operation hence based on high separation effectiveness and large permeability coefficient improving the membranes anti fouling performance is significant for mbr application to date electrochemical assisted membrane separation is recognized as an environmental friendly and cost effective means to alleviate membrane fouling gharibian and hazrati 2022 electrochemical repulsion could repel the pollutants with the same charges far from the membranes and then reduce their adhesion the electrodynamic and electrowetting phenomena exhibited by some materials also help to improve the separation performance of the membranes sun et al 2013 yang et al 2011 particularly parts of materials could participate in the reaction for oh o2 ho2 production under the electrochemistry which own the ability of removing the contaminants by oxidization or mineralization voinov et al 2011 yang et al 2013 among them oh with a high reactive shows a great potential in wastewater treatment soil remediation etc and involving in plenty of physiological processes gligorovski et al 2015 voinov et al 2011 yang et al 2013 electro fenton is one of the traditional oh generation method under electro assistance li et al 2017 during the electro fenton process for oh generation h2o2 was firstly produced by two electron reduction of dissolved oxygen on the cathode subsequently transformed into oh by the reaction h2o2 and fe3 li et al 2017 however there are inevitable disadvantages of metal leaching and loss which affects the growth of microorganisms and causes secondary pollution in effluent hartmann et al 2010 it is very important to establish a green and metal free method for oh production with electrochemical effect previous researches reported that the polyaniline pani with graphite like structure derived carbonaceous materials could conveniently introduce different nitrogen including pyrrolic graphitic and pyridinic n etc into carbon framework during the process of high temperature pyrolysis wu et al 2011 among them graphitic n and pyridinic n were considered to be the active sites for h2o2 production and its activation to oh su et al 2019 these interesting pioneering discoveries encouraged us to develop metal free membrane with oh production under electrochemistry for membrane fouling control eliminating the need for metal catalyst will resolve the intrinsic drawback of secondary pollution which would ultimately reduce the operation cost for successfully practicing this strategy of applying metal free electro fenton membranes to membrane fouling mitigation in mbr the pani need be prepared with graphite like structure it could introduce pyridinic n and graphitic n into the carbon framework as well as abundant pores which provide carbon membranes with pani as precursor guarantee in permeability from the appearance of pani materials tubular structure or filament structure are preferred to endow membranes a certain degree of flexibility and mechanical strength therefore aim to practice a green and metal free method for oh production with electrochemical effect for membrane fouling control based on pani the performance and the efficiency of oh production of pani based carbon separation membranes remain to be verified and explored as well as the feasibility of using it as the basic separation unit in mbr therefore this research developed a new type of pani based carbon pac membrane the pani was synthesized with aniline as substrate then koh as a green activating agent was used for modifying the material surface properties to enhance the efficiency of in situ generation of h2o2 and its activation to oh su et al 2019 yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 to explore the anti fouling performance a mbr system was constructed with pac membrane as the separation unit and cathode simultaneously during the operation the relationship among electrochemical effect anti fouling ability and characteristics of microorganisms was systematically researched here the successful implementation of this idea will provide a green and environmentally friendly membrane fouling mitigation strategy and lay a certain theoretical foundation for the practical application of electrochemical technology coupled with mbr process 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of pani derived carbons and pac membranes the pani derived carbons were synthesized by chemical polymerization and carbonization masuko et al 2005 firstly pani was made from the polymerization of aniline and ammonium persulfate 98 specifically 60 ml aqueous solution with ammonium persulfate 3 423 g was named as a 60 ml aqueous solution with 1 1 ml aniline was named as b quickly adding a to b under stirring then reaction for 24 h to form pani then the pani solution was washed by pure water until neuter freeze dryer was used to completely removed water of pani subsequently pani derived carbons were obtained by calcinating in a flow of nitrogen 40 sccm at 1000 c for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 in order to enhance the efficiency of in situ generation of h2o2 and its activation to oh yang et al 2018 2019 koh and pani were mixed with the proportion of 2 1 and calcinated in a flow of nitrogen 40 sccm at 700 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 finally the aimed pani derived carbons were washed by 2 m hcl following by pure water until neuter and then dried by freeze dryer the pac membrane was fabricated by loading pani derived carbons 10 mg on the ceramic substrate 300 400 nm and calcinated in a flow of nitrogen 40 sccm at 600 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 to strengthen the binding force between materials and substrate 2 2 characterization the morphology of the pani was observed by scanning electron microscope sem fesem hitachi s 8010 on a microscope with 1 0 nm resolution at 5 kv the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the membrane was evaluated by automatic contact angle meter sl200b kono industrial co ltd usa the pore size of membrane was measured by pore size tester poroluxtm1000 porometer germany dmpo spin trapping electron spin resonance esr spectra was used to record the production of oh with 1 0 v enhanced membrane as cathode the pure water permeate flux was an average value by measuring three times of parallel pure water flux at a constant pressure of 0 2 bar it was calculated as follows 1 j v a δ t where j is the permeation flux l m 2 h 1 v is the volume of the permeate l a is the membrane area m2 and δt is the permeate collection interval h the rejection ratios r could be calculated by the following equation 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp ware the pollutants concentration in influent and in effluent respectively 2 3 electro fenton degradation experiment the feasibility of the electro fenton enhanced pac membrane for pollutants removal and membrane fouling control was verified by filtrating the supernatant of the bioreactor the initial chemical oxygen demand cod of the target was around 70 mg l the removal rate of cod and permeate flux of pac membrane were recorded to evaluate the performance of electro fenton enhanced pac for each group of samples the tests were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility the stability and reusability of pac membrane were also evaluated by the flux recovery f r which was calculated by the following equation 3 f r j m i j m 1 100 where j m 1 is the initial membrane flux j m i is the flux of membrane after recovery 2 4 embr setup and operation fig 1 presents the schematic diagram of the laboratory scale electro fenton enhanced bioreactor embr two parallel bioreactors with 2 0 l working volume were constructed to compare the performance of electro enhanced pac membrane on membrane fouling control for embr pac membrane with 1 0 v was used as the basic separation unit the pac membrane was used as the cathode membrane with the total effective area 1 256 10 3 m2 and the titanium mesh with the dimension of 10 cm 10 cm was choose as anode the sludge in bioreactor was taken from wastewater treatment plant in dalian the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids were maintained as 3000 mg l ph was set around 7 8 by adding nahco3 in the influent dissolved oxygen was kept at 2 4 mg l by air pump hydraulic retention time hrt was 8 h in this study the feed of embr and mbr was simulated municipal wastewater and the compositions were presented in supporting information for the control group mbr experimental setup without potential was maintained a high degree of consistency to the embr in other aspects membranes in both mbr and embr would be conducted hydraulic cleaning each 15 days the extracellular polymeric substances eps including bound eps beps and soluble eps seps also known as soluble microbial products smp as an important factor for reveal the anti fouling mechanisms was mainly focused by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fl4500 hitachi japan seps or smp was from supernatant or effluent and beps was extracted from sludge or cake layer in our experiments the seps from supernatant or effluent has been named as smp and the eps here specifically refers to beps from activated sludge meanwhile the carbohydrate and proteins in seps and beps have been named as smpc smpp and epsc epsp respectively among them the carbohydrate content in seps and beps was measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as a standard masuko et al 2005 the protein content in seps and beps was determined by the bradford method brunelle and green 2014 using bovine serum albumin as a standard moreover the relationship between electrochemical environment and microbial community was researched by high throughput 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing the pyrosequencing was carried out using illumina high throughput sequencing on the miseq platform sangon biotech shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pani derived carbons and pac membrane as previous reports showed the pani nanostructures ranging from the typical fibers tubes and particles to more exotic leafs cubes etc have been successfully documented by self assembly methods han et al 2007 huang et al 2003a qiu et al 2001 stejskal et al 2004 herein nanofibers structure of pani is preferred for forming interconnected and porous conducting network as sem images presented the pani derived carbons with the morphology of cross linked nanofibers have been perfectly prepared fig 2 a even experiencing high temperature pyrolysis with koh zhu et al 2014 cross linking structure of conducting nanofibers was convenient to reduce the internal resistance thereby improve electron transfer at the same time the widened macro pores caused by cross linking and koh activation were beneficial to increase the accessible active and the specific surface area which could enhance reaction by facilitating mass transfer of reactants to the active sites haider et al 2019 from the perspective of practical application the cross linking structure to some extent could provide guarantee for the flexibility of the formed membranes another feature such as chemical composition of the pani derived carbons was analyzed by elemental mapping in fig 2b d indicating c n and o with a uniform distribution were the main elements surface chemistry of this electrode membrane has been gained insights by further x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis in fig 2e three peaks including c1s o1s and n1s were presented in the spectra of pani derived carbons revealing that the materials were successfully doped with element n specifically one main peak appeared at 284 65 ev c c in the c1s spectra of pani derived carbons fig 2f after pani pyrolysis corresponding to graphitic sp2 c atoms indicating successful carbonization of pani derived carbons composite lu et al 2017 another two main peaks were readily identified at 285 6 and 286 85 ev relating to c n and c oh tong et al 2014 these two peaks illustrated n and o functional groups had been successfully incorporated into the carbon matrix in addition the n1s spectra of pani derived carbons was deconvoluted into four characteristic peaks located at 398 6 400 4 401 5 and 402 5 ev fig 2g which were correspondingly attributed to pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and pyridinic n oxides zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 as mentioned before graphitic n and pyridinic n could be used as the active sites for h2o2 generation and its activation to oh su et al 2019 pac membranes based on pani derived carbons were simultaneously conducted as the basic separation unit and cathode under bias oh as the main active substance oxidants was produced from activation of in situ generation h2o2 which generated from simultaneously catalyzing by pac cathode the generation of oh was recorded by dmpo spin trap esr spectra as presented in fig 2h four typical peaks appeared in esr spectra with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 which was a characteristic peak of dmpo oh complex hartmann et al 2010 the specific production process was described in fig 2i graphitic n was firstly used as the active site for converting adsorbed oxygen to h2o2 via 2e orr process at pac membrane cathode surface liu et al 2016 su et al 2019 subsequently oh would be generated by transferring an electron to h2o2 with pyridinic n as an active site on the membrane surface su et al 2019 if some of the produced h2o2 was released and then accumulated in the bulk solution which could still be activated to oh by once touching on the pac cathode surface during the material preparation process carbonization could introduce the defects and edges to serve as another active sites for enhancing catalysis process duan et al 2016 hu et al 2017 yang et al 2018 accordingly the generated oh existed on the pac membrane could directly attack the pollutants adsorbed on the membrane surface or deeply in the pores degrading them into corresponding by products oh produced on around the separation unit owned a weak effect on the microorganisms because the lifetime 20 ns and diffusion length 6 nm of oh is very short zhou et al 2019 that is the main reason for choosing oh as strategy to mitigate membrane fouling other basic properties of the pac membranes were presented in fig s1 contact angle is the angle of gas liquid and solid three phase when micro droplets touching solid sample surface which can characterize membrane hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity for the materials with hydrophilicity the strength of hydrophilicity also could be represented by the spread out speed of water droplet as seen in fig s1a a water droplet 2 μl was completely spread out the pac membrane after 93 ms on the raw membrane about 142 ms was demanded to adsorb the water droplet indicating that the prepared pac membrane has good hydrophilicity kota et al 2012 fig s1b indicates the membranes owned a certain degree of conductivity the average pore sizes of the pac membrane and the raw substrate were approximately 255 9 nm and 281 6 nm respectively the pure water permeate flux of pac membrane was 629 3 l m2 h bar which was a little higher than that of the raw substrate 617 03 l m2 h bar even with a small pore size the reasons could be attributed to the ability of fast transmission of water through carbon materials according to the results of dynamic water contact angle kota et al 2012 wang et al 2007 overall the pac membranes exhibited a relatively better performance from the results of the basic membrane features 3 2 degradation of pollutants by electro enhanced pac membrane the pollutants removal and membrane fouling performance were researched by filtrating the supernatant of the bioreactor with the initial cod of 71 21 mg l overall over 30 of cod from the pollutants could be removed by the interrupting of membranes pores from fig 3 a smaller pore size of pac membranes than the raw substrate could make an obviously enhanced pollutants retaining phenomenon with the cod removal efficiency higher than 40 maybe the adsorption effect of carbon materials also could contribute to the part of cod removal xin et al 2019 however the degradation efficiency of supernatant remained above 67 when applied 1 0 v bias on the pac membrane as previously explained oh produced from activation of h2o2 could help to pollutant degradation haider et al 2019 different kinds of by products from oh degradation possibly made up the remained cod which also could be partly prevented by the membranes therefore this part of by products combined with the pollutants could not be degraded together caused the flux loss of the pac membrane under bias as shown in fig 3b the loss of pure water permeate flux on the 1 0 v enhanced pac membrane was about 153 41 l m2 h bar which was less than those on pac membrane 247 61 l m2 h bar and the raw substrate 330 3 l m2 h bar above results revealed that using electro enhanced pac membrane as cathode could oxidize remove pollutants and mitigate membrane fouling in a metal free oxidation system furthermore this in situ fabricated material without any binder could remain stable for long term operation 3 3 wastewater treatment evaluation of embr fig 4 exhibits the wastewater treatment performance of the embr and mbr during the whole 74 day operation the parallel embr and mbr were continuously fed by simulated municipal wastewater the influent organic strength was stabilized around 500 mg l at an hrt of 8 h the quality of effluent was examined every two days during the period of operation mainly including cod and nh4 n concentration as shown in fig 4a both mbr and embr owned outstanding effluent quality with the cod removal efficiency over than 87 97 specifically the supernatant cod was between 7 03 mg l and 76 15 mg l average 42 85 mg l resulting in a cod removal efficiency between 98 60 and 85 15 91 48 on average in the bioreactor with electrochemical effect embr in mbr the supernatant cod was around 51 70 mg l and the removal rate could obtain about 96 01 from day 60 to 74 it can be speculated electrochemistry as the main difference between mbr and embr could influence the cod removal performance at the same time the residual cod and some high molecular polymers secreted in vitro by microorganism namely extracellular polymeric substances eps including smp combining with suspended particulate matter sludge floc etc will flow out with the effluent among them the main components of eps smp are similar to the intracellular components of microorganisms they are some high molecular substances such as polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids generally eps smp is usually considered to be the main pollutant for forming membrane fouling meng et al 2017 zhang and jiang 2019 the effluent quality could be further improved by the membrane separation the effluent cod was between 7 03 mg l and 59 70 mg l average 33 19 mg l resulting in a cod removal efficiency between 98 60 and 87 97 93 40 on average in mbr it was obviously 7 42 mg l 39 49 mg l lower than supernatant cod especially in embr the highest removal efficiencies of 100 was observed under negative bias the pollutants would be deeply oxidized or mineralized by in situ oh from pani derived carbons when they passed through the membranes su et al 2019 yang et al 2018 2019 non degraded compounds from the original feed and microbial secretions oxidation by product with the diameter less than membranes pore size will became the main source of effluent cod in mbr systems it could be designed systematically from the view of extending the time of through membrane or increasing the oh production efficiency for further reducing the effluent cod fig 4b presents nh4 n removal efficiencies in mbr and embr overall the effluent nh4 n concentration of mbr and embr were relatively steady in mbr the supernatant nh4 n and effluent nh4 n were relatively stable with a changeless influent strength of 25 mg l and constant hrt of 8 h they were around 1 53 mg l in supernatant and 1 00 mg l in effluent indicating the mbr had a good nitrification with the average nh4 n removal rates around 95 96 similar to the cod removal results nitrification in the embr gradually improved with the supernatant nh4 n around 1 27 mg l which was 0 26 mg l lower than that in mbr because of applying electrochemical effect on the system feng et al 2017 the lower supernatant nh4 n at the same time would contribute to reduce the effluent nh4 n on one hand which was around 0 68 mg l on the other hand the supernatant nh4 n would be further oxidized by oh when it passed through the membrane feng et al 2003 in most bioreactors the utilization by microorganisms is the leading role for nh4 n removal however the enhanced microbial activity along with oh oxidation ensure a good nh4 n removal in embr according to above results 3 4 membrane fouling mitigation in embr fig 5 shows the variations of tmp and corresponding membrane permeate flux in embr and control mbr over the operation time during the 74 days of operation tmp was progressively increased from 0 5 to 1 0 bar in five operational stages of all bioreactors with the influent cod around 500 mg l overall the tmp of each cycle was gradually increased with the operation indicating the membrane filtrating ability was lost gradually subsequently it would be rapidly recovering after hydraulic cleaning correspondingly the membrane permeate flux owned an opposite variation with gradually decreasing followed by rapidly improvement after hydraulic cleaning because the interactions between pollutants and the membranes could cause the membrane permeability loss and the tmp increasing blanpain avet et al 2009 lyko et al 2008 skouteris et al 2012 specifically in mbr the tmp increased from 0 6 to 0 89 bar day 1 15 in cycle 1 from 0 7 to 0 92 bar day 16 30 in cycle 2 from 0 8 to 0 95 bar day 31 45 in cycle 3 from 0 85 to 0 96 bar day 46 60 in cycle 4 and from 0 9 to 0 973 bar day 61 74 in cycle 5 table s1 in embr the corresponding tmp variation were from 0 5 to 0 8 bar from 0 68 to 0 86 bar from 0 7 to 0 89 bar from 0 8 to 0 95 bar and from 0 8 to 0 95 bar respectively comparing the first few days of the operation in each cycle a higher and higher initial tmp could be observed both in mbr and embr demonstrating the content of irreversible membrane fouling has heightened which could not be recovered by hydraulic cleaning the values on pac membrane were always higher than those of membrane in embr which demonstrated a better filtrating performance of electro enhanced pac membrane than the control group the prosperities of membrane in embr were almost the same as membrane in mbr however the initial the 1st day tmp in embr was lower than those in mbr it is because that the electrophoretic phenomena such as electrophoresis electroosmosis and electromigration and electrowetting phenomena exhibited by the material under electric bias could help to improve the membrane separation performance sun et al 2013 yang et al 2011 from the results of membrane permeate flux it was 12 62 l m2 h bar after the fourth time hydraulic cleaning in embr after calculation about 77 41 irreversible membrane fouling was occurred on the electrochemically enhanced membrane which was less than that on the control membrane 85 96 this could be attributed to the electrochemical effect which contributed electrons for membrane to produce h2o2 and then activated it to oh su et al 2019 yang et al 2018 2019 the oh promoted the membrane fouling mitigation by in situ pollutants oxidation on the membrane surface or in the deep pores meanwhile the negative bias formed a barrier to repel some negatively charged pollutants mainly released soluble microbial products smp far from the membranes thereby reducing the membrane fouling rates eps including beps and seps smp are products of the metabolism of microorganisms and well known as the main pollutants responsible for leading biological foulants and cake layer flemming et al 1997 ramesh et al 2007 smp and eps are prevalent in the interior and surface of biomass flocs they are polymers of some macromolecules such as carbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids most of which have negative charges sheng et al 2010 among them beps located outside cell surfaces played an essential role in aggregating cells into flocs or granules along with accumulating enzymes for cell utilization and cell cell communication chang and lee 1998 laspidou et al 2002 zheng et al 2018 importantly these secreted products seps also can build a protective barrier for microbial cells to resist unfavorable environments wingender et al 1999 therefore taking a deep insight into the variation of electrochemical effect on smp and eps will be beneficial to clear the membrane fouling mitigation mechanisms in the mbr coupled with electrochemical environment also be help to understand the reasons for the performance variation of mbr in electrochemical environment in this study eps involving smp was critically researched by eem fluorescence spectroscopy and ultraviolet spectrophotometry the relationships between the evolution of membrane fouling and eps smp variation were also discussed the characteristics of the extracted foulants from the samples in embr were further analyzed compared to those in control mbr among plenty of analyses proteins and polysaccharides were gave specific attention to clarify the relative importance of these components to forming membrane fouling in fig s2a the average proteins concentrations in supernatant smpp from mbr were 2 15 mg l 12 17 mg l and 22 68 mg l at 15 30 and 45 days they were 3 51 mg l 17 91 mg l and 24 53 mg l in embr respectively the content of secreted smpp has increased with the stimulating of electrochemical environment however the tmp will rapidly increase with responding to the smpp incensement because the accumulation of smp attaching on membrane surface or deeply in pores could largely reduce membrane permeability in principle actually the epsp content on in membranes was 32 31 mg l in embr at 45 days which was lower than that in mbr 65 29 mg l the possible explanation for the decreased epsp on in membrane must be related to the oxidation of oh coupling the repulsion during filtrating phase resulting in the alleviation bio foulants aggregation and deposition meanwhile correspondingly average 0 mg l 5 93 mg l and 12 16 mg l of the epsp had been separated by membrane in embr effluent the decreased smpp were 2 92 mg l 14 30 mg l and 22 09 mg l at 15 30 and 45 days above varying smpp concentrations demonstrated an alleviated membrane fouling and enhanced effluent quality by the oxidation effect coupling with membrane separation in embr the polysaccharides content in eps and smp were recognized as epsc and smpc here respectively as shown in fig s2d f the overall difference or trend of epsc and smpc was similar with the variation of epsp and smpp in mbr the supernatant smpc were 21 07 mg l 17 21 mg l and 33 19 mg l and the effluent smpc were 21 92 mg l 16 53 mg l and 17 54 mg l at 15 30 and 45 days in embr the supernatant smpc and effluent smpc were 62 80 10 81 mg l 49 68 4 08 mg l and 34 20 9 64 mg l respectively at 15 30 and 45 days meanwhile epsc on in membrane were 235 99 mg l in embr and 297 50 mg l in mbr epsc with negative charged carboxylic acid and phosphoric acid groups could be well excluded by 1 0 v bias enhanced pac cai et al 2004 therefore exceeding 60 mg l epsc was reduced on pac in embr than mbr causing an obviously membrane fouling mitigation aim to explore the variations in characteristics of eps smp under electrochemical environment eem fluorescence spectroscopy of the smp from supernatant and effluent eps from membrane surface pores at 45 days in the two systems were illustrated in fig 6 two main peaks were obviously appearing from the fluorescence spectra of smp in supernatant as shown in fig 6a and b one peak a was located around the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 275 280 332 350 nm which was related to tryptophan protein like substances chen et al 2003 the second main peak b was readily identified at the ex em of 235 240 338 342 nm which was attributed to the simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine baker 2001 the strength of smp was higher in embr than that in mbr which was consistent with the results of fig s2a and d after electrochemical effect in embr the substance of simple aromatic protein has been well removed by oh through 15 days of accumulation the content of protein like substances still at a low level as shown in fig 6c however both simple aromatic proteins and tryptophan protein like substances on in the membrane of mbr have obviously increased previous study showed that the protein like substances indicated by both peak a and b were easily biodegraded by microorganisms for energy requirements and growth he et al 2011 huang et al 2011 meanwhile the protein like substances including tyrosine like peak a and tryptophan like peak b especially the tryptophan protein like substances could be more easily retained captured by the membranes leading to serious membrane fouling wang et al 2009 for embr higher smp content in supernatant but lower deposition on in membrane compared with the eps variation in mbr was in favor of system stability and membrane fouling control after separation all eps and smp content have reduced in effluent as expressed in fig 6e and f another peak appearing in the ex em of 290 350 410 435 nm peak c was also observed which was described as visible humic acid like fluorescence chen et al 2003 actually the humic acid like substance was always existing with covering by the high strength of protein like substance in supernatant fig s3a and b however almost no humic acid like substances could be found on the membrane both in embr and mbr because it could pass the membranes more easily wang et al 2009 it is worth noting that electrochemical effect enhanced bioreactors could completely remove the humic acid like substances without existing in effluent hence it was logical to speculate that the reduced eps smp content and the composition variation of the eps smp under electrochemical environment have a great significance to membrane fouling alleviation confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to characterize the sludge cake layer on membrane after operation the content of total cells pink proteins green β polysaccharides blue and α polysaccharides red in the sludge cake layer were measured by fluorescence intensities with different color the specific percentages of different pollutant and membrane porosity were further summarized in table 1 as presented in fig 7 a the strength of total cell proteins β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides on the membrane without bias were 5 17 4 32 9 65 and 16 31 respectively the total fluorescence intensities of pac membrane in embr fig 7b were significantly weaker than those of the control membrane with the strength of total cell proteins β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides being 2 03 3 35 2 15 and 6 73 the results are provided by shiyanjia lab www shiyanjia com showing that the fouling mainly consisting of cells proteins and polysaccharides was alleviated with the negative potential imposed membrane moreover both the bacteria clusters pink and β polysaccharides blue were found to coexist or overlap on many regions of the membrane surface fig 7c indicating that biofouling is the formation of mature biofilm layer or the accumulation of eps on the membrane surface ng et al 2006 on the surface of pac with 1 0 v the pollutants content was all reduced along with the coexist or overlap breaking thus the membrane pore sizes would be exposed correspondingly the unblocked pores represented by the black area in fig 7d account for 35 3 of the total membrane surface in control mbr 78 5 pores of the membrane were still observed with 1 0 v bias which corresponded to the results of tmp variation above results suggested that pac with 1 0 v bias had obviously alleviated the membrane fouling especially β polysaccharides were more likely to be decomposed compared with other pollutants among these four types of pollutants at the same time the content of α polysaccharides accounted for a large part of the cake layer with the proportion of 46 in mbr and 47 in embr 3 5 microbial community analysis as presented in fig s4a the betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria group at the class level respectively accounting for 47 42 13 69 and 13 03 were the main microbial community in initial activated sludge within the syntrophic community after 74 day culturation in a fixed environment the microbial community structure gradually changed for good growing compared the initial distribution bacteria belong to gammaproteobacteria bacteroidia alphaproteobacteria and gemmatimonadetes group were the dominant species in both mbr and embr fig 8 a the electrochemical environment did not cause the obvious variation of microbial community on distribution at the class level between mbr and embr however there was a little difference on community proportion they successively accounted for 87 76 7 46 1 51 and 1 39 of the syntrophic community in mbr and 83 72 10 88 1 45 and 1 04 in embr the total proportion of these four groups reached 98 12 in mbr and 97 10 in embr it can be said the four groups of microbial community become absolute dominant species after 74 day operation at the genus level fig s4b azohydromonas 38 17 dokdonella 4 36 paracoccus 2 20 occupied the main microbial community in initial activated sludge within the syntrophic community dokdonella is a completely aerobic denitrifier which has been categorized among nitrogen removing organisms du et al 2017 pishgar et al 2019 however the genus dokdonella significantly decreased in abundance from 4 36 to 0 16 and 0 13 of the total relative abundance in the microbial community in the mbr and embr respectively fig 8b above results indicated another means was needed for n further removal among them the biggest difference in distribution is azohydromonas which obviously increased from 38 17 to 76 12 of the total relative abundance in the microbial community in the mbr fig 8b in embr azohydromonas with 67 82 also was the absolute dominant species at genus level fig 8b previous studies indicated that the members of the genus azohydromonas can act as storage materia for the principal fatty acids in addition to cells accumulating poly β hydroxybutyrate granules xie et al 2005 the members are able to fix nitrogen and grow autotrophically with hydrogen xie et al 2005 another main top species was ferruginibacter and luteimonas with the respectively proportion of 5 98 and 3 87 in mbr after 74 days operation fig 8b the percentages of above two communities were 8 72 and 5 12 in embr ferruginibacter was usually found to be core genera in multiple activated samples from biological wastewater treatment plant caporaso et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 which was reported to hydrolyze some organic matter lim et al 2009 luteimonas was the main denitrifying genera in wastewater treatment plant blažková et al 2017 park et al 2011 vaz moreira et al 2007 meanwhile the members of luteimonas were cold adapted vaz moreira et al 2007 above mentioned relative abundance of microbial community could be one of the main reasons for improved cod and nh4 n removal efficiency it is worth noting that the zoogloea under the stimulation of electrochemical environment owned a percentage of 0 95 in embr which was a little higher than that in mbr with the proportion of 0 62 the increased content of genus zoogloea with applying the bias on the membranes could form characteristic cell aggregates often calling zoogloeal matrices fig 8b they embed in extracellular gelatinous matrices and are mainly responsible for the flocculation activated sludge dugan et al 1992 rosselló mora et al 1995 the increasing of zoogloea from another perspective would relieve the membrane fouling by providing colloidal substances to absorb fine particles 4 conclusion in this study an embr was successfully constructed with pani based carbon membrane as the basic electrode and separation unit simultaneously under 1 0 v bias the oh was in situ generated without metal catalyst from activation of h2o2 depending on graphitic n and pyridinic n as the active sites during the 74 day operation applying electric field obviously suppressed membrane fouling levels via driving off the foulants from the membrane surface or oxidizing mineralizing pollutants deeply in the pores mainly including the total cell proteins β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides therefore after operation the unblocked pores accounted for 78 5 of the total membrane surface in embr which was higher than that of mbr 35 3 meanwhile electrochemical repulsion effect together with oh oxidation endowed embr the highest cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies close to 100 specifically the average cod and nh4 n removal rates of embr and mbr were 96 23 97 29 and 93 40 95 96 respectively from an application point of view the electro enhanced mbr with pac membrane could be a potential sustainable strategy for in situ membrane fouling control and wastewater treatment via oh oxidation without adding any external chemicals compared to iron based electro fenton which could avoid the production of secondary pollutant metal sludge however the scale up studies concerning this type electro enhanced mbr with pac membrane deserve
