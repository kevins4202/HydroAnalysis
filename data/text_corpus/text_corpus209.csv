1045,benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in six habitats in the yellow river delta wetlands including the intertidal zone suaeda salsa area phragmites australis shoal p australis deep beach tamarix chinensis area and inland river beach were sampled and analyzed in summer and autumn the results showed that the richness and diversity indices of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms were higher in autumn than in summer differences in the vegetation coverage of different habitats were the main factors affecting the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in addition the study provided a new respect of the interaction between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms based the life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates and found that the life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates had varied effects on the distribution of microorganisms the study suggested that the interactions of organisms were important factors affecting and regulating the ecosystem functions of wetlands keywords benthic macroinvertebrate community structure microorganism wetland introduction wetlands are the special natural complex formed by the interactions between water and land mou et al 2015 and play important roles in flood storage drought prevention climate regulation environmental remediation and maintenance of regional ecological balance mclaughlin and cohen 2013 woodward and wui 2001 the components of the wetland ecosystem i e producers consumers decomposers and abiotic factors determine the functions of the wetlands wilson and mitsch 1996 and are inter related and interdependent because of the rich biodiversity and complex nutrient structure of this ecosystem wetlands have stronger self regulation ability than other ecosystems and the mutual response of each component to the wetland ecosystem is more complex as important consumers and decomposers in wetland ecosystems benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms play important roles both in the cycling of soil elements and the biogeochemical cycle of the sediment water interface cannicci et al 2008 ligi et al 2014 liu et al 2012 papanikolaou et al 2010 benthic macroinvertebrates are characterized by abundant species wide distribution extensive physiological adaptation characteristics and diverse nutrient relationships thompson and lowe 2004 wu et al 2014 moreover benthic macroinvertebrates respond rapidly to changes in habitat and are the basis of the nutrient cycle and ecological balance in the ecosystem lee 2008 the community structure and function of soil microorganisms also change rapidly with variations in environmental conditions soil microorganisms modulate the physical and chemical properties of soil and the functions of the ecosystem drissner et al 2010 madsen 2005 several studies have discussed the roles of different water environments and seasons in the diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates angradi et al 2001 brraich and kaur 2017 obolewski et al 2014 quan et al 2008 and the responses of the microbial community structure to soil and water environments huang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 taubert et al 2017 wang et al 2016 benthic macroinvertebrates have also been shown to contribute to the element cycle ahmed and holmström 2015 hou et al 2014 kamaz et al 2018 however few studies have reported the relationships between consumers and decomposers and the correlations between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in wetland ecosystems according to previous studies the community distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates is dramatically affected by the wetland environment the community distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates changes with variations in water temperature dissolved oxygen and water depth among other factors long et al 2018 the content of organic matter is also related to the abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates inagaki et al 2012 additionally the behavior and activities of benthic macroinvertebrates affect the community structure of microorganisms there are significant differences in the species and relative abundance of bacterial taxa in sediments of different benthic macroinvertebrates doustshenas et al 2009 for example active macrofauna can entrain fresh organic matter subduction to deeper sediment layers witte and kamp 2005 and the activity and abundance of microorganisms are elevated around burrows of burrowing benthos kristensen and kostka 2005 thus microorganisms in wetland ecosystems affect the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates by modulating the trophic status of aquatic ecosystems the presence of benthic macrofauna stimulates microbial nutrient dynamics through different types of animal microbe interactions stief 2013 therefore the ecological functions of wetlands are not only affected by the benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms alone but could also be regulated and controlled by interactions between them studying the factors of interaction between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms is essential for exploring the biogeochemical cycle process improving the ecological function of wetlands and facilitating wetland ecological restoration strategies the yellow river delta wetland is the most complete broadest and youngest wetland ecosystem in china s warm temperate zone this wetland is important for protection of the newborn wetland ecosystem and endangered birds in the yellow river sun et al 2011 and plays a pivotal role in maintaining regional ecological security and sustainable development hou and li 2015 located at the sea land junction and the intersection of saltwater and freshwater the yellow river delta has extensive area of natural wetlands and constructed wetlands tian 2008 affected by changes in sea water and river diversion the landscape pattern of saltwater wetland near the coastal zone and freshwater wetland along the river has been formed lu et al 2018 therefore the yellow river delta is a good model for the study of wetland biodiversity in various habitats in this study we investigated the effects of seasons and habitats on the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in wetlands at the yellow river delta and explored the interactions of organisms the aims of the present study were to verify that there have significant interactions among plants benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms and these interactions could affect the ecosystem function of the wetlands our findings provided important insights

communities in wetlands in this survey 1798 benthic macroinvertebrates belonging to 57 species 52 genera and 46 families were collected from the 18 sample sites at the six habitats in the yellow river delta wetlands in summer and in autumn among these organisms 1103 benthic macroinvertebrates belonging to 25 species 23 genera and 21 families were collected in summer and 695 benthic macroinvertebrates belonging to 50 species 46 genera and 40 families were collected in autumn arthropoda 47 44 and mollusca 46 38 were the main benthic macroinvertebrates collected malacostraca 25 81 bivalvia 23 47 gastropoda 22 91 and eumetabola 21 19 accounted for more than 80 0 of benthic macroinvertebrates fig 2 according to k s test results table 1 the p values of species number total number margalef richness index shannon wiener diversity index and pielou evenness index of benthic macroinvertebrates in the yellow river delta in summer and autumn were all greater than 0 05 indicating that the community distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates obeyed the normal distribu tion according to t test table 2 of the seasonal variables there were significant differences in the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates between summer and autumn in the yellow river delta wetlands for the whole yellow river delta the species number shannon wiener diversity index margalef richness index and pielou evenness index of benthic macroinvertebrates in autumn were significantly higher than those in summer the species numbers of benthic macroinvertebrates in cjd cjp and tt were significantly higher in autumn than that in summer the increase of species number also increased the margalef richness index in cjp and tt the shannon wiener diversity index and pielou evenness index in tt in autumn were also higher than those in summer however the total numbers of benthic macroinvertebrates in cjp and tt decreased the evenness index of cl in autumn were higher than those in summer there was no significant difference in benthic macroinvertebrates diversity in lwq and lws between two seasons in our analysis of habitats fig 3 there were no significant differences in the richness indices diversity indices and evenness indices between habitats with plant cover i e lwq lws cl and cjp in summer and at this time the habitat with the highest shannon wiener diversity index and margalef richness index in the yellow river delta was cjd whereas that with the lowest values was tt suitable crabs in tt were mostly megalopa li et al 1999 they are not easy to collect and may migrate to freshwater areas that are more suitable and the pielou evenness index was lowest in the tt plot owing to the large number of gammarus in this plot in autumn the richness index and diversity index of lws area with large vegetation coverage were significantly lower than those of cjd and tt areas without plant coverage in order to further explore the impact of habitats on the diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates spearman correlations of benthic macroinvertebrates types and environmental impact factors were analyzed the results table 3 showed that vegetation coverage and dissolved oxygen were the main factors affecting the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in summer vegetation coverage was negatively correlated with the numbers of burrowing and climbing benthic macroinvertebrates and positively correlated with the number of boring macroinvertebrates dissolved oxygen was negatively correlated with the number of burrowing and climbing macroinvertebrates and positively correlated with the number of boring and free moving macroinvertebrates in autumn the vegetation coverage of the habitat was the main factor affecting the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates vegetation coverage was negatively correlated with the numbers of burrowing benthos boring benthos and climbing benthos and positively correlated with the number of free moving benthos effects of seasons and habitats on microbial community structure analysis of the relative abundances of microorganisms in the wetlands of the yellow river delta fig 4 showed that proteobacteria was the most abundant microorganism at the phylum level in summer and autumn however it indicated the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria was reduced in autumn compared with that in summer and the relative abundances of gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were increased at the genus level the dominant genera in summer was phyllobacterium in autumn lwq lws and cl plots were dominated by oxyphotobacteria whereas woeseia was dominant in cjd cjp and tt plots according to k s test results the p values of microbial shannon wiener were 0 760 in summer and 0 637 in autumn the p values of chao1 index were 0 865 in summer and 0 924 in autumn the p values were all greater than 0 05 indicating the data accord with the normal distribution through t tests we found that the shannon wiener index t 6 413 and chao1 index t 10 211 of microorganism were significantly higher in autumn than in summer indicating that microorganisms accumulated in all plots over time there existed significant differences between different habitats in summer and autumn in the yellow river delta wetlands and there were no significant differences in microbial chao1 indexes in summer however a difference was observed in autumn fig 5 additionally the dispersion degrees of the shannon wiener index and chao1 index were relatively high in summer fig 5 suggesting that summer was the node of microbial community succession the dca with the metric data revealed a gradient length 1 5 standard deviation units thus the metrics were analyzed using redundancy analysis rda ter braak and smilauer 2002 rda was used to analyze the effect of environmental factors on the top 10 dominant genera of microorganisms in summer and autumn further explaining the influence of habitat on microbial community structure fig 6 notably in summer the explained variation in the first axis was 29 59 and the explained variation in the second axis was 8 11 vegetation coverage was significantly correlated with microbial community structure lambda a 0 24 in autumn the explained variation in the first axis was 11 06 and the explained variation in the second axis was 6 32 in addition vegetation coverage was positively correlated with ph and dissolved oxygen in both seasons interactions between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in wetlands spearman analysis to shannon wiener indices of microorganisms and benthic macroinvertebrates as well as the margalef index of benthic macroinvertebrates and chao1 index of microorganisms table 4 showed that the richness indices of benthic macroinvertebrates and soil microbial communities in the yellow river delta were significantly positively correlated although there were no correlations between their shannon diversity indices this suggested that there was a mutually reinforcing relationship between the species richness of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms and this showed that there was not an established fact that more microorganisms in the place with high activity of benthic macroinvertebrates thus species diversity alone could not explain the relationship between the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms therefore microbial genera with relative abundances greater than 1 during both seasons in the yellow river delta were selected to analyze their relationships with the distributions of different types of benthic macroinvertebrates spearman correlation coefficients table 5 showed that the relative abundance of boring benthos was significantly negatively correlated with those of phyllobacterium and phingomonas in summer in autumn the relative abundance of burrowing benthos was significantly positively correlated with that of woesei and significantly negatively correlated with that of thiobacillus boring benthic macroinvertebrates were significantly negatively correlated with unidentified oxyphotobacteria and significantly positively correlated with unidentified gammaproteobacteria the relative abundances of climbing benthic macroinvertebrates and woesei were significantly positively correlated discussion seasonal effect of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in this study we found that the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in the yellow river delta were significantly affected by seasons the dominant species and community compositions of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms were significantly different between the two seasons the richness and diversity indices of macrobenthic and microbial communities were higher in autumn than in summer this seasonal differences in diversity and richness indices were consistent with the findings of the mediterranean lagoon kevrekidis 2004 a headwater stream in the changbai mountains wang et al 2018 and the nanhui dongtan wetland of shanghai zhao et al 2018 but contradictory to findings in temperate victoria barmuta 1989 miyun reservoir hu et al 2018 and a shallow subtidal sandflat in the sylt rømø basin böer et al 2009 the results showed that the effects of seasons on the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms were not the same in different regions differences in soil temperature water temperature water level and other physicochemical properties affected by seasons rather than time were more likely to cause the sensitive responses of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms foulquier et al 2013 ligi et al 2014 nishijima et al 2013 therefore specific environmental indicators should be taken into account when studying the factors influencing macrobenthic and microbial diversity and when investigating the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in different years comparisons should be made during the same season effects of habitats on benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in this study vegetation coverage of the habitat was the main factor affecting the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in the wetlands different life styles of wetland benthos could disturb the distribution of plants by burrowing or other behaviors nacorda 2008 the changes of soil nutrients and porosity caused by the distribution of plant roots would also affect the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates heip et al 1992 vegetation coverage also contributed to the differences in community distribution and dominant genera of microorganisms it was significantly correlated with microbial community structure in summer owing to changes in vegetation coverage in autumn the dominant genera of oxyphotobacteria was found in areas with vegetation coverage not less than 70 i e lwq lws and cl plots whereas the dominant genera was woeseia in areas with vegetation coverage not more than 10 i e cjd cjp and tt plots the change of water temperature air temperature and ph in the environment is significant long et al 2018 which has no significant effect on the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms analyzed in this study but vegetation can undoubtedly affect the physicochemical properties in the bottom sediment our findings suggested that the effects of habitats on macrobenthic and soil microbial community structures were mainly related to vegetation coverage in the coastal wetlands which may be related to differences in carbon and nitrogen contents ph and dissolved oxygen in water caused by variations in vegetation yi et al 2017 accordingly these changes may result in differences in the distributions of macroinvertebrates and microorganisms according to water environmental suitability sun et al 2015 wu et al 2018 interactions between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms spearman correlation analysis of shannon wiener indices of microorganisms and benthic macroinvertebrates showed that there was not an established fact that more microorganisms participating in carbon and nitrogen cycle in the place with high activity of benthic macroinvertebrates in the wetlands this result may be related to feedback responses of the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms resulting in alterations in the habitat statuses of wetland ecosystems owing to the behaviors of benthic macroinvertebrates and the functions of microorganisms marschner et al 2012 tsuchiya and kurihara 1980 therefore we performed additional analyses based on the life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates and the ecological functions of microorganisms summer was found to be the early growth period for benthic macroinvertebrates in the yellow river delta at this time the richness and diversity indices of benthic macroinvertebrates were relatively low and the richness and diversity indices of microorganisms were also reduced compared with those in autumn the community structures of microorganisms have not been differentiated the dominant bacterial genus in all living areas was phyllobacterium which is involved in nitrogen fixation mao et al 2017 this dominance may be influenced by the nutrients needed for the initial growth of benthic macroinvertebrates however the relative abundance of boring benthic macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with that of phyllobacterium at this time this result may be related to the observation that chironomid larvae were the dominant boring macroinvertebrates during the summer chironomid larvae can stimulate denitrification by reducing the diffusive barrier blocking nitrate from reaching anoxic zones in the sediment svensson 1997 this then inhibits the distribution of phyllobacterium during autumn when the diversity and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates peaked in the wetlands the distribution of microorganisms began to be affected and the dominant functional groups of microorganisms began to show differences the relative abundance of burrowing benthic macroinvertebrates was significantly positively correlated with that of woesei and that of climbing benthic macroinvertebrates was significantly positively correlated with that of woesei as hard substrates in the sediment the shells of burrowing and climbing benthos can affect the colonization of microbial communities strayer et al 2003 owing to the distribution of heterogeneous oxygen shell biofilm can simultaneously undergo nitrification and denitrification reactions castadelli and welsh 2004 svenningsen et al 2013 the microbial membranes on the surface of shells have become an important habitat for denitrifying bacteria because of the environment with little vegetation coverage in which burrowing and climbing benthos are widely distributed the probability of denitrification in the genus woeseia is high bacosa et al 2018 mussmann et al 2017 and denitrification can also eliminate the toxic effects of nitric acid accumulation on macroinvertebrates thereby promoting survival in addition the relative abundances of boring macroinvertebrates and unidentified gammaproteobacteria were significantly positively correlated this may be related to the functions of some gammaproteobacteria as methane oxidizers and as symbionts with geothermic ocean vent dwelling animals levin and michener 2002 oshkin et al 2014 in addition some relative distributions of benthic macroinvertebrates and soil microorganisms were also affected by different habitats for example the relative abundance of boring benthic macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with that of sphingomonas in summer boring benthic macroinvertebrates can promote nitrogen and phosphorus release chen and liu 1995 wang et al 2015 and contribute to algae growth gallepp 1979 in contrast sphingomonas is mainly distributed in areas of high molecular organic matter contamination bourne et al 2001 and reduced algae growth imamura et al 2000 thus the observed negative correlation was related to differences in suitable habitats in autumn the relative abundance of burrowing macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with that of thiobacillus and that of boring macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with that of unidentified oxyphotobacteria these results were also related to the observation that these benthic macroinvertebrates and soil microorganisms had different habitat preferences bibby et al 2001 in our analysis of the correlations between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms some correlations were related to similarities or differences in their suitable habitats other correlations were related to the life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates and the ecological functions expressed by microorganisms because of differences in wetland plant communities the habitats showed variations in soil physical and chemical properties which affected the community distributions of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms additionally the metabolic activities of soil microorganisms led to the cycling of soil elements thereby affecting the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates the different life style features and behaviors of wetland benthic macroinvertebrates could also change the soil granular structure and nutrient status of sediments resulting in changes in the community compositions of microorganisms based on life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates this study provided a new respect of the interaction between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in future studies control experiments and physical and chemical analyses are needed to further verify these findings conclusion the study revealed the seasonal differences of the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in wetlands and concluded the comparisons of biodiversity in a region during different years should be studied in the same season the variations of the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms were mainly caused by the variations of the wetland vegetation meanwhile there were significant correlations between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms some correlations were related to similarities or differences in their suitable habitats others were related to the life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates and the ecological functions expressed by microorganisms our study verified that there were significant interactions among plants benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms and these interactions could affect and regulate the ecosystem functions of wetlands which had implications for the study of wetland ecological functions and wetland ecological restoration therefore the study of wetland ecological functions and the engineering of wetland ecological restoration especially referring to bioremediation should consider the interactions among organisms conflict of interest

bivalvia 23 47 gastropoda 22 91 and eumetabola 21 19 accounted for more than 80 0 of benthic macroinvertebrates fig 2 according to k s test results table 1 the p values of species number total number margalef richness index shannon wiener diversity index and pielou evenness index of benthic macroinvertebrates in the yellow river delta in summer and autumn were all greater than 0 05 indicating that the community distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates obeyed the normal distribu tion according to t test table 2 of the seasonal variables there were significant differences in the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates between summer and autumn in the yellow river delta wetlands for the whole yellow river delta the species number shannon wiener diversity index margalef richness index and pielou evenness index of benthic macroinvertebrates in autumn were significantly higher than those in summer the species numbers of benthic macroinvertebrates in cjd cjp and tt were significantly higher in autumn than that in summer the increase of species number also increased the margalef richness index in cjp and tt the shannon wiener diversity index and pielou evenness index in tt in autumn were also higher than those in summer however the total numbers of benthic macroinvertebrates in cjp and tt decreased the evenness index of cl in autumn were higher than those in summer there was no significant difference in benthic macroinvertebrates diversity in lwq and lws between two seasons in our analysis of habitats fig 3 there were no significant differences in the richness indices diversity indices and evenness indices between habitats with plant cover i e lwq lws cl and cjp in summer and at this time the habitat with the highest shannon wiener diversity index and margalef richness index in the yellow river delta was cjd whereas that with the lowest values was tt suitable crabs in tt were mostly megalopa li et al 1999 they are not easy to collect and may migrate to freshwater areas that are more suitable and the pielou evenness index was lowest in the tt plot owing to the large number of gammarus in this plot in autumn the richness index and diversity index of lws area with large vegetation coverage were significantly lower than those of cjd and tt areas without plant coverage in order to further explore the impact of habitats on the diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates spearman correlations of benthic macroinvertebrates types and environmental impact factors were analyzed the results table 3 showed that vegetation coverage and dissolved oxygen were the main factors affecting the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in summer vegetation coverage was negatively correlated with the numbers of burrowing and climbing benthic macroinvertebrates and positively correlated with the number of boring macroinvertebrates dissolved oxygen was negatively correlated with the number of burrowing and climbing macroinvertebrates and positively correlated with the number of boring and free moving macroinvertebrates in autumn the vegetation coverage of the habitat was the main factor affecting the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates vegetation coverage was negatively correlated with the numbers of burrowing benthos boring benthos and climbing benthos and positively correlated with the number of free moving benthos effects of seasons and habitats on microbial community structure analysis of the relative abundances of microorganisms in the wetlands of the yellow river delta fig 4 showed that proteobacteria was the most abundant microorganism at the phylum level in summer and autumn however it indicated the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria was reduced in autumn compared with that in summer and the relative abundances of gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were increased at the genus level the dominant genera in summer was phyllobacterium in autumn lwq lws and cl plots were dominated by oxyphotobacteria whereas woeseia was dominant in cjd cjp and tt plots according to k s test results the p values of microbial shannon wiener were 0 760 in summer and 0 637 in autumn the p values of chao1 index were 0 865 in summer and 0 924 in autumn the p values were all greater than 0 05 indicating the data accord with the normal distribution through t tests we found that the shannon wiener index t 6 413 and chao1 index t 10 211 of microorganism were significantly higher in autumn than in summer indicating that microorganisms accumulated in all plots over time there existed significant differences between different habitats in summer and autumn in the yellow river delta wetlands and there were no significant differences in microbial chao1 indexes in summer however a difference was observed in autumn fig 5 additionally the dispersion degrees of the shannon wiener index and chao1 index were relatively high in summer fig 5 suggesting that summer was the node of microbial community succession the dca with the metric data revealed a gradient length 1 5 standard deviation units thus the metrics were analyzed using redundancy analysis rda ter braak and smilauer 2002 rda was used to analyze the effect of environmental factors on the top 10 dominant genera of microorganisms in summer and autumn further explaining the influence of habitat on microbial community structure fig 6 notably in summer the explained variation in the first axis was 29 59 and the explained variation in the second axis was 8 11 vegetation coverage was significantly correlated with microbial community structure lambda a 0 24 in autumn the explained variation in the first axis was 11 06 and the explained variation in the second axis was 6 32 in addition vegetation coverage was positively correlated with ph and dissolved oxygen in both seasons interactions between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in wetlands spearman analysis to shannon wiener indices of microorganisms and benthic macroinvertebrates as well as the margalef index of benthic macroinvertebrates and chao1 index of microorganisms table 4 showed that the richness indices of benthic macroinvertebrates and soil microbial communities in the yellow river delta were significantly positively correlated although there were no correlations between their shannon diversity indices this suggested that there was a mutually reinforcing relationship between the species richness of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms and this showed that there was not an established fact that more microorganisms in the place with high activity of benthic macroinvertebrates thus species diversity alone could not explain the relationship between the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms therefore microbial genera with relative abundances greater than 1 during both seasons in the yellow river delta were selected to analyze their relationships with the distributions of different types of benthic macroinvertebrates spearman correlation coefficients table 5 showed that the relative abundance of boring benthos was significantly negatively correlated with those of phyllobacterium and phingomonas in summer in autumn the relative abundance of burrowing benthos was significantly positively correlated with that of woesei and significantly negatively correlated with that of thiobacillus boring benthic macroinvertebrates were significantly negatively correlated with unidentified oxyphotobacteria and significantly positively correlated with unidentified gammaproteobacteria the relative abundances of climbing benthic macroinvertebrates and woesei were significantly positively correlated discussion seasonal effect of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in this study we found that the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in the yellow river delta were significantly affected by seasons the dominant species and community compositions of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms were significantly different between the two seasons the richness and diversity indices of macrobenthic and microbial communities were higher in autumn than in summer this seasonal differences in diversity and richness indices were consistent with the findings of the mediterranean lagoon kevrekidis 2004 a headwater stream in the changbai mountains wang et al 2018 and the nanhui dongtan wetland of shanghai zhao et al 2018 but contradictory to findings in temperate victoria barmuta 1989 miyun reservoir hu et al 2018 and a shallow subtidal sandflat in the sylt rømø basin böer et al 2009 the results showed that the effects of seasons on the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms were not the same in different regions differences in soil temperature water temperature water level and other physicochemical properties affected by seasons rather than time were more likely to cause the sensitive responses of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms foulquier et al 2013 ligi et al 2014 nishijima et al 2013 therefore specific environmental indicators should be taken into account when studying the factors influencing macrobenthic and microbial diversity and when investigating the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in different years comparisons should be made during the same season effects of habitats on benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in this study vegetation coverage of the habitat was the main factor affecting the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in the wetlands different life styles of wetland benthos could disturb the distribution of plants by burrowing or other behaviors nacorda 2008 the changes of soil nutrients and porosity caused by the distribution of plant roots would also affect the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates heip et al 1992 vegetation coverage also contributed to the differences in community distribution and dominant genera of microorganisms it was significantly correlated with microbial community structure in summer owing to changes in vegetation coverage in autumn the dominant genera of oxyphotobacteria was found in areas with vegetation coverage not less than 70 i e lwq lws and cl plots whereas the dominant genera was woeseia in areas with vegetation coverage not more than 10 i e cjd cjp and tt plots the change of water temperature air temperature and ph in the environment is significant long et al 2018 which has no significant effect on the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms analyzed in this study but vegetation can undoubtedly affect the physicochemical properties in the bottom sediment our findings suggested that the effects of habitats on macrobenthic and soil microbial community structures were mainly related to vegetation coverage in the coastal wetlands which may be related to differences in carbon and nitrogen contents ph and dissolved oxygen in water caused by variations in vegetation yi et al 2017 accordingly these changes may result in differences in the distributions of macroinvertebrates and microorganisms according to water environmental suitability sun et al 2015 wu et al 2018 interactions between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms spearman correlation analysis of shannon wiener indices of microorganisms and benthic macroinvertebrates showed that there was not an established fact that more microorganisms participating in carbon and nitrogen cycle in the place with high activity of benthic macroinvertebrates in the wetlands this result may be related to feedback responses of the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms resulting in alterations in the habitat statuses of wetland ecosystems owing to the behaviors of benthic macroinvertebrates and the functions of microorganisms marschner et al 2012 tsuchiya and kurihara 1980 therefore we performed additional analyses based on the life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates and the ecological functions of microorganisms summer was found to be the early growth period for benthic macroinvertebrates in the yellow river delta at this time the richness and diversity indices of benthic macroinvertebrates were relatively low and the richness and diversity indices of microorganisms were also reduced compared with those in autumn the community structures of microorganisms have not been differentiated the dominant bacterial genus in all living areas was phyllobacterium which is involved in nitrogen fixation mao et al 2017 this dominance may be influenced by the nutrients needed for the initial growth of benthic macroinvertebrates however the relative abundance of boring benthic macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with that of phyllobacterium at this time this result may be related to the observation that chironomid larvae were the dominant boring macroinvertebrates during the summer chironomid larvae can stimulate denitrification by reducing the diffusive barrier blocking nitrate from reaching anoxic zones in the sediment svensson 1997 this then inhibits the distribution of phyllobacterium during autumn when the diversity and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates peaked in the wetlands the distribution of microorganisms began to be affected and the dominant functional groups of microorganisms began to show differences the relative abundance of burrowing benthic macroinvertebrates was significantly positively correlated with that of woesei and that of climbing benthic macroinvertebrates was significantly positively correlated with that of woesei as hard substrates in the sediment the shells of burrowing and climbing benthos can affect the colonization of microbial communities strayer et al 2003 owing to the distribution of heterogeneous oxygen shell biofilm can simultaneously undergo nitrification and denitrification reactions castadelli and welsh 2004 svenningsen et al 2013 the microbial membranes on the surface of shells have become an important habitat for denitrifying bacteria because of the environment with little vegetation coverage in which burrowing and climbing benthos are widely distributed the probability of denitrification in the genus woeseia is high bacosa et al 2018 mussmann et al 2017 and denitrification can also eliminate the toxic effects of nitric acid accumulation on macroinvertebrates thereby promoting survival in addition the relative abundances of boring macroinvertebrates and unidentified gammaproteobacteria were significantly positively correlated this may be related to the functions of some gammaproteobacteria as methane oxidizers and as symbionts with geothermic ocean vent dwelling animals levin and michener 2002 oshkin et al 2014 in addition some relative distributions of benthic macroinvertebrates and soil microorganisms were also affected by different habitats for example the relative abundance of boring benthic macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with that of sphingomonas in summer boring benthic macroinvertebrates can promote nitrogen and phosphorus release chen and liu 1995 wang et al 2015 and contribute to algae growth gallepp 1979 in contrast sphingomonas is mainly distributed in areas of high molecular organic matter contamination bourne et al 2001 and reduced algae growth imamura et al 2000 thus the observed negative correlation was related to differences in suitable habitats in autumn the relative abundance of burrowing macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with that of thiobacillus and that of boring macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with that of unidentified oxyphotobacteria these results were also related to the observation that these benthic macroinvertebrates and soil microorganisms had different habitat preferences bibby et al 2001 in our analysis of the correlations between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms some correlations were related to similarities or differences in their suitable habitats other correlations were related to the life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates and the ecological functions expressed by microorganisms because of differences in wetland plant communities the habitats showed variations in soil physical and chemical properties which affected the community distributions of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms additionally the metabolic activities of soil microorganisms led to the cycling of soil elements thereby affecting the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates the different life style features and behaviors of wetland benthic macroinvertebrates could also change the soil granular structure and nutrient status of sediments resulting in changes in the community compositions of microorganisms based on life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates this study provided a new respect of the interaction between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in future studies control experiments and physical and chemical analyses are needed to further verify these findings conclusion the study revealed the seasonal differences of the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms in wetlands and concluded the comparisons of biodiversity in a region during different years should be studied in the same season the variations of the community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms were mainly caused by the variations of the wetland vegetation meanwhile there were significant correlations between benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms some correlations were related to similarities or differences in their suitable habitats others were related to the life styles of benthic macroinvertebrates and the ecological functions expressed by microorganisms our study verified that there were significant interactions among plants benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms and these interactions could affect and regulate the ecosystem functions of wetlands which had implications for the study of wetland ecological functions and wetland ecological restoration therefore the study of wetland ecological functions and the engineering of wetland ecological restoration especially referring to bioremediation should consider the interactions among organisms conflict of interest

1046,in order to discover the plankton distribution patterns and its relationship with environment gradients and hydrological connectivity in wetlands samples from yellow river delta that span gradients in salinity and hydrological connectivity were analyzed in this study plankton community composition abundance and biomass were determined and correlated with water variables and hydrological connectivity indexes to gain information about the forces that structure the plankton community in this dynamic environment phytoplankton with a total of 88 species and zooplankton with a total of 49 species were observed at an average abundance of 4 11 107 cells l and 951 27 ind l respectively predominant species were merismopedia minima g beck merismopedia elegans a braun ex kützing cyanobacteria and trichocerca pusilla jennings rotifera accounting for over 10 of the total abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively the dominant species of phytoplankton communities were shifted from freshwater chlorophyta e g oocystis sp to brackish cyanobacteria e g merismopedia minima and merismopedia elegans and then to marine cyanobacterium e g oscillatoria sp and pseudoanabaena sp that shift in zooplankton community was from freshwater rotifers trichocerca pusilla and polyarthra trigla ehrenberg to brackish rotifer brachionus urceus linnaeus and copepod thermocyclops spp and then to marine copepods sinocalanus spp and microsetella spp toward the river mouth however abundance biomass and community similarity of plankton decreased with increasing water salinity and decreasing hydrological connectivity from upper reaches to river mouth salinity gradient could be major force for the shift of plankton community while the increasing hydrological connectivity between freshwater and saline habitats promoted the similarity of plankton distribution patterns within the wetland network keywords phytoplankton zooplankton salinity hydrological connectivity river deltaic wetland 1 introduction the estuarine wetland is a unique ecosystem formed by the interaction of sea and land michael 2014 it has many ecological functions and important social values and is one of the most important habitats of organisms moreno 2007 the links to the inland and marine ecosystems through material circulation energy flow and information transmission and the obvious edge effects make the estuarine ecosystem susceptible to disturbance johnson 2015 while with the rapid development of urbanization the increasing human activities have an increasingly significant impact on the estuaries the long term disorderly development and over utilization has hindered the hydrological and biological connectivity of the wetlands within the estuarine area causing serious degradation of the estuarine wetland ecosystem miguel 2011 cohen 2016 hydrological connectivity refers to the process in which matter energy and organisms use water as a medium to transport within or between elements of a hydrological cycle cui 2016 the importance of hydrological connection among wetland ecosystems is mainly reflected in wetland ecological environment water quality aquatic animal resources flood control and water use amoros 2002 water flowing between river and the adjacent floodplain can increase the flux of organisms and nutrients giving them the opportunity to reach more habitats reid 2017 connection of hydrologic elements is also important for maintaining the biodiversity of birds and aquatic organisms the complete hydrological connectivity can promote energy and nutrient cycling while providing important habitats and living conditions for birds and aquatic organisms stoffels 2014 plankton is an important group of aquatic ecosystem among which phytoplankton is one of the primary producers of water habitats and zooplankton is the key link in the pelagic food webs dou 2016 the spatial and temporal distribution of plankton has a very close relationship with the hydrological condition which gives an indication of environmental changes and the changes of water environment can also directly or indirectly affect the community structure of plankton luan 2007 in natural aquatic ecosystems zooplankton is generally affected by physical and chemical properties of water phytoplankton and fish biomass yang 2012 the main physical and chemical indicators of water such as water temperature dissolved oxygen do ph nutrient concentration affect the community structure by affecting the growth rate and metabolic rate of plankton carter 2012 olson 2013 therefore it is possible to restore plankton biodiversity by adjusting hydrological and environmental factors for example by controlling nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and hypolimnion oxygenation by aeration with fine air bubbles bürgi and stadelmann 2002 and to improve the functional structure of ecosystems by using the relationship between plankton and hydrological connectivity such as through removing saltwater barrier to restore hydrology and salinity in support of saline habitats for salt tolerant species and salt marsh ecosystem function maintaining hutchinson 2015 the yellow river delta yrd region has created many types of wetlands in the process of natural succession making it the youngest wetland ecosystem in the warm temperate zone of world and it is a typical estuary wetland however due to the dual effects of climate change on water cycle processes such as rainfall and evapotranspiration and human activities such as dam construction on river hydrological processes the hydrological connectivity of the yrd is seriously affected cui 2016 resulting in the function and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems are also threatened since plankton organisms are sensitive to the changes of water environment and moveable with water flow the hypothesis could be proposed that at the zonal scale hydrological connectivity between fresh river and salt marsh decreases the water salinity in restored salt marsh and promotes dispersal of freshwater plankton species to salt marsh and increases the similarity of plankton distribution patterns within the wetland network under such hypothesis this study explored the plankton distribution patterns and their correlations with environmental gradients and hydrological connectivity in the study area which aimed to provide reference for the plankton biodiversity and ecosystem restoration through hydrologic regulation in the yrd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the yellow river delta yrd geographically spanning from 118 07 e to 119 18 e and from 36 55 n to 38 12 n is adjacent to the bohai sea in the north and laizhou bay in the east and it is the most extensive and youngest native wetland ecosystem in china yrd has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 12 3 c and an annual precipitation of 530 630 mm lv et al 2016 the soil type in this region is dominated by fluvo aquic soil and saline soil and the main plant species are phragmites australis cav trin ex steud suaeda salsa l pall and tamarix chinensis lour ma et al 2017 due to the impact of high groundwater level seawater intrusion insufficient freshwater recharge large evaporation and human activities the salinization of the wetland is quite serious in the yrd and the wetland ecosystem function and biodiversity have been threatened since 2002 a restoration project has been launched by pumping three million cubic meters freshwater to 5023 7 ha of designated and dammed tidal area each year to restore the degraded ecosystem cui et al 2009 this study was carried out in five zones of the yrd restoration zone in dawenliu dr and huanghekou hr tidal zone in dawenliu dt and huanghekou ht and the yellow river channel yr and a total of 35 sampling sites 11 sites 4 sites 8 sites 6 sites 6 sites in dr hr dt ht yr respectively were set in the study area the sampling sites were shown in fig 1 and samples of water and plankton were collected in july of 2017 2 2 sample collection and analysis the surface water samples were collected by an organic glass hydrophore a total of 500 ml of water samples were stored in a polyethylene bottle and brought back to the laboratory for water physical and chemical variables analysis electric conductivity ec and ph were measured with an ec meter vwr scientific west chester pa usa and a hanna ph meter hanna instruments woonsocket ri usa respectively dissolved oxygen do was determined using flow injection analysis based on iodometry winkler method total nitrogen tn samples were oxidized with potassium peroxodisulphate and reduced to nitrite in hg cd or cu cd columns and determined colorimetrically total phosphorus tp samples were digested by k2s2o8 to reactive form and analysed spectrophotometrically by the ammonium molybdate method of murphy and riley 1962 with ascorbic acid as a reducing agent the concentration of chlorophyll a chla in water samples was determined with the spectrophotometric method for determination of cladocerans and copepods 10 l water samples were filtered by plankton net of 64 µm mesh size the filtrate was placed in the specimen bottle and immediately added with formaldehyde to kill the zooplankton and other organism fӓrber lorda et al 2017 rotifers were identified using the concentrated samples of phytoplankton samples were taken back to the laboratory to identify zooplankton to species level with stereoscopic microscopy the number of zooplankton was obtained by microscopic counting the approximate geometrical shape of zooplankton was decided their volume was estimated using the quadrature formula and biomass was determined using the volumetric method yin et al 2018 for phytoplankton a total of 500 ml water samples at each sampling site were fixed with lugol solution for further identification and counting after the water samples were precipitated for 48 h the supernatant was removed and left with about 20 30 ml larsson et al 2017 the remaining concentrated water samples were divided into two equal parts one for phytoplankton identification and the other for rotifer analysis a total of 0 1 ml of the well shaken concentrated sample was put in a 0 1 ml phytoplankton count chambers and then the phytoplankton were identified and counted with a microscopy field lens 40 eye lens 10 to obtain the number of phytoplankton per unit volume 1 l the methods to quantify volume and biomass of zooplankton were the same as those to phytoplankton 2 3 calculation of hydrological connectivity graph theory based connectivity metrics can be used to describe the ecological process e g migration and diffusion of species saura and torné 2009 pietsch 2018 landscape graphs consist of a set of nodes and connections in which nodes represent species habitats and a connection represents the potential ability of species to disperse between two nodes and it can be interpreted as a corridor based on previous studies pirnat and hladnik 2016 volk 2018 we used the probability of connectivity index pc and integral index of connectivity iic to assess the connections between spatially isolated plankton habitat patches i e water bodies the importance of habitat patch dpc diic is usually represented by removing individual patches from the landscape and quantifying the corresponding decrease in connectivity bodin and saura 2010 guo 2018 these indices can be calculated with the freely available software conefor sensinode 2 6 http www conefor org saura and torné 2009 the remote sensing data comes from the geographical spatial data cloud platform of the computer network information center of the chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn we selected the 2017 7 12 landsat 8 oli image and used envi 5 3 as well as arcgis 10 2 software to process the remote sensing image two files are needed for calculate the landscape connection metrics within the conefor sensinode 2 6 a node file and connection file the node file includes habitat characteristics habitat area the connection file contains connections between a pair of nodes described in distance euclidean or diffusion possibility probabilities of connection probabilities of connection between every two nodes can be computed with the probabilistic connection model based on a decreasing exponential function of the distance between them volk 2018 in the binary connection model a link exists if the dispersal distance is less than the threshold defined by the user in order to choose the most appropriate scale for our study we tested dispersal distances ranging between 30 m and 3000 m 30 50 100 200 300 500 750 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 m and chose the distance for which the sum of the diic reached its maximum in each of the four habitat networks four habitat networks mean the network formed among sites within each of the four sampling zones see four sampling zones ht hr dt and dr in fig 1 at this distance the landscape was sufficiently connected and highly sensitive to connectivity decrease caused by patch loss bodin and saura 2010 guo 2018 after testing we finally selected 500 m as the distance threshold fig 2 the present study chose the number of components nc integral index of connectivity iic probability of connectivity pc node importance diic and dpc as the screening index nc refers to a whole consisting of functionally or structurally interconnected patch an isolated patch will form a component and there is no functional relationship between the different components therefore the closer the patches within the landscape are the less the number of components is i i c i 1 n j 1 n a i a j 1 n l i j a l 2 where n is the number of water patches existing in the landscape ai and aj are the areas of the water patches i and j respectively nlij is number of links in the shortest path topological distance between patches i and j al is the total landscape area both water and non water iic ranges from 0 to 1 and increases with improved connectivity iic 1 in the

terms of its individual contribution to the maintenance of overall landscape connectivity as measured by diic and dpc the resultant diic and dpc values are shown in five importance classes based on natural breakpoint method very high high medium low and very low 2 4 statistical analyses canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to analyze the relationship between the plankton and water variables in canoco for windows 4 5 the species with frequencies less than 10 were removed first in order to eliminate their impact on the analysis results zhang et al 2017 and a detrended correspondence analysis dca was performed first to identify if the cca is suitable to assess the relationship between the plankton and water variables total species data and water quality variables were log x 1 transformed before cca to achieve normality yang et al 2017 the correlation analysis between phytoplankton and each water variable was performed using pearson correlation analysis in spss 17 0 software 3 results 3 1 environment gradients the main environmental factors in different zones were shown in fig 3 it was found that the water bodies in the study area were alkaline as a whole and the ec of dt and ht was higher than those of the hr dr and yr the do content was between 6 0 and 9 7 mg l and that of the water bodies in the dawenliu was lower than huanghekou and yellow river channel the tp content in hr 0 02 mg l was significantly lower than dr 0 08 mg l overall tp content in the recovery zone was lower than that in the tidal zone the tn content was between 7 16 and 11 58 mg l and the highest occurred in yr no significant difference in chla content among sites but the lowest occurred in ht 0 013 mg l the differences in environmental factors of the study area were mainly reflected in ec do tn and tp while the spatial differences in ph and chla were not significant 3 2 hydrological connectivity the total area of water bodies in the yellow river delta yrd was found to be 155 69 km2 fig 4 accounting for 10 of the total study area for a threshold distance of 500 m there were 49 components in the yrd and iic and pc values were 0 08 and 0 1 respectively iic and pc values of different region for a threshold distance of 500 m were shown in table 1 compare to tidal zone connectivity metrics both iic and pc were higher in restoration zone what s more dawenliu has the higher connectivity value than huanghekou both in restoration and tidal zone the contributions of different water patches to the overall landscape connectivity at 500 m dispersal distances were shown in fig 5 values of diic ranged from 0 0000012 to 97 90 and values of dpc ranged from 0 00008 to 98 39 the patches with consistently very high diic values accounted for an area of 67 59 in dr 97 26 in hr 72 59 in dt and 76 29 in ht while the ones with consistently very high dpc values accounted for an area of 50 69 in dr 96 29 in hr 72 59 in dt and 76 29 in ht it showed that patches with higher diic and dpc value were relatively large area with surface waters located in the middle of the restoration zone or linear tidal creeks that connected with the bohai sea the linear water creeks connected a large number of water patches which played an important role in the water system connection of the coastal wetland 3 3 community composition and diversity indices in this study a total of 88 species of phytoplankton were identified including 34 species of chlorophyta 22 species of bacillariophyta 14 species of cyanobacteria 6 species of euglenophyta 4 species of pyrrophyta 3 species of cryptophyta 3 species of chrysophyta and 2 species of xanthophyta and a total of 49 zooplankton species were observed in all samples which consisted of 5 cladocerans 12 copepods and 32 rotifers fig 6 in this study if the dominance of a species was greater than 2 y 2 this species was defined as a dominant species lampitt et al 1993 the dominant species of the zooplankton and phytoplankton were shown in table 2 according to the dominance of each species it was found that merismopedia minima and merismopedia elegans which belong to cyanobacteria had a higher dominance among the phytoplankton species with the dominance of 15 63 and 11 20 respectively the most dominant zooplankton species was trichocerca pusilla with the y value of 14 96 the average

revealed that the number of species of phytoplankton in hr and yr was generally higher among them hr3 had the largest number of phytoplankton species and hr4 had the largest number of zooplankton species the phytoplankton at each sampling site was dominated by green algae diatoms and cyanobacteria and zooplankton was dominated by rotifers with copepods took second place the abundance and biomass of plankton were quite different at each site for phytoplankton the abundance and biomass were higher in the recovery zone and the yr than in the tidal zone and the species of chrysophyta which were mostly distributed in freshwater bodies had obvious advantages in the recovery zone for zooplankton excepted for the individual samples the abundance and biomass of the rotifers had obvious advantages and the abundance and biomass of the rotifers in the hr and yr regions were much larger than those of other regions 3 4 relationships between community composition and environmental variables the results of the cca analysis were shown in fig 8 for phytoplankton the eigenvalue of the axis 1 and axis 2 were 0 234 and 0 142 respectively and the first two axes contributed 18 0 of variance of phytoplankton species data and 54 3 of species environment relation the species environment correlations for the first two axes were 0 938 and 0 827 respectively for zooplankton the eigenvalues of the axis 1 0 502 and axis 2 0 166 explained 32 1 of variance of zooplankton species data the species environment correlations for the first two axes were 0 991 and 0 968 respectively and the first two axes explained 81 2 of variance of species environment relation which indicated a significant relationship between the environment variables and zooplankton species cca analysis of plankton abundance and environmental factors showed that ec tp do and tn were the main factors affecting the abundance of plankton for phytoplankton most species of diatoms was positively correlated with ec and tp such as chaetoceros synedra navicula most species in chlorophyta and cyanobacteria are positively correlated with ph do and tn such as crucigenia pseudoanabaena and microcystis most species abundance of the copepods was positively correlated with ec and tp such as the species of mesochra and sinocalanus and the abundance of most species of rotifers was positively correlated with do and tn such as the species of brachionus and trichocerca 4 discussion 4 1 differences in hydrological connectivity between different regions of the yellow river deltaic wetland previous studies have shown that the size of water patches is one of the factors determining the regional hydrological connectivity li et al 2018 in this study most of the water patches distributed in dr zone were large and medium sized and the distribution was relatively concentrated while in other areas the water patches were scattered small and medium sized or small patches although there were a large number of small and medium sized patches the area of water patches in the dr zone is significantly larger than that of other areas which made it a certain advantage in the overall hydrological connectivity of the study area in addition to the area of water patches the construction of water conservancy projects in the study area will also have a certain impact on the hydrological connection of the wetland the results showed that the hydrological connectivity of the hr zone on the north bank of the yellow river was poorer than that of the dr zone on the south bank of the yellow river in terms of water conservancy projects both the hr and dr zones would be recharged through the diversion canal but a dam was built every 600 m in the hr channel to block and distribute water in sections which hindered the hydrological connectivity in the region to a certain extent while there was no barrier built in dr zone and there was less human interference yang 2019 therefore the hydrological connectivity of the dr zone was higher overall than the hr region at the same time according to the iic and pc values the hydrological connectivity of the ht zone was smaller than that of the dt zone in this study the results of the extraction of water bodies in the tidal zone showed that there were more tidal creeks channels in the dt zone than in the ht zone so the tidal flat with a more developed tidal creek channel system in the dt zone resulting in a higher hydrological connectivity 4 2 effects of water environmental factors on the distribution of plankton community in rivers and lakes changes in the composition and quantitative structure of plankton communities are influenced by various environmental factors such as physical chemical and biological factors when multiple factors work together on plankton some environmental factors play a leading role naselli flores 2000 the results showed that the main environmental factors affecting the growth of plankton were conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn content and water depth depth correlation analysis showed that conductivity ec was negatively correlated with the biomass and abundance of phytoplankton p 0 01 and dissolved oxygen do was positively correlated with the biomass and abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton p 0 01 combining with fig 3 ht and dt zones had seawater influx and the salinity and conductivity of the water body was obviously higher than that of other zones therefore the abundance and biomass of plankton in the tidal region are relatively low which was consistent with the existing research results park et al 2000 mishra et al 2019 the number of phytoplankton species did not dramatically decline as the abundance and biomass from inland freshwater river yr to brackish wetland hr and dr and then to tidal flat saltmarsh ht and dt indicated that the dominant species were shifted from freshwater chlorophyta e g oocystis sp to brackish cyanobacteria e g merismopedia minima merismopedia elegans and anabaena sp and then to marine cyanobacterium e g oscillatoria sp and pseudoanabaena sp at the river mouth scholz and liebezeit 2012 this was different from the shift of the dominant species in the pearl river estuary pre from freshwater diatoms e g melosira granulata and melosira granulata var angustissima in the upper reaches to saline water diatoms e g skeletonema costatum greville cleve and coscinodiscus sp at the river mouth zhou et al 2016 melosira granulata and melosira granulata var angustissima which are typical riverine phytoplankton with limited salinity tolerance huang et al 2004 also existed in our study see p3 and p4 in fig 8a despite both being not the dominant species but skeletonema costatum and coscinodiscus sp were not found in our samples skeletonema costatum was the dominant estuarine species in the pre and it is a pollution tolerant and indicator species of eutrophication which can adapt to high n p conditions nassar 2000 the difference in phytoplankton community changes from upper reaches to river mouth indicated the salinity gradient may play an importance role in the yrd relative to the pollution gradient playing an importance role in the pre bai et al 2011 xiao et al 2014 2015 the common findings of the yrd and pre on the changes of phytoplankton communities was the generally decreased phytoplankton abundance and biomass with a shift from large sized phytoplankton to relative small sized cells from the upper to lower reaches along the channel as other estuaries schuchardt and schirmer 1991 carić et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 throughout the investigation rotifers polyarthra trigla 6 31 and trichocerca pusilla 14 96 were the dominant zooplankton in the freshwater parts rotifer brachionus urceus and copepod thermocyclops spp were dominant in the brackish water region copepods sinocalanus spp and microsetella spp were dominant in the saltwater region of the yrd table 2 fig 7b 7d 7f and 8b the salinity gradient and phytoplankton distribution table 3 fig 7a 7c and 7e could be responsible for the shift of zooplankton community freshwater rotifers decreased in species number while the marine copepods increased toward the river mouth this was similar to the findings in the elbe estuary holsta et al 1998 4 3 effects of different hydrological connectivity on the distribution of plankton community several studies have announced that hydrological connectivity was a shaping force in structuring the plankton community in the water systems baranyi et al 2002 phlips et al 2008 goździejewska et al 2016 the four zones hr dr ht and dt differ primarily in their degree of connectivity to the yellow river main channel with the floodplain zone hr maintaining a higher connection and displaying physical and chemical characteristics similar to river water the other restoration zone dr connecting to the river only during the water supplement period between mid june to mid july and having a tidal inlet at the south of the zone versus the zones ht and dt without connecting to the river and only having tidal creeks for tidal flows in salt marshes the phytoplankton of hr has a similarly high number of species and was dominated by merismopedia minima and merismopedia elegans cyanobacteria as yr fig 7a 7c while the relatively lower abundance may be associated to the lower nutrient concentrations tn and tp fig 3 the great contribution of chrysophyta to the generally high biomass of phytoplankton in hr and dr suggested large sized chrysophyta was stimulated by nitrogen enrichment relative to phosphorus higher n p in the brackish zones leading to increased phosphorus limitation paerl et al 2001 in contrast in ht and dt the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton were far below those in yr hr and dr the low abundance could be explained by the influence of salinity and dilution effect due to connection to the sea and the low biomass was largely due to the decreased abundance and increased small marine algae phlips et al 2008 these results confirming that the high level of connectivity would lead to similar species composition and variation patterns of richness diversity and biomass biovolume granado and henry 2014 due to the environmental factors changes associated with the variation of hydrological conditions caused by varying hydrologic connectivity tomasek et al 2017 thanks to their short life cycles rotifers developed rapidly in tolerable environments up to very high abundance and biomass baranyi et al 2002 even though other zooplankton groups were covered up in the comparison of abundance and biomass fig 7d 7f a distinct regional variation was discernible in the dominance of zooplankton components in this study through the zooplankton community composition fig 7b 7d 7f copepods constituted the dominant group at the tidal flat near the river mouth while rotifers were dominant in the upper reaches where freshwater influx was relatively high as reported by nair et al 1984 the hydrological connectivity to main river channel promoted the diffusion of rotifers to brackish zones even marine environment however the increasing salinity and copepod predation seaward decreased their abundance and biomass see anjusha et al 2018 our study proved that hydrological connectivity with freshwater river network stimulated freshwater linked species dispersing to salty environments which confirmed the hypothesis this was not only because the hydrological connectivity with freshwater river network directly delivered freshwater species from limnohaline oligohaline region into mesohaline polyhaline region i e brackish and salt marshes lansac tôha et al 2016 anjusha et al 2018 but also strengthened the dispersal by adjusting the salty environment through constantly freshwater input during the processes the salinity of water was declined and nutrients was increased favouring the exchange of organisms through passive dispersal increasing similarity in metacommunity species composition and decreasing beta diversity see lopes et al 2014 those were the reasons for the similar plankton distribution patterns between yr and hr however the very low abundance and biomass of rotifers in the freshwater supplemented zone dr even as low as those in tidal zones ht and dt where there was only tidal creeks for seawater connectivity but not hydrological connectivity to freshwater river network reflected that the relatively higher salinity fig 3 was the major limiting factor for rotifer bloom in brackish wetland same as reported in other studies see medeiros et al 2010 viayeh et al 2012 anjusha et al 2018 moreover the lowest abundance and biomass of plankton in ht and dt zones further demonstrated that salinity was a major factor controlling plankton community distribution in the yrd while the hydrological connectivity to freshwater river network could weaken the inhibition of high salinity and promote the dispersal of plankton especially merismopedia minima merismopedia elegans oscillatoria sp and rotifers trichocerca pusilla polyarthra trigla in wetland networks 5 conclusion the study was carried out among wetlands that span a gradient in hydrological connectivity between the main channel of yellow river and its sidearm system at estuarine region we analyzed the relationship between plankton distribution patterns and hydrological connectivity and discussed the effect of water variable changes especially salinity decline related to the increasing hydrological connectivity to freshwater river on the dispersal of phytoplankton and rotifers to brackish marshes abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton were highly related to the hydrological connectivity and salinity highest amounts were detected at main river channel and zones connected to river where showed high hydrological connectivity and low salinity lowest amounts were detected at tidal flat where hydrological connectivity was low and salinity was high cyanobacteria and chlorophyta were dominating the phytoplankton community and rotifera was dominating the zooplankton community hydrological connectivity favoured cyanobacteria e g merismopedia minima merismopedia elegans and chrysophyta was characterized by its association with high tn tp ratios rotifers i e trichocerca pusilla polyarthra trigla bloomed in hr but not in dr confirmed that salinity was a major factor for the survival and reproduction of rotifers copepod occurred in the tidal flat and might be another threat predation to rotifers this study suggested that the effect of hydrological connectivity was not limited to deliver transfer spread plankton to the linked habitats but also to modify the originally isolated environment to more suitable for colonization through the energy materials and information delivery interchange leading to community similarity between the main channel and the connected side arm system hr with direct connectivity to main river channel showing high plankton similarity as yr indicated the great influence potential of the main channel on plankton community to its hydrological connected wetlands dr with indirectly connectivity to main river channel showed less similar plankton community as yr relative to hr however biotic interaction including community succession competition and zooplankton grazing which played an important role in the plankton community shifts between successional stages need to be considered in the further studies conflict of interest the

1046,in order to discover the plankton distribution patterns and its relationship with environment gradients and hydrological connectivity in wetlands samples from yellow river delta that span gradients in salinity and hydrological connectivity were analyzed in this study plankton community composition abundance and biomass were determined and correlated with water variables and hydrological connectivity indexes to gain information about the forces that structure the plankton community in this dynamic environment phytoplankton with a total of 88 species and zooplankton with a total of 49 species were observed at an average abundance of 4 11 107 cells l and 951 27 ind l respectively predominant species were merismopedia minima g beck merismopedia elegans a braun ex kützing cyanobacteria and trichocerca pusilla jennings rotifera accounting for over 10 of the total abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively the dominant species of phytoplankton communities were shifted from freshwater chlorophyta e g oocystis sp to brackish cyanobacteria e g merismopedia minima and merismopedia elegans and then to marine cyanobacterium e g oscillatoria sp and pseudoanabaena sp that shift in zooplankton community was from freshwater rotifers trichocerca pusilla and polyarthra trigla ehrenberg to brackish rotifer brachionus urceus linnaeus and copepod thermocyclops spp and then to marine copepods sinocalanus spp and microsetella spp toward the river mouth however abundance biomass and community similarity of plankton decreased with increasing water salinity and decreasing hydrological connectivity from upper reaches to river mouth salinity gradient could be major force for the shift of plankton community while the increasing hydrological connectivity between freshwater and saline habitats promoted the similarity of plankton distribution patterns within the wetland network keywords phytoplankton zooplankton salinity hydrological connectivity river deltaic wetland 1 introduction the estuarine wetland is a unique ecosystem formed by the interaction of sea and land michael 2014 it has many ecological functions and important social values and is one of the most important habitats of organisms moreno 2007 the links to the inland and marine ecosystems through material circulation energy flow and information transmission and the obvious edge effects make the estuarine ecosystem susceptible to disturbance johnson 2015 while with the rapid development of urbanization the increasing human activities have an increasingly significant impact on the estuaries the long term disorderly development and over utilization has hindered the hydrological and biological connectivity of the wetlands within the estuarine area causing serious degradation of the estuarine wetland ecosystem miguel 2011 cohen 2016 hydrological connectivity refers to the process in which matter energy and organisms use water as a medium to transport within or between elements of a hydrological cycle cui 2016 the importance of hydrological connection among wetland ecosystems is mainly reflected in wetland ecological environment water quality aquatic animal resources flood control and water use amoros 2002 water flowing between river and the adjacent floodplain can increase the flux of organisms and nutrients giving them the opportunity to reach more habitats reid 2017 connection of hydrologic elements is also important for maintaining the biodiversity of birds and aquatic organisms the complete hydrological connectivity can promote energy and nutrient cycling while providing important habitats and living conditions for birds and aquatic organisms stoffels 2014 plankton is an important group of aquatic ecosystem among which phytoplankton is one of the primary producers of water habitats and zooplankton is the key link in the pelagic food webs dou 2016 the spatial and temporal distribution of plankton has a very close relationship with the hydrological condition which gives an indication of environmental changes and the changes of water environment can also directly or indirectly affect the community structure of plankton luan 2007 in natural aquatic ecosystems zooplankton is generally affected by physical and chemical properties of water phytoplankton and fish biomass yang 2012 the main physical and chemical indicators of water such as water temperature dissolved oxygen do ph nutrient concentration affect the community structure by affecting the growth rate and metabolic rate of plankton carter 2012 olson 2013 therefore it is possible to restore plankton biodiversity by adjusting hydrological and environmental factors for example by controlling nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and hypolimnion oxygenation by aeration with fine air bubbles bürgi and stadelmann 2002 and to improve the functional structure of ecosystems by using the relationship between plankton and hydrological connectivity such as through removing saltwater barrier to restore hydrology and salinity in support of saline habitats for salt tolerant species and salt marsh ecosystem function maintaining hutchinson 2015 the yellow river delta yrd region has created many types of wetlands in the process of natural succession making it the youngest wetland ecosystem in the warm temperate zone of world and it is a typical estuary wetland however due to the dual effects of climate change on water cycle processes such as rainfall and evapotranspiration and human activities such as dam construction on river hydrological processes the hydrological connectivity of the yrd is seriously affected cui 2016 resulting in the function and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems are also threatened since plankton organisms are sensitive to the changes of water environment and moveable with water flow the hypothesis could be proposed that at the zonal scale hydrological connectivity between fresh river and salt marsh decreases the water salinity in restored salt marsh and promotes dispersal of freshwater plankton species to salt marsh and increases the similarity of plankton distribution patterns within the wetland network under such hypothesis this study explored the plankton distribution patterns and their correlations with environmental gradients and hydrological connectivity in the study area which aimed to provide reference for the plankton biodiversity and ecosystem restoration through hydrologic regulation in the yrd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the yellow river delta yrd geographically spanning from 118 07 e to 119 18 e and from 36 55 n to 38 12 n is adjacent to the bohai sea in the north and laizhou bay in the east and it is the most extensive and youngest native wetland ecosystem in china yrd has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 12 3 c and an annual precipitation of 530 630 mm lv et al 2016 the soil type in this region is dominated by fluvo aquic soil and saline soil and the main plant species are phragmites australis cav trin ex steud suaeda salsa l pall and tamarix chinensis lour ma et al 2017 due to the impact of high groundwater level seawater intrusion insufficient freshwater recharge large evaporation and human activities the salinization of the wetland is quite serious in the yrd and the wetland ecosystem function and biodiversity have been threatened since 2002 a restoration project has been launched by pumping three million cubic meters freshwater to 5023 7 ha of designated and dammed tidal area each year to restore the degraded ecosystem cui et al 2009 this study was carried out in five zones of the yrd restoration zone in dawenliu dr and huanghekou hr tidal zone in dawenliu dt and huanghekou ht and the yellow river channel yr and a total of 35 sampling sites 11 sites 4 sites 8 sites 6 sites 6 sites in dr hr dt ht yr respectively were set in the study area the sampling sites were shown in fig 1 and samples of water and plankton were collected in july of 2017 2 2 sample collection and analysis the surface water samples were collected by an organic glass hydrophore a total of 500 ml of water samples were stored in a polyethylene bottle and brought back to the laboratory for water physical and chemical variables analysis electric conductivity ec and ph were measured with an ec meter vwr scientific west chester pa usa and a hanna ph meter hanna instruments woonsocket ri usa respectively dissolved oxygen do was determined using flow injection analysis based on iodometry winkler method total nitrogen tn samples were oxidized with potassium peroxodisulphate and reduced to nitrite in hg cd or cu cd columns and determined colorimetrically total phosphorus tp samples were digested by k2s2o8 to reactive form and analysed spectrophotometrically by the ammonium molybdate method of murphy and riley 1962 with ascorbic acid as a reducing agent the concentration of chlorophyll a chla in water samples was determined with the spectrophotometric method for determination of cladocerans and copepods 10 l water samples were filtered by plankton net of 64 µm mesh size the filtrate was placed in the specimen bottle and immediately added with formaldehyde to kill the zooplankton and other organism fӓrber lorda et al 2017 rotifers were identified using the concentrated samples of phytoplankton samples were taken back to the laboratory to identify zooplankton to species level with stereoscopic microscopy the number of zooplankton was obtained by microscopic counting the approximate geometrical shape of zooplankton was decided their volume was estimated using the quadrature formula and biomass was determined using the volumetric method yin et al 2018 for phytoplankton a total of 500 ml water samples at each sampling site were fixed with lugol solution for further identification and counting after the water samples were precipitated for 48 h the supernatant was removed and left with about 20 30 ml larsson et al 2017 the remaining concentrated water samples were divided into two equal parts one for phytoplankton identification and the other for rotifer analysis a total of 0 1 ml of the well shaken concentrated sample was put in a 0 1 ml phytoplankton count chambers and then the phytoplankton were identified and counted with a microscopy field lens 40 eye lens 10 to obtain the number of phytoplankton per unit volume 1 l the methods to quantify volume and biomass of zooplankton were the same as those to phytoplankton 2 3 calculation of hydrological connectivity graph theory based connectivity metrics can be used to describe the ecological process e g migration and diffusion of species saura and torné 2009 pietsch 2018 landscape graphs consist of a set of nodes and connections in which nodes represent species habitats and a connection represents the potential ability of species to disperse between two nodes and it can be interpreted as a corridor based on previous studies pirnat and hladnik 2016 volk 2018 we used the probability of connectivity index pc and integral index of connectivity iic to assess the connections between spatially isolated plankton habitat patches i e water bodies the importance of habitat patch dpc diic is usually represented by removing individual patches from the landscape and quantifying the corresponding decrease in connectivity bodin and saura 2010 guo 2018 these indices can be calculated with the freely available software conefor sensinode 2 6 http www conefor org saura and torné 2009 the remote sensing data comes from the geographical spatial data cloud platform of the computer network information center of the chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn we selected the 2017 7 12 landsat 8 oli image and used envi 5 3 as well as arcgis 10 2 software to process the remote sensing image two files are needed for calculate the landscape connection metrics within the conefor sensinode 2 6 a node file and connection file the node file includes habitat characteristics habitat area the connection file contains connections between a pair of nodes described in distance euclidean or diffusion possibility probabilities of connection probabilities of connection between every two nodes can be computed with the probabilistic connection model based on a decreasing exponential function of the distance between them volk 2018 in the binary connection model a link exists if the dispersal distance is less than the threshold defined by the user in order to choose the most appropriate scale for our study we tested dispersal distances ranging between 30 m and 3000 m 30 50 100 200 300 500 750 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 m and chose the distance for which the sum of the diic reached its maximum in each of the four habitat networks four habitat networks mean the network formed among sites within each of the four sampling zones see four sampling zones ht hr dt and dr in fig 1 at this distance the landscape was sufficiently connected and highly sensitive to connectivity decrease caused by patch loss bodin and saura 2010 guo 2018 after testing we finally selected 500 m as the distance threshold fig 2 the present study chose the number of components nc integral index of connectivity iic probability of connectivity pc node importance diic and dpc as the screening index nc refers to a whole consisting of functionally or structurally interconnected patch an isolated patch will form a component and there is no functional relationship between the different components therefore the closer the patches within the landscape are the less the number of components is i i c i 1 n j 1 n a i a j 1 n l i j a l 2 where n is the number of water patches existing in the landscape ai and aj are the areas of the water patches i and j respectively nlij is number of links in the shortest path topological distance between patches i and j al is the total landscape area both water and non water iic ranges from 0 to 1 and increases with improved connectivity iic 1 in the

terms of its individual contribution to the maintenance of overall landscape connectivity as measured by diic and dpc the resultant diic and dpc values are shown in five importance classes based on natural breakpoint method very high high medium low and very low 2 4 statistical analyses canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to analyze the relationship between the plankton and water variables in canoco for windows 4 5 the species with frequencies less than 10 were removed first in order to eliminate their impact on the analysis results zhang et al 2017 and a detrended correspondence analysis dca was performed first to identify if the cca is suitable to assess the relationship between the plankton and water variables total species data and water quality variables were log x 1 transformed before cca to achieve normality yang et al 2017 the correlation analysis between phytoplankton and each water variable was performed using pearson correlation analysis in spss 17 0 software 3 results 3 1 environment gradients the main environmental factors in different zones were shown in fig 3 it was found that the water bodies in the study area were alkaline as a whole and the ec of dt and ht was higher than those of the hr dr and yr the do content was between 6 0 and 9 7 mg l and that of the water bodies in the dawenliu was lower than huanghekou and yellow river channel the tp content in hr 0 02 mg l was significantly lower than dr 0 08 mg l overall tp content in the recovery zone was lower than that in the tidal zone the tn content was between 7 16 and 11 58 mg l and the highest occurred in yr no significant difference in chla content among sites but the lowest occurred in ht 0 013 mg l the differences in environmental factors of the study area were mainly reflected in ec do tn and tp while the spatial differences in ph and chla were not significant 3 2 hydrological connectivity the total area of water bodies in the yellow river delta yrd was found to be 155 69 km2 fig 4 accounting for 10 of the total study area for a threshold distance of 500 m there were 49 components in the yrd and iic and pc values were 0 08 and 0 1 respectively iic and pc values of different region for a threshold distance of 500 m were shown in table 1 compare to tidal zone connectivity metrics both iic and pc were higher in restoration zone what s more dawenliu has the higher connectivity value than huanghekou both in restoration and tidal zone the contributions of different water patches to the overall landscape connectivity at 500 m dispersal distances were shown in fig 5 values of diic ranged from 0 0000012 to 97 90 and values of dpc ranged from 0 00008 to 98 39 the patches with consistently very high diic values accounted for an area of 67 59 in dr 97 26 in hr 72 59 in dt and 76 29 in ht while the ones with consistently very high dpc values accounted for an area of 50 69 in dr 96 29 in hr 72 59 in dt and 76 29 in ht it showed that patches with higher diic and dpc value were relatively large area with surface waters located in the middle of the restoration zone or linear tidal creeks that connected with the bohai sea the linear water creeks connected a large number of water patches which played an important role in the water system connection of the coastal wetland 3 3 community composition and diversity indices in this study a total of 88 species of phytoplankton were identified including 34 species of chlorophyta 22 species of bacillariophyta 14 species of cyanobacteria 6 species of euglenophyta 4 species of pyrrophyta 3 species of cryptophyta 3 species of chrysophyta and 2 species of xanthophyta and a total of 49 zooplankton species were observed in all samples which consisted of 5 cladocerans 12 copepods and 32 rotifers fig 6 in this study if the dominance of a species was greater than 2 y 2 this species was defined as a dominant species lampitt et al 1993 the dominant species of the zooplankton and phytoplankton were shown in table 2 according to the dominance of each species it was found that merismopedia minima and merismopedia elegans which belong to cyanobacteria had a higher

of 1221 1300 ind l and 1000 1029 ind l and the later showed 955 803 ind l and 735 773 ind l in hr and yr zones respectively analysis of plankton community composition at each sampling site fig 7 revealed that the number of species of phytoplankton in hr and yr was generally higher among them hr3 had the largest number of phytoplankton species and hr4 had the largest number of zooplankton species the phytoplankton at each sampling site was dominated by green algae diatoms and cyanobacteria and zooplankton was dominated by rotifers with copepods took second place the abundance and biomass of plankton were quite different at each site for phytoplankton the abundance and biomass were higher in the recovery zone and the yr than in the tidal zone and the species of chrysophyta which were mostly distributed in freshwater bodies had obvious advantages in the recovery zone for zooplankton excepted for the individual samples the abundance and biomass of the rotifers had obvious advantages and the abundance and biomass of the rotifers in the hr and yr regions were much larger than those of other regions 3 4 relationships between community composition and environmental variables the results of the cca analysis were shown in fig 8 for phytoplankton the eigenvalue of the axis 1 and axis 2 were 0 234 and 0 142 respectively and the first two axes contributed 18 0 of variance of phytoplankton species data and 54 3 of species environment relation the species environment correlations for the first two axes were 0 938 and 0 827 respectively for zooplankton the eigenvalues of the axis 1 0 502 and axis 2 0 166 explained 32 1 of variance of zooplankton species data the species environment correlations for the first two axes were 0 991 and 0 968 respectively and the first two axes explained 81 2 of variance of species environment relation which indicated a significant relationship between the environment variables and zooplankton species cca analysis of plankton abundance and environmental factors showed that ec tp do and tn were the main factors affecting the abundance of plankton for phytoplankton most species of diatoms was positively correlated with ec and tp such as chaetoceros synedra navicula most species in chlorophyta and cyanobacteria are positively correlated with ph do and tn such as crucigenia pseudoanabaena and microcystis most species abundance of the copepods was positively correlated with ec and tp such as the species of mesochra and sinocalanus and the abundance of most species of rotifers was positively correlated with do and tn such as the species of brachionus and trichocerca 4 discussion 4 1 differences in hydrological connectivity between different regions of the yellow river deltaic wetland previous studies have shown that the size of water patches is one of the factors determining the regional hydrological connectivity li et al 2018 in this study most of the water patches distributed in dr zone were large and medium sized and the distribution was relatively concentrated while in other areas the water patches were scattered small and medium sized or small patches although there were a large number of small and medium sized patches the area of water patches in the dr zone is significantly larger than that of other areas which made it a certain advantage in the overall hydrological connectivity of the study area in addition to the area of water patches the construction of water conservancy projects in the study area will also have a certain impact on the hydrological connection of the wetland the results showed that the hydrological connectivity of the hr zone on the north bank of the yellow river was poorer than that of the dr zone on the south bank of the yellow river in terms of water conservancy projects both the hr and dr zones would be recharged through the diversion canal but a dam was built every 600 m in the hr channel to block and distribute water in sections which hindered the hydrological connectivity in the region to a certain extent while there was no barrier built in dr zone and there was less human interference yang 2019 therefore the hydrological connectivity of the dr zone was higher overall than the hr region at the same time according to the iic and pc values the hydrological connectivity of the ht zone was smaller than that of the dt zone in this study the results of the extraction of water bodies in the tidal zone showed that there were more tidal creeks channels in the dt zone than in the ht zone so the tidal flat with a more developed tidal creek channel system in the dt zone resulting in a higher hydrological connectivity 4 2 effects of water environmental factors on the distribution of plankton community in rivers and lakes changes in the composition and quantitative structure of plankton communities are influenced by various environmental factors such as physical chemical and biological factors when multiple factors work together on plankton some environmental factors play a leading role naselli flores 2000 the results showed that the main environmental factors affecting the growth of plankton were conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn content and water depth depth correlation analysis showed that conductivity ec was negatively correlated with the biomass and abundance of phytoplankton p 0 01 and dissolved oxygen do was positively correlated with the biomass and abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton p 0 01 combining with fig 3 ht and dt zones had seawater influx and the salinity and conductivity of the water body was obviously higher than that of other zones therefore the abundance and biomass of plankton in the tidal region are relatively low which was consistent with the existing research results park et al 2000 mishra et al 2019 the number of phytoplankton species did not dramatically decline as the abundance and biomass from inland freshwater river yr to brackish wetland hr and dr and then to tidal flat saltmarsh ht and dt indicated that the dominant species were shifted from freshwater chlorophyta e g oocystis sp to brackish cyanobacteria e g merismopedia minima merismopedia elegans and anabaena sp and then to marine cyanobacterium e g oscillatoria sp and pseudoanabaena sp at the river mouth scholz and liebezeit 2012 this was different from the shift of the dominant species in the pearl river estuary pre from freshwater diatoms e g melosira granulata and melosira granulata var angustissima in the upper reaches to saline water diatoms e g skeletonema costatum greville cleve and coscinodiscus sp at the river mouth zhou et al 2016 melosira granulata and melosira granulata var angustissima which are typical riverine phytoplankton with limited salinity tolerance huang et al 2004 also existed in our study see p3 and p4 in fig 8a despite both being not the dominant species but skeletonema costatum and coscinodiscus sp were not found in our samples skeletonema costatum was the dominant estuarine species in the pre and it is a pollution tolerant and indicator species of eutrophication which can adapt to high n p conditions nassar 2000 the difference in phytoplankton community changes from upper reaches to river mouth indicated the salinity gradient may play an importance role in the yrd relative to the pollution gradient playing an importance role in the pre bai et al 2011 xiao et al 2014 2015 the common findings of the yrd and pre on the changes of phytoplankton communities was the generally decreased phytoplankton abundance and biomass with a shift from large sized phytoplankton to relative small sized cells from the upper to lower reaches along the channel as other estuaries schuchardt and schirmer 1991 carić et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 throughout the investigation rotifers polyarthra trigla 6 31 and trichocerca pusilla 14 96 were the dominant zooplankton in the freshwater parts rotifer brachionus urceus and copepod thermocyclops spp were dominant in the brackish water region copepods sinocalanus spp and microsetella spp were dominant in the saltwater region of the yrd table 2 fig 7b 7d 7f and 8b the salinity gradient and phytoplankton distribution table 3 fig 7a 7c and 7e could be responsible for the shift of zooplankton community freshwater rotifers decreased in species number while the marine copepods increased toward the river mouth this was similar to the findings in the elbe estuary holsta et al 1998 4 3 effects of different hydrological connectivity on the distribution of plankton community several studies have announced that hydrological connectivity was a shaping force in structuring the plankton community in the water systems baranyi et al 2002 phlips et al 2008 goździejewska et al 2016 the four zones hr dr ht and dt differ primarily in their degree of connectivity to the yellow river main channel with the floodplain zone hr maintaining a higher connection and displaying physical and chemical characteristics similar to river water the other restoration zone dr connecting to the river only during the water supplement period between mid june to mid july and having a tidal inlet at the south of the zone versus the zones ht and dt without connecting to the river and only having tidal creeks for tidal flows in salt marshes the phytoplankton of hr has a similarly high number of species and was dominated by merismopedia minima and merismopedia elegans cyanobacteria as yr fig 7a 7c while the relatively lower abundance may be associated to the lower nutrient concentrations tn and tp fig 3 the great contribution of chrysophyta to the generally high biomass of phytoplankton in hr and dr suggested large sized chrysophyta was stimulated by nitrogen enrichment relative to phosphorus higher n p in the brackish zones leading to increased phosphorus limitation paerl et al 2001 in contrast in ht and dt the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton were far below those in yr hr and dr the low abundance could be explained by the influence of salinity and dilution effect due to connection to the sea and the low biomass was largely due to the decreased abundance and increased small marine algae phlips et al 2008 these results confirming that the high level of connectivity would lead to similar species composition and variation patterns of richness diversity and biomass biovolume granado and henry 2014 due to the environmental factors changes associated with the variation of hydrological conditions caused by varying hydrologic connectivity tomasek et al 2017 thanks to their short life cycles rotifers developed rapidly in tolerable environments up to very high abundance and biomass baranyi et al 2002 even though other zooplankton groups were covered up in the comparison of abundance and biomass fig 7d 7f a distinct regional variation was discernible in the dominance of zooplankton components in this study through the zooplankton community composition fig 7b 7d 7f copepods constituted the dominant group at the tidal flat near the river mouth while rotifers were dominant in the upper reaches where freshwater influx was relatively high as reported by nair et al 1984 the hydrological connectivity to main river channel promoted the diffusion of rotifers to brackish zones even marine environment however the increasing salinity and copepod predation seaward decreased their abundance and biomass see anjusha et al 2018 our study proved that hydrological connectivity with freshwater river network stimulated freshwater linked species dispersing to salty environments which confirmed the hypothesis this was not only because the hydrological connectivity with freshwater river network directly delivered freshwater species from limnohaline oligohaline region into mesohaline polyhaline region i e brackish and salt marshes lansac tôha et al 2016 anjusha et al 2018 but also strengthened the dispersal by adjusting the salty environment through constantly freshwater input during the processes the salinity of water was declined and nutrients was increased favouring the exchange of organisms through passive dispersal increasing similarity in metacommunity species composition and decreasing beta diversity see lopes et al 2014 those were the reasons for the similar plankton distribution patterns between yr and hr however the very low abundance and biomass of rotifers in the freshwater supplemented zone dr even as low as those in tidal zones ht and dt where there was only tidal creeks for seawater connectivity but not hydrological connectivity to freshwater river network reflected that the relatively higher salinity fig 3 was the major limiting factor for rotifer bloom in brackish wetland same as reported in other studies see medeiros et al 2010 viayeh et al 2012 anjusha et al 2018 moreover the lowest abundance and biomass of plankton in ht and dt zones further demonstrated that salinity was a major factor controlling plankton community distribution in the yrd while the hydrological connectivity to freshwater river network could weaken the inhibition of high salinity and promote the dispersal of plankton especially merismopedia minima merismopedia elegans oscillatoria sp and rotifers trichocerca pusilla polyarthra trigla in wetland networks 5 conclusion the study was carried out among wetlands that span a gradient in hydrological connectivity between the main channel of yellow river and its sidearm system at estuarine region we analyzed the relationship between plankton distribution patterns and hydrological connectivity and discussed the effect of water variable changes especially salinity decline related to the increasing hydrological connectivity to freshwater river on the dispersal of phytoplankton and rotifers to brackish marshes abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton were highly related to the hydrological connectivity and salinity highest amounts were detected at main river channel and zones connected to river where showed high hydrological connectivity and low salinity lowest amounts were detected at tidal flat where hydrological connectivity was low and salinity was high cyanobacteria and chlorophyta were dominating the phytoplankton community and rotifera was dominating the zooplankton community hydrological connectivity favoured cyanobacteria e g merismopedia minima merismopedia elegans and chrysophyta was characterized by its association with high tn tp ratios rotifers i e trichocerca pusilla polyarthra trigla bloomed in hr but not in dr confirmed that salinity was a major factor for the survival and reproduction of rotifers copepod occurred in the tidal flat and might be another threat predation to rotifers this study suggested that the effect of hydrological connectivity was not limited to deliver transfer spread plankton to the linked habitats but also to modify the originally isolated environment to more suitable for colonization through the energy materials and information delivery interchange leading to community similarity between the main channel and the connected side arm system hr with direct connectivity to main river channel showing high plankton similarity as yr indicated the great influence potential of the main channel on plankton community to its hydrological connected wetlands dr with indirectly connectivity to main river channel showed less similar plankton community as yr relative to hr however biotic interaction including community succession competition and zooplankton grazing which played an important role in the plankton community shifts between successional stages need to be considered in the further studies conflict of interest the

1048,springs are environmental objects of unique character determined by water resources and high water quality important for economic recreational landscape and cultural aspects springs on the boundary of surface and groundwater resources are fundamental for understanding resources and circulation of water in the river catchment and can be good indicators for assessment of the natural environment changes the paper presents results of discharge measurements analyses for 65 springs performed in the period 1946 2016 in the area of the lublin upland and roztocze in poland based on approximately 5 000 measurements characteristic discharges were determined for each spring minimum mean and maximum as well as the variation coefficient the role of spring waters in the alimentation of rivers was assessed the most abundant springs continuously or periodically exceed 100 dm3 s 1 maximum discharge 400 dm3 s 1 are alimented from the cretaceous aquifer the springs show high discharge stability in the multiannual rhythm and seasonal regime of water resource fluctuations resulting from the appearance of a series of years with increased or reduced atmospheric precipitation variable response to atmospheric alimentation results from the conditions of water flow through the aeration zone springs provide from 40 to almost 100 of river water because of economic activity contributing to the transformation of environmental components and constituting a threat to springs their niches and water quality there is the need for their protection and their preservation in a possibly natural state in accordance with the local environmental conditions key words springs discharge regime discharge irregularity long term data 1 introduction springs represent high environmental economic and landscape value their efficiency is important for river alimentation especially during dry periods when even 100 of river water comes from groundwater resources michalczyk 1997 2001 siwek and pociask karteczka 2017 during low river discharges water from springs constitutes biological discharge to maintain good ecological state waters outflowing from springs are characterized by stable physical and chemical properties ziułkiewicz 2016 which determine the chemistry of rivers especially in the upper courses low content of dissolved oxygen approx 5 mg dm 3 is typical for groundwaters in potamic zone because of turbulent way of outflow spring waters are quickly oxidized and reach the level of saturation common for surface waters approx 10 mg dm 3 springs as objects on the boundary of surface and groundwater resources can be stated as natural laboratories and are good indicators for assessment of the natural environment changes stability of physical and chemical water properties and spatial isolation of particular springs are crucial for organisms living in springs phytoplankton and macrophytes their occurrence in springs in places which are under relatively weak human impact have immense importance for biological diversity wojtal 2013 żelazna wieczorek and knysak 2017 the lublin region is known for the occurrence of springs with waters commonly used for municipal and economic purposes first published information on springs water resources appeared at the turn of the 19th and 20th century in the middle of the previous century groundwater outflows and periodical measurements of the discharge of selected springs in the lublin region were commenced by department of hydrology department of hydrology and climatology at present faculty of earth sciences and spatial management maria curie skłodowska university other specialised research was conducted simultaneously e g a description of physical and chemical properties of waters of the lublin region was prepared in 1995 in cooperation with voivodship inspectorate of environmental protection in lublin michalczyk 1996b in 2000 in 16 outflows considered to be springs with healing properties or considered miracle springs and in 60 other outflows content of heavy metals was determined and proved to be at the lowest level michalczyk 2001 periodical results of spring monitoring research conducted in different years were presented in several papers michalczyk 1997 michalczyk et al 1998 2004 2008 2015 considering discharges physical chemical properties and their role in river alimentation especially in dry periods after the introduction of the water supply system in rural areas i e after the discontinuation of direct use of spring waters degradation of the outflows is observed and sometimes purposeful transformations of spring niches the environmental values of all springs deserve preservation and the most valuable springs should be under legal protection janiec 1992 michalczyk 2004 the objective of the study is to revise the crenological studies in the lublin upland and roztocze with emphasis on the occurrence and discharge results of field observations let to analyse variability of spring discharge and their regime and to answer the question about the role of spring waters in the alimentation of rivers 2 study area the study area of approximately 12 200 km2 covers the area between the vistula and bug rivers in poland where cretaceous or quaternary carbonate rocks develop the main useful aquifer its range overlaps with the area of the lublin basin hydrogeological region designated in the regionalisation of groundwaters by a s kleczkowski 1990 according to the hydrographic regionalisation wilgat 1998 the designated area covers a subregion of roztocze four subregions of the lublin upland and a subregion of the chełm hills and dubienka depression in physiographic terms fig 1 the study area covers subregions included in the lublin upland and roztocze chałubińska and wilgat 1954 next to the tatra mountains and kraków częstochowa upland it is an area of occurrence of unique groundwater outflows with very high quality and discharges exceeding 100 dm3 s 1 chełmicki et al 2011 moreover the regions are distinguished by a high number of springs and high contribution of groundwaters in total runoff michalczyk 1986 2001 the conditions of water circulation in the lublin upland and roztocze and therefore the occurrence and discharge of springs are largely determined by the series of vertically and horizontally lithologically variable carbonate upper cretaceous and tertiary rocks deposited in the lublin basin within the south western elevated part of the basin the thickness of cretaceous rocks reaches 400 600 m in the north eastern part already in the area of the bug river it decreases to approximately 250 m wyrwicka 1977 mesozoic rocks contain flat fold and block structures as well as dislocations and faults corresponding with the relief and movements of the palaeozoic bedrock pożaryski 1974 the uppermost series of cretaceous rocks are composed of maastrichtian deposits with varied facies in the bottom part east of the wieprz river marls and chalks are largely predominant in the western part opokas and hard marls and in the southern and south eastern part also limestones and gaizes of older cretaceous periods occur wyrwicka 1977 in the north western part of the lublin upland cretaceous rocks cover water bearing palaeocene deposits represented by gaizes limestones and marls with a thickness of up to 70 m harasimiuk and henkiel 1982 in the southern escarpment zone neogene sands sandstones lithothamnion detritic surpule and reef limestones are deposited bielecka 1967 with a total thickness from several to 80 m the carbonate rocks massif usually contains a continuous saturation zone in spite of variable porous fissure conditions of water flow in the vertical profile all types of carbonate rocks form interbedded layers occur with no observed order regularity and fissure permeability is at least ten times higher than porous permeability malinowski 1974 krajewski and motyka 1999 such parameters favour the persistence of upper water levels the existence of which is confirmed by numerous springs in zones of river valleys groundwaters circulating in carbonate rocks remain in hydraulic connection usually recharged with quaternary waters the carbonate bedrock of the lublin upland and roztocze is covered by a series of quaternary deposits with variable thickness the highest in buried valleys and in deep erosion tectonic channels in the areas of slopes and on plateaus the thickness of quaternary deposits is low and in many places the bedrock crops up on the surface jahn 1956 a part of the upland area is covered with loess deposits reaching a depth of 20 30 m their thickness exceeding 3 m is recorded over approximately 30 of the upland area maruszczak 1972 recharge of groundwaters occurs through infiltration of atmospheric precipitation into the ground in roztocze annual precipitation reach 650 700 mm they are higher by 70 100 mm than mean precipitation recorded in the northern and eastern part of the upland area kaszewski 2008 in roztocze the effective infiltration coefficient exceed 160 mm its value decreases towards lowland areas sandomierz basin and through the lublin upland towards polesie and mazowsze on the lublin upland groundwater runoff on the boundary with west roztocze amounts to approximately 140 mm and in the area of the bug river it decreases to 60 mm michalczyk and wilgat 1998 michalczyk and wilgat 2008 3 material and methods the first published information about springs in the research area concerned ferruginous outflows in the czechówka river valley in sławinek near lublin wilson 1859 doborzyński 1896 1904 and other springs existing in the vicinity of lublin krisztafowicz 1902 in 1946 the state hydrological meteorological institute pihm currently institute of meteorology and water management imgw commenced stationary measurements of water levels and discharge of a spring in wąwolnica czarnecka 1965 in 1963 research expanded to 11 springs where monthly discharge measurements were performed every month for several or a dozen years first research of springs in the lublin region conducted by geographers from the maria curie skłodowska university in lublin umcs considered measurements of spring discharge water temperature and radioactivity of water trembaczowski 1953 rederowa 1965 an increase in the scope of field research occurred in the period 1951 1954 i e in the first period of development of the concept of hydrographic surveying wilgat 1964 in 1954 1959 employees of the department of hydrology and students preparing dissertations continued the systematic collection of regional crenological data the cartographic distribution of selected springs was included in the hydrogeological studies paczyński et al 1965 rederowa 1971 janiec 1972 and on the hydrogeographic map of the lublin region wilgat 1968 materials covering multiannual periods collected at the department of hydrology of umcs also provided the basis for an overview of the number of springs their spatial distribution and attempt to assess the total discharge of all groundwater outflows michalczyk 1986 in the early 1990 s at the department of hydrology of umcs in lublin a research programme was prepared aimed at collecting information concerning current discharge and assessment of the role of springs in the alimentation of rivers of the lublin upland and roztocze its implementation involved recording all springs determination of physical and chemical water properties and performance of simultaneous measurements of the discharge of springs and discharges of rivers the field works were performed in three stages the first one covered the western part of the lublin upland the second focused on roztocze and the third one concerned the central and eastern part of the region michalczyk 1993 1996a 2001 annual measurements of approximately 70 springs also commenced performed at the turn of spring and summer may june by means of a current meter physical and chemical water properties were also determined measurements were performed in selected springs with considerable discharge distributed in hydrographic regions of the upland area between the vistula and bug rivers designated by t wilgat 1998 fig 1 based on field research series of measurements were collected for the years 1998 2016 earlier measurement results for the second half of 20th century were taken from reviewed archive materials a large majority of springs are supplied with waters from the cretaceous aquifer only three outflows drain the water resources of the tertiary horizon janów lubelski dzwola and płazów one spring in bezek is alimented with waters of the cretaceous tertiary horizon and in hedwiżyn with waters of the tertiary quaternary horizon for 65 springs data were collected on more than 5 000 measurements or monthly discharges determined based on water gauge observations table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution and discharge of springs of the lublin upland and roztocze multiannual field research conducted in the central part of the area between the vistula and bug rivers resulted in a thorough crenological investigation of the lublin upland and roztocze over a surface area of approximately 12 200 km2 data were collected concerning approximately 1 400 natural springs at a regional scale the density of the distribution of the springs averages 0 115 spring per km2 in the neighbouring areas of the lublin region the density of springs is very low over a 1 5 times larger area only somewhat more than 100 springs were recorded the provided data concerned only places of natural spontaneous and concentrated groundwater outflow to the surface the density of occurrence of the springs is very variable particularly as a consequence of the geological structure land relief and climate conditions a total of 351 springs were recorded in roztocze 673 in the western part of the lublin upland 463 in the central part and 105 in the eastern part throughout the upland area one spring corresponds to an area of 8 5 km2 their highest density occurs in the western part of the lublin upland 7 3 km2 spring in roztocze 7 8 km2 spring in the central part 8 0 km2 spring and in the eastern part 27 6 km2 spring michalczyk 2001 approximately 59 of outflows are located under valley slopes 24 in valley floors and 4 in river beds 11 of outflows were located within largely elevated slopes of valleys or on slopes sometimes in the plateau zone the discharge of springs in the study area is largely varied out of 1 400 springs functioning in 2000 as many as 49 outflows did not reach 1 dm3 s 1 the discharge of 26 of the springs was maintained between 1 and 10 dm3 s 1 and only 13 exceeded 10 dm3 s 1 springs of the latter group exceeding 10 dm3 s 1 supplied 78 3 of spring water reaching rivers michalczyk 2001 a particular group of outflows includes those with discharges of more than 100 dm3 s 1 they are located in the main valleys near the mouth of a large lateral valley the research documented the seasonal and annual variability of discharge of springs directly corresponding with the abundance of water resources of the carbonate rocks of the lublin upland and roztocze in a year with average abundance of groundwaters the total discharge of springs was estimated for 13 0 m3 s 1 in years with low water resources total discharge decreases to 6 7 m3 s 1 and in those with high water abundance it increases to 18 0 m3 s 1 michalczyk 2001 in the upland area of the lublin region springs usually provide the source of rivers simultaneously determining the water resources of the resulting streams in periods with no precipitation the amount of flowing water results from the discharge of springs and direct alimentation of river channels from groundwater resources in entire catchments springs provide from 40 to almost 100 of river water michalczyk 1996a 2001 the contribution of springs and groundwaters in alimentation of rivers shows regional variability it is the highest in areas of occurrence of opokas gaizes and hard marls and the lowest in the zone of occurrence of chalk and soft marls spring alimentation and overland flow are each responsible for 26 of the runoff volume michalczyk 2001 in roztocze specific spring runoffs reach values of 2 2 dm3 s 1 km2 in the western part of the lublin upland they amount to approximately 1 0 dm3 s 1 km2 in the middle part 0 9 dm3 s 1 km2 and in the eastern part they do not reach 0 1 dm3 s 1 km2 4 2 annual and seasonal variability of spring efficiency the discharge of springs depends on the groundwater resources of the cretaceous tertiary horizon and their volume is directly related to atmospheric precipitation the precipitation distribution shows annual seasonal and spatial variability it is the basic factor determining the multiannual and seasonal variability of water resources and spring discharge good permeability of surface formations permits retention of precipitation and snowmelt waters in the aeration and saturation zone good water flow conditions and high capacity of zones of tectonic cracks provide for the stability of alimentation of springs studies concerning single springs show considerable dependencies occurring between atmospheric precipitation groundwater stages and discharge of springs michalczyk 1982 1983a 1983b 1986 1996a michalczyk and rederowa 1992 michalczyk and chabudziński 2013 long term relations between precipitation and spring discharge in wąwolnica were investigated by k dębski 1965 who suggested the possibility of alimentation of the spring from the area of roztocze research conducted at the department of hydrography of umcs including that for master s theses involved the performance of one year or several year series of monthly measurements of discharge of large springs the measurements show relatively low variability of discharge of springs and its weak direct dependence on monthly and annual precipitation totals the collected materials show no response of springs to high individual rainfall an increase in their discharge occurs with a certain delay in relation to alimentation such increase depends on the lithological character of the aeration zone in the study area the fastest response occurs in the area of outcrops of cracked hard carbonate rocks and the slowest in the zone of occurrence of compact loess covers michalczyk 2001 for the area of west roztocze j malinowski 1974 documented a response of springs alimented from cretaceous rocks lasting half a year in numerous studies based on the analysis of precipitation groundwater stages and spring discharge z michalczyk 1982 1983a 1983b 1988 as well as z michalczyk and e rederowa 1992 documented the supplementation of groundwater resources and an increase in the discharge of springs after a longer period of intensive alimentation lasting 2 4 months and sometimes even 8 months conditions favourable for the supplementation of groundwater resources occur in the cold half year particularly in the period of appearance of a series of years with higher than average atmospheric alimentation hydrological studies also reveal the occurrence of higher groundwater discharges in the year following high precipitation michalczyk and paszczyk 1983 michalczyk 2001 based on published materials of imgw hydrological yearbook 1963 1983 hydrological yearbook 1965 1980 and own research published materials were collected concerning 3 springs located in different hydrographic regions michalczyk 1982 1988 michalczyk and rederowa 1992 michalczyk and turczyński 1999 the spring in wąwolnica is located in the north western part of the lublin upland the spring in sulów is located on the boundary of roztocze and the lublin upland and the spring in goraj zastawie in the central part of west roztocze fig 1 for parallel years of observation and measurements fig 2 includes mean annual discharges together with annual precipitation totals in the station of imgw in zakrzówek the common feature of springs is the occurrence of thick loess covers in their catchments in all springs the appearance of high or low discharge was recorded resulting from the alimentation of the current year or preceding years in the period 1965 1968 an increase in discharge occurred followed by several years of output recession the appearance of very high precipitation in the summer half year 1974 resulted in a high increase in spring discharge and in the following years its recession in particular years periods of appearance of extreme annual discharges occur in different months in periods of an increase in discharge its highest values were recorded at the end of the year and the lowest at the beginning of the year moreover usually after the winter period a lower or higher increase in output occurs suggesting alimentation of groundwaters in the months of the winter half year at the monthly scale mean discharge of springs increase to maximum values recorded in different months from march to june fig 3 this depends on the conditions of water flow in the rock mass and extensiveness of the area of alimentation in the local circulation system maximum annual discharges appear earlier and at the inflow of waters of transitional or regional circulation considerably later however monthly discharge values suggest high stability of outflowing water differences between months with the highest and lowest output are within 10 dm3 s 1 only several percent deviation from the mean value research results show an evident multiannual and seasonal regime of spring water resources fluctuations resulting from the occurrence of a series of years with high or low atmospheric precipitation seasonal variability is stronger in the eastern part of the upland area in the zone of occurrence of soft carbonate rocks the regime of multiannual changes was determined in areas of occurrence of hard carbonate rocks underlying thick loess covers over the last 70 years the lowest efficiencies were recorded in the periods 1954 1955 1959 1960 1964 1965 1973 1974 1984 1985 and 1991 1992 very high efficiencies were observed in the years 1967 1968 1971 1975 1976 1980 1981 1999 2000 and 2010 2011 4 3 mean and extreme spring discharges detailed information concerning changes in the discharge of 65 springs is presented in table 1 and fig 4 they include data on the number of performed measurements in the period 1946 2016 the highest number of systematically measured springs concerned the area of roztocze iia and the lowest the area of the bug river iii the number of performed measurements in particular springs varied from 15 to 679 and the mean discharge from 1 9 to 285 8 dm3 s 1 fig 5 the springs most abundant in water resources are located in zaporze approximately 286 dm3 s 1 hutki 218 dm3 s 1 and malinie 181 dm3 s 1 table 1 the mean discharge of 65 measured springs amounts to 64 3 dm3 s 1 the provided data suggest that the mean variability coefficient amounts to 5 9 it should be emphasised that minimum and maximum values were recorded in different years due to the variability of atmospheric alimentation in the study area and conditions of groundwater circulation in several cases periodical lack of outflow from spring niches was observed these are usually places of groundwater outflow located in the highest parts of the catchment gałęzów wierzchowiska moreover declines in water outflow were caused by human activity e g launching a deep drilled well or pumping water for hydrotechnical facilities after reducing human impact water returned to spring niches e g sobieska wola krasnobród measured maximum spring discharges exceed 400 dm3 s 1 hutki krasnobród malinie sołokije in three springs short term highest output was maintained in a range of 300 400 dm3 s 1 zaporze świdry stokowa góra stryjno duże in total the maximum discharge exceeded 100 dm3 s 1 in 36 measured springs during the measurements performed in late spring 2016 the total mean discharge of 65 springs amounted to 55 9 dm3 s 1 it was therefore lower by 8 4 dm3 s 1 than the mean value calculated for all springs in three springs the lowest discharges boiska belfond kryłów from the period of our measurements were recorded in approximately a dozen outflows higher discharges were observed or those approximate to mean multiannual values such springs were located in the western part in the area of occurrence of loesses catchments of the bystrzyca bystra sanna and łada rivers i e in an area with delayed response to precipitation the comparison of the uniform series of measurements collected for the years 1998 2016 suggests that the discharge in 2016 was one of the lowest in the study period somewhat lower mean discharge by approximately 2 dm3 s 1 was obtained only in 2004 the presented effect is perhaps a result of high discharges obtained in the initial monitoring period and particularly in the years 1999 2000 the irregularity of the discharge of measured springs is low fig 5 table 1 in 49 analysed springs it is maintained in a range of 1 7 7 7 and in nine others it varies from 9 3 to 15 0 in six springs located in the highest parts of the catchment periodical lack of water outflow from spring niches was observed usually in periods of a series of several years with low precipitation the collected materials suggest in accordance with the classification proposed by maillet that the springs of the lublin upland and roztocze should be included in a class with constant and little variable discharge the variability of the variation coefficient of the outflow of the analysed springs is presented in fig 3 in the hydrogenic conditions of the lublin upland and roztocze it is difficult to talk about a minimum series of measurements for proper determination of output variability in the case of multiannual variability of water outflow measurements from a period with low and high discharges are necessary higher variation coefficients of spring output are recorded in the most elevated outflows located in the upper parts of the catchment the values depend on the type of alimentation of a spring i e on how the systems of fissures supplying water are developed sometimes springs occurring at a short distance from one another have a very different range of variability e g zakrzówek i 13 9 zakrzówek ii periodical lack of outflow zakrzówek osada 7 2 4 4 spring water quality and its significance for ecosystems groundwaters discharging springs are characterized by high quality resulting from their natural physical and chemical features the process of shaping the spring water physical and chemical water properties takes place in spring niches resulting from the change of environmental conditions the springs create on unusual environment for various forms of life to develop marked by trees and bushes as a result of stable thermal conditions related to groundwaters outflows of almost stable temperature 9 c and other physical and chemical properties this is why the processes of freezing or warming up do not occur in springs in such conditions occurrence of vegetation and other organisms is possible during all the year total dissolved solids tds for monitored spring waters is 300 600 mg dm 3 so they can be described as fresh or acratopegae of slight alkaline reaction in chemical composition of spring waters in lublin upland and roztocze regions ions hco3 ca2 and mg2 are dominant they compose in almost 90 of anions and cations these are two ion waters of hco3 ca or three ion hco3 ca mg chemical compositions what is the result of dissolving process of hydrocarbonates minerals of the bedrock the content of hydrocarbonates usually is in the range 165 470 mg dm 3 calcium 60 135 mg dm 3 and magnesium 1 20 mg dm 3 spring waters are characterized by slight concentration of substances of anthropogenic origin total content of sulphates chlorides nitrates sodium and potassium is about 10 of the weight total of ions mean concentration of those ions is within the range of values so4 1 65 mg dm 3 cl 3 30 mg dm 3 no3 1 27 mg dm 3 na 1 12 mg dm 3 k 0 2 11 mg dm 3 in spring waters concentration of ammonium and nitrite ions is low however orthophosphates concentration is relatively high slight standard deviations indicate the stability of chemical composition of spring waters michalczyk 2004 conducted research document only small changes of chemical composition of spring waters in the region of cretaceous rocks occurrence specific microclimate in neighborhood of springs gives favorable conditions for subsistence of various plant species including protected ones which are not common in the region plant development depends on size and shape of spring type of bedrock water quality including biogenes content czarnecka 2009 in small springs of the size up to several square meters phytocenosis of slightly diverse floristic composition occurs in big spring niches area of several ares mosaic of herb meadow and rushes communities is found the occurrence of 25 protected taxa of vascular plants and bryophytes including 9 species on the regional red list was stated czarnecka 2009 5 conclusions the hydrographic and physico chemical characteristics of the lublin and roztocze springs allows for the following conclusions 1 the area of the lublin upland and roztocze is characterised by the existence of numerous springs alimented from the cretaceous neogene and palaeocene as well as quaternary aquifer the most efficient outflows are maintained in the area of occurrence of carbonate rocks of the upper cretaceous developed as opokas gaizes and hard marls 2 discharges of many springs continuously or periodically exceed 100 dm3 s 1 and the recorded maximum output reaches even 450 dm3 s 1 abundant springs constitute approx 1 of the total number of springs 3 the springs show high discharge stability fluctuating in the multiannual rhythm overlapping with seasonal changes 4 the response of springs to atmospheric alimentation is variable this results from the conditions of water flow through the aeration zone after precipitation or snowmelt an increase in efficiency in the area of shallow deposition of carbonate rocks is observed quite rapidly in the area of occurrence of loesses the response of springs to alimentation is delayed corresponding with the occurrence of periods with higher or lower alimentation 5 the coefficients of irregularity of spring output have low values allowing for including efficient outflows of the lublin upland and roztocze in classes with permanent or low variability part of the springs located in the highest part of the catchment or outflows subject to anthropopressure in periods with very low groundwater stages provide no outflow such a situation suggests a long term century long decrease in the level of groundwaters 6 water resources in 2016 were relatively low because the efficiencies of springs were usually maintained below the multiannual mean in three cases the lowest efficiency of springs measured in the 21st century was recorded 7 groundwater resources and spring discharge are influenced by climatic and hydrogeological conditions and locally by human impact in stable infiltration conditions precipitation has basic importance in seasonal and multiannual presentation lower precipitation in last years caused springs discharge decreasing phenomenon is the consequence of global circulation changes which had let to stronger or weaker multiannual tendencies in water resources changes 8 springs as environmental objects have a unique character determined by water resources and high water quality the way of its outflow habitat conditions in niches and economic recreational landscape and cultural importance the need for protection of springs results from the necessity of their preservation in a possibly natural state in accordance with the local environmental conditions economic activity contributing to the transformation of environmental components constitutes a threat to springs their niches and water quality 9 spring research are important for ecohydrological studies discharge of springs is important for river alimentation especially during dry periods when water from springs constitutes biological discharge to maintain good ecological state changes of discharge can give knowledge about groundwater resources in the basin physical and chemical spring water properties are excellent indicator for variable conditions of the environment state and can give information in the case of groundwater pollution and human impact spring niches are habitats for many plant species including protected or from the regional red list changes of discharge and physical and chemical properties can have impact on plant existence in niches and their neighbourhood monitoring of spring gives opportunity for understanding changes in the natural environment not only in particular catchment but also in the wider scale further observations of springs should include discharge measurements and analyses of physical and chemical properties in monitored springs at least ones a month it would be favourably for ecological studies to conduct complex observations not only hydrological and hydrochemical but also biological declaration of competing interest none 
1048,springs are environmental objects of unique character determined by water resources and high water quality important for economic recreational landscape and cultural aspects springs on the boundary of surface and groundwater resources are fundamental for understanding resources and circulation of water in the river catchment and can be good indicators for assessment of the natural environment changes the paper presents results of discharge measurements analyses for 65 springs performed in the period 1946 2016 in the area of the lublin upland and roztocze in poland based on approximately 5 000 measurements characteristic discharges were determined for each spring minimum mean and maximum as well as the variation coefficient the role of spring waters in the alimentation of rivers was assessed the most abundant springs continuously or periodically exceed 100 dm3 s 1 maximum discharge 400 dm3 s 1 are alimented from the cretaceous aquifer the springs show high discharge stability in the multiannual rhythm and seasonal regime of water resource fluctuations resulting from the appearance of a series of years with increased or reduced atmospheric precipitation variable response to atmospheric alimentation results from the conditions of water flow through the aeration zone springs provide from 40 to almost 100 of river water because of economic activity contributing to the transformation of environmental components and constituting a threat to springs their niches and water quality there is the need for their protection and their preservation in a possibly natural state in accordance with the local environmental conditions key words springs discharge regime discharge irregularity long term data 1 introduction springs represent high environmental economic and landscape value their efficiency is important for river alimentation especially during dry periods when even 100 of river water comes from groundwater resources michalczyk 1997 2001 siwek and pociask karteczka 2017 during low river discharges water from springs constitutes biological discharge to maintain good ecological state waters outflowing from springs are characterized by stable physical and chemical properties ziułkiewicz 2016 which determine the chemistry of rivers especially in the upper courses low content of dissolved oxygen approx 5 mg dm 3 is typical for groundwaters in potamic zone because of turbulent way of outflow spring waters are quickly oxidized and reach the level of saturation common for surface waters approx 10 mg dm 3 springs as objects on the boundary of surface and groundwater resources can be stated as natural laboratories and are good indicators for assessment of the natural environment changes stability of physical and chemical water properties and spatial isolation of particular springs are crucial for organisms living in springs phytoplankton and macrophytes their occurrence in springs in places which are under relatively weak human impact have immense importance for biological diversity wojtal 2013 żelazna wieczorek and knysak 2017 the lublin region is known for the occurrence of springs with waters commonly used for municipal and economic purposes first published information on springs water resources appeared at the turn of the 19th and 20th century in the middle of the previous century groundwater outflows and periodical measurements of the discharge of selected springs in the lublin region were commenced by department of hydrology department of hydrology and climatology at present faculty of earth sciences and spatial management maria curie skłodowska university other specialised research was conducted simultaneously e g a description of physical and chemical properties of waters of the lublin region was prepared in 1995 in cooperation with voivodship inspectorate of environmental protection in lublin michalczyk 1996b in 2000 in 16 outflows considered to be springs with healing properties or considered miracle springs and in 60 other outflows content of heavy metals was determined and proved to be at the lowest level michalczyk 2001 periodical results of spring monitoring research conducted in different years were presented in several papers michalczyk 1997 michalczyk et al 1998 2004 2008 2015 considering discharges physical chemical properties and their role in river alimentation especially in dry periods after the introduction of the water supply system in rural areas i e after the discontinuation of direct use of spring waters degradation of the outflows is observed and sometimes purposeful transformations of spring niches the environmental values of all springs deserve preservation and the most valuable springs should be under legal protection janiec 1992 michalczyk 2004 the objective of the study is to revise the crenological studies in the lublin upland and roztocze with emphasis on the occurrence and discharge results of field observations let to analyse variability of spring discharge and their regime and to answer the question about the role of spring waters in the alimentation of rivers 2 study area the study area of approximately 12 200 km2 covers the area between the vistula and bug rivers in poland where cretaceous or quaternary carbonate rocks develop the main useful aquifer its range overlaps with the area of the lublin basin hydrogeological region designated in the regionalisation of groundwaters by a s kleczkowski 1990 according to the hydrographic regionalisation wilgat 1998 the designated area covers a subregion of roztocze four subregions of the lublin upland and a subregion of the chełm hills and dubienka depression in physiographic terms fig 1 the study area covers subregions included in the lublin upland and roztocze chałubińska and wilgat 1954 next to the tatra mountains and kraków częstochowa upland it is an area of occurrence of unique groundwater outflows with very high quality and discharges exceeding 100 dm3 s 1 chełmicki et al 2011 moreover the regions are distinguished by a high number of springs and high contribution of groundwaters in total runoff michalczyk 1986 2001 the conditions of water circulation in the lublin upland and roztocze and therefore the occurrence and discharge of springs are largely determined by the series of vertically and horizontally lithologically variable carbonate upper cretaceous and tertiary rocks deposited in the lublin basin within the south western elevated part of the basin the thickness of cretaceous rocks reaches 400 600 m in the north eastern part already in the area of the bug river it decreases to approximately 250 m wyrwicka 1977 mesozoic rocks contain flat fold and block structures as well as dislocations and faults corresponding with the relief and movements of the palaeozoic bedrock pożaryski 1974 the uppermost series of cretaceous rocks are composed of maastrichtian deposits with varied facies in the bottom part east of the wieprz river marls and chalks are largely predominant in the western part opokas and hard marls and in the southern and south eastern part also limestones and gaizes of older cretaceous periods occur wyrwicka 1977 in the north western part of the lublin upland cretaceous rocks cover water bearing palaeocene deposits represented by gaizes limestones and marls with a thickness of up to 70 m harasimiuk and henkiel 1982 in the southern escarpment zone neogene sands sandstones lithothamnion detritic surpule and reef limestones are deposited bielecka 1967 with a total thickness from several to 80 m the carbonate rocks massif usually contains a continuous saturation zone in spite of variable porous fissure conditions of water flow in the vertical profile all types of carbonate rocks form interbedded layers occur with no observed order regularity and fissure permeability is at least ten times higher than porous permeability malinowski 1974 krajewski and motyka 1999 such parameters favour the persistence of upper water levels the existence of which is confirmed by numerous springs in zones of river valleys groundwaters circulating in carbonate rocks remain in hydraulic connection usually recharged with quaternary waters the carbonate bedrock of the lublin upland and roztocze is covered by a series of quaternary deposits with variable thickness the highest in buried valleys and in deep erosion tectonic channels in the areas of slopes and on plateaus the thickness of quaternary deposits is low and in many places the bedrock crops up on the surface jahn 1956 a part of the upland area is covered with loess deposits reaching a depth of 20 30 m their thickness exceeding 3 m is recorded over approximately 30 of the upland area maruszczak 1972 recharge of groundwaters occurs through infiltration of atmospheric precipitation into the ground in roztocze annual precipitation reach 650 700 mm they are higher by 70 100 mm than mean precipitation recorded in the northern and eastern part of the upland area kaszewski 2008 in roztocze the effective infiltration coefficient exceed 160 mm its value decreases towards lowland areas sandomierz basin and through the lublin upland towards polesie and mazowsze on the lublin upland groundwater runoff on the boundary with west roztocze amounts to approximately 140 mm and in the area of the bug river it decreases to 60 mm michalczyk and wilgat 1998 michalczyk and wilgat 2008 3 material and methods the first published information about springs in the research area concerned ferruginous outflows in the czechówka

hydrology of umcs in lublin a research programme was prepared aimed at collecting information concerning current discharge and assessment of the role of springs in the alimentation of rivers of the lublin upland and roztocze its implementation involved recording all springs determination of physical and chemical water properties and performance of simultaneous measurements of the discharge of springs and discharges of rivers the field works were performed in three stages the first one covered the western part of the lublin upland the second focused on roztocze and the third one concerned the central and eastern part of the region michalczyk 1993 1996a 2001 annual measurements of approximately 70 springs also commenced performed at the turn of spring and summer may june by means of a current meter physical and chemical water properties were also determined measurements were performed in selected springs with considerable discharge distributed in hydrographic regions of the upland area between the vistula and bug rivers designated by t wilgat 1998 fig 1 based on field research series of measurements were collected for the years 1998 2016 earlier measurement results for the second half of 20th century were taken from reviewed archive materials a large majority of springs are supplied with waters from the cretaceous aquifer only three outflows drain the water resources of the tertiary horizon janów lubelski dzwola and płazów one spring in bezek is alimented with waters of the cretaceous tertiary horizon and in hedwiżyn with waters of the tertiary quaternary horizon for 65 springs data were collected on more than 5 000 measurements or monthly discharges determined based on water gauge observations table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution and discharge of springs of the lublin upland and roztocze multiannual field research conducted in the central part of the area between the vistula and bug rivers resulted in a thorough crenological investigation of the lublin upland and roztocze over a surface area of approximately 12 200 km2 data were collected concerning approximately 1 400 natural springs at a regional scale the density of the distribution of the springs averages 0 115 spring per km2 in the neighbouring areas of the lublin region the density of springs is very low over a 1 5 times larger area only somewhat more than 100 springs were recorded the provided data concerned only places of natural spontaneous and concentrated groundwater outflow to the surface the density of occurrence of the springs is very variable particularly as a consequence of the geological structure land relief and climate conditions a total of 351 springs were recorded in roztocze 673 in the western part of the lublin upland 463 in the central part and 105 in the eastern part throughout the upland area one spring corresponds to an area of 8 5 km2 their highest density occurs in the western part of the lublin upland 7 3 km2 spring in roztocze 7 8 km2 spring in the central part 8 0 km2 spring and in the eastern part 27 6 km2 spring michalczyk 2001 approximately 59 of outflows are located under valley slopes 24 in valley floors and 4 in river beds 11 of outflows were located within largely elevated slopes of valleys or on slopes sometimes in the plateau zone the discharge of springs in the study area is largely varied out of 1 400 springs functioning in 2000 as many as 49 outflows did not reach 1 dm3 s 1 the discharge of 26 of the springs was maintained between 1 and 10 dm3 s 1 and only 13 exceeded 10 dm3 s 1 springs of the latter group exceeding 10 dm3 s 1 supplied 78 3 of spring water reaching rivers michalczyk 2001 a particular group of outflows includes those with discharges of more than 100 dm3 s 1 they are located in the main valleys near the mouth of a large lateral valley the research documented the seasonal and annual variability of discharge of springs directly corresponding with the abundance of water resources of the carbonate rocks of the lublin upland and roztocze in a year with average abundance of groundwaters the total discharge of springs was estimated for 13 0 m3 s 1 in years with low water resources total discharge decreases to 6 7 m3 s 1 and in those with high water abundance it increases to 18 0 m3 s 1 michalczyk 2001 in the upland area of the lublin region springs usually provide the source of rivers simultaneously determining the water resources of the resulting streams in periods with no precipitation the amount of flowing water results from the discharge of springs and direct alimentation of river channels from groundwater resources in entire catchments springs provide from 40 to almost 100 of river water michalczyk 1996a 2001 the contribution of springs and groundwaters in alimentation of rivers shows regional variability it is the highest in areas of occurrence of opokas gaizes and hard marls and the lowest in the zone of occurrence of chalk and soft marls spring alimentation and overland flow are each responsible for 26 of the runoff volume michalczyk 2001 in roztocze specific spring runoffs reach values of 2 2 dm3 s 1 km2 in the western part of the lublin upland they amount to approximately 1 0 dm3 s 1 km2 in the middle part 0 9 dm3 s 1 km2 and in the eastern part they do not reach 0 1 dm3 s 1 km2 4 2 annual and seasonal variability of spring efficiency the discharge of springs depends on the groundwater resources of the cretaceous tertiary horizon and their volume is directly related to atmospheric precipitation the precipitation distribution shows annual seasonal and spatial variability it is the basic factor determining the multiannual and seasonal variability of water resources and spring discharge good permeability of surface formations permits retention of precipitation and snowmelt waters in the aeration and saturation zone good water flow conditions and high capacity of zones of tectonic cracks provide for the stability of alimentation of springs studies concerning single springs show considerable dependencies occurring between atmospheric precipitation groundwater stages and discharge of springs michalczyk 1982 1983a 1983b 1986 1996a michalczyk and rederowa 1992 michalczyk and chabudziński 2013 long term relations between precipitation and spring discharge in wąwolnica were investigated by k dębski 1965 who suggested the possibility of alimentation of the spring from the area of roztocze research conducted at the department of hydrography of umcs including that for master s theses involved the performance of one year or several year series of monthly measurements of discharge of large springs the measurements show relatively low variability of discharge of springs and its weak direct dependence on monthly and annual precipitation totals the collected materials show no response of springs to high individual rainfall an increase in their discharge occurs with a certain delay in relation to alimentation such increase depends on the lithological character of the aeration zone in the study area the fastest response occurs in the area of outcrops of cracked hard carbonate rocks and the slowest in the zone of occurrence of compact loess covers michalczyk 2001 for the area of west roztocze j malinowski 1974 documented a response of springs alimented from cretaceous rocks lasting half a year in numerous studies based on the analysis of precipitation groundwater stages and spring discharge z michalczyk 1982 1983a 1983b 1988 as well as z michalczyk and e rederowa 1992 documented the supplementation of groundwater resources and an increase in the discharge of springs after a longer period of intensive alimentation lasting 2 4 months and sometimes even 8 months conditions favourable for the supplementation of groundwater resources occur in the cold half year particularly in the period of appearance of a series of years with higher than average atmospheric alimentation hydrological studies also reveal the occurrence of higher groundwater discharges in the year following high precipitation michalczyk and paszczyk 1983 michalczyk 2001 based on published materials of imgw hydrological yearbook 1963 1983 hydrological yearbook 1965 1980 and own research published materials were collected concerning 3 springs located in different hydrographic regions michalczyk 1982 1988 michalczyk and rederowa 1992 michalczyk and turczyński 1999 the spring in wąwolnica is located in the north western part of the lublin upland the spring in sulów is located on the boundary of roztocze and the lublin upland and the spring in goraj zastawie in the central part of west roztocze fig 1 for parallel years of observation and measurements fig 2 includes mean annual discharges together with annual precipitation totals in the station of imgw in zakrzówek the common feature of springs is the occurrence of thick loess covers in their catchments in all springs the appearance of high or low discharge was recorded resulting from the alimentation of the current year or preceding years in the period 1965 1968 an increase in discharge occurred followed by several years of output recession the appearance of very high precipitation in the summer half year 1974 resulted in a high increase in spring discharge and in the following years its recession in particular years periods of appearance of extreme annual discharges occur in different months in periods of an increase in discharge its highest values were recorded at the end of the year and the lowest at the beginning of the year moreover usually after the winter period a lower or higher increase in output occurs suggesting alimentation of groundwaters in the months of the winter half year at the monthly scale mean discharge of springs increase to maximum values recorded in different months from march to june fig 3 this depends on the conditions of water flow in the rock mass and extensiveness of the area of alimentation in the local circulation system maximum annual discharges appear earlier and at the inflow of waters of transitional or regional circulation considerably later however monthly discharge values suggest high stability of outflowing water differences between months with the highest and lowest output are within 10 dm3 s 1 only several percent deviation from the mean value research results show an evident multiannual and seasonal regime of spring water resources fluctuations resulting from the occurrence of a series of years with high or low atmospheric precipitation seasonal variability is stronger in the eastern part of the upland area in the zone of occurrence of soft carbonate rocks the regime of multiannual changes was determined in areas of occurrence of hard carbonate rocks underlying thick loess covers over the last 70 years the lowest efficiencies were recorded in the periods 1954 1955 1959 1960 1964 1965 1973 1974 1984 1985 and 1991 1992 very high efficiencies were observed in the years 1967 1968 1971 1975 1976 1980 1981 1999 2000 and 2010 2011 4 3 mean and extreme spring discharges detailed information concerning changes in the discharge of 65 springs is presented in table 1 and fig 4 they include data on the number of performed measurements in the period 1946 2016 the highest number of systematically measured springs concerned the area of roztocze iia and the lowest the area of the bug river iii the number of performed measurements in particular springs varied from 15 to 679 and the mean discharge from 1 9 to 285 8 dm3 s 1 fig 5 the springs most abundant in water resources are located in zaporze approximately 286 dm3 s 1 hutki 218 dm3 s 1 and malinie 181 dm3 s 1 table 1 the mean discharge of 65 measured springs amounts to 64 3 dm3 s 1 the provided data suggest that the mean variability coefficient amounts to 5 9 it should be emphasised that minimum and maximum values were recorded in different years due to the variability of atmospheric alimentation in the study area and conditions of groundwater circulation in several cases periodical lack of outflow from spring niches was observed these are usually places of groundwater outflow located in the highest parts of the catchment gałęzów wierzchowiska moreover declines in water outflow were caused by human activity e g launching a deep drilled well or pumping water for hydrotechnical facilities after reducing human impact water returned to spring niches e g sobieska wola krasnobród measured maximum spring discharges exceed 400 dm3 s 1 hutki krasnobród malinie sołokije in three springs short term highest output was maintained in a range of 300 400 dm3 s 1 zaporze świdry stokowa góra stryjno duże in total the maximum discharge exceeded 100 dm3 s 1 in 36 measured springs during the measurements performed in late spring 2016 the total mean discharge of 65 springs amounted to 55 9 dm3 s 1 it was therefore lower by 8 4 dm3 s 1 than the mean value calculated for all springs in three springs the lowest discharges boiska belfond kryłów from the period of our measurements were recorded in approximately a dozen outflows higher discharges were observed or those approximate to mean multiannual values such springs were located in the western part in the area of occurrence of loesses catchments of the bystrzyca bystra sanna and łada rivers i e in an area with delayed response to precipitation the comparison of the uniform series of measurements collected for the years 1998 2016 suggests that the discharge in 2016 was one of the lowest in the study period somewhat lower mean discharge by approximately 2 dm3 s 1 was obtained only in 2004 the presented effect is perhaps a result of high discharges obtained in the initial monitoring period and particularly in the years 1999 2000 the irregularity of the discharge of measured springs is low fig 5 table 1 in 49 analysed springs it is maintained in a range of 1 7 7 7 and in nine others it varies from 9 3 to 15 0 in six springs located in the highest parts of the catchment periodical lack of water outflow from spring niches was observed usually in periods of a series of several years with low precipitation the collected materials suggest in accordance with the classification proposed by maillet that the springs of the lublin upland and roztocze should be included in a class with constant and little variable discharge the variability of the variation coefficient of the outflow of the analysed springs is presented in fig 3 in the hydrogenic conditions of the lublin upland and roztocze it is difficult to talk about a minimum series of measurements for proper determination of output variability in the case of multiannual variability of water outflow measurements from a period with low and high discharges are necessary higher variation coefficients of spring output are recorded in the most elevated outflows located in the upper parts of the catchment the values depend on the type of alimentation of a spring i e on how the systems of fissures supplying water are developed sometimes springs occurring at a short distance from one another have a very different range of variability e g zakrzówek i 13 9 zakrzówek ii periodical lack of outflow zakrzówek osada 7 2 4 4 spring water quality and its significance for ecosystems groundwaters discharging springs are characterized by high quality resulting from their natural physical and chemical features the process of shaping the spring water physical and chemical water properties takes place in spring niches resulting from the change of environmental conditions the springs create on unusual environment for various forms of life to develop marked by trees and bushes as a result of stable thermal conditions related to groundwaters outflows of almost stable temperature 9 c and other physical and chemical properties this is why the processes of freezing or warming up do not occur in springs in such conditions occurrence of vegetation and other organisms is possible during all the year total dissolved solids tds for monitored spring waters is 300 600 mg dm 3 so they can be described as fresh or acratopegae of slight alkaline reaction in chemical composition of spring waters in lublin upland and roztocze regions ions hco3 ca2 and mg2 are dominant they compose in almost 90 of anions and cations these are two ion waters of hco3 ca or three ion hco3 ca mg chemical compositions what is the result of dissolving process of hydrocarbonates minerals of the bedrock the content of hydrocarbonates usually is in the range 165 470 mg dm 3 calcium 60 135 mg dm 3 and magnesium 1 20 mg dm 3 spring waters are characterized by slight concentration of substances of anthropogenic origin total content of sulphates chlorides nitrates sodium and potassium is about 10 of the weight total of ions mean concentration of those ions is within the range of values so4 1 65 mg dm 3 cl 3 30 mg dm 3 no3 1 27 mg dm 3 na 1 12 mg dm 3 k 0 2 11 mg dm 3 in spring waters concentration of ammonium and nitrite ions is low however orthophosphates concentration is relatively high slight standard deviations indicate the stability of chemical composition of spring waters michalczyk 2004 conducted research document only small changes of chemical composition of spring waters in the region of cretaceous rocks occurrence specific microclimate in neighborhood of springs gives favorable conditions for subsistence of various plant species including protected ones which are not common in the region plant development depends on size and shape of spring type of bedrock water quality including biogenes content czarnecka 2009 in small springs of the size up to several square meters phytocenosis of slightly diverse floristic composition occurs in big spring niches area of several ares mosaic of herb meadow and rushes communities is found the occurrence of 25 protected taxa of vascular plants and bryophytes including 9 species on the regional red list was stated czarnecka 2009 5 conclusions the hydrographic and physico chemical characteristics of the lublin and roztocze springs allows for the following conclusions 1 the area of the lublin upland and roztocze is characterised by the existence of numerous springs alimented from the cretaceous neogene and palaeocene as well as quaternary aquifer the most efficient outflows are maintained in the area of occurrence of carbonate rocks of the upper cretaceous developed as opokas gaizes and hard marls 2 discharges of many springs continuously or periodically exceed 100 dm3 s 1 and the recorded maximum output reaches even 450 dm3 s 1 abundant springs constitute approx 1 of the total number of springs 3 the springs show high discharge stability fluctuating in the multiannual rhythm overlapping with seasonal changes 4 the response of springs to atmospheric alimentation is variable this results from the conditions of water flow through the aeration zone after precipitation or snowmelt an increase in efficiency in the area of shallow deposition of carbonate rocks is observed quite rapidly in the area of occurrence of loesses the response of springs to alimentation is delayed corresponding with the occurrence of periods with higher or lower alimentation 5 the coefficients of irregularity of spring output have low values allowing for including efficient outflows of the lublin upland and roztocze in classes with permanent or low variability part of the springs located in the highest part of the catchment or outflows subject to anthropopressure in periods with very low groundwater stages provide no outflow such a situation suggests a long term century long decrease in the level of groundwaters 6 water resources in 2016 were relatively low because the efficiencies of springs were usually maintained below the multiannual mean in three cases the lowest efficiency of springs measured in the 21st century was recorded 7 groundwater resources and spring discharge are influenced by climatic and hydrogeological conditions and locally by human impact in stable infiltration conditions precipitation has basic importance in seasonal and multiannual presentation lower precipitation in last years caused springs discharge decreasing phenomenon is the consequence of global circulation changes which had let to stronger or weaker multiannual tendencies in water resources changes 8 springs as environmental objects have a unique character determined by water resources and high water quality the way of its outflow habitat conditions in niches and economic recreational landscape and cultural importance the need for protection of springs results from the necessity of their preservation in a possibly natural state in accordance with the local environmental conditions economic activity contributing to the transformation of environmental components constitutes a threat to springs their niches and water quality 9 spring research are important for ecohydrological studies discharge of springs is important for river alimentation especially during dry periods when water from springs constitutes biological discharge to maintain good ecological state changes of discharge can give knowledge about groundwater resources in the basin physical and chemical spring water properties are excellent indicator for variable conditions of the environment state and can give information in the case of groundwater pollution and human impact spring niches are habitats for many plant species including protected or from the regional red list changes of discharge and physical and chemical properties can have impact on plant existence in niches and their neighbourhood monitoring of spring gives opportunity for understanding changes in the natural environment not only in particular catchment but also in the wider scale further observations of springs should include discharge measurements and analyses of physical and chemical properties in monitored springs at least ones a month it would be favourably for ecological studies to conduct complex observations not only hydrological and hydrochemical but also biological declaration of competing interest none 
1049,in the lowlands springs are quite rare in the north eastern poland many springs are attributed miraculous properties and water is considered sacred due to their cultural and spiritual importance they have survived to present times thus they can be used to study the hydrological and hydrochemical changes in the aquifer the level of hydrological and hydrochemical changes of the first aquifer in the north podlasie lowland has been assessed we have studied 25 springs and wells considered holy waters historically present in the geographical region of the north podlasie lowland the main hydro and physicio chemical parameters were measured currently majority of the springs have been transformed into shallow dug wells due to groundwater level lowering only in few cases 6 did the springs survived as groundwater outflows their performance was relatively small from 0 3 dm3ˑs 1 the remaining objects 19 are different depth wells capturing the first aquifer the largest lowering of groundwater level exceeding 3 m was found in bielska plain their waters were characterized by excessive iron concentration typical for shallow groundwater of the quaternary aquifer and increased concentration of biogenic elements associated with agricultural activity and natural processes contribute therefore using it as a drinking water requires treatment elevated concentrations of doc nitrogen and phosphorus compounds could have been caused by changes in hydrological conditions in the region transformation of the a spring niche through housing of the outflow or presence of surrounding buildings the studied water bodies were of the bicarbonate calcium type keywords springs groundwater outflow hydrochemistry 1 introduction water has always played a unique role in human existence water that forms the basis of human existence and economic activity has gained the sacred status in many religions of the world johansen 1997 khare et al 2010 al barakah et al 2017 examples of the sacred places related to water and the symbolism associated with beneficial or even necessary action of water in religious activities are often given in the literature it is believed that wells and springs represent the spiritual bosom of the earth due to which they are endowed with the power of healing transmitting the wisdom and fulfilling wishes jackowski 2003 a person experiencing healing properties of their waters may have not even realized their chemical properties however he or she appreciates the relief in their sufferings and attributes it to their holiness drwal 2005 in the history of holy waters being it a sacred spring or a well there are known frequent cases of health improvement after applying the miraculous water on sick places such examples are the most common reasons for the existence of holy waters in the podlasie region groundwaters including those flowing out in the form of springs are characterized by relatively constant temperature in warm periods of the year they are much cooler than the existing surface waters it is the temperature of water that greatly determines its good bacteriological status which is responsible for the improvement of health in the case of bacterial diseases of the skin eyes and other organs jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 in the north podlasie lowland holy waters are less often associated with the apparitions of saints sosna 2001 to facilitate the use of holy waters their niches were captured in boarding and then as a result of gradual lowering of the water surface of the first aquifer they were transformed into dug wells most outflows currently operate in the form of shallow wells table 1 some of them have manual water extraction pumps currently only seven objects have a natural constant and autonomous water outflow in the regional nomenclature all studied holy waters function as sacred springs places particularly important for believers who attribute their unique or even miraculous properties to god s grace that is granted to those who entrust in him this is how they have become places of religious worship until now water from these places serves the believers to drink and wash the body in order to get rid of all diseases kirschner et al 2012 oestigaard 2017 the studied places of worship with holy waters are objects that are extraordinarily unusual possessing their own history surrounded by the protection of the faithful due to which they have survived to our times the sacral importance of the outflows contributed to their preservation and protection baścik et al 2009 they are characteristic elements of the podlasie landscape sosna 2001 pytka 2010 griatowicz 2013 korolczuk 2019 the purpose of the study is to provide a current hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics of holy waters in the north podlasie lowland poland in order to assess the level of environmental changes in the region the cultural and spiritual importance of these water bodies contributed to their preservation and protection to a certain extent despite of their niche transformation in most of the cases 2 study area the research was carried out in the physico geographic region called north podlasie lowland which is a part of the sub province of the podlasie belorussian uplands stretching in the western part of the west russian lowland province kondracki 2000 in terms of hydrology the area belongs to the catchments of the upper narew river and bug river figure 1 the river network of the north podlasie lowland is well developed and its main rivers are narew flowing through the central part of the region biebrza separating the area from the north and bug constituting the southern border of the north podlasie lowland the narew river catchment has an area of 53 873 km2 on polish territory czarnecka 2005a 2005b the springs of narew river are found in the białowieża forest in belarus important tributaries of narew river in the north podlasie lowland are supraśl and biebrza narewka and orlanka river the bug catchment has a surface area of 19 284 1 km2 in poland the research area included the lower course of the river where the largest tributaries are leśna mętna kamionka silna and nurzec river czarnecka 2005a 2005b catchments of the largest rivers of the north podlasie lowland have features typical of lowland ones with meandering beds domination forming vast valleys often wet and marshy peat geomorphologically interesting is the breakthrough section of bug river that crosses the moraine belt of the warta glaciation terpiłowski et al 2004 rivers of the north podlasie lowlands are characterized by a moderate regime with a spring and winter spates and ground rain snow supply according to the classification of river regimes the research area is also characterized by an advantage or balance of surface and underground drainage jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 most of the rivers have maintained their natural character biebrza river protected by the biebrza national park an anastomosing section of narew river protected in the narew national park or the breakthrough section of bug river in the podlaski breakthrough of the bug landscape park but they belong to partially regulated rivers anthropogenic activity is also reflected in the quality of the hydrosphere the current cleanliness state of which is satisfactory due to the limited development of industry low use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture and increasingly appropriate water and sewage management larger modifications of the chemical composition of water occur locally in urban areas jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2008 jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2016 in most of the area of the north podlasie lowland however there are anthropogenically little transformed surface waters due to the favorable large forestation of the catchment and widespread extensive agriculture jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 in terms of hydrogeology the major part of the research area belongs to two regions the narew pregoła and niemen region and the bug region the lowland bug sub region paczyński sadurski 2007 there are 15 hydrological objects studied in the narew pregoła and niemen region these are waters in stary kornin kuraszewo saki gredele kotły rajsk płonka kościelna bachury odrynki folwarki tylwickie ryboły zajączki kożany zawyki and święta woda near wasilków figure 1 in the lowland bug sub region there are 10 tested objects in dubiny tokary moszczona królewska st grabarka mountain miłkowice maćki żurobice dobrowoda krasna wieś and hodyszewo table 1 the main and most important groundwater environment in north eastern poland are quaternary formations in sediments of almost all geological epochs of this area there are sporadically used waters of older geological formations paczyński sadurski 2007 groundwaters of quaternary deposits and deeper aquifer horizons of the north podlasie lowlands belong to the active exchange zone these are poorly mineralized waters of which bi ionic hco3 ca or tri ionic hco3 ca mg waters predominate duchnowski michalski 1987 sometimes also multi ionic waters are formed mainly due to the increased concentration of sulfates and chlorides however proportion of these waters in the research area is relatively small jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 in lowland areas springs are rare in the north podlasie lowland the supraśl catchment is characterized by a high number of springs as compared to earlier studies in the first decade of the 21st century still over 200 outflows were present in the study area jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 the rest has disappeared as a result of the lowering of the groundwater table due to anthropogenic activities e g faulty drainage and climate change effluents and bog springs are the most common forms of groundwater outflow onto the surface and point outflows are relatively rare the most common form of natural groundwater outflows in the area under study is a niche at the foot of slopes one of the most important parameters that characterize natural groundwater outflows is their efficiency the efficiency of springs in the białystok region in lowland conditions varies within wide limits from 0 01 to almost 100 dm3 s 1 outflow group in pieszczaniki jekatierynczuk rudczyk 1999a jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 however outflows with low capacities prevail the maximum outflow efficiency was observed after thaws and spring precipitation after this period the outflow expenditure gradually decreased and minima were observed in the summer autumn period jekatierynczuk rudczyk 1999a in the past holy waters in the podlasie region were natural outflows of underground water most outflows are associated with river valleys although they also occur in the watershed zone table 1 the most common form of groundwater outflow to the surface are seepages and fens while point outflows are relatively rare the most common form of natural outflows of groundwater in the studied area is the niche at the foot of slopes the sacral use of the studied waters influenced on significant transformations of outflows but analysis of their location against the background of the terrain clearly indicates that in the past these were places of groundwater outflow to the surface climatic conditions also influence on hydrological conditions of the north podlasie lowland the climate of the region is characterized by the greatest impact of continentalism in poland in the podlaskie region three local climatic regions were distinguished suwałki podlasie and masovian regions górniak 2000 the study was carried out in podlasie and masovian regions in 2012 the average annual air temperature in bialystok was 7 1 c which was close to the multi year average figure 2 although significant differences in average monthly values were recorded in 2012 the average annual amount of atmospheric precipitation was 623 mm and it was close to the sum recorded over many years much higher rainfall occurred in summer figure 3 3 methods holy waters in the north podlasie lowland were studied three times at the turn of march and april in july and in november in 2012 hydrological year due to the lowering of the groundwater surface level majority of the examined objects function as dug wells more and more frequently with the installed pump facilitating the water intake table 1 in dug wells the depth of the

it is most often associated with small anthropogenic transformations of the area jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 the content of biogenic elements often shows the character of land development and the degree of fertility of habitats near the intake point according to the literature biogenic elements are very important features of shallow groundwater in lowland areas jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 the groundwater in zawyki and kożany was characterized by the highest concentrations of doc both outflows are located in the narew river valley table 1 where the largest bogs in the białystok region occur organic carbon shows the high fertility of water and habitats occurring in the outflow zones the increased doc load reaching groundwater is intensified by drainage carried out within the peat valleys lyon et al 2011 strohmeier et al 2013 eutrophication of the aqueous environment is also caused by nitrogen compounds that in studied waters occur primarily as mineral nitrogen in the ionic

drinking water table 3 disturbingly high concentrations of nitrate ions were recorded in dobrowoda 4 95 0 68 mgˑdm 3 in groundwaters especially in the oxidizing zone of groundwater nitrates play the role of the dominant form of nitrogen occurrence ammonium ions in turn should be present in water at low concentrations the highest mean concentration of ammonium ions occurred in the outflow in zawyki exceeding standards for drinking water this outflow is characterized by the lowest redox potential indicating reduction conditions in this part of białystok region resulting from anthropogenic activity and geogenic processes associated with the developing muck process in peat soils the analysis of the topography of the area reveals that in the recent past there was a large area of a bog spring in this village and a dozen or so years ago the holy water was still captured by a well with a depth of only 0 5 m the content of phosphorus forms also confirms the fertility of waters often elevated concentrations of phosphorus may indicate the anthropogenic transformation of physicochemical parameters of waters and the fertility of the habitat around the outflow the highest mean tp

their worrying quality is commonplace sivasankar ramachandramoorthy 2009 khare et al 2010 kirschner et al 2012 al barakah et al 2017 6 conclusions holy waters in the north podlasie lowland in the recent past functioned in the form of natural outflows of groundwater due to the lowering of groundwater surface level caused by drainage land development and change of water relations they changed their hydrological character but retained their cultural significance permanent autonomous outflow of water remained only in six objects while others are wells some equipped with pumps for water intake tested waters were of the bicarbonate calcium type waters of this region often contain elevated concentrations of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus compounds this is most often associated with anthropogenic transformations comparison of holy waters quality with hydrochemical background developed on a basis of the quality of springs of the supraśl river catchment showed significant exceeding of typical concentrations in the region in the light of requirements for drinking water the quality of holy waters is unsatisfactory the most serious problem is the excessive iron concentration the largest changes in the chemical composition of water were found in the outflows in stary kornin bielska plain and zawyki upper narew valley in comparison with the hydrochemical background of shallow groundwater in the białostocka height despite significant qualitative changes in the underground hydrosphere these objects still exist today the cultural and aesthetic motivations have long played a role in the protection of holy waters religious beliefs were usually conducive to keeping the outflows in the unchanged form which were considered to be the places of

1049,in the lowlands springs are quite rare in the north eastern poland many springs are attributed miraculous properties and water is considered sacred due to their cultural and spiritual importance they have survived to present times thus they can be used to study the hydrological and hydrochemical changes in the aquifer the level of hydrological and hydrochemical changes of the first aquifer in the north podlasie lowland has been assessed we have studied 25 springs and wells considered holy waters historically present in the geographical region of the north podlasie lowland the main hydro and physicio chemical parameters were measured currently majority of the springs have been transformed into shallow dug wells due to groundwater level lowering only in few cases 6 did the springs survived as groundwater outflows their performance was relatively small from 0 3 dm3ˑs 1 the remaining objects 19 are different depth wells capturing the first aquifer the largest lowering of groundwater level exceeding 3 m was found in bielska plain their waters were characterized by excessive iron concentration typical for shallow groundwater of the quaternary aquifer and increased concentration of biogenic elements associated with agricultural activity and natural processes contribute therefore using it as a drinking water requires treatment elevated concentrations of doc nitrogen and phosphorus compounds could have been caused by changes in hydrological conditions in the region transformation of the a spring niche through housing of the outflow or presence of surrounding buildings the studied water bodies were of the bicarbonate calcium type keywords springs groundwater outflow hydrochemistry 1 introduction water has always played a unique role in human existence water that forms the basis of human existence and economic activity has gained the sacred status in many religions of the world johansen 1997 khare et al 2010 al barakah et al 2017 examples of the sacred places related to water and the symbolism associated with beneficial or even necessary action of water in religious activities are often given in the literature it is believed that wells and springs represent the spiritual bosom of the earth due to which they are endowed with the power of healing transmitting the wisdom and fulfilling wishes jackowski 2003 a person experiencing healing properties of their waters may have not even realized their chemical properties however he or she appreciates the relief in their sufferings and attributes it to their holiness drwal 2005 in the history of holy waters being it a sacred spring or a well there are known frequent cases of health improvement after applying the miraculous water on sick places such examples are the most common reasons for the existence of holy waters in the podlasie region groundwaters including those flowing out in the form of springs are characterized by relatively constant temperature in warm periods of the year they are much cooler than the existing surface waters it is the temperature of water that greatly determines its good bacteriological status which is responsible for the improvement of health in the case of bacterial diseases of the skin eyes and other organs jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 in the north podlasie lowland holy waters are less often associated with the apparitions of saints sosna 2001 to facilitate the use of holy waters their niches were captured in boarding and then as a result of gradual lowering of the water surface of the first aquifer they were transformed into dug wells most outflows currently operate in the form of shallow wells table 1 some of them have manual water extraction pumps currently only seven objects have a natural constant and autonomous water outflow in the regional nomenclature all studied holy waters function as sacred springs places particularly important for believers who attribute their unique or even miraculous properties to god s grace that is granted to those who entrust in him this is how they have become places of religious worship until now water from these places serves the believers to drink and wash the body in order to get rid of all diseases kirschner et al 2012 oestigaard 2017 the studied places of worship with holy waters are objects that are extraordinarily unusual possessing their own history surrounded by the protection of the faithful due to which they have survived to our times the sacral importance of the outflows contributed to their preservation and protection baścik et al 2009 they are characteristic elements of the podlasie landscape sosna 2001 pytka 2010 griatowicz 2013 korolczuk 2019 the purpose of the study is to provide a current hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics of holy waters in the north podlasie lowland poland in order to assess the level of environmental changes in the region the cultural and spiritual importance of these water bodies contributed to their preservation and protection to a certain extent despite of their niche transformation in most of the cases 2 study area the research was carried out in the physico geographic region called north podlasie lowland which is a part of the sub province of the podlasie belorussian uplands stretching in the western part of the west russian lowland province kondracki 2000 in terms of hydrology the area belongs to the catchments of the upper narew river and bug river figure 1 the river network of the north podlasie lowland is well developed and its main rivers are narew flowing through the central part of the region biebrza separating the area from the north and bug constituting the southern border of the north podlasie lowland the narew river catchment has an area of 53 873 km2 on polish territory czarnecka 2005a 2005b the springs of narew river are found in the białowieża forest in belarus important tributaries of narew river in the north podlasie lowland are supraśl and biebrza narewka and orlanka river the bug catchment has a surface area of 19 284 1 km2 in poland the research area included the lower course of the river where the largest tributaries are leśna mętna kamionka silna and nurzec river czarnecka 2005a 2005b catchments of the largest rivers of the north podlasie lowland have features typical of lowland ones with meandering beds domination forming vast valleys often wet and marshy peat geomorphologically interesting is the breakthrough section of bug river that crosses the moraine belt of the warta glaciation terpiłowski et al 2004 rivers of the north podlasie lowlands are characterized by a moderate regime with a spring and winter spates and ground rain snow supply according to the classification of river regimes the research area is also characterized by an advantage or balance of surface and underground drainage jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 most of the rivers have maintained their natural character biebrza river protected by the biebrza national park an anastomosing section of narew river protected in the narew national park or the breakthrough section of bug river in the podlaski breakthrough of the bug landscape park but they belong to partially regulated rivers anthropogenic activity is also reflected in the quality of the hydrosphere the current cleanliness state of which is satisfactory due to the limited development of industry low use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture and increasingly appropriate water and sewage management larger modifications of the chemical composition of water occur locally in urban areas jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2008 jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2016 in most of the area of the north podlasie lowland however there are anthropogenically little transformed surface waters due to the favorable large forestation of the catchment and widespread extensive agriculture jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 in terms of hydrogeology the major part of the research area belongs to two regions the narew pregoła and niemen region and the bug region the lowland bug sub region paczyński sadurski 2007 there are 15 hydrological objects studied in the narew pregoła and niemen region these are waters in stary kornin kuraszewo saki gredele kotły rajsk płonka kościelna bachury odrynki folwarki tylwickie ryboły zajączki kożany zawyki and święta woda near wasilków figure 1 in the lowland bug sub region there are 10 tested objects in dubiny tokary moszczona królewska st grabarka mountain miłkowice maćki żurobice dobrowoda krasna wieś and hodyszewo table 1 the main and most important groundwater environment in north eastern poland are quaternary formations in sediments of almost all geological epochs of this area there are sporadically used waters of older geological formations paczyński sadurski 2007 groundwaters of quaternary deposits and deeper aquifer horizons of the north podlasie lowlands belong to the active exchange zone these are poorly mineralized waters of which bi ionic hco3 ca or tri ionic hco3 ca mg waters predominate duchnowski michalski 1987 sometimes also multi ionic waters are formed mainly due to the increased concentration of sulfates and chlorides however proportion of these waters in the research area is relatively small jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 in lowland areas springs are rare in the north podlasie lowland the supraśl catchment is characterized by a high number of springs as compared to earlier studies in the first decade of the 21st century still over 200 outflows were present in the study area jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 the rest has disappeared as a result of the lowering of the groundwater table due to anthropogenic activities e g faulty drainage and climate change effluents and bog springs are the most common forms of groundwater outflow onto the surface and point outflows are relatively rare the most common form of natural groundwater outflows in the area under study is a niche at the foot of slopes one of the most important parameters that characterize natural groundwater outflows is their efficiency the efficiency of springs in the białystok region in lowland conditions varies within wide limits from 0 01 to almost 100 dm3 s 1 outflow group in pieszczaniki jekatierynczuk rudczyk 1999a jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 however outflows with low capacities prevail the maximum outflow efficiency was observed after thaws and spring precipitation after this period the outflow expenditure gradually decreased and minima were observed in the summer autumn period jekatierynczuk rudczyk 1999a in the past holy waters in the podlasie region were natural outflows of underground water most outflows are associated with river valleys although they also occur in the watershed zone table 1 the most common form of groundwater outflow to the surface are seepages and fens while point outflows are relatively rare the most common form of natural outflows of groundwater in the studied area is the niche at the foot of slopes the sacral use of the studied waters influenced on significant transformations of outflows but analysis of their location against the background of the terrain clearly indicates that in the past these were places of groundwater outflow to the surface climatic conditions also influence on hydrological conditions of the north podlasie lowland the climate of the region is characterized by the greatest impact of continentalism in poland in the podlaskie region three local climatic regions were distinguished suwałki podlasie and masovian regions górniak 2000 the study was carried out in podlasie and masovian regions in 2012 the average annual air temperature in bialystok was 7 1 c which was close to the multi year average figure 2 although significant differences in average monthly values were recorded in 2012 the average annual amount of atmospheric precipitation was 623 mm and it was close to the sum recorded over many years much higher rainfall occurred in summer figure 3 3 methods holy waters in the north podlasie lowland were studied three times at the turn of march and april in july and in november in 2012 hydrological year due to the lowering of the groundwater surface level majority of the examined objects function as dug wells more and more frequently with the installed pump facilitating the water intake table 1 in dug wells the depth of the
