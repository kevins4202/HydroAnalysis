7885,study region the upper east region ghana west africa lies within the volta basin floods annually and contributes substantially to ghana s food production study focus we assessed precipitation p evapotranspiration et and total water storage anomalies from grace twsa and gldas noah twca to study the influence of the uer s climate on water availability between 2002 and 2017 we analysed 1 the relative uncertainties of the data sets using the triple cornered hat method 2 the terrestrial water budget to validate twsa twca and 3 cross and multi correlation analyses to study the relationship between water storage or availability and meteorological variables new hydrological insights we found strong correlations between the different p products r 0 96 between the different grace products r 0 95 but not between the different et products the hybrid p twsa from the jet propulsion laboratory and et from era 5 had the smallest relative uncertainties twsa increased by 9 8 0 8 mm yr 1 while twca decreased p and et showed no evidence of a trend and were similarly influenced by the other meteorological variables however 93 of 183 months had water surplus and mean net p was positive indicating the uer received more water than it lost these agree with the increasing twsa trend the water budget validation also confirmed that grace can be used for water management gldas noah underestimates storage in the uer keywords grace evapotranspiration water storage precipitation ghana s upper east region water budget 1 introduction the 2020 world meteorological organization s report on the state of the global climate showed that temporal variations in climate indicators and extreme weather events e g droughts and floods increased in 2020 in comparison to previous years world meteorological organization 2020 a consequence is the continual rise in temperatures the effect of which is pronounced over vulnerable regions such as west africa where increasing temperatures are linked to the large climatic variability particularly in terms of rainfall christensen et al 2013 since the region depends heavily on agriculture it is critical to understand the impact of climate variability on water resources in situ data for water resources monitoring are typically unavailable or scanty over areas such as ghana s upper east region uer the uer 1 contributes substantially to ghana s food production owusu et al 2013 2 has a long dry season and 3 gets flooded annually a result of rainfall and the opening of the bagre dam in burkina faso e g bempah and oyhus 2017 the region s strategic location explains the decision of the government of ghana to construct a multi purpose dam to 1 mitigate the effects of flooding 2 aid irrigation and 3 provide electricity ghana web 2021 these necessitate the study of water resources in the region for sustainable crop production yet according to the ghana meteorological agency there are only six weather stations distributed across the uer hydrological data are either unavailable or not easily accessible although the uer falls entirely within the volta basin which has been the subject of some hydrological studies andam akorful et al 2015 ni et al 2017 the basin spans several jurisdictions with varying climates consequently basin wide analysis of hydro meteorological data may not represent processes in the uer however the sparseness or unavailability of in situ components of total water storage tws presents a huge limitation to water resources analysis in the uer satellite and global hydro meteorological data provide an alternative to monitor water resources examples include satellite only gauge only and hybrid precipitation p products and evapotranspiration et products for hydrological studies modelled data such as those from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004b may provide adequate hydrological information over an area syed et al 2008 also the advent of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission has enabled the measurement of tws anomalies twsa by recovering temporal variations in the earth s gravity field at monthly scales wahr et al 1998 2004 thus grace data are applicable to studying the temporal evolution of the different drivers of the water cycle p et etc chen et al 2010 landerer et al 2020 ramillien et al 2006 in this study we assessed various freely available hydro meteorological and grace products to study water resources in the data poor uer we used methods including the three cornered hat tch for a relative uncertainty estimation of the respective data sets to enable the selection of the most appropriate of the analysed data while such methods yield relative rather than absolute uncertainties they are widely used as proxies to absolute error analysis and provide sufficient information to support data selection in data poor regions situations ferreira et al 2016 galindo and palacio 2003 gray and allan 1974 mccoll et al 2014 yakubu et al 2019 a potential limitation to our study is the resolution of grace the robustness of grace measurements cannot be assured because the area of the uer 8600 km2 is substantially smaller than 150 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2013 rowlands et al 2005 this leads to the mixing of grace signals in the uer with the surrounding signals which can cause biases if the surrounding signals have different signs e g vishwakarma et al 2018 however if storage variations in the uer are 8 km3 this will improve the signal to noise ratio snr of the recovered signals tourian et al 2015 thus grace may provide accurate twsa in the uer grace studies have been conducted over similarly smaller regions biancamaria et al 2019 guo et al 2016 ni et al 2017 tourian et al 2015 including one as small as 38 km2 zheng et al 2018 even so validating grace over a small region especially one with no prior grace studies is necessary to inspire confidence in the results where available and sufficient in situ data may be used to validate grace here we used the water budget equation to evaluate whether grace is suitable for the uer grace can provide tws change twsc hence we expect that the difference of net precipitation and grace twsc will provide insight into the validity of grace results over the uer this assertion is supported for instance by riegger et al 2012 who mentioned that the water budget equation can be used to estimate errors in grace furthermore the combination of grace and fluxes in the water budget equation is well established in the literature abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 andam akorful et al 2015 rodell et al 2004a previous studies over the uer focused on the spatial temporal variations of only a single aspect of the region s climate such as rainfall or temperature for instance rainfall reportedly decreased between 1954 and 2014 while temperatures increased issahaku et al 2016 quaye ballard et al 2020a also showed that more than 50 of the uer was characterised by a decrease in rainfall between 1981 and 2016 owusu et al 2013 reported severe desertification a drought indicator in the uer yet how these and other hydro meteorological conditions impact water availability in the uer has yet to be studied given the agroecological importance of the uer to ghana owusu et al 2013 understanding the relationship between hydro meteorological processes and water availability is necessary to implement policies for water resources management hence our study extended the scope of previous studies by analysing multiple hydro meteorological variables in relation to water resources our objectives were 1 to assess freely available space geodetic hydro meteorological and modelled hydrological data in the uer 2 to assess the use of grace over the uer and 3 extend the scope of previous uer studies to characterise the impact of multiple hydrological and meteorological variables on water resources our study is important because it provides pertinent information that can be used by stakeholders such as the hydrological services department the ghana water company limited and the ghanaian ministry of food and agriculture the findings of this study will also provide important information to the authorities of the yet to be constructed pwalugu dam on its operations e g on irrigation 2 regional setting 2 1 geography the uer shares boundaries with two of ghana s neighbouring countries togo to the east and burkina faso to the north it is located at 10 2 11 2 n 1 6 w to 0 03 e in the northeast of ghana fig 1 the area is approximately 8600 km2 making up about 4 of ghana and 2 of the volta basin it is characterised by a fairly undulating topography with moderate variations kelly et al 2021 slopes range between 1 and 5 but with a few outcrops and highlands ghana statistical service 2014 the maximum elevation is 455 m and the minimum is 119 m with the majority lying around 200 m the major occupation of the region is agriculture ministry of food and agriculture 2019 and farmers typically rely on ponds and dugouts for irrigated farming during the dry season quaye ballard et al 2020b the region is drained by the sisili river and the red and white volta rivers furthermore the region s valleys are characterised by heavy textured soils making them suitable for rice farming however some of the soils are composed of coarse material e g gravel stones and concretion thus reducing their water retention capabilities ministry of food and agriculture 2019 the vegetation of the uer is savannah mainly guinea savannah but also sudan savannah ministry of food and agriculture 2019 2 2 climatology the uer is characterised by two meteorological regimes the rainy april to october and the dry november to march seasons the dry season lasts relatively longer than the rainy season 6 7 months vs 5 6 months and is characterised by low humidity and dry winds harmattan dry season average temperatures range between 15 c december february and 45 c march april with relatively lower nighttime temperatures the mean annual rainfall in the region is 921 mm but exceeded 1200 mm in 2002 and 2007 ministry of food and agriculture 2019 although rainfall in the region is decreasing quaye ballard et al 2020a yiran and stringer 2016 the region is inundated annually these floods occur in response to contributions from the bagre dam in burkina faso rainfall and the volta river 3 material and methods fig 2 summarises the main data and processing workflow adopted in our study we used water storage rainfall p evapotranspiration et and meteorological data methods include 1 areal averaging for time series extraction 2 multi linear regression for time series decomposition and 3 cross correlation and 4 multiple correlation analyses both to examine the relationship between different variables 3 1 data sets the data sets are summarised in table 1 and are described in detail as follows 3 1 1 grace twsa products we used the mass concentration mascon solutions release 6 version 2 from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the center for space research csr at the university of texas save et al 2016 save 2020 wiese et al 2019 for comparison with the mascon grids we also used grace tellus land mass grids that were calculated from csr rl05 csr t spherical harmonic coefficients shcs landerer 2020 we applied the gain factors that were provided with the jpl mascon jpl m and csr t solutions to restore the attenuated signals and reduce leakage effect grace signal attenuation and leakage occur during jpl mascon processing and post processing of shcs csr t restoring signals and reducing the leakage effect improves the signal to noise ratio snr of grace derived twsa landerer and swenson 2012 wiese et al 2016 csr m is distributed on a 0 25 grid jpl m on a 0 5 grid and csr t is distributed on a 1 grid twsa represents total water storage as anomalies from the 2004 to 2009 mean the long term mean is subtracted to account for the static gravity field the study period was limited to april 2002 june 2017 mainly because of the almost 1 year gap between the two grace missions there is also the possibility of a bias between the two missions which requires further investigation not addressed here apart from section 4 4 we used cubic spline interpolation to fill in missing grace months cf andam akorful et al 2015 ramillien et al 2006 this was necessary for the implementation of eq 3 which describes storage change from month to month ramillien et al 2006 3 1 2 the global land data assimilation system gldas gldas uses satellite and terrestrial data as constraints to land surface states to provide an array of near global high resolution and accurate land surface models rodell et al 2004b we calculated total water content twc from gldas noah rui et al 2018 as the sum of canopy water storage cws and soil moisture storage sms then we converted twc into anomalies twca by estimating and subtracting the mean for the period 2004 2009 consistent with the grace solutions we chose gldas noah to evaluate the influence of unmodelled storage compartments in gldas for storage analysis in the uer 3 1 3 precipitation we did not have access to ground based precipitation data thus we compared three freely available precipitation p products the global precipitation measurement gpm the climate prediction centre cpc and the climate hazards group infra red precipitation with stations chirps these products represent satellite only gauge only and hybrid satellite and gauge solutions and are described as follows the gpm mission is a collaboration between nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency and comprises a constellation of satellites providing continuity to global precipitation measurement from the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm hou et al 2014 we used the satellite only imerg final precipitation l3 version 6 product which has spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 1 and 1 month the cpc solution is a purely gauge based global rainfall solution using data from more than 30 000 stations 0 125 grid xie et al 2007 2010 it is managed by the physical sciences laboratory of the us s national oceanic and atmospheric administration distributed at spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 5 and 1 day the chirps product is managed by the climate hazards centre of the university of california and is based on a combination of rain gauge and satellite data we used the monthly chirps version 2 v2 0 product distributed on 0 05 grid funk et al 2015 3 1 4 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et fluxes were extracted from three hydrological models gldas noah the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and the fifth generation reanalysis for the global climate and weather era 5 from the european center for medium range weather forecasts the modis et algorithm mod16 combines a surface energy partitioning process and environmental factors that impact et to calculate a global 8 day et product using data from modis onboard the aqua and terra satellite and station based meteorological observations mu et al 2007 2011 we downloaded the 500 m 8 day resolution mod16a2 product and aggregated to monthly et the data is provided in the sinusoidal map projection hence we dumped the latitude and longitude using the eosdump software http hdfeos org software eosdump php last accessed january 20 2021 era 5 is the replacement of the third generation era interim reanalysis and leverages developments in the integrated forecasting system cycle version 41r2 hersbach et al 2018 we downloaded the era5 land monthly averaged reanalysis data and calculated et as the sum of evaporation and vegetation transpiration the data is provided on a 0 1 grid quantities in era 5 are provided relative to the first day of the month thus we calculated monthly estimates by multiplying these quantities by the number of days in each month 3 1 5 aridity aridity describes the unavailability of water within a region this dryness is described by the aridity index ai given by cherlet et al 2018 1 a i p p e t where p is the annual average of precipitation and pet is the annual average of potential evapotranspiration ai classifications are summarised in table 2 cherlet et al 2018 to avoid the possible biasing of ai analysis because of the incomplete years in our study start and end years respectively april 2002 and june 2017 we recalculated ai from 2003 to 2016 for pet we used monthly cru time series version 4 04 cru ts v4 04 harris et al 2020 cru ts v4 04 is managed by the climate research unit cru of the university of east anglia 3 1 6 other meteorological data in addition to p and et we used temperature wind speed humidity and net short wave radiation swr flux all extracted from gldas noah we refer to these collectively as predictor variables and analysed their impact on twsa rainfall et and available water 3 2 methods 3 2 1 the uer water budget the terrestrial water budget equation relates water storage in an area to p runoff q and et and is expressed as brutsaert 2005 ramillien et al 2006 2 p e t q d s d t 0 where δs ds dt is tws change twsc or twc change twcc and describes storage change from month to month the terrestrial water budget equation balances if there are no errors in the individual data sets presenting a means of a mutual validation of the data thus we used eq 2 to validate grace and gldas noah estimates of δs we approximated δs by numerically differentiating grace gldas noah storage anomalies using the central difference formula 3 δ s t s t 1 s t 1 2 2 t t m a x 1 where t is time mth we also filtered p and et using a 300 km half width gaussian filter wahr et al 1998 to account for the spectral inconsistencies between grace and p and et ferreira and zibrila 2015 3 2 2 time series analysis for time series we extracted grid points x falling within the uer and calculated their area weighted average s t 4 s t i 1 n a i x i t i 1 n a i where n is the number of pixels and a represents the area per pixel we resampled all data sets on a 0 25 grid to match that of csr m for grace we calculated equivalent water volume ewv km3 by multiplying equivalent water height ewh mm by a i we adopted a time variable regression model to analyse s t we fitted the harmonic function characterised by an offset a linear trend annual and semi annual amplitudes and phases ogawa et al 2011 5 s t β 0 β 1 δ t k 1 2 a k cos ω k t ϕ k ϵ to s t the regression coefficients β 0 and β 1 denote the constant term and the linear trend respectively and a and ϕ are respectively the amplitude and phase δt is the time difference between each data point in years and the median time of the study 2009 5 and ω 2π t is the angular frequency with the period t 1 yr 365 25 days k has a value of 1 or 2 respectively corresponding to the annual and semi annual terms to solve for the parameters and their standard errors we expanded the last term into two pairs of sine and cosine functions a pair for each value of k the expansion uses the trigonometric identity that cos ω k t ϕ k b k cos ω k t c k sin ω k t we then estimated the parameters β 0 β 1 b k and c k and their standard errors via a least squares inversion then a k b k 2 c k 2 and ϕ k tan 1 c k b k we evaluated the estimated parameters by testing the null hypothesis that the parameter was equal to zero against the alternative that it was not equal to zero using the t test we calculated t as the ratio of the parameter estimates to their respective standard errors kutner et al 2005 from which the associated p values were calculated using the tcdf function in matlab r2021a 3 2 3 uncertainty analysis since we did not have in situ data for the different groups of data sets i e twsa p and et we calculated the relative uncertainties σ tch of the three solutions in each group using the generalised three cornered hat tch method galindo and palacio 2003 gray and allan 1974 premoli and tavella 1993 tavella and premoli 1994 the tch method allowed us to estimate the relative error variances of the three time series with the underlying assumption of a normal distribution of their errors like the extended triple collocation etc method mccoll et al 2014 tch does not require a reference data set gray and allan 1974 however we chose tch because etc has the strict requirement that the error variances of the systems must be uncorrelated the error variances of our data sets are likely correlated cf yakubu et al 2019 thus excluding the use of etc in our study we refer the interested reader to ferreira et al 2016 and the references therein for further details on the tch technique we used σ tch to calculate the ensemble averages of the different groups using a weighted averaging method similar to eq 4 by replacing a i with 1 σ tch and x i t with s t we then used the ensemble average to estimate the relative biases of the solutions we calculated the bias as the difference of the individual products and the ensemble average all results based on tch should be interpreted relative to the input solutions for instance if solution a has the smallest σ tch of the solutions a b and c we will refer to it as the best of the three however this conclusion is true only in the context of the three solutions we also expect that solutions with smaller σ tch will have the least deviation bias from their ensemble average this is because solutions with larger σ tch will be down weighted in the ensemble average in some cases we also calculated the snr of the different solutions as the ratio of the mean of the time series and σ tch for decomposed time series components eq 5 we used the estimated standard errors from the least squares inversion section 3 2 2 3 2 4 cross correlation analysis given two random equal length l time series x and y acquired at times t 1 2 l cross correlation analysis examines the relationship between x and y at different times if the variables are detrended then this is given by the cross covariance of x and y chatfield and xing 2019 6 cov x t y t l e x t μ x y t l μ y σ x y l where l lag in mth the cross covariance is related to the cross correlation r xy by 7 r x y l σ x y l σ x σ y where σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of x and y we estimated r xy l by shifting y to the right and left of x and each time calculating the pearson s correlation coefficient we determined the lag at which r xy was maximum this represents the lag time of maximum dependence between x and y if maximum r xy occurs anywhere else but lag 0 then there is a time delay phase shift between x and y if r xy 0 or r xy 0 then x leads or lags y at the given lag we also calculated the square of eq 7 i e the coefficient of determination r 2 to determine the percentage of variations in the response variable that are accounted for by the predictor variable 3 2 5 multiple correlation coefficient we used multiple correlation analysis to inspect the relationship between the predictor variables section 3 1 6 and the other quantities for this we formed two matrices the n 1 vector b representing the response variable and the n j 1 matrix a of the predictor variables we set the first column of a to 1 abdi 2007 and solved for the j unknowns b ˆ via a least squares inversion the multiple r y 1 j 2 which describes the percentage of variations in the response variable that can be explained by the predictor variables was then calculated as 8 r y 1 j 2 s s r s s t where ssr is the regression sum of squares and is given by 9 s s r b ˆ t a t b 1 n 1 t b 2 and sst is the total sum of squares given by 10 s s t b t b 1 n 1 t b 2 where 1 is a column vector of ones and represents the first column of a and t denotes the transpose operator 4 results in line with the aim and objectives of the study we used the following results to answer the questions 1 what is the relative performances of et p twsa solutions from different providers over the uer 2 can grace provide twsa over the uer with a high snr 3 how does gldas noah perform over the uer and 4 what is the relationship between meteorological conditions and water availability in the uer the results for the time series analysis are shown in table 3 this shows the parameter estimates β ˆ 0 β ˆ 1 a ˆ 1 a ˆ 2 ϕ ˆ 1 and ϕ ˆ 2 from eq 5 and their associated standard errors in most cases the standard errors are small compared to the point estimates of the parameters indicating that the parameter is clearly significantly different from zero this is a particular concern for the estimate of the trend β ˆ 1 if this parameter is not significantly different from zero p value 0 05 it indicates that there is no evidence of a trend over time and this component can be ignored in the model 4 1 rainfall fig 3 shows the time series of rainfall eq 4 from gpm cpc chirps and their ensemble average table 4 summarises their statistics differences and relative uncertainties the rainfall peaks usually occur in august and the maximum occurred in august 2007 for all the products table 4 and fig 3 fig 3 and table 4 indicate good agreement between the three rainfall products the products also had high correlation coefficients r 0 96 p value 0 001 and their estimated parameters from eq 5 not shown were similar relative to their ensemble average chirps and cpc underestimated rainfall negative biases table 4 while gpm overestimated rainfall we selected the chirps p product for the rest of the study because of its relatively low bias table 4 and σ tch see table 3 for the estimated parameters of chirps 4 2 aridity we illustrate the aridity pet time series in fig 4a we used pet to calculate aridity index ai the ai eq 1 for the period april 2002 to june 2017 ranged between 0 4 and 0 75 fig 4b i e between semi arid and humid table 2 cherlet et al 2018 when we excluded the incomplete years 2002 and 2017 and recalculated ai the average was 0 64 that is a dry sub humid classification table 2 this classification suggests the uer is susceptible to dryness 4 3 water loss the results for runoff not shown did not exceed 2 mm mth 1 and were therefore excluded from the analysis of water loss fig 5 shows the et time series and table 5 summarises their differences biases and relative uncertainties unlike the p products the et solutions were more dissimilar for instance mod16a2 did not exceed 80 mm mth 1 but gldas noah and era 5 exceeded 100 mm mth 1 the r ranged between 0 76 p value 0 001 mod16a2 and gldas noah and 0 91 p value 0 001 era 5 and gldas noah indicating a comparatively wider variability in the estimation of et by these solutions we selected era 5 as the best of the three solutions the maximum et flux from era 5 occurred in october 2015 and the minimum occurred in march 2006 the time series of the era 5 et product showed no evidence of a trend table 3 4 4 inter comparison of grace solutions we found good agreement between the three grace solutions table 6 fig 6 the minimum correlation coefficient was greater than 0 95 p value 0 001 table 6 shows the summary statistics along with their biases and relative uncertainties and fig 6 shows their time series along with the ensemble average we selected the jpl m solution for the rest of our analyses 4 5 terrestrial water storage tws anomalies from grace we recalculated monthly areal averages from the jpl m data from april 2002 to june 2017 fig 7 shows the time series of twsa expressed in ewh red and ewv green the minimum anomaly 161 1 mm 50 7 km3 was recorded in may 2006 and the maximum 290 4 mm 91 3 km3 was recorded in october 2012 we summarised the time series components of twsa ewh in table 3 notably twsa showed a significant trend of β 1 ˆ 9 8 s β ˆ 1 0 8 mm yr 1 4 6 terrestrial water content twc from gldas fig 8 shows the twca time series the peak twca 154 8 mm 48 7 km3 occurred in september 2003 and the lowest 90 9 mm 28 6 km3 in march 2012 contrary to grace twca showed a declining trend of β 1 ˆ 2 2 s β ˆ 1 0 4 mm yr 1 table 3 4 7 the terrestrial water budget we calculated three δs time series 1 p et net precipitation 2 tws change twsc from grace eq 3 and 3 twc change twcc from gldas noah eq 3 fig 9 shows these time series and p e t f filtered net p see section 3 2 1 all but p e t f showed no evidence of a trend p value 0 05 table 3 we summarised their statistics in table 7 all δs time series were characterised by positive means indicating that the uer received more water than it lost the peak of net precipitation 288 9 mm mth 1 occurred in august 2007 around the time of the anomalously high rainfall in the volta basin see fig 3 its maximum depletion 83 6 mm mth 1 occurred around the start of the dry season in october 2007 twsc peaked 139 4 mm mth 1 in august 2015 with relatively smaller amplitudes than net p fig 9 but the two time series were highly correlated r 0 87 p value 0 001 the minimum twsc 91 2 mm mth 1 was recorded in november 2015 twcc had comparatively smaller values the residual of filtered net p and twsc δ δ s grace f resulted in smaller differences than that of net p and twsc table 7 differences between net p and twcc were the largest 4 8 meteorological conditions and water availability the following describe the results of the relationships between water availability and the meteorological variables fig 10 shows the time series of humidity pressure swr flux temperature and wind speed all except humidity were characterised by increasing trends table 8 the multiple r section 3 2 5 between p and the predictor variables was 0 88 p value 0 0001 when we included et in the predictor variables we found no substantial change in r between p and the predictor variables et included we also found similar relationships between et and the predictor variables with and without p the percentages of the variations in p and et that were explained by the predictor variables were similar with multiple r 2 0 76 and 0 77 respectively thus we conclude that our predictor variables had a similar influence on both et and p rainfall and et had r 0 74 p value 0 001 and rainfall accounted for 54 0 of the variations in et cross correlating p and et showed that et lagged rainfall by 1 mth with maximum r 0 9 p value 0 001 this is equivalent to an r 2 0 81 suggesting that p accounted for 81 of et variations a month after rainfall hence rainfall s maximum contribution to et variations occurred a month after rainfall we analysed the ratio of et to p which is a measure of water surplus or deficit castellani 2017 fig 11 shows the resulting deficit surplus graph ninety three of the 183 months were characterised by a ratio 1 surplus these surplus months were during the months of april to september in the years between 2002 and 2016 and april to june 2017 the average p in surplus months was 143 5 mm and average et was 74 2 mm months of deficit et p 1 were between october and march with average p of 15 8 mm and average et of 42 7 mm both surplus and deficit months were equal in length except in 2002 and 2017 the multiple correlation analysis between twsa and the predictor variables yielded an r 2 0 3 p value 0 001 this value increased to r 2 0 32 and r 2 0 65 when p and et were respectively added to the predictors p value 0 001 the multiple r 2 0 42 when only p and et were used as the predictor variables however et and twsa were more highly correlated r 0 58 than p and twsa r 0 22 nonetheless cross correlation analysis section 3 2 4 estimated a 2 month lag between p and twsa r 0 78 p value 0 001 with twsa trailing p this indicates that the maximum contribution of p to twsa occurred after 2 months of rainfall twca was highly correlated with the predictor variables r 0 89 p value 0 001 adding p to the predictor variables did not change the multiple r but replacing p with et increased the multiple r to 0 94 p value 0 001 the multiple r when both et and p were added to the predictor variables was around 0 94 the multiple r between p and et as predictor variables and twca was 0 88 p value 0 001 net p compared well with the five predictor variables yielding an r 2 0 54 p value 0 001 p accounted for more than 90 of the variation in net precipitation similarly the r 2 between twsc and the predictor variables was 0 64 p value 0 001 and was higher when p was included in the predictor variables r 2 0 80 than when et was added r 2 0 64 collectively et p and the predictor variables explained a little over 80 of the variations in twsc indicating a strong relationship between water availability and meteorological conditions the multiple r 2 between twcc p et and the predictor variables was 0 78 p value 0 001 the r 2 between twcc and the predictor variables was 0 48 this increased to 0 56 and 0 67 upon inclusion of et and p respectively to the predictor variables 5 discussion 5 1 intercomparison of solutions the satellite and gauge based precipitation data sets were similar in their estimation of precipitation this was evident in the closeness of their statistics table 4 and their high correlation coefficients this is further supported by the statistics of their differences maximum mean difference of around 12 mm table 4 and by their σ tch the ordering of the products based on their biases table 4 and σ tch may be explained by their constituent data recall that 1 chirps combines satellite and gauge data funk et al 2015 2 gpm uses purely satellite data hou et al 2014 and 3 cpc uses purely gauge data xie et al 2007 2010 combining gauge and satellite data can improve precipitation estimates conversely the complete reliance on weather stations cpc could mean low data quality over data poor regions such as the uer in contrast the statistics of the differences between the et data sets table 5 and their σ tch showed significant disparities between mod16a2 and the other two solutions mod16a2 also underestimated et by a relatively large amount cf andam akorful et al 2015 this observed behaviour of the mod16a2 et may be attributed to its forcing data including modis land cover leaf area index and meteorological data which may be of low quality in regions like the uer mu et al 2007 2011 for instance the coarse modis land cover used in mod16a2 misclassifies the heterogeneity in savanna areas ramoelo et al 2014 and could lead to biases chang et al 2018 e g the observed comparatively lower et fluxes in the uer the grace solutions compared adequately well results of the intercomparison table 6 and σ tch analysis placed the mascon solutions ahead of the tellus land mass solution this may point to the superiority of mascon regularisation techniques over the conventional processing techniques applied to grace l2 data another possibility is the use of newer data in the mascon solutions relative to the tellus grids 5 2 meteorology p et and the predictors the rainfall time series was characterised by no apparent temporal trend this is in contrast to a related study over the uer that found a decreasing trend in rainfall issahaku et al 2016 this difference in the findings between our study and issahaku et al 2016 could be because of the spatial distribution and resolution of the data sets the latter studied rainfall from 6 gauge stations between 1954 and 2014 the largest values of rainfall which occurred in august are consistent with quaye ballard et al 2020a this is true not only for chirps quaye ballard et al 2020a used chirps in their study but also for cpc and gpm the peak p recorded in august 2007 fig 3 coincided with the anomalously high rainfall event which occurred in the same year in sub saharan africa paeth et al 2011 this anomaly was attributed to the 2007 la niña anomalies in atmospheric circulation and the african easterly waves paeth et al 2011 the dry sub humid classification from the aridity analysis indicated that the uer is prone to dryness cf quaye ballard et al 2020a the trends of the predictor variables table 8 suggested they supported a drier climate and water loss through et however considering the strong relationship between p and et in the uer cf rodell et al 2011 grippa et al 2011 andreini et al 2000 and the similar effects of the predictors on p and et the trends of the predictor variables also support p 5 3 water storage and meteorological conditions our results showed contradictory trends between grace and gldas noah estimates of water storage possible explanations include 1 grace had a low snr because of the area of the uer thus leading to the observed increasing trend 2 the unmodelled storage components in gldas noah contribute significantly to water storage in the uer or 3 the water holding capacity of the soil in the uer items 2 and 3 both refer to gldas noah with regards to low grace snr the grace signals recovered over the uer included signals from the surrounding areas if the signals had opposite signs or were substantially different this would lead to a low snr making grace unusable over the uer however because the uer completely lies within the volta basin we expect that the surrounding signals will not be different from the target in the absence of in situ data we used the water budget equation for validation we see from fig 9 that grace twsc and p et were generally quite similar cf ferreira and zibrila 2015 except when p was close to or exceeded 300 mm mth 1 discussed further in section 5 4 one also sees that the differences became much smaller when net p was filtered to account for spectral inconsistencies fig 9 table 6 although the uer is prone to dryness a positive mean p et value and et p 1 for 51 of the total months indicate that overall the uer received more water through p than it lost through et these two metrics concur with the observed increasing trend in twsa our analysis has assumed that rainfall is the only input to the water cycle in the uer however given that there is no increasing rainfall trend the twsa trend is likely to have another source such as the bagre dam which floods the uer annually we however did not have data to analyse its impact on twsa we also found similarities between the annual amplitudes and linear trends of our study and that of ferreira et al 2012 fig 4 of ferreira et al 2012 shows the linear trend of grace in the uer to be between 8 and 16 mm yr 1 this is important because ferreira et al 2012 used grace level 2 data and their study was over the entire volta basin the area of which is greater than twice the prescribed effective grace resolution 150 000 200 000 km2 thus based on our results and those of previous studies we conclude that grace has a high snr in the uer concerning unmodelled storage components in gldas noah and the low water retention properties of the soil twca in the uer comprises water stored in the soil and canopy rui et al 2018 however the total storage in a region comprises surface water groundwater and any other major water storages canopy water storage made up only a small portion of twca perhaps because the region s vegetation is savanna woodland if there is substantial storage in the unmodelled components this could result in gldas noah underestimating water storage grace aggregates these distinct components vertically as twsa and because our results have established that grace can measure water storage in the uer we conclude that soil moisture alone is not sufficient to describe the total water stored in the uer furthermore if one considers the water retention properties of the soil in the uer it becomes clear why modelled soil water can underestimate water storage in the uer according to the ministry of food and agriculture 2019 some of the soil in the uer has low water retention capacity this claim is further supported by the global water capacity map united states department of agriculture 2003 which classified the uer s soil water capacity between low 25 mm and moderate 25 100 mm in light of this and the statistics of et p and p et we conclude that gldas underestimates water storage in the uer probably because of the unmodelled components and the dependence of twca on soil water regarding the impact of meteorological conditions on water storage the annual amplitude variations in rainfall could not entirely explain the annual amplitude variation in twsa a ˆ 1 p a ˆ 1 twsa 0 93 implying that other factors e g et and other water inflow sources contributed to a ˆ 1 twsa this is to be expected because the uer has one season during which it receives water but rainfall does not account for all the water in the uer section 2 1 or that it receives and other processes e g et in the dry season contribute to the annual amplitude variations conversely rainfall alone was sufficient to explain a ˆ 2 twsa a ˆ 2 p a ˆ 2 twsa 1 95 probably because the impact of et over the period was smaller than that of p i e the uer received more water than it lost see table 7 and section 4 8 5 4 water availability the positive mean values of all the δs time series table 7 indicated that the uer received more water than it lost the large difference between net p and δs from gldas noah can be attributed to the lack of surface water in gldas noah rui et al 2018 and perhaps the water retention properties of the soil in the uer sections 2 1 5 3 ministry of food and agriculture 2019 two possible reasons for the difference between the grace δs time series and net p are 1 the 2 month lag between rainfall and the grace twin satellites sensing its maximum impact on the temporal variations of the gravity field see section 4 8 and rieser et al 2010 and 2 the spectral mismatch between grace and net precipitation notably the wide variations between p et and twsc mainly resulted from their differences in august 2003 2007 2011 2015 fig 9 these periods coincided with rainfall exceeding 300 mm mth 1 given 1 the 2 month time lag between rainfall and grace 2 that conditions predictor variables supported a drier climate and 3 the strong relationship between et and rainfall it is probable that some of the water will have been lost through et runoff had little to no effect on water loss since it did not exceed 2 mm mth 1 notwithstanding the differences between net p and grace twsc were smaller than the bias of net p and twcc filtering p et lowered the differences between filtered net p and twsc furthermore similarities between our study and that of andam akorful et al 2015 provide additional support for the usability of grace over the uer most importantly based on our water budget analysis one would require a mean of 21 0 mm of twsc to close the water budget of the uer using grace between 2002 and 2017 this translates roughly into a correction of 0 11 mm mth 1 to close the uer s water budget thus we conclude that the snr of grace in the uer is high and grace can provide information for water resources monitoring in the region 5 5 limitations and recommendations the main limitation of this study was the unavailability of in situ data for instance we did not have the necessary data to analyse the impact of the bagre dam on water resources in the uer given that twsa was increasing while rainfall showed no trend information from the bagre dam could improve the understanding of twsa dynamics in the uer especially the observed 9 8 0 8 mm yr 1 trend this can be important to the authorities of the yet to be constructed pwalugu dam a future study could analyse the contribution of the bagre dam to determine its contribution to the increasing twsa trend 6 conclusions we assessed globally available hydro meteorological data to study the impact of the climate of the uer on its water resources we validated the grace and gldas water storage time series using the water budget equation and found large differences between net precipitation and gldas noah the grace solution however compared well with net precipitation except when rainfall exceeded 300 mm mth 1 these results indicated that grace can provide support for water resources monitoring in the uer our results also showed that conditions in the uer affect p and et in a similar way but that overall the uer received more water through p than it lost through et all the time series of net p an indication of water availability were characterised by positive means water storage from grace showed an increasing trend of 9 8 0 8 mm yr 1 which likely includes the contribution of another source of water the bagre dam

7885,study region the upper east region ghana west africa lies within the volta basin floods annually and contributes substantially to ghana s food production study focus we assessed precipitation p evapotranspiration et and total water storage anomalies from grace twsa and gldas noah twca to study the influence of the uer s climate on water availability between 2002 and 2017 we analysed 1 the relative uncertainties of the data sets using the triple cornered hat method 2 the terrestrial water budget to validate twsa twca and 3 cross and multi correlation analyses to study the relationship between water storage or availability and meteorological variables new hydrological insights we found strong correlations between the different p products r 0 96 between the different grace products r 0 95 but not between the different et products the hybrid p twsa from the jet propulsion laboratory and et from era 5 had the smallest relative uncertainties twsa increased by 9 8 0 8 mm yr 1 while twca decreased p and et showed no evidence of a trend and were similarly influenced by the other meteorological variables however 93 of 183 months had water surplus and mean net p was positive indicating the uer received more water than it lost these agree with the increasing twsa trend the water budget validation also confirmed that grace can be used for water management gldas noah underestimates storage in the uer keywords grace evapotranspiration water storage precipitation ghana s upper east region water budget 1 introduction the 2020 world meteorological organization s report on the state of the global climate showed that temporal variations in climate indicators and extreme weather events e g droughts and floods increased in 2020 in comparison to previous years world meteorological organization 2020 a consequence is the continual rise in temperatures the effect of which is pronounced over vulnerable regions such as west africa where increasing temperatures are linked to the large climatic variability particularly in terms of rainfall christensen et al 2013 since the region depends heavily on agriculture it is critical to understand the impact of climate variability on water resources in situ data for water resources monitoring are typically unavailable or scanty over areas such as ghana s upper east region uer the uer 1 contributes substantially to ghana s food production owusu et al 2013 2 has a long dry season and 3 gets flooded annually a result of rainfall and the opening of the bagre dam in burkina faso e g bempah and oyhus 2017 the region s strategic location explains the decision of the government of ghana to construct a multi purpose dam to 1 mitigate the effects of flooding 2 aid irrigation and 3 provide electricity ghana web 2021 these necessitate the study of water resources in the region for sustainable crop production yet according to the ghana meteorological agency there are only six weather stations distributed across the uer hydrological data are either unavailable or not easily accessible although the uer falls entirely within the volta basin which has been the subject of some hydrological studies andam akorful et al 2015 ni et al 2017 the basin spans several jurisdictions with varying climates consequently basin wide analysis of hydro meteorological data may not represent processes in the uer however the sparseness or unavailability of in situ components of total water storage tws presents a huge limitation to water resources analysis in the uer satellite and global hydro meteorological data provide an alternative to monitor water resources examples include satellite only gauge only and hybrid precipitation p products and evapotranspiration et products for hydrological studies modelled data such as those from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004b may provide adequate hydrological information over an area syed et al 2008 also the advent of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission has enabled the measurement of tws anomalies twsa by recovering temporal variations in the earth s gravity field at monthly scales wahr et al 1998 2004 thus grace data are applicable to studying the temporal evolution of the different drivers of the water cycle p et etc chen et al 2010 landerer et al 2020 ramillien et al 2006 in this study we assessed various freely available hydro meteorological and grace products to study water resources in the data poor uer we used methods including the three cornered hat tch for a relative uncertainty estimation of the respective data sets to enable the selection of the most appropriate of the analysed data while such methods yield relative rather than absolute uncertainties they are widely used as proxies to absolute error analysis and provide sufficient information to support data selection in data poor regions situations ferreira et al 2016 galindo and palacio 2003 gray and allan 1974 mccoll et al 2014 yakubu et al 2019 a potential limitation to our study is the resolution of grace the robustness of grace measurements cannot be assured because the area of the uer 8600 km2 is substantially smaller than 150 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2013 rowlands et al 2005 this leads to the mixing of grace signals in the uer with the surrounding signals which can cause biases if the surrounding signals have different signs e g vishwakarma et al 2018 however if storage variations in the uer are 8 km3 this will improve the signal to noise ratio snr of the recovered signals tourian et al 2015 thus grace may provide accurate twsa in the uer grace studies have been conducted over similarly smaller regions biancamaria et al 2019 guo et al 2016 ni et al 2017 tourian et al 2015 including one as small as 38 km2 zheng et al 2018 even so validating grace over a small region especially one with no prior grace studies is necessary to inspire confidence in the results where available and sufficient in situ data may be used to validate grace here we used the water budget equation to evaluate whether grace is suitable for the uer grace can provide tws change twsc hence we expect that the difference of net precipitation and grace twsc will provide insight into the validity of grace results over the uer this assertion is supported for instance by riegger et al 2012 who mentioned that the water budget equation can be used to estimate errors in grace furthermore the combination of grace and fluxes in the water budget equation is well established in the literature abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 andam akorful et al 2015 rodell et al 2004a previous studies over the uer focused on the spatial temporal variations of only a single aspect of the region s climate such as rainfall or temperature for instance rainfall reportedly decreased between 1954 and 2014 while temperatures increased issahaku et al 2016 quaye ballard et al 2020a also showed that more than 50 of the uer was characterised by a decrease in rainfall between 1981 and 2016 owusu et al 2013 reported severe desertification a drought indicator in the uer yet how these and other hydro meteorological conditions impact water availability in the uer has yet to be studied given the agroecological importance of the uer to ghana owusu et al 2013 understanding the relationship between hydro meteorological processes and water availability is necessary to implement policies for water resources management hence our study extended the scope of previous studies by analysing multiple hydro meteorological variables in relation to water resources our objectives were 1 to assess freely available space geodetic hydro meteorological and modelled hydrological data in the uer 2 to assess the use of grace over the uer and 3 extend the scope of previous uer studies to characterise the impact of multiple hydrological and meteorological variables on water resources our study is important because it provides pertinent information that can be used by stakeholders such as the hydrological services department the ghana water company limited and the ghanaian ministry of food and agriculture the findings of this study will also provide important information to the authorities of the yet to be constructed pwalugu dam on its operations e g on irrigation 2 regional setting 2 1 geography the uer shares boundaries with two of ghana s neighbouring countries togo to the east and burkina faso to the north it is located at 10 2 11 2 n 1 6 w to 0 03 e in the northeast of ghana fig 1 the area is approximately 8600 km2 making up about 4 of ghana and 2 of the volta basin it is characterised by a fairly undulating topography with moderate variations kelly et al 2021 slopes range between 1 and 5 but with a few outcrops and highlands ghana statistical service 2014 the maximum elevation is 455 m and the minimum is 119 m with the majority lying around 200 m the major occupation of the region is agriculture ministry of food and agriculture 2019 and farmers typically rely on ponds and dugouts for irrigated farming during the dry season quaye ballard et al 2020b the region is drained by the sisili river and the red and white volta rivers furthermore the region s valleys are characterised by heavy textured soils making them suitable for rice farming however some of the soils are composed of coarse material e g gravel stones and concretion thus reducing their water retention capabilities ministry of food and agriculture 2019 the vegetation of the uer is savannah mainly guinea savannah but also sudan savannah ministry of food and agriculture 2019 2 2 climatology the uer is characterised by two meteorological regimes the rainy april to october and the dry november to march seasons the dry season lasts relatively longer than the rainy season 6 7 months vs 5 6 months and is characterised by low humidity and dry winds harmattan dry season average temperatures range between 15 c december february and 45 c march april with relatively lower nighttime temperatures the mean annual rainfall in the region is 921 mm but exceeded 1200 mm in 2002 and 2007 ministry of food and agriculture 2019 although rainfall in the region is decreasing quaye ballard et al 2020a yiran and stringer 2016 the region is inundated annually these floods occur in response to contributions from the bagre dam in burkina faso rainfall and the volta river 3 material and methods fig 2 summarises the main data and processing workflow adopted in our study we used water storage rainfall p evapotranspiration et and meteorological data methods include 1 areal averaging for time series extraction 2 multi linear regression for time series decomposition and 3 cross correlation and 4 multiple correlation analyses both to examine the relationship between different variables 3 1 data sets the data sets are summarised in table 1 and are described in detail as follows 3 1 1 grace twsa products we used the mass concentration mascon solutions release 6 version 2 from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the center for space research csr at the university of texas save et al 2016 save 2020 wiese et al 2019 for comparison with the mascon grids we also used grace tellus land mass grids that were calculated from csr rl05 csr t spherical harmonic coefficients shcs landerer 2020 we applied the gain factors that were provided with the jpl mascon jpl m and csr t solutions to restore the attenuated signals and reduce leakage effect grace signal attenuation and leakage occur during jpl mascon processing and post processing of shcs csr t restoring signals and reducing the leakage effect improves the signal to noise ratio snr of grace derived twsa landerer and swenson 2012 wiese et al 2016 csr m is distributed on a 0 25 grid jpl m on a 0 5 grid and csr t is distributed on a 1 grid twsa represents total water storage as anomalies from the 2004 to 2009 mean the long term mean is subtracted to account for the static gravity field the study period was limited to april 2002 june 2017 mainly because of the almost 1 year gap between the two grace missions there is also the possibility of a bias between the two missions which requires further investigation not addressed here apart from section 4 4 we used cubic spline interpolation to fill in missing grace months cf andam akorful et al 2015 ramillien et al 2006 this was necessary for the implementation of eq 3 which describes storage change from month to month ramillien et al 2006 3 1 2 the global land data assimilation system gldas gldas uses satellite and terrestrial data as constraints to land surface states to provide an array of near global high resolution and accurate land surface models rodell et al 2004b we calculated total water content twc from gldas noah rui et al 2018 as the sum of canopy water storage cws and soil moisture storage sms then we converted twc into anomalies twca by estimating and subtracting the mean for the period 2004 2009 consistent with the grace solutions we chose gldas noah to evaluate the influence of unmodelled storage compartments in gldas for storage analysis in the uer 3 1 3 precipitation we did not have access to ground based precipitation data thus we compared three freely available precipitation p products the global precipitation measurement gpm the climate prediction centre cpc and the climate hazards group infra red precipitation with stations chirps these products represent satellite only gauge only and hybrid satellite and gauge solutions and are described as follows the gpm mission is a collaboration between nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency and comprises a constellation of satellites providing continuity to global precipitation measurement from the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm hou et al 2014 we used the satellite only imerg final precipitation l3 version 6 product which has spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 1 and 1 month the cpc solution is a purely gauge based global rainfall solution using data from more than 30 000 stations 0 125 grid xie et al 2007 2010 it is managed by the physical sciences laboratory of the us s national oceanic and atmospheric administration distributed at spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 5 and 1 day the chirps product is managed by the climate hazards centre of the university of california and is based on a combination of rain gauge and satellite data we used the monthly chirps version 2 v2 0 product distributed on 0 05 grid funk et al 2015 3 1 4 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et fluxes were extracted from three hydrological models gldas noah the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and the fifth generation reanalysis for the global climate

calculate a global 8 day et product using data from modis onboard the aqua and terra satellite and station based meteorological observations mu et al 2007 2011 we downloaded the 500 m 8 day resolution mod16a2 product and aggregated to monthly et the data is provided in the sinusoidal map projection hence we dumped the latitude and longitude using the eosdump software http hdfeos org software eosdump php last accessed january 20 2021 era 5 is the replacement of the third generation era interim reanalysis and leverages developments in the integrated forecasting system cycle version 41r2 hersbach et al 2018 we downloaded the era5 land monthly averaged reanalysis data and calculated et as the sum of evaporation and vegetation transpiration the data is provided on a 0 1 grid quantities in era 5 are provided relative to the first day of the month thus we calculated monthly estimates by multiplying these quantities by the number of days in each month 3 1 5 aridity aridity describes the unavailability of water within a region this dryness is described by the aridity index ai given by cherlet et al 2018 1 a i p p e t where p is the annual average of precipitation and pet is the annual average of potential evapotranspiration ai classifications are summarised in table 2 cherlet et al 2018 to avoid the possible biasing of ai analysis because of the incomplete years in our study start and end years respectively april 2002 and june 2017 we recalculated ai from 2003 to 2016 for pet we used monthly cru time series version 4 04 cru ts v4 04 harris et al 2020 cru ts v4 04 is managed by the climate research unit cru of the university of east anglia 3 1 6 other meteorological data in addition to p and et we used temperature wind speed humidity and net short wave radiation swr flux all extracted from gldas noah we refer to these collectively as predictor variables and analysed their impact on twsa rainfall et and available water 3 2 methods 3 2 1 the uer water budget the terrestrial water budget equation relates water storage in an area to p runoff q and et and is expressed as brutsaert 2005 ramillien et al 2006 2 p e t q d s d t 0 where δs ds dt is tws change twsc or twc change twcc and describes storage change from month to month the terrestrial water budget equation balances if there are no errors in the individual data sets presenting a means of a mutual validation of the data thus we used eq 2 to validate grace and gldas noah estimates of δs we approximated δs by numerically differentiating grace gldas noah storage anomalies using the central difference formula 3 δ s t s t 1 s t 1 2 2 t t m a x 1 where t is time mth we also filtered p and et using a 300 km half width gaussian filter wahr et al 1998 to account for the spectral inconsistencies between grace and p and et ferreira and zibrila 2015 3 2 2 time series analysis for time series we extracted grid points x falling within the uer and calculated their area weighted average s t 4 s t i 1 n a i x i t i 1 n a i where n is the number of pixels and a represents the area per pixel we resampled all data sets on a 0 25 grid to match that of csr m for grace we calculated equivalent water volume ewv km3 by multiplying equivalent water height ewh mm by a i we adopted a time variable regression model to analyse s t we fitted the harmonic function characterised by an offset a linear trend annual and semi annual amplitudes and phases ogawa et al 2011 5 s t β 0 β 1 δ t k 1 2 a k cos ω k t ϕ k ϵ to s t the regression coefficients β 0 and β 1 denote the constant term and the linear trend respectively and a and ϕ are respectively the amplitude and phase δt is the time difference between each data point in years and the median time of the study 2009 5 and ω 2π t is the angular frequency with the period t 1 yr 365 25 days k has a value of 1 or 2 respectively corresponding to the annual and semi annual terms to solve for the parameters and their standard errors we expanded the last term into two pairs of sine and cosine functions a pair for each value of k the expansion uses the trigonometric identity that cos ω k t ϕ k b k cos ω k t c k sin ω k t we then estimated the parameters β 0 β 1 b k and c k and their standard errors via a least squares inversion then a k b k 2 c k 2 and ϕ k tan 1 c k b k we evaluated the estimated parameters by testing the null hypothesis that the parameter was equal to zero against the alternative that it was not equal to zero using the t test we calculated t as the ratio of the parameter estimates to their respective standard errors kutner et al 2005 from which the associated p values were calculated using the tcdf function in matlab r2021a 3 2 3 uncertainty analysis since we did not have in situ data for the different groups of data sets i e twsa p and et we calculated the relative uncertainties σ tch of the three solutions in each group using the generalised three cornered hat tch method galindo and palacio 2003 gray and allan 1974 premoli and tavella 1993 tavella and premoli 1994 the tch method allowed us to estimate the relative error variances of the three time series with the underlying assumption of a normal distribution of their errors like the extended triple collocation etc method mccoll et al 2014 tch does not require a reference data set gray and allan 1974 however we chose tch because etc has the strict requirement that the error variances of the systems must be uncorrelated the error variances of our data sets are likely correlated cf yakubu et al 2019 thus excluding the use of etc in our study we refer the interested reader to ferreira et al 2016 and the references therein for further details on the tch technique we used σ tch to calculate the ensemble averages of the different groups using a weighted averaging method similar to eq 4 by replacing a i with 1 σ tch and x i t with s t we then used the ensemble average to estimate the relative biases of the solutions we calculated the bias as the difference of the individual products and the ensemble average all results based on tch should be interpreted relative to the input solutions for instance if solution a has the smallest σ tch of the solutions a b and c we will refer to it as the best of the three however this conclusion is true only in the context of the three solutions we also expect that solutions with smaller σ tch will have the least deviation bias from their ensemble average this is because solutions with larger σ tch will be down weighted in the ensemble average in some cases we also calculated the snr of the different solutions as the ratio of the mean of the time series and σ tch for decomposed time series components eq 5 we used the estimated standard errors from the least squares inversion section 3 2 2 3 2 4 cross correlation analysis given two random equal length l time series x and y acquired at times t 1 2 l cross correlation analysis examines the relationship between x and y at different times if the variables are detrended then this is given by the cross covariance of x and y chatfield and xing 2019 6 cov x t y t l e x t μ x y t l μ y σ x y l where l lag in mth the cross covariance is related to the cross correlation r xy by 7 r x y l σ x y l σ x σ y where σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of x and y we estimated r xy l by shifting y to the right and left of x and each time calculating the pearson s correlation coefficient we determined the lag at which r xy was maximum this represents the lag time of maximum dependence between x and y if maximum r xy occurs anywhere else but lag 0 then there is a time delay phase shift between x and y if r xy 0 or r xy 0 then x leads or lags y at the given lag we also calculated the square of eq 7 i e the coefficient of determination r 2 to determine the percentage of variations in the response variable that are accounted for by the predictor variable 3 2 5 multiple correlation coefficient we used multiple correlation analysis to inspect the relationship between the predictor variables section 3 1 6 and the other quantities for this we formed two matrices the n 1 vector b representing the response variable and the n j 1 matrix a of the predictor variables we set the first column of a to 1 abdi 2007 and solved for the j unknowns b ˆ via a least squares inversion the multiple r y 1 j 2 which describes the percentage of variations in the response variable that can be explained by the predictor variables was then calculated as 8 r y 1 j 2 s s r s s t where ssr is the regression sum of squares and is given by 9 s s r b ˆ t a t b 1 n 1 t b 2 and sst is the total sum of squares given by 10 s s t b t b 1 n 1 t b 2 where 1 is a column vector of ones and represents the first column of a and t denotes the transpose operator 4 results in line with the aim and objectives of the study we used the following results to answer the questions 1 what is the relative performances of et p twsa solutions from different providers over the uer 2 can grace provide twsa over the uer with a high snr 3 how does gldas noah perform over the uer and 4 what is the relationship between meteorological conditions and water availability in the uer the results for the time series analysis are shown in table 3 this shows the parameter estimates β ˆ 0 β ˆ 1 a ˆ 1 a ˆ 2 ϕ ˆ 1 and ϕ ˆ 2 from eq 5 and their associated standard errors in most cases the standard errors are small compared to the point estimates of the parameters indicating that the parameter is clearly significantly different from zero this is a particular concern for the estimate of the trend β ˆ 1 if this parameter is not significantly different from zero p value 0 05 it indicates that there is no evidence of a trend over time and this component can be ignored in the model 4 1 rainfall fig 3 shows the time series of rainfall eq 4 from gpm cpc chirps and their ensemble average table 4 summarises their statistics differences and relative uncertainties the rainfall peaks usually occur in august and the maximum occurred in august 2007 for all the products table 4 and fig 3 fig 3 and table 4 indicate good agreement between the three rainfall products the products also had high correlation coefficients r 0 96 p value 0 001 and their estimated parameters from eq 5 not shown were similar relative to their ensemble average chirps and cpc underestimated rainfall negative biases table 4 while gpm overestimated rainfall we selected the chirps p product for the rest of the study because of its relatively low bias table 4 and σ tch see table 3 for the estimated parameters of chirps 4 2 aridity we illustrate the aridity pet time series in fig 4a we used pet to calculate aridity index ai the ai eq 1 for the period april 2002 to june 2017 ranged between 0 4 and 0 75 fig 4b i e between semi arid and humid table 2 cherlet et al 2018 when we excluded the incomplete years 2002 and 2017 and recalculated ai the average was 0 64 that is a dry sub humid classification table 2 this classification suggests the uer is susceptible to dryness 4 3 water loss the results for runoff not shown did not exceed 2 mm mth 1 and were therefore excluded from the analysis of water loss fig 5 shows the et time series and table 5 summarises their differences biases and relative uncertainties unlike the p products the et solutions were more dissimilar for instance mod16a2 did not exceed 80 mm mth 1 but gldas noah and era 5 exceeded 100 mm mth 1 the r ranged between 0 76 p value 0 001 mod16a2 and gldas noah and 0 91 p value 0 001 era 5 and gldas noah indicating a comparatively wider variability in the estimation of et by these solutions we selected era 5 as the best of the three solutions the maximum et flux from era 5 occurred in october 2015 and the minimum occurred in march 2006 the time series of the era 5 et product showed no evidence of a trend table 3 4 4 inter comparison of grace solutions we found good agreement between the three grace solutions table 6 fig 6 the minimum correlation coefficient was greater than 0 95 p value 0 001 table 6 shows the summary statistics along with their biases and relative uncertainties and fig 6 shows their time series along with the ensemble average we selected the jpl m solution for the rest of our analyses 4 5 terrestrial water storage tws anomalies from grace we recalculated monthly areal averages from the jpl m data from april 2002 to june 2017 fig 7 shows the time series of twsa expressed in ewh red and ewv green the minimum anomaly 161 1 mm 50 7 km3 was recorded in may 2006 and the maximum 290 4 mm 91 3 km3 was recorded in october 2012 we summarised the time series components of twsa ewh in table 3 notably twsa showed a significant trend of β 1 ˆ 9 8 s β ˆ 1 0 8 mm yr 1 4 6 terrestrial water content twc from gldas fig 8 shows the twca time series the peak twca 154 8 mm 48 7 km3 occurred in september 2003 and the lowest 90 9 mm 28 6 km3 in march 2012 contrary to grace twca showed a declining trend of β 1 ˆ 2 2 s β ˆ 1 0 4 mm yr 1 table 3 4 7 the terrestrial water budget we calculated three δs time series 1 p et net precipitation 2 tws change twsc from grace eq 3 and 3 twc change twcc from gldas noah eq 3 fig 9 shows these time series and p e t f filtered net p see section 3 2 1 all but p e t f showed no evidence of a trend p value 0 05 table 3 we summarised their statistics in table 7 all δs time series were characterised by positive means indicating that the uer received more water than it lost the peak of net precipitation 288 9 mm mth 1 occurred in august 2007 around the time of the anomalously high rainfall in the volta basin see fig 3 its maximum depletion 83 6 mm mth 1 occurred around the start of the dry season in october 2007 twsc peaked 139 4 mm mth 1 in august 2015 with relatively smaller amplitudes than net p fig 9 but the two time series were highly correlated r 0 87 p value 0 001 the minimum twsc 91 2 mm mth 1 was recorded in november 2015 twcc had comparatively smaller values the residual of filtered net p and twsc δ δ s grace f resulted in smaller differences than that of net p and twsc table 7 differences between net p and twcc were the largest 4 8 meteorological conditions and water availability the following describe the results of the relationships between water availability and the meteorological variables fig 10 shows the time series of humidity pressure swr flux temperature and wind speed all except humidity were characterised by increasing trends table 8 the multiple r section 3 2 5 between p and the predictor variables was 0 88 p value 0 0001 when we included et in the predictor variables we found no substantial change in r between p and the predictor variables et included we also found similar relationships between et and the predictor variables with and without p the percentages of the variations in p and et that were explained by the predictor variables were similar with multiple r 2 0 76 and 0 77 respectively thus we conclude that our predictor variables had a similar influence on both et and p rainfall and et had r 0 74 p value 0 001 and rainfall accounted for 54 0 of the variations in et cross correlating p and et showed that et lagged rainfall by 1 mth with maximum r 0 9 p value 0 001 this is equivalent to an r 2 0 81 suggesting that p accounted for 81 of et variations a month after rainfall hence rainfall s maximum contribution to et variations occurred a month after rainfall we analysed the ratio of et to p which is a measure of water surplus or deficit castellani 2017 fig 11 shows the resulting deficit surplus graph ninety three of the 183 months were characterised by a ratio 1 surplus these surplus months were during the months of april to september in the years between 2002 and 2016 and april to june 2017 the average p in surplus months was 143 5 mm and average et was 74 2 mm months of deficit et p 1 were between october and march with average p of 15 8 mm and average et of 42 7 mm both surplus and deficit months were equal in length except in 2002 and 2017 the multiple correlation analysis between twsa and the predictor variables yielded an r 2 0 3 p value 0 001 this value increased to r 2 0 32 and r 2 0 65 when p and et were respectively added to the predictors p value 0 001 the multiple r 2 0 42 when only p and et were used as the predictor variables however et and twsa were more highly correlated r 0 58 than p and twsa r 0 22 nonetheless cross correlation analysis section 3 2 4 estimated a 2 month lag between p and twsa r 0 78 p value 0 001 with twsa trailing p this indicates that the maximum contribution of p to twsa occurred after 2 months of rainfall twca was highly correlated with the predictor variables r 0 89 p value 0 001 adding p to the predictor variables did not change the multiple r but replacing p with et increased the multiple r to 0 94 p value 0 001 the multiple r when both et and p were added to the predictor variables was around 0 94 the multiple r between p and et as predictor variables and twca was 0 88 p value 0 001 net p compared well with the five predictor variables yielding an r 2 0 54 p value 0 001 p accounted for more than 90 of the variation in net precipitation similarly the r 2 between twsc and the predictor variables was 0 64 p value 0 001 and was higher when p was included in the predictor variables r 2 0 80 than when et was added r 2 0 64 collectively et p and the predictor variables explained a little over 80 of the variations in twsc indicating a strong relationship between water availability and meteorological conditions the multiple r 2 between twcc p et and the predictor variables was 0 78 p value 0 001 the r 2 between twcc and the predictor variables was 0 48 this increased to 0 56 and 0 67 upon inclusion of et and p respectively to the predictor variables 5 discussion 5 1 intercomparison of solutions the satellite and gauge based precipitation data sets were similar in their estimation of precipitation this was evident in the closeness of their statistics table 4 and their high correlation coefficients this is further supported by the statistics of their differences maximum mean difference of around 12 mm table 4 and by their σ tch the ordering of the products based on their biases table 4 and σ tch may be explained by their constituent data recall that 1 chirps combines satellite and gauge data funk et al 2015 2 gpm uses purely satellite data hou et al 2014 and 3 cpc uses purely gauge data xie et al 2007 2010 combining gauge and satellite data can improve precipitation estimates conversely the complete reliance on weather stations cpc could mean low data quality over data poor regions such as the uer in contrast the statistics of the differences between the et data sets table 5 and their σ tch showed significant disparities between mod16a2 and the other two solutions mod16a2 also underestimated et by a relatively large amount cf andam akorful et al 2015 this observed behaviour of the mod16a2 et may be attributed to its forcing data including modis land cover leaf area index and meteorological data which may be of low quality in regions like the uer mu et al 2007 2011 for instance the coarse modis land cover used in mod16a2 misclassifies the heterogeneity in savanna areas ramoelo et al 2014 and could lead to biases chang et al 2018 e g the observed comparatively lower et fluxes in the uer the grace solutions compared adequately well results of the intercomparison table 6 and σ tch analysis placed the mascon solutions ahead of the tellus land mass solution this may point to the superiority of mascon regularisation techniques over the conventional processing techniques applied to grace l2 data another possibility is the use of newer data in the mascon solutions relative to the tellus grids 5 2 meteorology p et and the predictors the rainfall time series was characterised by no apparent temporal trend this is in contrast to a related study over the uer that found a decreasing trend in rainfall issahaku et al 2016 this difference in the findings between our study and issahaku et al 2016 could be because of the spatial distribution and resolution of the data sets the latter studied rainfall from 6 gauge stations between 1954 and 2014 the largest values of rainfall which occurred in august are consistent with quaye ballard et al 2020a this is true not only for chirps quaye ballard et al 2020a used chirps in their study but also for cpc and gpm the peak p recorded in august 2007 fig 3 coincided with the anomalously high rainfall event which occurred in the same year in sub saharan africa paeth et al 2011 this anomaly was attributed to the 2007 la niña anomalies in atmospheric circulation and the african easterly waves paeth et al 2011 the dry sub humid classification from the aridity analysis indicated that the uer is prone to dryness cf quaye ballard et al 2020a the trends of the predictor variables table 8 suggested they supported a drier climate and water loss through et however considering the strong relationship between p and et in the uer cf rodell et al 2011 grippa et al 2011 andreini et al 2000 and the similar effects of the predictors on p and et the trends of the predictor variables also support p 5 3 water storage and meteorological conditions our results showed contradictory trends between grace and gldas noah estimates of water storage possible explanations include 1 grace had a low snr because of the area of the uer thus leading to the observed increasing trend 2 the unmodelled storage components in gldas noah contribute significantly to water storage in the uer or 3 the water holding capacity of the soil in the uer items 2 and 3 both refer to gldas noah with regards to low grace snr the grace signals recovered over the uer included signals from the surrounding areas if the signals had opposite signs or were substantially different this would lead to a low snr making grace unusable over the uer however because the uer completely lies within the volta basin we expect that the surrounding signals will not be different from the target in the absence of in situ data we used the water budget equation for validation we see from fig 9 that grace twsc and p et were generally quite similar cf ferreira and zibrila 2015 except when p was close to or exceeded 300 mm mth 1 discussed further in section 5 4 one also sees that the differences became much smaller when net p was filtered to account for spectral inconsistencies fig 9 table 6 although the uer is prone to dryness a positive mean p et value and et p 1 for 51 of the total months indicate that overall the uer received more water through p than it lost through et these two metrics concur with the observed increasing trend in twsa our analysis has assumed that rainfall is the only input to the water cycle in the uer however given that there is no increasing rainfall trend the twsa trend is likely to have another source such as the bagre dam which floods the uer annually we however did not have data to analyse its impact on twsa we also found similarities between the annual amplitudes and linear trends of our study and that of ferreira et al 2012 fig 4 of ferreira et al 2012 shows the linear trend of grace in the uer to be between 8 and 16 mm yr 1 this is important because ferreira et al 2012 used grace level 2 data and their study was over the entire volta basin the area of which is greater than twice the prescribed effective grace resolution 150 000 200 000 km2 thus based on our results and those of previous studies we conclude that grace has a high snr in the uer concerning unmodelled storage components in gldas noah and the low water retention properties of the soil twca in the uer comprises water stored in the soil and canopy rui et al 2018 however the total storage in a region comprises surface water groundwater and any other major water storages canopy water storage made up only a small portion of twca perhaps because the region s vegetation is savanna woodland if there is substantial storage in the unmodelled components this could result in gldas noah underestimating water storage grace aggregates these distinct components vertically as twsa and because our results have established that grace can measure water storage in the uer we conclude that soil moisture alone is not sufficient to describe the total water stored in the uer furthermore if one considers the water retention properties of the soil in the uer it becomes clear why modelled soil water can underestimate water storage in the uer according to the ministry of food and agriculture 2019 some of the soil in the uer has low water retention capacity this claim is further supported by the global water capacity map united states department of agriculture 2003 which classified the uer s soil water capacity between low 25 mm and moderate 25 100 mm in light of this and the statistics of et p and p et we conclude that gldas underestimates water storage in the uer probably because of the unmodelled components and the dependence of twca on soil water regarding the impact of meteorological conditions on water storage the annual amplitude variations in rainfall could not entirely explain the annual amplitude variation in twsa a ˆ 1 p a ˆ 1 twsa 0 93 implying that other factors e g et and other water inflow sources contributed to a ˆ 1 twsa this is to be expected because the uer has one season during which it receives water but rainfall does not account for all the water in the uer section 2 1 or that it receives and other processes e g et in the dry season contribute to the annual amplitude variations conversely rainfall alone was sufficient to explain a ˆ 2 twsa a ˆ 2 p a ˆ 2 twsa 1 95 probably because the impact of et over the period was smaller than that of p i e the uer received more water than it lost see table 7 and section 4 8 5 4 water availability the positive mean values of all the δs time series table 7 indicated that the uer received more water than it lost the large difference between net p and δs from gldas noah can be attributed to the lack of surface water in gldas noah rui et al 2018 and perhaps the water retention properties of the soil in the uer sections 2 1 5 3 ministry of food and agriculture 2019 two possible reasons for the difference between the grace δs time series and net p are 1 the 2 month lag between rainfall and the grace twin satellites sensing its maximum impact on the temporal variations of the gravity field see section 4 8 and rieser et al 2010 and 2 the spectral mismatch between grace and net precipitation notably the wide variations between p et and twsc mainly resulted from their differences in august 2003 2007 2011 2015 fig 9 these periods coincided with rainfall exceeding 300 mm mth 1 given 1 the 2 month time lag between rainfall and grace 2 that conditions predictor variables supported a drier climate and 3 the strong relationship between et and rainfall it is probable that some of the water will have been lost through et runoff had little to no effect on water loss since it did not exceed 2 mm mth 1 notwithstanding the differences between net p and grace twsc were smaller than the bias of net p and twcc filtering p et lowered the differences between filtered net p and twsc furthermore similarities between our study and that of andam akorful et al 2015 provide additional support for the usability of grace over the uer most importantly based on our water budget analysis one would require a mean of 21 0 mm of twsc to close the water budget of the uer using grace between 2002 and 2017 this translates roughly into a correction of 0 11 mm mth 1 to close the uer s water budget thus we conclude that the snr of grace in the uer is high and grace can provide information for water resources monitoring in the region 5 5 limitations and recommendations the main limitation of this study was the unavailability of in situ data for instance we did not have the necessary data to analyse the impact of the bagre dam on water resources in the uer given that twsa was increasing while rainfall showed no trend information from the bagre dam could improve the understanding of twsa dynamics in the uer especially the observed 9 8 0 8 mm yr 1 trend this can be important to the authorities of the yet to be constructed pwalugu dam a future study could analyse the contribution of the bagre dam to determine its contribution to the increasing twsa trend 6 conclusions we assessed globally available hydro meteorological data to study the impact of the climate of the uer on its water resources we validated the grace and gldas water storage time series using the water budget equation and found large differences between net precipitation and gldas noah the grace solution however compared well with net precipitation except when rainfall exceeded 300 mm mth 1 these results indicated that grace can provide support for water resources monitoring in the uer our results also showed that conditions in the uer affect p and et in a similar way but that overall the uer received more water through p than it lost through et all the time series of net p an indication of water availability were characterised by positive means water storage from grace showed an increasing trend of 9 8 0 8 mm yr 1 which likely includes the contribution of another source of water the bagre dam

7886,study region central europe study focus precipitation fields from reanalyses have been widely used for hydrological applications meteorological extreme analyses or climatological research modern reanalyses provide all characteristics in regular grids with high resolutions and thus can substitute for gridded in situ radar and satellite observations here we assess the ability of three modern reanalyses with different spatial resolutions and different rates of assimilation to reproduce precipitation in central europe two global era 5 and era 5 land and one regional mescan surfex reanalysis products are evaluated against adjusted radar derived precipitation totals in the warm parts of the 17 year period new hydrological insights for the region a comparison of daily precipitation totals generally shows good agreement with the observations in all reanalyses however the detailed analysis of climatological indices shows a general overestimation of precipitation sums and the number of wet days in all tested months but an underestimation of high precipitation on monthly or seasonal sums and a lower occurrence of days with sums above 10 mm mescan surfex seems to be the most accurate of all three reanalyses with the exception of the years between 2009 and 2012 with very low precipitation in southern bohemia the largest differences between radar and reanalysis precipitation characteristics are detected in the summer months when convective precipitation prevails the obtained results can be used for further applications in hydrological modelling graphical abstract ga1 keywords atmospheric reanalysis weather radar accuracy evaluation precipitation czech republic 1 introduction reanalyses are a strong tool for atmospheric research they provide information about the past state of the atmosphere at different levels and thus have been widely used to study free atmosphere dynamics e g diallo et al 2021 gruzdev 2017 huth et al 2009 huth and beranová 2021 wallace and gutzler 1981 and the links between the free atmosphere and surface climate deser et al 2016 pokorná and huth 2015 vejmelka et al 2015 wallace et al 2012 recently the large development of climate modelling and computer machine improvement has enabled model resolution to increase and the computation of the smaller scale processes instead of their parameterization and thus the more precise simulation of surface parameters the surface or near surface fields of meteorological elements simulated by reanalysis are now frequently used for a wide range of purposes including research on extreme and compound events hu and franzke 2020 rulfová et al 2021 trend analysis nogueira 2020 simmons et al 2004 characterization of precipitation patterns acharya et al 2019 amjad et al 2020 bandhauer et al 2021 and their causation aleshina et al 2021 řehoř et al 2021 due to fine and in the case of regional reanalysis very fine spatial and temporal resolution reanalysis serves as a reference set for climate model validation johns et al 2006 martin et al 2006 and as an input field for hydrological modelling for example to model river runoff and water storage tarek et al 2020 or to assess the risk of floods and droughts koster et al 2019 mcclean et al 2021 paprotny et al 2020 however correctly simulated surface fields are essential for all of the abovementioned purposes thus a comparison of the simulated characteristics with observations should be the first step before the utilization of the reanalysis output fields this paper focuses on precipitation which is key information for further meteorological climatological hydrological and environmental applications although accurate observations are highly desirable for several reasons the spatial density and temporal coverage of available measurements are still not sufficient in addition to providing information about actual spatiotemporal distributions precipitation data serve as input data into various numerical models predicting natural hazards such as flooding events liu et al 2015 paprotny et al 2020 or landslides canli et al 2018 rain gauges represent the basic principle of precipitation measurement and due to their long and widespread use they are considered a ground truth when compared to other data sources bližňák et al 2021 2021 however their biggest disadvantage is that they are not uniformly distributed in space and large uninhabited areas remain uncovered this fact may become very problematic for hydrological simulations requiring dense and or regular precipitation input data gampe and ludwig 2017 this need can be achieved by applying different techniques to surface observed data from rain gauges or using modern regular grid datasets thus gridded interpolated gauge based observations acharya et al 2020 henn et al 2018 hu and franzke 2020 as well as radar based precipitation products sokol et al 2021 versini 2012 satellite based precipitation products amjad et al 2020 guo and liu 2016 jiang et al 2021 and reanalysis precipitation fields aleshina et al 2021 nogueira 2020 are used by different authors their spatial resolution ranges from coarse in global reanalysis 30 100 km to very fine in regional reanalysis satellite based and radar based precipitation or gridded datasets lower than 10 km each of the regular network precipitation products has advantages and disadvantages interpolated gauge based observations stem from direct in situ precipitation measurements which is a clear advantage compared to other data sources however its accuracy strongly depends on the density of the ground network hohmann et al 2021 merino et al 2021 as well as on the applied interpolation technique wagner et al 2012 therefore despite accurate precipitation information at near rain gauge locations the largest biases can be observed in mountainous areas with sparse rain gauge networks where interpolation techniques that do not consider elevation precipitation relationship fail due to the high elevation gradient daly et al 2017 radar measurements have added value particularly when monitoring convective precipitation which is very variable in space and time therefore it is difficult to capture them with conventional rain gauge networks the reason for this is that weather radars perform measurements at high temporal and spatial resolutions which can capture well convective phenomena including local precipitation on the other hand radar measurements are affected by a number of errors which can be divided into two categories the first is given by incorrect measurements of radar reflectivity due to various reasons such as incorrect calibration of radar hardware attenuation of radar reflectivity ground clutter anomalous propagation of radar beams and blocking by the terrain e g mcroberts and nielsen gammon 2017 seo et al 2015 the second group includes errors resulting from the inaccurate transformation of the measured radar reflectivity into rain rates caused for instance by variability in the vertical profile of reflectivity typically the so called bright band representing the occurrence of increased reflectivity in the melting zone in the region close to the zero isotherm berne and krajewski 2013 hall et al 2015 for these reasons it is desirable to adjust radar measurements by using rain gauge observations e g sokol and bližňák 2009 bližňák et al 2018 in contrast satellite based precipitation products are not influenced by mountains and other obstacles and in the case of satellites in geostationary orbit they provide spatially continuous information about precipitation distribution all over the world their main disadvantage is a less deterministic relationship between visible infrared microwave radiances and derived rain rates compared to for instance radar reflectivity and precipitation intensity bližňák and sokol 2012 atmospheric reanalyses based on modern numerical weather prediction nwp models reconstruct the meteorological conditions of the past integrating the available historical observations from various observation systems through data assimilation they provide physically consistent datasets of a wide range of variables including surface precipitation hersbach et al 2020 kaiser weiss et al 2019 their accuracy and resolution have increased in recent years thanks to improvements in physical based nwp models and the assimilation of remote sensing measurements nogueira 2020 soci et al 2016 the spatial resolution in the case of precipitation reanalyses is easily competitive with the resolution of satellite based precipitation estimates e g amjad et al 2020 their major advantage is that they provide a relatively long term continuous dataset of atmospheric parameters covering both near surface conditions and vertical profiles in contrast to the uncertainty coming from the nwp model orography incorrectness mainly in complex topography particularly in the case of global reanalysis data assimilation and parameterization of small scale processes may be large enough that it is necessary to evaluate precipitation accuracy as the first step before their utilization e g crossett et al 2020 hu and franzke 2020 tarek et al 2020 recently considerable efforts have been made to evaluate precipitation reanalyses at global and or regional scales precipitation fields derived from global atmospheric reanalyses produced by the european centre for medium range weather and forecasting ecmwf have been recently verified by many studies focused on their employment in further hydrological modelling for instance tarek et al 2020 demonstrated that equivalent hydrological outputs can be obtained after replacement of the in situ station network by era 5 precipitation reanalysis in sparsely observed regions in north america mcclean et al 2021 investigated the ability of four reanalyses era 5 cfsr merra 2 and jra 55 to simulate historic flood events in northern england era 5 reanalysis showed a large improvement in bias of precipitation accuracy compared to its predecessor era interim when analysing daily and or monthly precipitation totals likely due to its improved parameterization and higher resolution amjad et al 2020 nogueira 2020 recently available global reanalyses covering at least part of the 21st century are listed in table 1 from that we selected era 5 and era 5 land the products of the latest fifth generation of ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 for our research the era 5 is the latest comprehensive ecmwf reanalysis replacing era interim hersbach et al 2020 it assimilates in situ observations satellite data snow data and since 2009 also radar data over the north america territory the era 5 land muñoz sabater et al 2021 is a 2d product of the era 5 specifically optimized for the land surface with no assimilated observations precipitation in both products are available hourly further details are given in table 1 global reanalyses usually serve as boundary conditions to generate regional reanalyses providing added value for further climatological applications mainly because of their higher spatial and temporal resolution acharya et al 2019 kaiser weiss et al 2019 an evaluation and uncertainty assessment of several regional reanalyses have been recently carried out within the european seventh framework programme eu fp7 project uncertainties in ensembles of regional reanalyses uerra https uerra eu a comparison of precipitation fields revealed that various regional reanalyses exceled in different regions of europe for instance the additional value of the high resolution regional mescan surfex reanalysis soci et al 2016 was found in regions with dense station networks compared to regions with sparse station densities the mescan surfex data set is a 2d surface analysis combining downscaled harmonie reanalysis fields and additional surface observations bazile et al 2017 this regional reanalysis is driven by era interim thus ending in 2019 its horizontal resolution is 5 5 km covers the whole european domain and provides daily precipitation sums from 0600 to 0600 utc an overview of regional reanalysis products covering europe was recently published by kaiser weiss et al 2019 the main goal of this study is to evaluate and compare the accuracy of the precipitation products of newly released reanalyses era 5 era 5 land and mescan surfex with respect to radar derived precipitation estimates adjusted by daily rain gauge measurements in the territory of the czech republic cr considering that the last two reanalyses are available at high spatial resolution a combination of radar and rain gauge measurements seems to be a suitable verification tool for this purpose the results of the present study could provide a reliable evaluation of reanalyzed precipitation accuracy in climatic conditions over central europe and provide possible feedback to their developers in addition the obtained results will help the hydrological community decide which of the evaluated reanalyses can be used for further applications in hydrological modelling in the cr from this point of view the paper brings novelty to the current state of the art as it presents the first verification of the regional reanalysis mescan surfex in a complex topography and the first comparison of precipitation reanalyses era 5 and era 5 land using high resolution precipitation observations the paper is structured as follows a description of the observational and reanalysed data is given in section 2 section 3 describes the verification scores applied to meteorological and climatological validation the results are presented in section 4 a comparison and explanation of the results are presented in section 5 and finally section 6 contains a summary and conclusions of the presented study 2 data and study area the study evaluates precipitation from three modern reanalyses era 5 era 5 land and uerra mescan surfex with observational records using a combination of radar and rain gauge data during the warm seasons april october in 2002 2018 the warm season was chosen because of the highest frequency of precipitation occurrence in contrast to the winter months when the precipitation amount is lower especially in a liquid phase furthermore radar based measurement of solid precipitation i e snowfall during the cold season may be inaccurate for use as a ground truth e g saltikoff et al 2015 the study area covers the whole cr and is displayed in fig 1 the cr is a hilly landlocked country located in central europe with a total area of 78 871 km2 mountain areas are mostly situated along the state border with a maximum altitude of 1602 m in giant mts in the north of the country the cr has a temperate climate situated in the transition zone between the oceanic and continental climate types with warm summers and cold cloudy and snowy winters however specific climate conditions depends on the elevation 2 1 observational data radar derived precipitation estimates adjusted by daily rain gauge measurements were used as observed data in this study although adjusted radar derived precipitation may exhibit some specific shortcomings e g rlan interference the radar s circular range etc it can still be considered the most accurate observational product of precipitation providing high temporal and spatial resolution bližňák et al 2018 radar reflectivity was measured by two czech c band doppler weather radars brdy and skalky every 10 up to may 2009 and 5 since june 2009 onwards minutes in 1 by 1 km square boxes at several elevation levels we used a cappi product constant altitude plan position indicator at 2 km above sea level obtained from the interpolation of adjacent radar beams the location of both weather radars at elevations exceeding 700 m above sea level is chosen well so that their radar reflectivity measurements are not significantly blocked by mountainous areas and their spatial coverage includes the entire cr and its nearest neighbourhood see fig 1 in areas of the cr where both radars overlapped a higher radar reflectivity value was considered technical details and parameters of the czech weather radar network can be found for instance in novák 2007 and or bližňák et al 2018 in general the quality of the czech radar data is high and comparable to data from other european radar networks michelson et al 2005 rain gauge measurements recorded the sum of daily precipitation between 0600 and 0600 utc of the next day their location is evenly distributed over all of the cr without significant ungauged areas fig 1 their number varied during the considered period and usually ranged between 700 and 800 gauges all daily rain gauge records were carefully checked by the czech hydrometeorological institute chmi before being included in the database 2 2 reanalysed data this paper evaluates the precipitation products of three modern reanalyses two global reanalyses era 5 and era 5 land and one regional reanalysis uerra mescan surfex while era 5 and mescan surfex combine a coupled model forecast system with the assimilation of observed data era 5 land is produced under a single simulation and does not directly assimilate the observations the era 5 land was included in the comparison to show the possible improvement due to fine resolution combined with the worsening due to no assimilation of observations era 5 is based on integrated forecast system cycle 42r2 ifs version 2016 which is coupled to a land surface model htessel and an ocean wave model wam the 4d var data assimilation uses 12 hour windows from 0900 utc to 2100 utc and 2100 utc to 0900 utc the following day where the background forecast and all observations falling within a time window are used to specify all analyses during that window the correctness of individual parameter fields in the reanalysis is spatially very variable and depends on the number of in situ measurements and other data as era 5 does not assimilate precipitation over europe neither in situ nor radar correctness should be comparable for large areas and depend particularly on the complexity of terrain rather than observation density precipitation belongs to a prognostic parameter and is computed during the short term forecasts initialised twice a day from analyses at 0600 and 1800 utc total precipitation is available each hour and is expressed as accumulations over the last 60 min it comprises rain and snow that falls to the earth s surface but it does not include dew fog or precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before reaching the surface thus total precipitation corresponds to the same parameter as the in situ measurement it has two basic components large scale precipitation generated by the cloud scheme which takes into account changes in atmospheric quantities such as pressure temperature and moisture and convective precipitation generated by the convection scheme in the ifs which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box era 5 land is a rerun of the land component of the era 5 as a single simulation without coupling to the atmospheric module or to the ocean wave model of the ifs the core of era 5 land is the tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land incorporating land surface hydrology h tessel observations are not assimilated however they indirectly affect the simulation through the atmospheric forcing of era 5 this fact leads to shortcomings that may equalize or even outweigh the benefits from model improvements and fine resolution uerra mescan surfex combines downscaled uerra harmonie regional reanalysis fields and additional observations the synop ship buoy radiosonde pilot and aircraft data are assimilated directly 4 times a day at 0000 utc 0600 utc 1200 utc and 1800 utcthe system is based on two separate tools i mescan a version of the operational surface analysis canari used at météo france that provides 2 m temperature relative humidity and 24 h total accumulated precipitation and ii surfex a land and ocean surface platform describing the surface processes and computing surface fluxes soil heat and water transfer etc surfex is driven by temperature humidity precipitation wind and radiative fluxes the precipitation observations used in the mescan surfex assimilation are the 24 h accumulated precipitation from 0600 utc to 0600 day 1 from several databases such as eca d ecmwf and national databases the number of assimilated precipitation observations has exceeded 4000 since 2010 the total precipitation is the prognostic parameter computed from 4 successive 6 hour forecasts and expresses the amount of water falling onto the ground during convective and large scale precipitation 3 methods 3 1 adjustment of radar derived precipitation estimates 3 1 1 calculation of radar derived precipitation estimates the basic radar product was 10 min radar derived rain rates calculated in the following way the interpolated radar reflectivity at 2 km above sea level pseudocappi 2 km was first transformed into rain rates using a standard z r relationship marshall and palmer 1948 measurements in a 5 min temporal step were integrated into 10 min by averaging three consecutive 5 min measurements with a double weight assigned to the term in the middle of the 10 min interval if one of the three 5 min measurements was missing the average was not calculated and the 10 min interval was assigned a missing value the prepared 10 min radar derived precipitation estimates were then accumulated from 0600 utc to 0600 utc of the following day to create daily radar derived precipitation estimates that temporally matched the daily rain gauge measurements if more than 18 integrations were missing out of 144 then the resulting daily radar derived precipitation estimate was assigned a missing value if the number of missing radar integrations was between 1 and 17 missing values were replaced by estimates based on linear interpolation between the adjacent preceding and subsequent 10 min radar integrations missing data were usually caused by the malfunction of one or both weather radars or by regular testing and checking of radar devices more specifically 92 9 and 90 6 of the total number of days were covered by data in the range of the brdy and skalky radars respectively 3 1 2 adjustment method the adjustment of both radar and rain gauge data consisted of two steps first the radar derived rain field was spatially adjusted to measurements from the rain gauges in general for each day the ratio between the mean 1 day precipitation total calculated from all rain gauges and the mean 1 day precipitation total estimated from the corresponding radar pixels was determined and used for a multiplication of radar derived precipitation in every pixel of the radar domain second the spatially adjusted radar derived rain rates were locally adjusted in individual pixels based on the distance from the closest rain gauge whereas the weight of the observed precipitation decreased with increasing distance to the given pixel because a detailed description of an adjustment procedure is beyond the scope of this study we refer readers to our previous papers focused primarily on the preparation of adjusted radar derived precipitation and its climatological application where more details are provided e g bližňák et al 2018 sokol and bližňák 2009 3 2 verification methods the research combined meteorological and climatological approaches the methods widely used for forecast verification such as categorical skill scores and methods common in the climatological community based on seasonal and monthly characteristics and indices were employed while the meteorological approach shows the reanalysis ability to simulate the precipitation correctly in a specific place the climatological characteristics indicate the agreement of precipitation distribution during the 17 year period and within individual months in the following subsections we provide a brief explanation of the applied verification scores and indices their description and mathematical notation can then be found in appendix a at the end of this paper adjusted radar derived precipitation estimates were upscaled from 1 km grid boxes to the resolution of a given reanalysis this approach provides a direct and more consistent inter comparison without bringing more errors and uncertainties to the reanalysed products and well describes the original character of precipitation products e g wong et al 2017 watters et al 2021 in the following text we use the terms estimation and observation for reanalysed and adjusted radar derived precipitation respectively 3 2 1 meteorological validation to verify the daily reanalyzed precipitation in a corresponding grid box we used two groups of evaluation metrics i statistical indicators including the mean error me root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficient pcc and ii categorical skill scores derived from the contingency table between estimation and observations see table a1 in appendix a the contingency table which compares estimated and observed events is a useful way to see what types of errors are being made in section 4 1 1 which evaluates daily precipitation totals we define the event as the occurrence of a daily precipitation total greater than or equal to a given threshold value of 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 20 mm the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi and frequency bias bias were calculated from the contingency table statistics 3 2 2 climatological validation the comparison of reanalysis from the climatological view comprises correlation pcc and anomaly analysis of monthly and seasonal sums and comparison of climatological indices that are inspired by the european climate assessment dataset eca d project https www ecad eu indicesextremes indicesdictionary php 5 we used the number of wet days rr1 number of heavy precipitation days r10mm number of very heavy precipitation days r20mm and precipitation fraction due to very wet days r95ptot in addition we expanded the number of indices showing the number of days above a given threshold by two more values 5 mm r5mm and 15 mm r15mm the pcc of seasonal and monthly precipitation sums the mean anomalies of seasonal and monthly sums from 17 year averages and all indices were computed for all grids and are displayed on maps and via box and whisker plots in the case of indices monthly maps are a part of the supplementary material the differences between reanalysis and adjusted radar precipitation are displayed as the number of days per study period or as the number of days per season and in of precipitation sum in case of r95ptot to provide an idea about the magnitude of detected seasonal index differences we also calculated the 25th and 75th percentiles of indices in observed data recalculated to the horizontal resolution of a given reanalysis and this range is denoted as a common value in the following text it is worth mentioning that the values of the calculated percentiles may differ in the observations due to the different horizontal resolutions of each of the evaluated reanalyses a brief explanation of the climate indices used is given in appendix a 4 results 4 1 verification of daily precipitation estimates 4 1 1 verification using statistical and categorical skill scores fig 2 gives a basic idea of the relationship between the estimated and observed daily precipitation totals the top row in fig 2 shows scatterplots where each dot represents the precipitation total from a given day and given grid box naturally values of daily precipitation totals are higher with increasing horizontal resolution of reanalyses in addition both the observed and estimated daily precipitation totals in era 5 do not exceed 130 mm and the maximal observed daily precipitation in a horizontal resolution of mescan surfex reanalysis i e 5 5 km reaches almost 230 mm in addition such extreme precipitation events are usually underestimated in all three reanalyses for instance the highest observed daily precipitation total in the mescan surfex reanalysis 226 7 mm is underestimated by approximately 47 the correlation of all precipitation totals between all considered grid boxes is 0 81 0 78 and 0 85 for era 5 era 5 land and mescan surfex respectively the underestimation of very high precipitation events in the reanalyses is also evident from the bottom row in fig 2 which shows histograms of the frequency of differences between the estimate and observations for each day and grid box more bins are situated on the left side with negative values of the histograms reaching or even exceeding approximately 100 mm in mescan surfex and era 5 land precipitation totals derived from era 5 seem to be more balanced with lower values of differences within a range of 70 and 70 mm the spatial distribution of me and rmse computed as an average daily value between all estimated and observed daily precipitation totals in individual months and the whole warm season of the year i e april october is given in figs 3 and 4 while era 5 and era 5 land overestimate daily precipitation over almost all territories in the warm season and most of the czech territory in individual months precipitation derived from mescan surfex shows both underestimation and overestimation randomly distributed fig 3 mes are even higher from may to august and very low in april september and october the most problematic regions occur in northern and southern mountain regions and in the case of mescan surfex along the eastern border the largest underestimation is evident in june in south bohemia in all reanalyses it should be stressed that despite low precipitation in april the overestimation of era 5 and era 5 land can reach 60 in a given grid box however it usually does not exceed 35 in the warm season not shown here the distribution of rmse fig 4 confirms the problematic grid boxes and the distribution of errors within the season in addition the era 5 and era 5 land reanalyses reveal higher rmses 5 8 mm in may july and august in the beskydy mountains along the eastern border and several problematic localities in the centre of the study area the effect of altitude is less visible in mescan surfex giving the highest rmse values in northern moravia and southern bohemia to assess the accuracy of precipitation estimates with the considered threshold value we calculated four categorical skill scores derived from the contingency table table a1 in appendix a and plotted them in fig 5 the figure is able to display all scores in a single graph so that the most accurate estimates are plotted in the upper right corner and near the diagonal while the least accurate estimates are plotted in the lower left quadrant or distant from the diagonal the symbols distinguish the evaluated reanalysis and the colours represent the considered threshold of precipitation totals fig 5 shows that mescan surfex is the most accurate of all three evaluated reanalyses and better corresponds to observed precipitation totals the statement is valid for all considered thresholds and scores except for pod with a 1 mm threshold with an increasing threshold the values of the categorical skill scores deteriorate faster in era 5 and era 5 land than in mescan surfex which generates a satisfactory level of accuracy even for the highest considered 20 mm threshold with pod reaching 0 59 far reaching 0 36 csi reaching 0 45 and bias reaching 0 92 from fig 5 it is clear that era 5 and era 5 land have more difficulty accurately capturing moderate above 10 mm and especially high above 20 mm daily precipitation events in addition a bias exceeding a value of 1 for daily totals with a threshold value up to 10 mm indicates an overestimation in all three reanalyses in contrast to precipitation totals equal to or higher than 20 mm that are underestimated 4 1 2 verification using climate indices the indices based on the number of days with precipitation above a specific threshold confirm the abovementioned statements the seasonal precipitation overestimation is particularly due to the higher number of wet days r 1 mm and days with precipitation equal to or exceeding 5 mm in all reanalyses fig 6 the differences between reanalysis and observations are partly related to altitude and their magnitude is distinctly lower in mescan surfex in comparison with era 5 and era 5 land the largest overestimation of the number of wet days is detected in era 5 land fig 7 an overestimation occurs particularly in the mountainous regions along the borders fig 6 the first row central column in this case the overestimation reaches 40 days per warm season whereas the common value ranges between 64 and 71 days the overestimation of the number of wet days is largest in april and may in era 5 and era 5 land but is largest in june and july in mescan surfex fig 7 fig s1 the differences among individual months are not as pronounced for r5mm fig s2 the clear overestimation is obvious in the šumava mountains in era 5 and era 5 land while the underestimation is common for all months in the region of south bohemia for mescan surfex the same problematic areas are displayed for the case of rr1 the errors change their polarity and distribution for the number of days with precipitation equal to or higher than 10 15 and 20 mm indices r10mm r15mm and r20mm when overall seasonal underestimation prevails for all reanalyses fig 6 fig 7 the higher threshold of daily precipitation sums above 10 mm per day is associated with higher relative underestimation of the number of days compared to common values in the case of r20mm the overall underestimation is typical for era 5 and era 5 land with only a few exceptions in contrast mescan surfex shows overestimation on the seasonal scale as well the highest is in northern hrubý jeseník mountains and eastern beskydy mountains moravia the monthly differences are on average the lowest i e the median of the differences close to zero for r10mm in all months and r15mm and r20mm in april september and october fig 7 the magnitude of monthly differences in comparison to observed indices is displayed in fig s7 the spatial distribution of errors highlights the most problematic areas again the šumava mountains and north bohemia particularly for era 5 land fig s3 fig s4 fig s5 although mescan surfex seems to assess the indices the best on average there are regions with larger differences in comparison with era 5 and era 5 land among others the overestimation in northern and eastern moravia in several months and the underestimation of r15mm in western moravia in july can be mentioned right column on fig s4 the general underestimation of extreme precipitation in all evaluated reanalyses is confirmed by the last used index r95ptot in era 5 and era 5 land the seasonal fraction of extreme precipitation is up to 4 5 lower compared to observations with common values between 21 and 23 fig 6 bottom row the large differences are less related to altitude as they occur in western and eastern areas as well however the spatial distribution of monthly differences in r95ptot is not uniform and large areas of overestimation prevail in era 5 and era 5 land in july and august fig s6 the differences in the seasonal and monthly r95ptot index between mescan surfex and the observations are generally lower in comparison with both global reanalyses fig 7 and the distribution of the largest errors in individual months is similar in all reanalyses fig s6 4 2 verification of monthly precipitation sums the correlations between reanalysis and observed precipitation seasonal sums are generally high fig 8 top row and table 2 and spatially consistent in all reanalyses the figure shows that regional differences in correlation increase with increasing horizontal resolution of the reanalysis while the low variability of seasonal pccs in era 5 between 0 82 and 0 93 in individual grid boxes is detected the other two reanalyses point to greater heterogeneity and variability values below 0 75 and above 0 9 are detected for era 5 land and values from 0 35 to 0 99 are detected for mescan surfex the spatial mean of correlations is similar in individual months with a maximum in october and a minimum in june in all reanalyses table 2 the maps of monthly pcc also display high values in august and september but also indicate some problems with may precipitation fig s8 the most problematic region with the generally lowest correlation in several months is the entire southern area of bohemia around české budějovice town the relative anomalies of precipitation sums display a distinct difference between reanalyses at a monthly scale although the seasonal anomalies show only slight overestimation of precipitation in era 5 and era 5 land and quite good agreement between mescan surfex and the observations fig 8 bottom row the magnitude of monthly relative errors is considerably variable with the largest mean spatial overestimation above 30 for era 5 and era 5 land and near 6 for mescan surfex in april table 3 september and october also report large overestimations particularly in the central parts of the study area in other months the errors concentrate in higher elevated regions along borders and in českomoravská vrchovina fig s9 the spatial distribution of anomalies is very similar in era 5 and era 5 land which documents the fact that era 5 land adopts precipitation from era 5 mescan surfex generally overestimates precipitation although underestimation is detected in the entire southern northwestern and northeastern parts of bohemia fig 9 displays the monthly anomalies in individual months and grids the grid monthly difference between the estimation and observations ranges from 235 167 mm day in all reanalyses the median of the differences in each month of the warm season is above zero an interval between maxima and minima increases with the higher spatial resolution of a given reanalysis the highest is in july for era 5 land and in august for mescan surfex the first and third quartile spread of anomalies in individual grid boxes indicated by the height of the boxplot bodies is generally lowest for mescan surfex table 4 and table 5 display the lists of the ten largest negative and positive differences respectively between the estimated and observed monthly precipitation totals for all evaluated reanalyses the events differ only in the order of magnitude difference between era 5 and era 5 land year month and location are the same while mesacan surfex has the largest errors in completely different years months and grid boxes selected events are discussed in section 5 5 discussion the spatial distribution and annual cycle of daily precipitation indices uncovered some weaknesses in the reanalyses especially reanalyses without assimilation of the observed precipitation the explanation for the several discrepancies between reanalysis and observations as well as a comparison of our results with recently published findings forms the content of this section our results including a general overestimation of daily precipitation totals and wet day frequency and an underestimation of the frequency of heavy precipitation in all studied reanalyses especially in global reanalyses era 5 and era 5 land are consistent with the results published by isotta et al 2015 the underestimation of high daily precipitation totals in global reanalyses era interim 80 km horizontal resolution across england and wales was also documented by de leeuw et al 2015 in this case however the authors conclude that the reanalysed precipitation is highly correlated with the observation and the underestimation is less pronounced the underestimation of high precipitation in global reanalyses arises from the nwp models that are the base of the reanalyses lavers and villarini 2013 shrestha et al 2013 sometimes even in situ measurement underestimate local high precipitation our results thus enhance the importance of the radar products assimilation to improve the modern reanalyses fig 3 and fig 4 show that the global reanalyses era 5 and era 5 land reveal larger errors in the elevated areas compared to mescan surfex a possible explanation could be the fact that the model topography in the global reanalyses has a coarser resolution which leads to a greater underestimation of precipitation compared to regional reanalyses with finer model topography this assumption is consistent with the results published by crossett et al 2020 who found that the accuracy of precipitation reanalysis deteriorates with increasing altitude difference between model and real altitude precipitation seasonal and monthly totals are overestimated in all study reanalyses as was documented for europe bandhauer et al 2021 the usa crossett et al 2020 turkey amjad et al 2020 and mainland china jiang et al 2021 the differences are similar in all months similar to bandhauer et al 2021 which leads to the largest relative overestimation in april in all reanalyses and the lowest in june and october in era 5 era 5 land and mescan surfex with no clear relation to the monthly totals in contrast to amjad et al 2020 the positive bias is caused by the enhanced number of wet days with low precipitation between 1 mm and approximately 10 mm for comparison the mean seasonal wet day frequency generally ranges between 0 34 and 0 51 in era 5 and from 0 25 to 0 43 in the observations which is similar to bandhauer et al 2021 the number of days with high and extremely high precipitation is considerably underestimated in era 5 and era 5 land particularly in higher elevated locations grid boxes similar to the era 5 behaviour over turkey amjad et al 2020 and across the northeastern united states crossett et al 2020 this is because high convective precipitation which prevails in warm months is not well captured in the reanalyses especially in those with a coarser horizontal resolution and convective parameterization switched on de leeuw et al 2015 in those cases the highest precipitation totals are usually smoothed and or may be displaced compared to the observations however bandhauer et al 2021 found excessively intense precipitation over europe in era 5 compared to gridded station data the disagreement may arise from the different reference data adjusted radar can better capture local convective events in comparison with gridded datasets based solely on station measurements parkes et al 2013 a combination of overestimation of low precipitation and underestimation of high precipitation leads to low seasonal and monthly anomalies of precipitation sums and creates a false impression of reanalysis capability to simulate precipitation well the categorical skill scores point to a better ability of the regional reanalysis to spatially simulate precipitation events even for the highest considered 20 mm threshold which could be attributed to its finer resolution acharya et al 2019 isotta et al 2015 soci et al 2016 the difficulties of era 5 and era 5 land with accurate simulation of moderate above 10 mm and especially high above 20 mm daily precipitation totals have been confirmed in different parts of the world e g hu and franzke 2020 jiang et al 2021 nogueira 2020 the precipitation patterns monthly and daily totals bias and rmse and spatial structure of all applied indices in era 5 land have a very similar appearance to those in era 5 which is logical because both reanalyses are based on the same nwp model and era 5 land is a rerun of era 5 in a simple 2d scheme the errors are larger and even more expressive in era 5 land which proves that the increase in spatial resolution alone does not lead to improved precipitation estimates the concurrent assimilation of observation data is also important and its absence leads to a worsening of the reanalysis ability to capture the observed temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation including extremes on the other hand the spatial structure of climate indices calculated from the mescan surfex reanalysis is clearly different from the previous two the largest errors are again generally related to higher altitudes however both types of errors under and overestimations of individual indices and characteristics with the exception of pcc occur their magnitude can be even larger than in both global reanalyses nevertheless grid boxes with large errors cover only small areas prevailing low errors over most areas indicate that mescan surfex corresponds better to the observations than era 5 and era 5 land the largest differences in individual monthly totals listed in table 4 and table 5 originate in all reanalyses particularly from the erroneous simulation of individual extreme precipitation events negative bias or problems related to interference of radar signals positive bias for example the largest difference uncovered in era 5 land was in july 2011 when the monthly precipitation total was underestimated by 50 206 mm in one grid box this was caused by a missed extreme precipitation event in the reanalysis that occurred between july 20 and july 21 and caused extensive floods in northern bohemia it should be mentioned that this event was also underestimated by the other two reanalyses although it did not occur first similarly the most severe precipitation underestimation in mescan surfex was observed in the giant mountains northern bohemia in august 2002 when all of central europe was hit by long lasting and heavy precipitation that together with antecedent catchment saturation caused immense floods in a great part of bohemia řezáčová et al 2005 ulbrich et al 2003 on the other hand the highest overestimation detected in september 2007 was caused by a precipitation event that occurred on 6 september in this particular case however the error was not on the reanalysis side but on the measurement side the radio local access network rlan interference blocked the radar beams in several pixels in the eastern part of moravia and caused a significant underestimation of the derived precipitation totals this well known artefact can be easily removed in situations without rain but in cases of heavy precipitation it is not clear which values should be assigned to those pixels this problem appears in the adjusted radar derived precipitation totals before 2015 when a large upgrade of both weather radars occurred new polarimetric radars can effectively eliminate rlan interference without any postprocessing of radar derived products bližňák et al 2018 the magnitude of positive and negative biases increases with the spatial resolution the locations of errors are almost the same in both global reanalyses but differ from the largest biases in mescan surfex in position and timing the differences between reanalysis and observations at individual grid boxes may be large for era 5 land and mescan surfex but low for era 5 as in october 2013 or may have an opposite sign small negative sign in era 5 era 5 land and large positive sign in mescan surfex as in august 2010 such an even distribution of extreme errors among the months and the cause of selected examples indicate no systematic but rather random bias as the main reason for the extreme monthly anomalies the pcc is reasonably high reaching values above 0 75 in all months in most of the study area however the pcc does not indicate the real ability of reanalysis to capture the precipitation distribution as implied by the above stated findings on the other hand the pcc can uncover areas with problematic precipitation simulations such unexpectedly low correlations as well as a strongly underestimated number of days with precipitation above 10 mm were uncovered in all southern bohemia in the mescan surfex reanalysis the time series of estimated and observed monthly precipitation totals from the grid box with the lowest pcc value fig 10 shows underestimation between 2009 and 2012 however if one compares the time series without the 2009 2012 period the value of the correlation increases to 0 91 the reason for the large dry error pertaining to 4 years may arise from the driving global era interim reanalysis specific setup of the nwp model or the missing observations entering assimilation although we cannot fully explain the cause of this deficiency we can conclude that the largest underestimation in 2009 2012 occurs in the summer months with a higher proportion of heavy convective precipitation similar precipitation behaviour was documented in sweden between 1994 and 2000 shimanke et al 2019 the recommendation according to the user guide is to exclude such periods from the analysis however in our case the error is restricted to a short time period and limited area and does not distinctly affect the general results thus precipitation series entered into the computation were kept unchanged our results confirm the findings of soci et al 2016 that the assimilation of all available observations is essential for the good performance of precipitation products in reanalysis the assimilation reduces errors of the nwp model used in reanalysis simulations and substantially improves the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation particularly in warm months over the complex terrain when convective precipitation prevails the free provision of observed data is thus in the interest of each state to achieve the best possible accuracy of reanalyses for its territory 6 summary and conclusion the aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the performance of three precipitation reanalyses era 5 era 5 land and mescan surfex at daily monthly and seasonal scales over the czech republic in the warm seasons i e april october in 2002 2018 several statistical indicators and categorical skill scores were employed to assess the accuracy of the precipitation datasets using radar derived precipitation estimates adjusted by daily totals measured by the rain gauge network in addition several climate indices were used to determine the ability of the reanalyses to simulate the number of days with a defined precipitation threshold verification of daily precipitation totals generally showed good agreement with the observations in all reanalyses documented by high values of the pearson correlation coefficient 0 78 0 85 and low values of the mean error and root mean square error ranging between 1 and 1 mm and between 2 and 5 mm respectively era 5 and era 5 land tended to overestimate low precipitation and to underestimate high precipitation with the largest deviations in mountainous areas along the czech border on the other hand the spatial distribution of precipitation totals simulated by mescan surfex was both overestimated and underestimated with less influence of altitude all three reanalyses were less accurate in absolute values in the summer months i e june july and august when convective precipitation prevailed in contrast to the beginning april and end september and october of the warm season when the amount of precipitation was usually lower the interannual variability was generally well captured in all reanalyses and the mean correlations of seasonal and monthly precipitation sums frequently reached 0 8 but decreased to 0 5 in may and june the lowest correlations were detected in all southern bohemia particularly for mescan surfex which completely underestimated precipitation in the whole period from 2009 to 2012 in this area the possible cause for this may be an inaccuracy in the driving global era interim reanalysis specific setup of the nwp model or the missing observations entering assimilation the correlation maps did not display any problems in mountainous or lowland areas as did the number of days with precipitation above a specific threshold this study adds a valuable contribution to the current state of the art not only by verifying reanalyses in specific regions with complex terrain affected by different circulation patterns but also by using radar derived precipitation as a ground truth due to the high horizontal resolution this can be helpful in capturing local convective precipitation which may be significantly underestimated or completely missing in rain gauge only data on the other hand errors in radar data caused by various reasons see section 1 may in some specific situations result in incorrect reanalysis evaluation and may thus deteriorate verification scores however it should be emphasized that such situations are not very common and occur mainly when using older radar data measured by nonpolarimetric weather radars our research revealed a weakness in individual reanalyses that should be considered in their further utilization and application additionally we showed the advantages of the high spatial resolution of adjusted radar derived precipitation estimates in reanalysis verification the available temporal resolution of the radar data encourages applying such data to evaluate reanalysis performance in a subdaily step specific reanalyses have been recently created to simulate convective precipitation and have thus correctly characterised the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation e g acharya et al 2020 wahl et al 2017 its evaluation with respect to hydrological applications may be a possible step in our future work credit authorship contribution

7886,study region central europe study focus precipitation fields from reanalyses have been widely used for hydrological applications meteorological extreme analyses or climatological research modern reanalyses provide all characteristics in regular grids with high resolutions and thus can substitute for gridded in situ radar and satellite observations here we assess the ability of three modern reanalyses with different spatial resolutions and different rates of assimilation to reproduce precipitation in central europe two global era 5 and era 5 land and one regional mescan surfex reanalysis products are evaluated against adjusted radar derived precipitation totals in the warm parts of the 17 year period new hydrological insights for the region a comparison of daily precipitation totals generally shows good agreement with the observations in all reanalyses however the detailed analysis of climatological indices shows a general overestimation of precipitation sums and the number of wet days in all tested months but an underestimation of high precipitation on monthly or seasonal sums and a lower occurrence of days with sums above 10 mm mescan surfex seems to be the most accurate of all three reanalyses with the exception of the years between 2009 and 2012 with very low precipitation in southern bohemia the largest differences between radar and reanalysis precipitation characteristics are detected in the summer months when convective precipitation prevails the obtained results can be used for further applications in hydrological modelling graphical abstract ga1 keywords atmospheric reanalysis weather radar accuracy evaluation precipitation czech republic 1 introduction reanalyses are a strong tool for atmospheric research they provide information about the past state of the atmosphere at different levels and thus have been widely used to study free atmosphere dynamics e g diallo et al 2021 gruzdev 2017 huth et al 2009 huth and beranová 2021 wallace and gutzler 1981 and the links between the free atmosphere and surface climate deser et al 2016 pokorná and huth 2015 vejmelka et al 2015 wallace et al 2012 recently the large development of climate modelling and computer machine improvement has enabled model resolution to increase and the computation of the smaller scale processes instead of their parameterization and thus the more precise simulation of surface parameters the surface or near surface fields of meteorological elements simulated by reanalysis are now frequently used for a wide range of purposes including research on extreme and compound events hu and franzke 2020 rulfová et al 2021 trend analysis nogueira 2020 simmons et al 2004 characterization of precipitation patterns acharya et al 2019 amjad et al 2020 bandhauer et al 2021 and their causation aleshina et al 2021 řehoř et al 2021 due to fine and in the case of regional reanalysis very fine spatial and temporal resolution reanalysis serves as a reference set for climate model validation johns et al 2006 martin et al 2006 and as an input field for hydrological modelling for example to model river runoff and water storage tarek et al 2020 or to assess the risk of floods and droughts koster et al 2019 mcclean et al 2021 paprotny et al 2020 however correctly simulated surface fields are essential for all of the abovementioned purposes thus a comparison of the simulated characteristics with observations should be the first step before the utilization of the reanalysis output fields this paper focuses on precipitation which is key information for further meteorological climatological hydrological and environmental applications although accurate observations are highly desirable for several reasons the spatial density and temporal coverage of available measurements are still not sufficient in addition to providing information about actual spatiotemporal distributions precipitation data serve as input data into various numerical models predicting natural hazards such as flooding events liu et al 2015 paprotny et al 2020 or landslides canli et al 2018 rain gauges represent the basic principle of precipitation measurement and due to their long and widespread use they are considered a ground truth when compared to other data sources bližňák et al 2021 2021 however their biggest disadvantage is that they are not uniformly distributed in space and large uninhabited areas remain uncovered this fact may become very problematic for hydrological simulations requiring dense and or regular precipitation input data gampe and ludwig 2017 this need can be achieved by applying different techniques to surface observed data from rain gauges or using modern regular grid datasets thus gridded interpolated gauge based observations acharya et al 2020 henn et al 2018 hu and franzke 2020 as well as radar based precipitation products sokol et al 2021 versini 2012 satellite based precipitation products amjad et al 2020 guo and liu 2016 jiang et al 2021 and reanalysis precipitation fields aleshina et al 2021 nogueira 2020 are used by different authors their spatial resolution ranges from coarse in global reanalysis 30 100 km to very fine in regional reanalysis satellite based and radar based precipitation or gridded datasets lower than 10 km each of the regular network precipitation products has advantages and disadvantages interpolated gauge based observations stem from direct in situ precipitation measurements which is a clear advantage compared to other data sources however its accuracy strongly depends on the density of the ground network hohmann et al 2021 merino et al 2021 as well as on the applied interpolation technique wagner et al 2012 therefore despite accurate precipitation information at near rain gauge locations the largest biases can be observed in mountainous areas with sparse rain gauge networks where interpolation techniques that do not consider elevation precipitation relationship fail due to the high elevation gradient daly et al 2017 radar measurements have added value particularly when monitoring convective precipitation which is very variable in space and time therefore it is difficult to capture them with conventional rain gauge networks the reason for this is that weather radars perform measurements at high temporal and spatial resolutions which can capture well convective phenomena including local precipitation on the other hand radar measurements are affected by a number of errors which can be divided into two categories the first is given by incorrect measurements of radar reflectivity due to various reasons such as incorrect calibration of radar hardware attenuation of radar reflectivity ground clutter anomalous propagation of radar beams and blocking by the terrain e g mcroberts and nielsen gammon 2017 seo et al 2015 the second group includes errors resulting from the inaccurate transformation of the measured radar reflectivity into rain rates caused for instance by variability in the vertical profile of reflectivity typically the so called bright band representing the occurrence of increased reflectivity in the melting zone in the region close to the zero isotherm berne and krajewski 2013 hall et al 2015 for these reasons it is desirable to adjust radar measurements by using rain gauge observations e g sokol and bližňák 2009 bližňák et al 2018 in contrast satellite based precipitation products are not influenced by mountains and other obstacles and in the case of satellites in geostationary orbit they provide spatially continuous information about precipitation distribution all over the world their main disadvantage is a less deterministic relationship between visible infrared microwave radiances and derived rain rates compared to for instance radar reflectivity and precipitation intensity bližňák and sokol 2012 atmospheric reanalyses based on modern numerical weather prediction nwp models reconstruct the meteorological conditions of the past integrating the available historical observations from various observation systems through data assimilation they provide physically consistent datasets of a wide range of variables including surface precipitation hersbach et al 2020 kaiser weiss et al 2019 their accuracy and resolution have increased in recent years thanks to improvements in physical based nwp models and the assimilation of remote sensing measurements nogueira 2020 soci et al 2016 the spatial resolution in the case of precipitation reanalyses is easily competitive with the resolution of satellite based precipitation estimates e g amjad et al 2020 their major advantage is that they provide a relatively long term continuous dataset of atmospheric parameters covering both near surface conditions and vertical profiles in contrast to the uncertainty coming from the nwp model orography incorrectness mainly in complex topography particularly in the case of global reanalysis data assimilation and parameterization of small scale processes may be large enough that it is necessary to evaluate precipitation accuracy as the first step before their utilization e g crossett et al 2020 hu and franzke 2020 tarek et al 2020 recently considerable efforts have been made to evaluate precipitation reanalyses at global and or regional scales precipitation fields derived from global atmospheric reanalyses produced by the european centre for medium range weather and forecasting ecmwf have been recently verified by many studies focused on their employment in further hydrological modelling for instance tarek et al 2020 demonstrated that equivalent hydrological outputs can be obtained after replacement of the in situ station network by era 5 precipitation reanalysis in sparsely observed regions in north america mcclean et al 2021 investigated the ability of four reanalyses era 5 cfsr merra 2 and jra 55 to simulate historic flood events in northern england era 5 reanalysis showed a large improvement in bias of precipitation accuracy compared to its predecessor era interim when analysing daily and or monthly precipitation totals likely due to its improved parameterization and higher resolution amjad et al 2020 nogueira 2020 recently available global reanalyses covering at least part of the 21st century are listed in table 1 from that we selected era 5 and era 5 land the products of the latest fifth generation of ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 for our research the era 5 is the latest comprehensive ecmwf reanalysis replacing era interim hersbach et al 2020 it assimilates in situ observations satellite data snow data and since 2009 also radar data over the north america territory the era 5 land muñoz sabater et al 2021 is a 2d product of the era 5 specifically optimized for the land surface with no assimilated observations precipitation in both products are available hourly further details are given in table 1 global reanalyses usually serve as boundary conditions to generate regional reanalyses providing added value for further climatological applications mainly because of their higher spatial and temporal resolution acharya et al 2019 kaiser weiss et al 2019 an evaluation and uncertainty assessment of several regional reanalyses have been recently carried out within the european seventh framework programme eu fp7 project uncertainties in ensembles of regional reanalyses uerra https uerra eu a comparison of precipitation fields revealed that various regional reanalyses exceled in different regions of europe for instance the additional value of the high resolution regional mescan surfex reanalysis soci et al 2016 was found in regions with dense station networks compared to regions with sparse station densities the mescan surfex data set is a 2d surface analysis combining downscaled harmonie reanalysis fields and additional surface observations bazile et al 2017 this regional reanalysis is driven by era interim thus ending in 2019 its horizontal resolution is 5 5 km covers the whole european domain and provides daily precipitation sums from 0600 to 0600 utc an overview of regional reanalysis products covering europe was recently published by kaiser weiss et al 2019 the main goal of this study is to evaluate and compare the accuracy of the precipitation products of newly released reanalyses era 5 era 5 land and mescan surfex with respect to radar derived precipitation estimates adjusted by daily rain gauge measurements in the territory of the czech republic cr considering that the last two reanalyses are available at high spatial resolution a combination of radar and rain gauge measurements seems to be a suitable verification tool for this purpose the results of the present study could provide a reliable evaluation of reanalyzed precipitation accuracy in climatic conditions over central europe and provide possible feedback to their developers in addition the obtained results will help the hydrological community decide which of the evaluated reanalyses can be used for further applications in hydrological modelling in the cr from this point of view the paper brings novelty to the current state of the art as it presents the first verification of the regional reanalysis mescan surfex in a complex topography and the first comparison of precipitation reanalyses era 5 and era 5 land using high resolution precipitation observations the paper is structured as follows a description of the observational and reanalysed data is given in section 2 section 3 describes the verification scores applied to meteorological and climatological validation the results are presented in section 4 a comparison and explanation of the results are presented in section 5 and finally section 6 contains a summary and conclusions of the presented study 2 data and study area the study evaluates precipitation from three modern reanalyses era 5 era 5 land and uerra mescan surfex with observational records using a combination of radar and rain gauge data during the warm seasons april october in 2002 2018 the warm season was chosen because of the highest frequency of precipitation occurrence in contrast to the winter months when the precipitation amount is lower especially in a liquid phase furthermore radar based measurement of solid precipitation i e snowfall during the cold season may be inaccurate for use as a ground truth e g saltikoff et al 2015 the study area covers the whole cr and is displayed in fig 1 the cr is a hilly landlocked country located in central europe with a total area of 78 871 km2 mountain areas are mostly situated along the state border with a maximum altitude of 1602 m in giant mts in the north of the country the cr has a temperate climate situated in the transition zone between the oceanic and continental climate types with warm summers and cold cloudy and snowy winters however specific climate conditions depends on the elevation 2 1 observational data radar derived precipitation estimates adjusted by daily rain gauge measurements were used as observed data in this study although adjusted radar derived precipitation may exhibit some specific shortcomings e g rlan interference the radar s circular range etc it can still be considered the most accurate observational product of precipitation providing high temporal and spatial resolution bližňák et al 2018 radar reflectivity was measured by two czech c band doppler weather radars brdy and skalky every 10 up to may 2009 and 5 since june 2009 onwards minutes in 1 by 1 km square boxes at several elevation levels we used a cappi product constant altitude plan position indicator at 2 km above sea level obtained from the interpolation of adjacent radar beams the location of both weather radars at elevations exceeding 700 m above sea level is chosen well so that their radar reflectivity measurements are not significantly blocked by mountainous areas and their spatial coverage includes the entire cr and its nearest neighbourhood see fig 1 in areas of the cr where both radars overlapped a higher radar reflectivity value was considered technical details and parameters of the czech weather radar network can be found for instance in novák 2007 and or bližňák et al 2018 in general the quality of the czech radar data is high and comparable to data from other european radar networks michelson et al 2005 rain gauge measurements recorded the sum of daily precipitation between 0600 and 0600 utc of the next day their location is evenly distributed over all of the cr without significant ungauged areas fig 1 their number varied during the considered period and usually ranged between 700 and 800 gauges all daily rain gauge records were carefully checked by the czech hydrometeorological institute chmi before being included in the database 2 2 reanalysed data this paper evaluates the precipitation products of three modern reanalyses two global reanalyses era 5 and era 5 land and one regional reanalysis uerra mescan surfex while era 5 and mescan surfex combine a coupled model forecast system with the assimilation of observed data era 5 land is produced under a single simulation and does not directly assimilate the observations the era 5 land was included in the comparison to show the possible improvement due to fine resolution combined with the worsening due to no assimilation of observations era 5 is based on integrated forecast system cycle 42r2 ifs version 2016 which is coupled to a land surface model htessel and an ocean wave model wam the 4d var data assimilation uses 12 hour windows from 0900 utc to 2100 utc and 2100 utc to 0900 utc the following day where the background forecast and all observations falling within a time window are used to specify all analyses during that window the correctness of individual parameter fields in the reanalysis is spatially very variable and depends on the number of in situ measurements and other data as era 5 does not assimilate precipitation over europe neither in situ nor radar correctness should be comparable for large areas and depend particularly on the complexity of terrain rather than observation density precipitation belongs to a prognostic parameter and is computed during the short term forecasts initialised twice a day from analyses at 0600 and 1800 utc total precipitation is available each hour and is expressed as accumulations over the last 60 min it comprises rain and snow that falls to the earth s surface but it does not include dew fog or precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before reaching the surface thus total precipitation corresponds to the same parameter as the in situ measurement it has two basic components large scale precipitation generated by the cloud scheme which takes into account changes in atmospheric quantities such as pressure temperature and moisture and convective precipitation generated by the convection scheme in the ifs which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box era 5 land is a rerun of the land component of the era 5 as a single simulation without coupling to the atmospheric module or to the ocean wave model of the ifs the core of era 5 land is the tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land incorporating land surface hydrology h tessel observations are not assimilated however they indirectly affect the simulation through the atmospheric forcing of era 5 this fact leads to shortcomings that may equalize or even outweigh the benefits from model improvements and fine resolution uerra mescan surfex combines downscaled uerra harmonie regional reanalysis fields and additional observations the synop ship buoy radiosonde pilot and aircraft data are assimilated directly 4 times a day at 0000 utc 0600 utc 1200 utc and 1800 utcthe system is based on two separate tools i mescan a version of the operational surface analysis canari used at météo france that provides 2 m temperature relative humidity and 24 h total accumulated precipitation and ii surfex a land and ocean surface platform describing the surface processes and computing surface fluxes soil heat and water transfer etc surfex is driven by temperature humidity precipitation wind and radiative fluxes the precipitation observations used in the mescan surfex assimilation are the 24 h accumulated precipitation from 0600 utc to 0600 day 1 from several databases such as eca d ecmwf and national databases the number of assimilated precipitation observations has exceeded 4000 since 2010 the total precipitation is the prognostic parameter computed from 4 successive 6 hour forecasts and expresses the amount of water falling onto the ground during convective and large scale precipitation 3 methods 3 1 adjustment of radar derived precipitation estimates 3 1 1 calculation of radar derived precipitation estimates the basic radar product was 10 min radar derived rain rates calculated in the following way the interpolated radar reflectivity at 2 km above sea level pseudocappi 2 km was first transformed into rain rates using a standard z r relationship marshall and palmer 1948 measurements in a 5 min temporal step were integrated into 10 min by averaging three consecutive 5 min measurements with a double weight assigned to the term in the middle of the 10 min interval if one of the three 5 min measurements was missing the average was not calculated and the 10 min interval was assigned a missing value the prepared 10 min radar derived precipitation estimates were then accumulated from 0600 utc to 0600 utc of the following day to create daily radar derived precipitation estimates that temporally matched the daily rain gauge measurements if more than 18 integrations were missing out of 144 then the resulting daily radar derived precipitation estimate was assigned a missing value if the number of missing radar integrations was between 1 and 17 missing values were replaced by estimates based on linear interpolation between the adjacent preceding and subsequent 10 min radar integrations missing data were usually caused by the malfunction of one or both weather radars or by regular testing and checking of radar devices more specifically 92 9 and 90 6 of the total number of days were covered by data in the range of the brdy and skalky radars respectively 3 1 2 adjustment method the adjustment of both radar and rain gauge data consisted of two steps first the radar derived rain field was spatially adjusted to measurements from the rain gauges in general for each day the ratio between the mean 1 day precipitation total calculated from all rain gauges and the mean 1 day precipitation total estimated from the corresponding radar pixels was determined and used for a multiplication of radar derived precipitation in every pixel of the radar domain second the spatially adjusted radar derived rain rates were locally adjusted in individual pixels based on the distance from the closest rain gauge whereas the weight of the observed precipitation decreased with increasing distance to the given pixel because a detailed description of an adjustment procedure is beyond the scope of this study we refer readers to our previous papers focused primarily on the preparation of adjusted radar derived precipitation and its climatological application where more details are provided e g bližňák et al 2018 sokol and bližňák 2009 3 2 verification methods the research combined meteorological and climatological approaches the methods widely used for forecast verification such as categorical skill scores and methods common in the climatological community based on seasonal and monthly characteristics and indices were employed while the meteorological approach shows the reanalysis ability to simulate the precipitation correctly in a specific place the climatological characteristics indicate the agreement of precipitation distribution during the 17 year period and within individual months in the following subsections we provide a brief explanation of the applied verification scores and indices their description and mathematical notation can then be found in appendix a at the end of this paper adjusted radar derived precipitation estimates were upscaled from 1 km grid boxes to the resolution of a given reanalysis this approach provides a direct and more consistent inter comparison without bringing more errors and uncertainties to the reanalysed products and well describes the original character of precipitation products e g wong et al 2017 watters et al 2021 in the following text we use the terms estimation and observation for reanalysed and adjusted radar derived precipitation respectively 3 2 1 meteorological validation to verify the daily reanalyzed precipitation in a corresponding grid box we used two groups of evaluation metrics i statistical indicators including the mean error me root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficient pcc and ii categorical skill scores derived from the contingency table between estimation and observations see table a1 in appendix a the contingency table which compares estimated and observed events is a useful way to see what types of errors are being made in section 4 1 1 which evaluates daily precipitation totals we define the event as the occurrence of a daily precipitation total greater than or equal to a given threshold value of 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 20 mm the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi and frequency bias bias were calculated from the contingency table statistics 3 2 2 climatological validation the comparison of reanalysis from the climatological view comprises correlation pcc and anomaly analysis of monthly and seasonal sums and comparison of climatological indices that are inspired by the european climate assessment dataset eca d project https www ecad eu indicesextremes indicesdictionary php 5 we used the number of wet days rr1 number of heavy precipitation days r10mm number of very heavy precipitation days r20mm and precipitation fraction due to very wet days r95ptot in addition we expanded the number of indices showing the number of days above a given threshold by two more values 5 mm r5mm and 15 mm r15mm the pcc of seasonal and monthly precipitation sums the mean anomalies of seasonal and monthly sums from 17 year averages and all indices were computed for all grids and are displayed on maps and via box and whisker plots in the case of indices monthly maps are a part of the supplementary material the differences between reanalysis and adjusted radar precipitation are displayed as the number of days per study period or as the number of days per season and in of precipitation sum in case of r95ptot to provide an idea about the magnitude of detected seasonal index differences we also calculated the 25th and 75th percentiles of indices in observed data recalculated to the horizontal resolution of a given reanalysis and this range is denoted as a common value in the following text it is worth mentioning that the values of the calculated percentiles may differ in the observations due to the different horizontal resolutions of each of the evaluated reanalyses a brief explanation of the climate indices used is given in appendix a 4 results 4 1 verification of daily precipitation estimates 4 1 1 verification using statistical and categorical skill scores fig 2 gives a basic idea of the relationship between the estimated and observed daily precipitation totals the top row in fig 2 shows scatterplots where each dot represents the precipitation total from a given day and given grid box naturally values of daily precipitation totals are higher with increasing horizontal resolution of reanalyses in addition both the observed and estimated daily precipitation totals in era 5 do not exceed 130 mm and the maximal observed daily precipitation in a horizontal resolution of mescan surfex reanalysis i e 5 5 km reaches almost 230 mm in addition such extreme precipitation events are usually underestimated in all three reanalyses for instance the highest observed daily precipitation total in the mescan surfex reanalysis 226 7 mm is underestimated by approximately 47 the correlation of all precipitation totals between all considered grid boxes is 0 81 0 78 and 0 85 for era 5 era 5 land and mescan surfex respectively the underestimation of very high precipitation events in the reanalyses is also evident from the bottom row in fig 2 which shows histograms of the frequency of differences between the estimate and observations for each day and grid box more bins are situated on the left side with negative values of the histograms reaching or even exceeding approximately 100 mm in mescan surfex and era 5 land precipitation totals derived from era 5 seem to be more balanced with lower values of differences within a range of 70 and 70 mm the spatial distribution of me and rmse computed as an average daily value between all estimated and observed daily precipitation totals in individual months and the whole warm season of the year i e april october is given in figs 3 and 4 while era 5 and era 5 land overestimate daily precipitation over almost all territories in the warm season and most of the czech territory in individual months precipitation derived from mescan surfex shows both underestimation and overestimation randomly distributed fig 3 mes are even higher from may to august and very low in april september and october the most problematic regions occur in northern and southern mountain regions and in the case of mescan surfex along the eastern border the largest underestimation is evident in june in south bohemia in all reanalyses it should be stressed that despite low precipitation in april the overestimation of era 5 and era 5 land can reach 60 in a given grid box however it usually does not exceed 35 in the warm season not shown here the distribution of rmse fig 4 confirms the problematic grid boxes and the distribution of errors within the season in addition the era 5 and era 5 land reanalyses reveal higher rmses 5 8 mm in may july and august in the beskydy mountains along the eastern border and several problematic localities in the centre of the study area the effect of altitude is less visible in mescan surfex giving the highest rmse values in northern moravia and southern bohemia to assess the accuracy of precipitation estimates with the considered threshold value we calculated four categorical skill scores derived from the contingency table table a1 in appendix a and plotted them in fig 5 the figure is able to display all scores in a single graph so that the most accurate estimates are plotted in the upper right corner and near the diagonal while the least accurate estimates are plotted in the lower left quadrant or distant from the diagonal the symbols distinguish the evaluated reanalysis and the colours represent the considered threshold of precipitation totals fig 5 shows that mescan surfex is the most accurate of all three evaluated reanalyses and better corresponds to observed precipitation totals the statement is valid for all considered thresholds and scores except for pod with a 1 mm threshold with an increasing threshold the values of the categorical skill scores deteriorate faster in era 5 and era 5 land than in mescan surfex which generates a satisfactory level of accuracy even for the highest considered 20 mm threshold with pod reaching 0 59 far reaching 0 36 csi reaching 0 45 and bias reaching 0 92 from fig 5 it is clear that era 5 and era 5 land have more difficulty accurately capturing moderate above 10 mm and especially high above 20 mm daily precipitation events in addition a bias exceeding a value of 1 for daily totals with a threshold value up to 10 mm indicates an overestimation in all three reanalyses in contrast to precipitation totals equal to or higher than 20 mm that are underestimated 4 1 2 verification using climate indices the indices based on the number of days with precipitation above a specific threshold confirm the abovementioned statements the seasonal precipitation overestimation is particularly due to the higher number of wet days r 1 mm and days with precipitation equal to or exceeding 5 mm in all reanalyses fig 6 the differences between reanalysis and observations are partly related to altitude and their magnitude is distinctly lower in mescan surfex in comparison with era 5 and era 5 land the largest overestimation of the number of wet days is detected in era 5 land fig 7 an overestimation occurs particularly in the mountainous regions along the borders fig 6 the first row central column in this case the overestimation reaches 40 days per warm season whereas the common value ranges between 64 and 71 days the overestimation of the number of wet days is largest in april and may in era 5 and era 5 land but is largest in june and july in mescan surfex fig 7 fig s1 the differences among individual months are not as pronounced for r5mm fig s2 the clear overestimation is obvious in the šumava mountains in era 5 and era 5 land while the underestimation is common for all months in the region of south bohemia for mescan surfex the same problematic areas are displayed for the case of rr1 the errors change their polarity and distribution for the number of days with precipitation equal to or higher than 10 15 and 20 mm indices r10mm r15mm and r20mm when overall seasonal underestimation prevails for all reanalyses fig 6 fig 7 the higher threshold of daily precipitation sums above 10 mm per day is associated with higher relative underestimation of the number of days compared to common values in the case of r20mm the overall underestimation is typical for era 5 and era 5 land with only a few exceptions in contrast mescan surfex shows overestimation on the seasonal scale as well the highest is in northern hrubý jeseník mountains and eastern beskydy mountains moravia the monthly differences are on average the lowest i e the median of the differences close to zero for r10mm in all months and r15mm and r20mm in april september and october fig 7 the magnitude of monthly differences in comparison to observed indices is displayed in fig s7 the spatial distribution of errors highlights the most problematic areas again the šumava mountains and north bohemia particularly for era 5 land fig s3 fig s4 fig s5 although mescan surfex seems to assess the indices the best on average there are regions with larger differences in comparison with era 5 and era 5 land among others the overestimation in northern and eastern moravia in several months and the underestimation of r15mm in western moravia in july can be mentioned right column on fig s4 the general underestimation of extreme precipitation in all evaluated reanalyses is confirmed by the last used index r95ptot in era 5 and era 5 land the seasonal fraction of extreme precipitation is up to 4 5 lower compared to observations with common values between 21 and 23 fig 6 bottom row the large differences are less related to altitude as they occur in western and eastern areas as well however the spatial distribution of monthly differences in r95ptot is not uniform and large areas of overestimation prevail in era 5 and era 5 land in july and august fig s6 the differences in the seasonal and monthly r95ptot index between mescan surfex and the observations are generally lower in comparison with both global reanalyses fig 7 and the distribution of the largest errors in individual months is similar in all reanalyses fig s6 4 2 verification of monthly precipitation sums the correlations between reanalysis and observed precipitation seasonal sums are generally high fig 8 top row and table 2 and spatially consistent in all reanalyses the figure shows that regional differences in correlation increase with increasing horizontal resolution of the reanalysis while the low variability of seasonal pccs in era 5 between 0 82 and 0 93 in individual grid boxes is detected the other two reanalyses point to greater heterogeneity and variability values below 0 75 and above 0 9 are detected for era 5 land and values from 0 35 to 0 99 are detected for mescan surfex the spatial mean of correlations is similar in individual months with a maximum in october and a minimum in june in all reanalyses table 2 the maps of monthly pcc also display high values in august and september but also indicate some problems with may precipitation fig s8 the most problematic region with the generally lowest correlation in several months is the entire southern area of bohemia around české budějovice town the relative anomalies of precipitation sums display a distinct difference between reanalyses at a monthly scale although the seasonal anomalies show only slight overestimation of precipitation in era 5 and era 5 land and quite good agreement between mescan surfex and the observations fig 8 bottom row the magnitude of monthly relative errors is considerably variable with the largest mean spatial overestimation above 30 for era 5 and era 5 land and near 6 for mescan surfex in april table 3 september and october also report large overestimations particularly in the central parts of the study area in other months the errors concentrate in higher elevated regions along borders and in českomoravská vrchovina fig s9 the spatial distribution of anomalies is very similar in era 5 and era 5 land which documents the fact that era 5 land adopts precipitation from era 5 mescan surfex generally overestimates precipitation although underestimation is detected in the entire southern northwestern and northeastern parts of bohemia fig 9 displays the monthly anomalies in individual months and grids the grid monthly difference between the estimation and observations ranges from 235 167 mm day in all reanalyses the median of the differences in each month of the warm season is above zero an interval between maxima and minima increases with the higher spatial resolution of a given reanalysis the highest is in july for era 5 land and in august for mescan surfex the first and third quartile spread of anomalies in individual grid boxes indicated by the height of the boxplot bodies is generally lowest for mescan surfex table 4 and table 5 display the lists of the ten largest negative and positive differences respectively between the estimated and observed monthly precipitation totals for all evaluated reanalyses the events differ only in the order of magnitude difference between era 5 and era 5 land year month and location are the same while mesacan surfex has the largest errors in completely different years months and grid boxes selected events are discussed in section 5 5 discussion the spatial distribution and annual cycle of daily precipitation indices uncovered some weaknesses in the reanalyses especially reanalyses without assimilation of the observed precipitation the explanation for the several discrepancies between reanalysis and observations as well as a comparison of our results with recently published findings forms the content of this section our results including a general overestimation of daily precipitation totals and wet day frequency and an underestimation of the frequency of heavy precipitation in all studied reanalyses especially in global reanalyses era 5 and era 5 land are consistent with the results published by isotta et al 2015 the underestimation of high daily precipitation totals in global reanalyses era interim 80 km horizontal resolution across england and wales was also documented by de leeuw et al 2015 in this case however the authors conclude that the reanalysed precipitation is highly correlated with the observation and the underestimation is less pronounced the underestimation of high precipitation in global reanalyses arises from the nwp models that are the base of the reanalyses lavers and villarini 2013 shrestha et al 2013 sometimes even in situ measurement underestimate local high precipitation our results thus enhance the importance of the radar products assimilation to improve the modern reanalyses fig 3 and fig 4 show that the global reanalyses era 5 and era 5 land reveal larger errors in the elevated areas compared to mescan surfex a possible explanation could be the fact that the model topography in the global reanalyses has a coarser resolution which leads to a greater underestimation of precipitation compared to regional reanalyses with finer model topography this assumption is consistent with the results published by crossett et al 2020 who found that the accuracy of precipitation reanalysis deteriorates with increasing altitude difference between model and real altitude precipitation seasonal and monthly totals are overestimated in all study reanalyses as was documented for europe bandhauer et al 2021 the usa crossett et al 2020 turkey amjad et al 2020 and mainland china jiang et al 2021 the differences are similar in all months similar to bandhauer et al 2021 which leads to the largest relative overestimation in april in all reanalyses and the lowest in june and october in era 5 era 5 land and mescan surfex with no clear relation to the monthly totals in contrast to amjad et al 2020 the positive bias is caused by the enhanced number of wet days with low precipitation between 1 mm and approximately 10 mm for comparison the mean seasonal wet day frequency generally ranges between 0 34 and 0 51 in era 5 and from 0 25 to 0 43 in the observations which is similar to bandhauer et al 2021 the number of days with high and extremely high precipitation is considerably underestimated in era 5 and era 5 land particularly in higher elevated locations grid boxes similar to the era 5 behaviour over turkey amjad et al 2020 and across the northeastern united states crossett et al 2020 this is because high convective precipitation which prevails in warm months is not well captured in the reanalyses especially in those with a coarser horizontal resolution and convective parameterization switched on de leeuw et al 2015 in those cases the highest precipitation totals are usually smoothed and or may be displaced compared to the observations however bandhauer et al 2021 found excessively intense precipitation over europe in era 5 compared to gridded station data the disagreement may arise from the different reference data adjusted radar can better capture local convective events in comparison with gridded datasets based solely on station measurements parkes et al 2013 a combination of overestimation of low precipitation and underestimation of high precipitation leads to low seasonal and monthly anomalies of precipitation sums and creates a false impression of reanalysis capability to simulate precipitation well the categorical skill scores point to a better ability of the regional reanalysis to spatially simulate precipitation events even for the highest considered 20 mm threshold which could be attributed to its finer resolution acharya et al 2019 isotta et al 2015 soci et al 2016 the difficulties of era 5 and era 5 land with accurate simulation of moderate above 10 mm and especially high above 20 mm daily precipitation totals have been confirmed in different parts of the world e g hu and franzke 2020 jiang et al 2021 nogueira 2020 the precipitation patterns monthly and daily totals bias and rmse and spatial structure of all applied indices in era 5 land have a very similar appearance to those in era 5 which is logical because both reanalyses are based on the same nwp model and era 5 land is a rerun of era 5 in a simple 2d scheme the errors are larger and even more expressive in era 5 land which proves that the increase in spatial resolution alone does not lead to improved precipitation estimates the concurrent assimilation of observation data is also important and its absence leads to a worsening of the reanalysis ability to capture the observed temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation including extremes on the other hand the spatial structure of climate indices calculated from the mescan surfex reanalysis is clearly different from the previous two the largest errors are again generally related to higher altitudes however both types of errors under and overestimations of individual indices and characteristics with the exception of pcc occur their magnitude can be even larger than in both global reanalyses nevertheless grid boxes with large errors cover only small areas prevailing low errors over most areas indicate that mescan surfex corresponds better to the observations than era 5 and era 5 land the largest differences in individual monthly totals listed in table 4 and table 5 originate in all reanalyses particularly from the erroneous simulation of individual extreme precipitation events negative bias or problems related to interference of radar signals positive bias for example the largest difference uncovered in era 5 land was in july 2011 when the monthly precipitation total was underestimated by 50 206 mm in one grid box this was caused by a missed extreme precipitation event in the reanalysis that occurred between july 20 and july 21 and caused extensive floods in northern bohemia it should be mentioned that this event was also underestimated by the other two reanalyses although it did not occur first similarly the most severe precipitation underestimation in mescan surfex was observed in the giant mountains northern bohemia in august 2002 when all of central europe was hit by long lasting and heavy precipitation that together with antecedent catchment saturation caused immense floods in a great part of bohemia řezáčová et al 2005 ulbrich et al 2003 on the other hand the highest overestimation detected in september 2007 was caused by a precipitation event that occurred on 6 september in this particular case however the error was not on the reanalysis side but on the measurement side the radio local access network rlan interference blocked the radar beams in several pixels in the eastern part of moravia and caused a significant underestimation of the derived precipitation totals this well known artefact can be easily removed in situations without rain but in cases of heavy precipitation it is not clear which values should be assigned to those pixels this problem appears in the adjusted radar derived precipitation totals before 2015 when a large upgrade of both weather radars occurred new polarimetric radars can effectively eliminate rlan interference without any postprocessing of radar derived products bližňák et al 2018 the magnitude of positive and negative biases increases with the spatial resolution the locations of errors are almost the same in both global reanalyses but differ from the largest biases in mescan surfex in position and timing the differences between reanalysis and observations at individual grid boxes may be large for era 5 land and mescan surfex but low for era 5 as in october 2013 or may have an opposite sign small negative sign in era 5 era 5 land and large positive sign in mescan surfex as in august 2010 such an even distribution of extreme errors among the months and the cause of selected examples indicate no systematic but rather random bias as the main reason for the extreme monthly anomalies the pcc is reasonably high reaching values above 0 75 in all months in most of the study area however the pcc does not indicate the real ability of reanalysis to capture the precipitation distribution as implied by the above stated findings on the other hand the pcc can uncover areas with problematic precipitation simulations such unexpectedly low correlations as well as a strongly underestimated number of days with precipitation above 10 mm were uncovered in all southern bohemia in the mescan surfex reanalysis the time series of estimated and observed monthly precipitation totals from the grid box with the lowest pcc value fig 10 shows underestimation between 2009 and 2012 however if one compares the time series without the 2009 2012 period the value of the correlation increases to 0 91 the reason for the large dry error pertaining to 4 years may arise from the driving global era interim reanalysis specific setup of the nwp model or the missing observations entering assimilation although we cannot fully explain the cause of this deficiency we can conclude that the largest underestimation in 2009 2012 occurs in the summer months with a higher proportion of heavy convective precipitation similar precipitation behaviour was documented in sweden between 1994 and 2000 shimanke et al 2019 the recommendation according to the user guide is to exclude such periods from the analysis however in our case the error is restricted to a short time period and limited area and does not distinctly affect the general results thus precipitation series entered into the computation were kept unchanged our results confirm the findings of soci et al 2016 that the assimilation of all available observations is essential for the good performance of precipitation products in reanalysis the assimilation reduces errors of the nwp model used in reanalysis simulations and substantially improves the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation particularly in warm months over the complex terrain when convective precipitation prevails the free provision of observed data is thus in the interest of each state to achieve the best possible accuracy of reanalyses for its territory 6 summary and conclusion the aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the performance of three precipitation reanalyses era 5 era 5 land and mescan surfex at daily monthly and seasonal scales over the czech republic in the warm seasons i e april october in 2002 2018 several statistical indicators and categorical skill scores were employed to assess the accuracy of the precipitation datasets using radar derived precipitation estimates adjusted by daily totals measured by the rain gauge network in addition several climate indices were used to determine the ability of the reanalyses to simulate the number of days with a defined precipitation threshold verification of daily precipitation totals generally showed good agreement with the observations in all reanalyses documented by high values of the pearson correlation coefficient 0 78 0 85 and low values of the mean error and root mean square error ranging between 1 and 1 mm and between 2 and 5 mm respectively era 5 and era 5 land tended to overestimate low precipitation and to underestimate high precipitation with the largest deviations in mountainous areas along the czech border on the other hand the spatial distribution of precipitation totals simulated by mescan surfex was both overestimated and underestimated with less influence of altitude all three reanalyses were less accurate in absolute values in the summer months i e june july and august when convective precipitation prevailed in contrast to the beginning april and end september and october of the warm season when the amount of precipitation was usually lower the interannual variability was generally well captured in all reanalyses and the mean correlations of seasonal and monthly precipitation sums frequently reached 0 8 but decreased to 0 5 in may and june the lowest correlations were detected in all southern bohemia particularly for mescan surfex which completely underestimated precipitation in the whole period from 2009 to 2012 in this area the possible cause for this may be an inaccuracy in the driving global era interim reanalysis specific setup of the nwp model or the missing observations entering assimilation the correlation maps did not display any problems in mountainous or lowland areas as did the number of days with precipitation above a specific threshold this study adds a valuable contribution to the current state of the art not only by verifying reanalyses in specific regions with complex terrain affected by different circulation patterns but also by using radar derived precipitation as a ground truth due to the high horizontal resolution this can be helpful in capturing local convective precipitation which may be significantly underestimated or completely missing in rain gauge only data on the other hand errors in radar data caused by various reasons see section 1 may in some specific situations result in incorrect reanalysis evaluation and may thus deteriorate verification scores however it should be emphasized that such situations are not very common and occur mainly when using older radar data measured by nonpolarimetric weather radars our research revealed a weakness in individual reanalyses that should be considered in their further utilization and application additionally we showed the advantages of the high spatial resolution of adjusted radar derived precipitation estimates in reanalysis verification the available temporal resolution of the radar data encourages applying such data to evaluate reanalysis performance in a subdaily step specific reanalyses have been recently created to simulate convective precipitation and have thus correctly characterised the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation e g acharya et al 2020 wahl et al 2017 its evaluation with respect to hydrological applications may be a possible step in our future work credit authorship contribution

7887,study region crati river basin southern italy central mediterranean study focus we evaluate the combined effect of multiple global and regional climate model gcm rcm combinations and bias correction bc methods on the hydrological impact of projected climate change under the representative concentration pathway rcp4 5 15 euro cordex members combining 6 gcms and five high resolution 0 11 rcms provide the meteorological input for a spatially distributed hydrological model rcm derived input data are uncorrected and corrected through three empirical methods leading to 60 different simulations for three 30 year future periods in 2020 2096 compared to the baseline 1975 2005 the combined uncertainty of the climate models and correction methods is evaluated for the main hydrological variables using an analysis of variance anova method new hydrological insights for the region results highlight a considerable agreement in projecting a decreasing trend of available water resources on average 70 for snow 8 for root zone soil moisture and 17 for river runoff in the period 2070 2096 due to the remarkable mean temperature increase and less accentuated precipitation reduction the uncertainty evaluation shows that 1 the primary source of uncertainty is the driving gcm and 2 bc methods smooth the projected hydrological impact in a not negligible way especially concerning discharge for each future period the reduction projected without bias correction is about 3 higher than with bc therefore contributing to the total uncertainty graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrological impact gcm rcm combinations change factor bias correction anova mediterranean catchments 1 introduction the studies on the hydrological impact of climate change must cope with the uncertainty arising from the complex modelling chain leading to hydrological projections a cascade of uncertainty proceeds from the envisaged future socio economic scenarios and related greenhouse gas emissions down to the modelling of adaptation responses wilby and dessai 2010 in the middle further high uncertainty arises from the structure and parameterisation of the models used at different resolutions to project climate change from the global climate models gcms to statistical or dynamical through regional climate models rcms downscaling methods down to the hydrological models dobler et al 2012 gobiet et al 2014 in the last decade several studies investigated the uncertainty linked to model projections analysing the interactions of the single sources of uncertainty and evaluating the relative weight of each source see ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 for a review while most analyses consistently recognised gcms as the primary sources of uncertainty chen et al 2013 there is no general agreement about the relative importance of the other components of the modelling chain to assess the hydrological impact especially in small to medium size catchments maximum area in the order of 103 km2 downscaling the coarse resolution information provided by gcms is an inevitable step dynamical downscaling methods i e rcms use consistently the same fundamental physical principles driving the gcms gutmann et al 2012 furthermore comprehensive investigation of the interrelated uncertainties descending from gcms to rcms is supported by the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex giorgi et al 2009 giorgi and gutowski 2015 an intercomparison project focused on regional modelling which addresses specific world regions with targeted initiatives like e g euro cordex jacob et al 2014 dealing with the european continent despite their capability of providing physically based high resolution information about all the climate variables simulated by gcms rcms performances are subject to some limitations such limitations must be considered when these models are intended for further use in impact studies e g xie et al 2015 maraun et al 2010 maraun 2013 senatore et al 2011 mascaro et al 2018 therefore the most relevant rcm variables used as inputs need corrections through a proper strategy for hydrological studies ho et al 2012 identified two main calibration pathways in the change factor and the bias correction approaches with the former observations are modified with the modelled climate change signal ccs to derive future scenarios while with the latter future projections are corrected using the model bias calculated against observations despite this distinction in practice many authors refer to change factor methods as particular bias correction methods e g teutschbein and seibert 2013 therefore hereafter we will refer to bias correction including also change factor methods furthermore according to potter et al 2020 bias correction methods can be grouped in scaling or change factor methods and either non parametric empirical or parametric distributional quantile quantile mapping qqm the assumptions on which the different bias correction approaches rely are debatable many studies addressed basic questions concerning their effects and potential benefits e g maraun et al 2017 the main concerns regard the physical justification of applying such methods ehret et al 2012 whether bias correction can be applied directly to gcms ngai et al 2017 and the possibility of application for non stationary conditions teutschbein and seibert 2013 likewise it is debated to what extent bias correction provides a more consistent representation of river runoff for the past and how much it acts as a source of uncertainty affecting the estimation of future change in hydrological indicators muerth et al 2013 including extreme values willkofer et al 2018 furthermore some techniques could not correctly preserve changes in quantiles and extremes cannon et al 2015 or could affect modelled runoff teng et al 2015 finally further uncertainty can arise from the accuracy of the observational datasets on which bias correction relies kim et al 2015 and the periods used for calibration chen et al 2015 gampe et al 2019 bias correction methods represent another source of uncertainty in the framework of the overall modelling chain under non stationary conditions therefore the impact of the choice of different bias correction methods on hydrological output is being increasingly investigated e g chen et al 2013 muerth et al 2013 huang et al 2014 fang et al 2015 teng et al 2015 seaby et al 2015 johnson and sharma 2015 li et al 2019 also with the aid of techniques for the analysis of the variance al aamery et al 2016 aryal et al 2019 ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 meresa et al 2021 lee et al 2022 such an impact on the relative climate change signal is generally weak but some studies e g johnson and sharma 2015 al aamery et al 2016 found that bias correction mitigates the change projected by raw model simulations others e g aryal et al 2019 or meresa et al 2021 highlighted the contribution to the total uncertainty of combined driving climate models and bias correction methods uncertainty evaluation of future projections is particularly relevant for highly vulnerable regions to climate change such as the mediterranean basin giorgi and lionello 2008 ipcc 2014 garrote et al 2015 cramer et al 2018 tuel and eltahir 2020 which is mainly affected by drought risk cook et al 2014 hoegh guldberg et al 2018 tramblay et al 2020 in this area anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are likely contributing to an increase in the occurrence of dry spells enhancing this trend with ever higher levels of global warming gudmundsson et al 2017 the consequences on the hydrological cycle of the observed and projected change in the precipitation and temperature regimes in the mediterranean affect the whole ecosystem and consequently essential socio economic activities like drinking water distribution un 2021 maiolo et al 2017 food production fao 2016 ronco et al 2017 or preparedness to hydrometeorological extremes madsen et al 2014 therefore in the last years the climate change impact studies dealing with the projected hydrological variability in mediterranean catchments has increased tremendously addressing either the whole region e g hertig and tramblay 2016 hartmann et al 2017 or smaller areas e g spain estrela et al 2012 majone et al 2012 olmos giménez et al 2016

2019 peres et al 2019 citrini et al 2020 this study aims to contribute to the ongoing debate about uncertainty in projecting climate change hydrological impact addressing the portion of the overall modelling chain composed by the global and regional models and further bias correction which is applied to both precipitation and temperature the main input variables of several hydrological models our fundamental exercise is demonstrated in the crati river basin a typical mediterranean catchment located in southern italy the hydrological impact analysis under climate change in this basin was already performed by senatore et al 2011 considering three rcms and the period 2070 2099 with sres emission scenarios nakícenovíc et al 2000 in this study the climate change scenario ensemble includes 15 members deriving from the combination of 6 gcms and 5 high resolution 0 11 rcms in the framework of the euro cordex project the variables of interest are uncorrected and corrected through three bias correction methods representative of change factor scaling and quantile quantile mapping methods and then used as the input for the fully distributed intermediate space time resolution hydrological model in strhym senatore et al 2011 our previous study results are updated and enlarged because projected change under a representative concentration pathway rcp4 5 namely van vuuren et al 2011 spans the whole period from 2020 to 2096 subdivided into 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 furthermore they are generalisable in terms of uncertainty evaluation the extra level of uncertainty introduced by different correction methods is quantified and related for each 30 year scenario to that originated by the different gcm rcm combinations on several relevant variables such as groundwater and root zone water content evapotranspiration and river runoff 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study focuses on the crati river basin fig 1 the largest in the calabria region southern italy the analysed area is delimited by the sila plateau east and south and the tyrrhenian coastal chain west with the closing section north at the tarsia dam the average altitude of the study area determined on a 20 m resolution digital terrain model dtm is approximately 682 m a s l with a maximum of 1781 m a s l in the sila plateau and a minimum of 52 m a s l at the closing section the contributing area has an extension of 1280 km2 and a perimeter of about 190 km while the main river channel is 52 km long vegetation cover was considered constant during the whole study period even the future emphasising changes due only to ccs reference land cover was taken from the corine land cover 2000 project the primary land cover types in the basin are forests 43 with 26 broad leaved forest and agricultural areas 47 with 14 non irrigated arable land and 12 olive groves precipitation and temperature measurements are performed through a monitoring network of 33 rain gauges and 18 thermometers as for climate conditions according to the thornthwaite 1948 classification the crati river basin is characterised by a mediterranean climate from sub humid to hyper humid for the period 1975 2005 which is considered as the baseline for the evaluation of climate change scenarios the cumulative precipitation is approximately 1100 mm year 1 with monthly mean values ranging from a minimum of 27 mm month 1 in summer jja to a maximum of 142 mm month 1 in winter djf for the same period the average monthly temperature ranges from 5 c in winter to 21 c in summer with an average annual value of approximately 14 c 2 2 euro cordex rcms the meteorological variables used as input in the hydrological analysis for the projection of water resources variability i e precipitation temperature and net radiation are determined from the output of 15 rcms provided through the euro cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 in the framework of euro cordex several gcms derived from the cmip5 project coupled model intercomparison phase 5 taylor et al 2012 were dynamically downscaled rcms resolution is currently the highest for downscaling within cordex i e 0 11 since this study focuses on the uncertainty provided by different gcm rcm chains and bias correction methods only the output of the intermediate scenario rcp4 5 is selected this scenario reflects the more plausible outcomes given the current and pledged policies hausfather and peters 2020 for each of the 15 models simulations outputs in the control period 1975 2005 and projection period 2020 2096 are used table 1 shows the models used renamed through an acronym consisting of three letters referring to the gcm name and four to the rcm name furthermore when more than one ensemble member belongs to the same gcm rcm combination the suffix r an abbreviation for realisation followed by a number given by the institute running the gcms is used 2 3 the hydrological model in strhym the hydrological analysis is conducted using the in strhym model intermediate space time resolution hydrological model senatore et al 2011 in strhym is a fully distributed hydrological model developed to analyse hydrological processes on small medium sized mediterranean basins designed to work at intermediate spatial and temporal resolutions 1 km and 24 h respectively particularly suitable for long range analyses it reproduces all the main surface and subsurface hydrological processes i e snow accumulation and melting following the scheme proposed by the swat model neitsch et al 2002 which distinguishes rainfall and snow depending on a threshold temperature interception kriestensen and jensen 1975 infiltration and soil water redistribution along the soil column using a gravitational method which allows water movement along the root zone an unsaturated layer below the root zone and the water table exfiltration and runoff generation actual evapotranspiration using the approach proposed by allen et al 1998 with a crop coefficient and a water stress coefficient accounting for land cover type and the actual root zone water content respectively furthermore contributions from vegetated and bare soil are separated and the reference evapotranspiration is calculated following priestley and taylor 1972 base flow routing following a two dimensional approach and surface and sub surface flow routing kinematic cascade approach therefore the model output provides daily maps of snow accumulation evapotranspiration root zone soil moisture and storage in an idealised near surface groundwater layer and the simulated runoff at the closing section as a time series in strhym was calibrated for the crati river basin over available daily discharge values at the closing section during 1961 1966 achieving a nash sutcliffe coefficient value of 0 83 senatore et al 2011 subsequent validation over the periods 1969 1971 and 2004 2006 no other discharge data are available led to nash sutcliffe coefficient values of 0 64 and 0 57 respectively this study s original model was updated by migrating the code from visual basic using map window gis activex control extension to python with gdal ogr geospatial data abstraction software library the new version of the model allows for more efficient parallelised calculations the model s meteorological input data is provided through spatial interpolating point values acquired by either the observational network or the rcms in the latter cells centres falling within and in the neighbouring of the study area are considered the daily maps of precipitation are achieved through spline interpolations temperature maps are obtained by integrating the spline interpolation with daily elevation dependent regressions thus accounting for the influence of the orography concerning net radiation rcm values are determined from the balance of the incident and reflected short and long wave radiations and then interpolated in the same way as precipitation at the same time the output from a modified version of a model by moore et al 1993 replaces missing observations due to the lack of measurements this variable is not bias corrected further details about interpolation methods and other input parameters are provided by senatore et al 2011 the meteorological input grids are returned at a resolution of 1 km both for the reference 1975 2005 and projection periods 2020 2096 2 4 bias correction methods considering both uncorrected nb meaning no bias correction and corrected rcms precipitation and temperature fields the hydrological projections are performed three approaches are used for correction namely 1 the constant scaling method cs mpelasoka and chiew 2009 chen et al 2011 chen et al 2013 a change factor approach 2 the method proposed by kunstmann et al 2004 abbreviated with ku hereafter which can be classified as a scaling bias correction method and 3 a non parametric quantile mapping method qm wilks 1995 themeßl et al 2011 2012 chen et al 2013 these methods are briefly detailed in appendix a 2 5 uncertainty evaluation the variability produced by the use of 15 gcm rcm combinations and 4 change factor bias correction approaches including no correction in the crati river basin is evaluated through the comparison of the 60 projected changes time averaged variables in evapotranspiration root zone water content groundwater and river runoff in the three future periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 considering the whole year the irrigation period april september and the four seasons i e djf mam jja and son comparisons for all variables are performed by computing the percentage differences defined as the ratio between 1 the differences of the variable in future scenarios and the control period and 2 the variable in the control period furthermore the contribution of the two different sources of uncertainty to the total predicted uncertainty of the projected variables is evaluated through an analysis of variance method anova following the methodology proposed by ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 first for each variable the total sum of squared errors sse is determined 1 sse i 1 n gr j 1 n bc x ij x oo 2 where n gr 15 is the number of combined gcm rcm projections used n bc 4 the number of bias correction methods x ij the value of the hydrological variable x corresponding to the gcm rcm i and the correction method j and finally x oo is the overall mean sse can be considered as the sum of single contributions to errors given by gcm rcm combinations ss gr bias correction methods ss bc and their interaction ss gr bc 2 sse ss gr ss bc ss gr bc 3 ss gr n bc i 1 n gr x io x oo 2 4 ss bc n gr j 1 n bc x oj x oo 2 5 ss gr bc i 1 n gr j 1 n bc x ij x io x oj x oo 2 the subscript o is used in the previous equations when the average over a specific i or j index is indicated to avoid biases in the results of uncertainty decomposition due to the different sizes of gr and bc populations 15 and 4 respectively the approach of bosshard et al 2013 is followed according to this methodology all the 1365 possible combinations of 4 i e the bc population size out of 15 gcm rcm projections are sampled then for each 4 member sample set m out of 1365 the terms ss gr m ss bc m and ss gr bc m are calculated using eqs 3 5 in this case n gr 4 and their ratios against the corresponding sse m are averaged over the whole sample set to achieve the unbiased variance fraction nss related to each of the single contributions to errors 6 nss u 1 1365 m 1 1365 ss u m sse m u gr ed gr bc the variance decomposition is applied to all the projected hydrological variables for the three future periods furthermore thanks to the flexibility of the method two subsets of euro cordex projections characterised by the coupling of the same gcm with different rcms and vice versa are also analysed to provide insights concerning the separated contribution to uncertainty of gcms and rcms specifically two experiments were performed one involving four projections with the same gcm namely ececclm ecehirh eceracm and ecerca4 sharing the ichec ec earth gcm table 1 and one involving the same rcm namely cm5rca4 ecerca4 hadrca4 and mpirca4 sharing the smhi rca4 rcm table 1 3 results 3 1 precipitation and temperature precipitation and temperature mean values provided by each rcm for the entire projection period 2020 2096 are divided into three different 30 year intervals 2020 2049 2040 2069 2070 2096 compared with the reference period 1975 2005 changes are evaluated with respect to the reference period for each rcm without considering any bias correction techniques precipitation is analysed in percentage variation and temperature as deviation from the reference period the analysis is performed from a single month to a yearly scale the box and whiskers plots in figs 2 and 3 show the monthly variability in the projected rcm outputs for each model the spatially averaged values are considered concerning precipitation fig 2 for most of the months in all the three periods the models project reductions on average black dots except for march november and partially january and february which typically are rainy months in the mediterranean climate however in no months did all the models agree on reductions starting from a reference annual value of 1124 mm yearly variations range from 9 4 to 4 8 in 2020 2049 from 8 5 to 2 6 in 2040 2069 and from 15 9 to 2 1 in 2070 2096 projected yearly changes are positive in 4 1 and 1 cases out of 15 in 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 respectively table s1 goes into details about yearly irrigation period and seasonal variations showing that in general for each season and period considerable decreases are projected the temperature change signal is much clearer than the precipitation change signal fig 3 shows that a temperature increase is expected in all cases all models all periods all months with higher growth in summer and moving into the future starting form a reference annual value of 12 1 c yearly variations range from 0 9 c to 1 9 c in 2020 2049 from 1 2 c to 2 5 c in 2040 2069 and from 1 7 c to 3 1 c in 2070 2096 in summer jja reference value of 20 2 c the temperature increase is projected up to 3 9 c in 2070 2096 the reliability of the climate projections can be linked to models skills in reproducing the current climate based on this assumption weighting procedures can be used to prioritise the most accurate models e g senatore et al 2019 none of the models used in this study can perfectly reproduce the reference period s average conditions fig 4 shows the uncertainty of precipitation simulations some of which cannot fully represent the typical seasonal variability of the mediterranean climate and also shows the substantial temperature underestimation of all models table 2 shows some performance indices calculated monthly the models with the best performances concerning precipitation i e eceracmr12 with the lowest mean absolute error mae and the highest coefficient of determination r2 and hadracm with the lowest absolute bias are not within the best models considering the temperature these results consistent with the analysis performed by peres et al 2020 with a broader ensemble of euro cordex models for a larger area of southern italy highlight the inaccuracies and uncertainties of the gcm rcm combinations in reproducing the current climate and solicits the use of bias correction methods these techniques are applied to the precipitation and temperature fields before their use as input in the hydrological model whose results are shown in the following sections 3 2 snow starting from this section on snow projections and for the following ones dedicated to specific hydrological variables results are presented considering the whole set of available models to account for the global uncertainty of the climate change projections concurrently we also focus on a single model to provide an example of the space time variations due to the bias correction methods our choice on which projection to use as an example fell on the hadracm model which is the one with the lowest precipitation bias compared to observations table 2 a comparison of the mean monthly evolution of the main components of the water balance as simulated by the hadracm model with and without bias correction and the corresponding results achieved with the calibrated hydrologic model forced by observations in the control period 1975 2005 is provided as supplementary material fig s1 while in the following percentage changes are shown fig s1 also provides absolute values as a reference furthermore the annual means of the variables achieved with observation forcing are provided in the main text snow accumulation in snow water equivalent units projections mainly pertain to the winter months fig 5 shows the average daily percentage decrease in the three periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 2070 2096 compared with the reference period 1975 2005 using the hadracm model some spikes can be noted in the curves especially at the very beginning and end of the cold season because of numeric issues i e the absolute values of accumulated snow are minimal still they do not overshadow the primary trend the reduction across the three periods is evident mainly due to temperature increases the simulations using the uncorrected precipitation and temperature fields labelled with nb provide a less pronounced but still relevant reduction in contrast the ku and qm simulations which use the same correction for temperature show somewhat similar behaviour fig 6 focuses on the average spatial distribution of the decrease for the same model hadracm with different corrections and periods the main differences concern the period 2020 2049 nb simulation projects a lower decline in the high altitude areas especially the sila plateau in the east in contrast ku and qm simulations project a lower decrease in the valley where snow accumulation is already low in the reference period the outcomes are more consistent for the other future periods with the nb simulations projecting a slightly lower decrease on the mountains agreeing with fig 5 a summary of yearly snow accumulation percentage changes concerning both hadracm and the average of all the 15 models is shown in table 3 detailed information for each model is provided in table s3 models trends are consistent with projected decreases starting from a spatially averaged reference annual value of snow water equivalent in the basin of 65 mm of approximately 50 60 and 70 in the periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 respectively hadracm projects a more remarkable decrease especially in 2070 2096 with the cs simulations in general models agreement is confirmed by the not too high variability of the outputs total standard deviation values lower than 15 for every period of course no model in any scenario projects snow accumulation increase 3 3 evapotranspiration fig 7 shows the average daily percentage changes of actual evapotranspiration et with hadracm as summarised by table 4 an et increase is projected for every correction method and every period in particular et increases in 2020 2049 where both precipitation and temperature increase is projected and in 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 where only temperature increase is projected despite the increasing temperatures a lower et increase in 2070 2096 than 2040 2069 indicates higher water stress i e less water available for evapotranspiration due to reduced precipitation the yearly et increase is generally uniformly distributed in space even though it is slightly more pronounced in 2070 2096 on the eastern side fig s2 the same increasing trend found at the yearly scale occurs in the irrigation april september period and even in summer tables s4 s7 except in 2070 2096 where et decrease is projected with all bias correction methods this behaviour is due to increased water shortage highlighting higher water stress for the vegetation the yearly average trend of all models is positive like hadracm but less pronounced table 4 the nb simulations almost always provide the highest average increase the annual reference value for the control period is approximately 740 mm all projections for all models and correction methods considering the whole year are shown in fig 8 models outputs are consistent at the yearly scale for 2020 2049 and 2040 2069 et increase is projected by 70 and 72 of the simulations respectively higher uncertainty was found for 2070 2096 et increase projected by 58 of the simulations et reduction is further amplified during the summer months where the average change of et projected by all models is negative in all periods up to 4 4 in 2070 2096 tables s4 s7 3 4 root zone soil moisture the increase of et induced by the temperature rise causes a reduction in soil moisture in the first layers namely in the root zone even in those simulations like hadracm in 2020 2049 that do not project a reduction in precipitation fig 9 shows for hadracm but the same behaviour persists for all simulations slightly negative or even positive changes of the root zone soil moisture rz during winter months due to the upper constraint given by the saturated conditions wet months precipitation combined with lower et values increases rz close to saturation so that at the end of the winter the highest values are reached anyway then the increased temperature causes a more robust reduction in the warmer and drier summer months implying yearly reductions varying from approximately 2 2020 2049 to 9 2070 2096 table 5 the spatial distribution of the yearly rz generally follows that of et fig s3 expanding the analysis to the whole ensemble table 5 shows that for all periods and correction methods average reductions are projected yearly with overall average values of 4 5 5 8 and 8 2 respectively for the periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 slightly higher percentages are achieved for the irrigation period tables s8 s11 in agreement with et outcomes the most significant decrease is projected by nb simulations simulations outputs are highly consistent in projecting reduction yearly fig 10 and seasonal tables s8 s11 3 5 groundwater storage the in strhym model accounts for downward water flow from the unsaturated zone towards the saturated zone as soon as the water content in the former is higher than the field capacity this condition occurs relatively often during wintertime even with reduced precipitation fig 11 shows that with hadracm winter recharge allows positive changes in the schematised unconfined aquifer depth aqdp hereafter at the end of the cold and wet season for 2020 2049 when precipitation increase is projected table 6 the behaviour is the same in the other two periods but shifted downwards negative yearly changes in all cases the spatial distribution of annual changes fig s4 shows that the most relevant changes occur in the two latter periods in the mountain areas while groundwater flow towards the valley reduces climate change effects table 6 shows that average yearly changes are negative regardless of the period considered overall average values equal to 2 1 2 9 and 4 3 respectively for 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 similar values are achieved in the irrigation period tables s12 s15 once more the most significant decrease is projected by nb simulations even though fig 12 highlights that almost all simulations agree in predicting aqdp reduction especially in the period 2070 2096 3 6 runoff in the schematisation proposed by the in strhym model surface runoff results from a saturation excess mechanism hence it strongly depends on soil saturation and the ability of groundwater to feed the river network therefore discharge q changes generally resemble those achieved for rz and aqdp and amplify them the annual reference value of the control period simulation driven by observations is approximately 14 m3s 1 table 7 and fig 13 highlight increasingly marked reductions from 2020 2049 to 2070 2096 such as for the previous variables the worst most significant reduction scenario is projected by the nb simulations looking at the sub yearly time scale on average the seasons with the highest percentage reductions are summer nb and ku and spring cs and qm tables s16 s19 the flow recession phase also due to the reduced contribution of snow melting is mainly affected by the projected climatic change enhancing water shortage issues in the irrigation period concerning the hadracm simulation table 7 and tables s16 s19 highlight a slight increase in the first future period but a more significant reduction in the following two compared to the average of projections this behaviour agrees with rz and aqdp variables for the same model however in addition to the evaluation of the annual or seasonal average changes which provide an idea of the available volumes it is also interesting to observe the variations in the discharge values daily frequency to verify whether a proportional change in the streamflow extremes both maximum and minimum is projected for this purpose the changes of some relevant flow percentiles were analysed flow percentile qn is the daily flow equal or exceeding for n of the time fig 14 shows the variability of q90 low flow reference value from the model driven by observations in the control period approximately equal to 0 8 m3s 1 q50 median flow reference value 5 3 m3s 1 and q10 high flow reference value 30 m3s 1 changes projected by the gcm rcm combinations percentage results for all models are reported in table s20 the primary outcome is that low flows q90 percentage reduction is more prominent than high flow q10 reduction in percentage overall discharge decrease induced by reduced precipitation and increased temperature affects more summer low flows due to missed wet season recharge than winter discharge peaks which in turn are mainly given by isolated high precipitation events interestingly in 2020 2049 the hadracm model black squares in fig 14 projects both q90 reductions and q10 increase with all the correction methods indicating more extreme low and high flow events 3 7 sources of uncertainty fig 15 shows the variance decomposition of uncertainties between gcm rcm projections and bias correction methods for the variables et rz aqdp and q yearly results highlight clearly that the gcm rcm combinations are the primary source of uncertainty the average value in the three future periods of the term nss gr varies from 74 8 with aqdp to 81 1 with et the variance attributed to the bias correction bc methods nss bc is equal to 8 5 3 3 overall while that due to interaction nss gr bc is slightly higher 13 4 1 7 even though there is no clear trend among the three future periods gcm rcm projections are responsible for a slightly greater variance in the first one next to the variance decomposition for all the available projections an uncertainty analysis is performed focusing only on the results achieved for bias correction methods i e cs ku and qm even though theoretically avoiding bias correction could be a reasonable option often it is unavoidable to allow proper use of rcms outputs in impact assessment studies therefore this further analysis allows isolating the effects of input data correction since previous results sections 3 2 to 3 6 highlighted the different nb projections behaviour the results achieved excluding the option of no bias correction slightly increase the role of gcm rcm projections nss gr varies from 78 0 aqdp to 83 5 q the variance related to bc methods decreases to 6 9 1 1 overall while that due to interactions remains almost the same 13 3 2 4 as explained in section 2 5 the large variety of gcm rcm combinations available allows further analysis of variance decomposition focusing on gcm or rcm contribution fig 16 shows the results achieved using the same gcm i e ichec ec earth in this case the sources of uncertainties are the rcm the bc methods or their interaction compared to the previous analysis involving both gcms and rcms the contribution to uncertainty due to the different rcms is much reduced the average nss rcm value in the three future periods varies from 37 3 q to 72 5 rz at the yearly scale the interaction term nss rcm bc increases overall average value of 30 1 23 8 while nss bc increases less 12 5 8 8 in particular the variance of q attributed exclusively to the rcms decreases significantly being the interaction term the greatest nss rcm bc almost always greater than 50 on the other hand excluding nb projections from the analysis cuts back bc contribution to the variance with nss bc reducing to 10 3 7 8 and nss rcm bc to 22 4 11 7 fig 17 considers model combinations always using the same rcm i e smhi rca4 therefore highlighting the effects on the uncertainty of the gcms only combined with the bc methods the results in this case are closer to those shown in fig 15 the average nss gcm value in the three future periods varies from 65 4 rz to 72 5 rz nevertheless the average nss bc increases reaching not negligible values considering all the projections overall average value of 17 3 7 4 reduced to 10 3 5 9 if nb projections are removed from the analysis 4 discussion our discussion will first focus on comparing the results of this study with other climate change projections in the mediterranean area primarily southern italy and then on the uncertainty analysis and the impact of different bias correction methods 4 1 comparison with other climate change studies our precipitation and temperature projections providing less evident precipitation decrease than temperature increase are consistent with other studies performed in the mediterranean basin e g zittis et al 2019 which use different cordex domains at a spatial resolution of 50 km specifically the mediterranean areas for which more significant rainfall reductions are expected are north western africa and the eastern mediterranean at the same time the central north mediterranean lies in the borders of a kind of transition zone where projections are more uncertain tuel and eltahir 2020 in their previous study in the crati river basin senatore et al 2011 considered sres a2 and a1b scenarios comparing the future period 2070 2099 to the reference period 1961 1990 they also found a moderate decrease in cumulative yearly precipitation and a more marked temperature increase concerning snow we found reductions varying from 50 to 70 from 2020 2049 to 2070 2096 respectively table 3 in their previous study on the same area senatore et al 2011 estimated decreases ranging from 82 to 92 no other examples of snow projection at the catchment scale in southern italy are available to our knowledge di sante et al 2021 project relevant snow reductions in the central and eastern mediterranean using euro cordex cmip5 and cmip6 simulations but their analysis is at a lower resolution higher detail studies focusing on spanish mountain ranges highlight reductions like those achieved in the crati catchment collados lara et al 2019 using rcp8 5 and considering the future period 2071 2100 found a mean reduction in the area covered by the snow of 60 in spanish sierra nevada lópez moreno et al 2017 using both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 found reductions varying from 40 to 60 in the sierra nevada and the pyrenees by 2050 regarding et we projected mean annual changes ranging from 4 2 ipsrca4 cs 2070 2096 to 8 1 eceracmr12 nb 2070 2096 tables s4 s7 senatore et al 2011 also found results for the period 2070 2099 that disagreed concerning the sign of the projected change at the yearly scale with variations ranging from 8 3 to 2 5 nevertheless all models projected sharp negative changes during the summer months perra et al 2018 focusing on a sardinian catchment considering the sres a1b emission scenario and the future period 2041 2070 generally four of the five hydrological models used found et reductions up to 12 especially during summertime pumo et al 2016 focused their analysis on reference evapotranspiration for small catchments in sicily and periods 2045 2065 and 2081 2100 finding percentage increments in the range from 0 35 rcp4 5 to 8 2 rcp8 5 in general all results related to southern italy agree in projecting an increasing inability of the actual evapotranspiration flow to match the potential demand particularly during the summer months this behaviour is due to drier soil conditions than the reference period in their projections of root zone soil moisture senatore et al 2011 found an unequivocal reduction in the crati river basin ranging from 13 to 21 more intense than in this study from 7 6 to 9 5 in 2070 2096 on average table 5 with not negligible reduction even in wintertime the simulations performed by perra et al 2018 also showed a reduction of the soil water content at 1 m depth for the future period approximately 9 on the other hand pumo et al 2016 found different intensities of climate change effects in the analysed non perennial catchments since soil hydraulic characteristics can mitigate the impact of the meteorological forcing finally d oria et al 2019 in their analysis concerning northern tuscany scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 and periods ranging from 2030 to 2060 highlighted that reduced soil moisture reflects not only in reduced et but also reduced percolation previous projections on groundwater storage achieved by senatore et al 2011 in the crati river basin showed reductions varying from 7 to 12 these reductions are sharper than projected in this study from 3 7 to 5 5 in 2070 2096 on average table 6 similarly to rz in their study area in tuscany d oria et al 2019 estimated percolation volume variations of 3 3 in 2031 2040 and 8 1 in 2051 2060 pumo et al 2016 showed that climate change effects could reduce subsurface flow contribution in small mediterranean catchments another result concerning the italian territory even though not addressing an area with mediterranean climate was shown by citrini et al 2020 which projected ensemble mean discharges for a pre alpine karst spring lower than observations 3 23 despite the not clear trend in precipitation both there and in the analysed case study even slightly increased annual precipitation cannot balance increases in evapotranspiration rates finally concerning surface runoff projection results in agreement with previous literature highlight that the problem of water scarcity connected to low flows will be particularly emphasised senatore et al 2011 projected average yearly reductions varying from 25 to 41 in the same basin we found from 15 5 to 19 1 in 2070 2096 on average table 7 perra et al 2018 estimated average decreases of 31 in their sardinian catchment while d oria et al 2019 found for their catchment in tuscany that the decrease in the streamflow volume is two times the precipitation decrease peres et al 2019 estimated a significant reduction of future inflow in one of the most critical sicilian reservoirs similar runoff reductions were projected in other northern mediterranean regions e g between 10 and 30 through the 21st century in spain estrela et al 2012 such an increasing drying scenario requires adequate tools for planning e g maiolo et al 2017 and emergency management e g mendicino and versace 2007 on the other hand both the results of this study and previous projections show that in the analysed area it is also necessary to continue keeping the flood risk under control since high flows will not decrease as much in general comparison with existing literature shows that this study confirms the trends previously detected even though some previous sharp projections are smoothed the overall drying scenario is the most likely 4 2 uncertainty analysis and impact of bias correction methods the results achieved with the uncertainty analysis further support the assumption that the primary source is the gcm chen et al 2013 ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 which is responsible for approximately the 80 of the total uncertainty the main ccs features do not change significantly considering the whole ensemble whether a bias correction method is applied or not nevertheless comparisons between the nb and the bias correction methods outcomes unequivocally show that bias correction reduces the projected hydrological impact of the changing climate forcing especially on river runoff with this variable the average decrease of yearly discharge with nb is about 3 higher than the average of the results achieved with the bias correction methods in every future period table 7 this result agrees with previous literature and can be generalised limiting the analysis on rcm and bc methods i e using the same gcm fig 16 the uncertainties associated with these two components are more comparable with the latter even prevailing during the irrigation period not shown when low flows occur this result holds either considering or not the nb option with the overall uncertainty attributable to the rcm varying from 57 including nb in the anova to 67 excluding nb in particular the interaction term contributes to total uncertainty up to 30 and is particularly relevant for runoff this outcome agrees with recent studies highlighting the effects of combined climate model drivers and bias correction techniques aryal et al 2019 meresa et al 2021 and can also be generalised to explain the more substantial influence of both bc derived and bc rcm interaction derived uncertainty on q it should be considered that streamflow results from the combined effect of other processes namely snow melting interception infiltration evapotranspiration and baseflow the in strhym framework assuming a saturation excess mechanism follows this assumption the analysis performed in this study addresses only a tiny portion of the overall cascade of uncertainty concerning the projection of climate change hydrological impact virtually the investigation could be extended almost indefinitely starting from the choice of the rcp e g the debated rcp8 5 which is the closest to reality for some authors schwalm et al 2020 highly unlikely for others hausfather and peters 2020 nevertheless the detailed analysis of a given model generation becomes less critical when a new model generation with improved capabilities comes out whereby the previously defined hierarchy of problems could be significantly changed e g the new generation of cmip6 earth system models portends improved simulations fernandez granja et al 2021 while convection permitting rcms should assure higher accuracy on rainfall extremes projections yu et al 2020 5 conclusions in this study we performed an uncertainty evaluation of the modelling chain to assess the climate change hydrological impact the interested portion of the chain included the gcm rcm combinations and bias correction methods the exercise was demonstrated in the crati river basin southern italy considering the rcp4 5 scenario 6 gcms and 5 high resolution 0 11 rcms were used in 15 combinations available through the euro cordex project furthermore precipitation and temperature data derived from the rcms and used as input for the hydrological model in strhym were uncorrected and corrected using three different bias correction methods the simulations performed considering all the available options led to 60 hydrological projections for three future periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 such projections allowed a detailed analysis of the projected trends of many meteo hydrological quantities and the evaluation of the contribution of different sources to the total predicted uncertainty of the projected variables concerning the amplitude and the uncertainty of the projected climate change signal precipitation projections indicate an increasing reduction in average even though simulations results are not unanimous on the other hand uncorrected projections of temperature unambiguously indicate a continuously increasing trend snow accumulation will reduce approximately from 50 to 70 regardless of the bc method used actual et will increase in the range of 0 5 to 2 even though there is partial model disagreement especially in the period 2070 2096 root zone soil moisture and groundwater storage simulations unequivocally project yearly reductions in the range of 4 to 9 5 and 1 5 to 5 5 respectively finally for runoff data models substantially agree on mean future reduction up to 19 1 in 2070 2096 projecting more frequent low flows and persisting high flows concerning the analysis of the relative contribution of different sources of uncertainty the relative effect of the bc methods compared with the overall gcm rcm modelling chain is generally small mainly due to the great influence of the gcm choice on the other hand the relative effect of the bc methods compared with the rcms only is more notable with an increasing impact of the interactions between bc methods and rcms furthermore it is shown that applying a bias correction method to the climate forcing produces a smoothing of the projected water resources reduction particularly concerning river runoff overall this study confirms the decreasing trend of projected water resources availability in the crati river basin with unprecedented detail furthermore it demonstrates that i multimodel approach especially concerning gcms is crucial for evaluating the uncertainty of the projected hydrological impact of climate change ii the bc methods do not modify the main features of the projected climate change signal substantially but their effects are not negligible especially when the analysis focuses on specific hydrological variables such as river runoff credit authorship contribution statement

2011 2012 and chen et al 2013 theoretically cfs can be calculated for each cell of the domain however since the basin under study is relatively small and the daily precipitation series in each domain cell are highly correlated the computational effort is reduced by calculating the correction coefficients based on the daily observed and simulated precipitation averaged in the whole contributing area further simplification concerns daily temperature data whose future projections are largely beyond the range of the reference period though the original qm method themeßl et al 2011 2012 allows temperature corrections extrapolating corrected values in these conditions would require the definition of theoretical distributions chen et al 2013 with related problems concerning the fitting process and a substantial loss of information compared to empirical distributions therefore in this study the corrected temperature combined with the qm corrected precipitation for hydrological simulations is achieved with the ku method appendix b supporting information supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10 1016 j ejrh 2022 101120 these

7887,study region crati river basin southern italy central mediterranean study focus we evaluate the combined effect of multiple global and regional climate model gcm rcm combinations and bias correction bc methods on the hydrological impact of projected climate change under the representative concentration pathway rcp4 5 15 euro cordex members combining 6 gcms and five high resolution 0 11 rcms provide the meteorological input for a spatially distributed hydrological model rcm derived input data are uncorrected and corrected through three empirical methods leading to 60 different simulations for three 30 year future periods in 2020 2096 compared to the baseline 1975 2005 the combined uncertainty of the climate models and correction methods is evaluated for the main hydrological variables using an analysis of variance anova method new hydrological insights for the region results highlight a considerable agreement in projecting a decreasing trend of available water resources on average 70 for snow 8 for root zone soil moisture and 17 for river runoff in the period 2070 2096 due to the remarkable mean temperature increase and less accentuated precipitation reduction the uncertainty evaluation shows that 1 the primary source of uncertainty is the driving gcm and 2 bc methods smooth the projected hydrological impact in a not negligible way especially concerning discharge for each future period the reduction projected without bias correction is about 3 higher than with bc therefore contributing to the total uncertainty graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrological impact gcm rcm combinations change factor bias correction anova mediterranean catchments 1 introduction the studies on the hydrological impact of climate change must cope with the uncertainty arising from the complex modelling chain leading to hydrological projections a cascade of uncertainty proceeds from the envisaged future socio economic scenarios and related greenhouse gas emissions down to the modelling of adaptation responses wilby and dessai 2010 in the middle further high uncertainty arises from the structure and parameterisation of the models used at different resolutions to project climate change from the global climate models gcms to statistical or dynamical through regional climate models rcms downscaling methods down to the hydrological models dobler et al 2012 gobiet et al 2014 in the last decade several studies investigated the uncertainty linked to model projections analysing the interactions of the single sources of uncertainty and evaluating the relative weight of each source see ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 for a review while most analyses consistently recognised gcms as the primary sources of uncertainty chen et al 2013 there is no general agreement about the relative importance of the other components of the modelling chain to assess the hydrological impact especially in small to medium size catchments maximum area in the order of 103 km2 downscaling the coarse resolution information provided by gcms is an inevitable step dynamical downscaling methods i e rcms use consistently the same fundamental physical principles driving the gcms gutmann et al 2012 furthermore comprehensive investigation of the interrelated uncertainties descending from gcms to rcms is supported by the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex giorgi et al 2009 giorgi and gutowski 2015 an intercomparison project focused on regional modelling which addresses specific world regions with targeted initiatives like e g euro cordex jacob et al 2014 dealing with the european continent despite their capability of providing physically based high resolution information about all the climate variables simulated by gcms rcms performances are subject to some limitations such limitations must be considered when these models are intended for further use in impact studies e g xie et al 2015 maraun et al 2010 maraun 2013 senatore et al 2011 mascaro et al 2018 therefore the most relevant rcm variables used as inputs need corrections through a proper strategy for hydrological studies ho et al 2012 identified two main calibration pathways in the change factor and the bias correction approaches with the former observations are modified with the modelled climate change signal ccs to derive future scenarios while with the latter future projections are corrected using the model bias calculated against observations despite this distinction in practice many authors refer to change factor methods as particular bias correction methods e g teutschbein and seibert 2013 therefore hereafter we will refer to bias correction including also change factor methods furthermore according to potter et al 2020 bias correction methods can be grouped in scaling or change factor methods and either non parametric empirical or parametric distributional quantile quantile mapping qqm the assumptions on which the different bias correction approaches rely are debatable many studies addressed basic questions concerning their effects and potential benefits e g maraun et al 2017 the main concerns regard the physical justification of applying such methods ehret et al 2012 whether bias correction can be applied directly to gcms ngai et al 2017 and the possibility of application for non stationary conditions teutschbein and seibert 2013 likewise it is debated to what extent bias correction provides a more consistent representation of river runoff for the past and how much it acts as a source of uncertainty affecting the estimation of future change in hydrological indicators muerth et al 2013 including extreme values willkofer et al 2018 furthermore some techniques could not correctly preserve changes in quantiles and extremes cannon et al 2015 or could affect modelled runoff teng et al 2015 finally further uncertainty can arise from the accuracy of the observational datasets on which bias correction relies kim et al 2015 and the periods used for calibration chen et al 2015 gampe et al 2019 bias correction methods represent another source of uncertainty in the framework of the overall modelling chain under non stationary conditions therefore the impact of the choice of different bias correction methods on hydrological output is being increasingly investigated e g chen et al 2013 muerth et al 2013 huang et al 2014 fang et al 2015 teng et al 2015 seaby et al 2015 johnson and sharma 2015 li et al 2019 also with the aid of techniques for the analysis of the variance al aamery et al 2016 aryal et al 2019 ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 meresa et al 2021 lee et al 2022 such an impact on the relative climate change signal is generally weak but some studies e g johnson and sharma 2015 al aamery et al 2016 found that bias correction mitigates the change projected by raw model simulations others e g aryal et al 2019 or meresa et al 2021 highlighted the contribution to the total uncertainty of combined driving climate models and bias correction methods uncertainty evaluation of future projections is particularly relevant for highly vulnerable regions to climate change such as the mediterranean basin giorgi and lionello 2008 ipcc 2014 garrote et al 2015 cramer et al 2018 tuel and eltahir 2020 which is mainly affected by drought risk cook et al 2014 hoegh guldberg et al 2018 tramblay et al 2020 in this area anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are likely contributing to an increase in the occurrence of dry spells enhancing this trend with ever higher levels of global warming gudmundsson et al 2017 the consequences on the hydrological cycle of the observed and projected change in the precipitation and temperature regimes in the mediterranean affect the whole ecosystem and consequently essential socio economic activities like drinking water distribution un 2021 maiolo et al 2017 food production fao 2016 ronco et al 2017 or preparedness to hydrometeorological extremes madsen et al 2014 therefore in the last years the climate change impact studies dealing with the projected hydrological variability in mediterranean catchments has increased tremendously addressing either the whole region e g hertig and tramblay 2016 hartmann et al 2017 or smaller areas e g spain estrela et al 2012 majone et al 2012 olmos giménez et al 2016 france lafaysse et al 2014 prats et al 2018 dayon et al 2018 northern africa beyene et al 2010 sellami et al 2016 taïbi et al 2019 hadour et al 2020 greece tigkas et al 2012 koutroulis et al 2013

2019 peres et al 2019 citrini et al 2020 this study aims to contribute to the ongoing debate about uncertainty in projecting climate change hydrological impact addressing the portion of the overall modelling chain composed by the global and regional models and further bias correction which is applied to both precipitation and temperature the main input variables of several hydrological models our fundamental exercise is demonstrated in the crati river basin a typical mediterranean catchment located in southern italy the hydrological impact analysis under climate change in this basin was already performed by senatore et al 2011 considering three rcms and the period 2070 2099 with sres emission scenarios nakícenovíc et al 2000 in this study the climate change scenario ensemble includes 15 members deriving from the combination of 6 gcms and 5 high resolution 0 11 rcms in the framework of the euro cordex project the variables of interest are uncorrected and corrected through three bias correction methods representative of change factor scaling and quantile quantile mapping methods and then used as the input for the fully distributed intermediate space time resolution hydrological model in strhym senatore et al 2011 our previous study results are updated and enlarged because projected change under a representative concentration pathway rcp4 5 namely van vuuren et al 2011 spans the whole period from 2020 to 2096 subdivided into 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 furthermore they are generalisable in terms of uncertainty evaluation the extra level of uncertainty introduced by different correction methods is quantified and related for each 30 year scenario to that originated by the different gcm rcm combinations on several relevant variables such as groundwater and root zone water content evapotranspiration and river runoff 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study focuses on the crati river basin fig 1 the largest in the calabria region southern italy the analysed area is delimited by the sila plateau east and south and the tyrrhenian coastal chain west with the closing section north at the tarsia dam the average altitude of the study area determined on a 20 m resolution digital terrain model dtm is approximately 682 m a s l with a maximum of 1781 m a s l in the sila plateau and a minimum of 52 m a s l at the closing section the contributing area has an extension of 1280 km2 and a perimeter of about 190 km while the main river channel is 52 km long vegetation cover was considered constant during the whole study period even the future emphasising changes due only to ccs reference land cover was taken from the corine land cover 2000 project the primary land cover types in the basin are forests 43 with 26 broad leaved forest and agricultural areas 47 with 14 non irrigated arable land and 12 olive groves precipitation and temperature measurements are performed through a monitoring network of 33 rain gauges and 18 thermometers as for climate conditions according to the thornthwaite 1948 classification the crati river basin is characterised by a mediterranean climate from sub humid to hyper humid for the period 1975 2005 which is considered as the baseline for the evaluation of climate change scenarios the cumulative precipitation is approximately 1100 mm year 1 with monthly mean values ranging from a minimum of 27 mm month 1 in summer jja to a maximum of 142 mm month 1 in winter djf for the same period the average monthly temperature ranges from 5 c in winter to 21 c in summer with an average annual value of approximately 14 c 2 2 euro cordex rcms the meteorological variables used as input in the hydrological analysis for the projection of water resources variability i e precipitation temperature and net radiation are determined from the output of 15 rcms provided through the euro cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 in the framework of euro cordex several gcms derived from the cmip5 project coupled model intercomparison phase 5 taylor et al 2012 were dynamically downscaled rcms resolution is currently the highest for downscaling within cordex i e 0 11 since this study focuses on the uncertainty provided by different gcm rcm chains and bias correction methods only the output of the intermediate scenario rcp4 5 is selected this scenario reflects the more plausible outcomes given the current and pledged policies hausfather and peters 2020 for each of the 15 models simulations outputs in the control period 1975 2005 and projection period 2020 2096 are used table 1 shows the models used renamed through an acronym consisting of three letters referring to the gcm name and four to the rcm name furthermore when more than one ensemble member belongs to the same gcm rcm combination the suffix r an abbreviation for realisation followed by a number given by the institute running the gcms is used 2 3 the hydrological model in strhym the hydrological analysis is conducted using the in strhym model intermediate space time resolution hydrological model senatore et al 2011 in strhym is a fully distributed hydrological model developed to analyse hydrological processes on small medium sized mediterranean basins designed to work at intermediate spatial and temporal resolutions 1 km and 24 h respectively particularly suitable for long range analyses it reproduces all the main surface and subsurface hydrological processes i e snow accumulation and melting following the scheme proposed by the swat model neitsch et al 2002 which distinguishes rainfall and snow depending on a threshold temperature interception kriestensen and jensen 1975 infiltration and soil water redistribution along the soil column using a gravitational method which allows water movement along the root zone an unsaturated layer below the root zone and the water table exfiltration and runoff generation actual evapotranspiration using the approach proposed by allen et al 1998 with a crop coefficient and a water stress coefficient accounting for land cover type and the actual root zone water content respectively furthermore contributions from vegetated and bare soil are separated and the reference evapotranspiration is calculated following priestley and taylor 1972 base flow routing following a two dimensional approach and surface and sub surface flow routing kinematic cascade approach therefore the model output provides daily maps of snow accumulation evapotranspiration root zone soil moisture and storage in an idealised near surface groundwater layer and the simulated runoff at the closing section as a time series in strhym was calibrated for the crati river basin over available daily discharge values at the closing section during 1961 1966 achieving a nash sutcliffe coefficient value of 0 83 senatore et al 2011 subsequent validation over the periods 1969 1971 and 2004 2006 no other discharge data are available led to nash sutcliffe coefficient values of 0 64 and 0 57 respectively this study s original model was updated by migrating the code from visual basic using map window gis activex control extension to python with gdal ogr geospatial data abstraction software library the new version of the model allows for more efficient parallelised calculations the model s meteorological input data is provided through spatial interpolating point values acquired by either the observational network or the rcms in the latter cells centres falling within and in the neighbouring of the study area are considered the daily maps of precipitation are achieved through spline interpolations temperature maps are obtained by integrating the spline interpolation with daily elevation dependent regressions thus accounting for the influence of the orography concerning net radiation rcm values are determined from the balance of the incident and reflected short and long wave radiations and then interpolated in the same way as precipitation at the same time the output from a modified version of a model by moore et al 1993 replaces missing observations due to the lack of measurements this variable is not bias corrected further details about interpolation methods and other input parameters are provided by senatore et al 2011 the meteorological input grids are returned at a resolution of 1 km both for the reference 1975 2005 and projection periods 2020 2096 2 4 bias correction methods considering both uncorrected nb meaning no bias correction and corrected rcms precipitation and temperature fields the hydrological projections are performed three approaches are used for correction namely 1 the constant scaling method cs mpelasoka and chiew 2009 chen et al 2011 chen et al 2013 a change factor approach 2 the method proposed by kunstmann et al 2004 abbreviated with ku hereafter which can be classified as a scaling bias correction method and 3 a non parametric quantile mapping method qm wilks 1995 themeßl et al 2011 2012 chen et al 2013 these methods are briefly detailed in appendix a 2 5 uncertainty evaluation the variability produced by the use of 15 gcm rcm combinations and 4 change factor bias correction approaches including no correction in the crati river basin is evaluated through the comparison of the 60 projected changes time averaged variables in evapotranspiration root zone water content groundwater and river runoff in the three future periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 considering the whole year the irrigation period april september and the four seasons i e djf mam jja and son comparisons for all variables are performed by computing the percentage differences defined as the ratio between 1 the differences of the variable in future scenarios and the control period and 2 the variable in the control period furthermore the contribution of the two different sources of uncertainty to the total predicted uncertainty of the projected variables is evaluated through an analysis of variance method anova following the methodology proposed by ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 first for each variable the total sum of squared errors sse is determined 1 sse i 1 n gr j 1 n bc x ij x oo 2 where n gr 15 is the number of combined gcm rcm projections used n bc 4 the number of bias correction methods x ij the value of the hydrological variable x corresponding to the gcm rcm i and the correction method j and finally x oo is the overall mean sse can be considered as the sum of single contributions to errors given by gcm rcm combinations ss gr bias correction methods ss bc and their interaction ss gr bc 2 sse ss gr ss bc ss gr bc 3 ss gr n bc i 1 n gr x io x oo 2 4 ss bc n gr j 1 n bc x oj x oo 2 5 ss gr bc i 1 n gr j 1 n bc x ij x io x oj x oo 2 the subscript o is used in the previous equations when the average over a specific i or j index is indicated to avoid biases in the results of uncertainty decomposition due to the different sizes of gr and bc populations 15 and 4 respectively the approach of bosshard et al 2013 is followed according to this methodology all the 1365 possible combinations of 4 i e the bc population size out of 15 gcm rcm projections are sampled then for each 4 member sample set m out of 1365 the terms ss gr m ss bc m and ss gr bc m are calculated using eqs 3 5 in this case n gr 4 and their ratios against the corresponding sse m are averaged over the whole sample set to achieve the unbiased variance fraction nss related to each of the single contributions to errors 6 nss u 1 1365 m 1 1365 ss u m sse m u gr ed gr bc the variance decomposition is applied to all the projected hydrological variables for the three future periods furthermore thanks to the flexibility of the method two subsets of euro cordex projections characterised by the coupling of the same gcm with different rcms and vice versa are also analysed to provide insights concerning the separated contribution to uncertainty of gcms and rcms specifically two experiments were performed one involving four projections with the same gcm namely ececclm ecehirh eceracm and ecerca4 sharing the ichec ec earth gcm table 1 and one involving the same rcm namely cm5rca4 ecerca4 hadrca4 and mpirca4 sharing the smhi rca4 rcm table 1 3 results 3 1 precipitation and temperature precipitation and temperature mean values provided by each rcm for the entire projection period 2020 2096 are divided into three different 30 year intervals 2020 2049 2040 2069 2070 2096 compared with the reference period 1975 2005 changes are evaluated with respect to the reference period for each rcm without considering any bias correction techniques precipitation is analysed in percentage variation and temperature as deviation from the reference period the analysis is performed from a single month to a yearly scale the box and whiskers plots in figs 2 and 3 show the monthly variability in the projected rcm outputs for each model the spatially averaged values are considered concerning precipitation fig 2 for most of the months in all the three periods the models project reductions on average black dots except for march november and partially january and february which typically are rainy months in the mediterranean climate however in no months did all the models agree on reductions starting from a reference annual value of 1124 mm yearly variations range from 9 4 to 4 8 in 2020 2049 from 8 5 to 2 6 in 2040 2069 and from 15 9 to 2 1 in 2070 2096 projected yearly changes are positive in 4 1 and 1 cases out of 15 in 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 respectively table s1 goes into details about yearly irrigation period and seasonal variations showing that in general for each season and period considerable decreases are projected the temperature change signal is much clearer than the precipitation change signal fig 3 shows that a temperature increase is expected in all cases all models all periods all months with higher growth in summer and moving into the future starting form a reference annual value of 12 1 c yearly variations range from 0 9 c to 1 9 c in 2020 2049 from 1 2 c to 2 5 c in 2040 2069 and from 1 7 c to 3 1 c in 2070 2096 in summer jja reference value of 20 2 c the temperature increase is projected up to 3 9 c in 2070 2096 the reliability of the climate projections can be linked to models skills in reproducing the current climate based on this assumption weighting procedures can be used to prioritise the most accurate models e g senatore et al 2019 none of the models used in this study can perfectly reproduce the reference period s average conditions fig 4 shows the uncertainty of precipitation simulations some of which cannot fully represent the typical seasonal variability of the mediterranean climate and also shows the substantial temperature underestimation of all models table 2 shows some performance indices calculated monthly the models with the best performances concerning precipitation i e eceracmr12 with the lowest mean absolute error mae and the highest coefficient of determination r2 and hadracm with the lowest absolute bias are not within the best models considering the temperature these results consistent with the analysis performed by peres et al 2020 with a broader ensemble of euro cordex models for a larger area of southern italy highlight the inaccuracies and uncertainties of the gcm rcm combinations in reproducing the current climate and solicits the use of bias correction methods these techniques are applied to the precipitation and temperature fields before their use as input in the hydrological model whose results are shown in the following sections 3 2 snow starting from this section on snow projections and for the following ones dedicated to specific hydrological variables results are presented considering the whole set of available models to account for the global uncertainty of the climate change projections concurrently we also focus on a single model to provide an example of the space time variations due to the bias correction methods our choice on which projection to use as an example fell on the hadracm model which is the one with the lowest precipitation bias compared to observations table 2 a comparison of the mean monthly evolution of the main components of the water balance as simulated by the hadracm model with and without bias correction and the corresponding results achieved with the calibrated hydrologic model forced by observations in the control period 1975 2005 is provided as supplementary material fig s1 while in the following percentage changes are shown fig s1 also provides absolute values as a reference furthermore the annual means of the variables achieved with observation forcing are provided in the main text snow accumulation in snow water equivalent units projections mainly pertain to the winter months fig 5 shows the average daily percentage decrease in the three periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 2070 2096 compared with the reference period 1975 2005 using the hadracm model some spikes can be noted in the curves especially at the very beginning and end of the cold season because of numeric issues i e the absolute values of accumulated snow are minimal still they do not overshadow the primary trend the reduction across the three periods is evident mainly due to temperature increases the simulations using the uncorrected precipitation and temperature fields labelled with nb provide a less pronounced but still relevant reduction in contrast the ku and qm simulations which use the same correction for temperature show somewhat similar behaviour fig 6 focuses on the average spatial distribution of the decrease for the same model hadracm with different corrections and periods the main differences concern the period 2020 2049 nb simulation projects a lower decline in the high altitude areas especially the sila plateau in the east in contrast ku and qm simulations project a lower decrease in the valley where snow accumulation is already low in the reference period the outcomes are more consistent for the other future periods with the nb simulations projecting a slightly lower decrease on the mountains agreeing with fig 5 a summary of yearly snow accumulation percentage changes concerning both hadracm and the average of all the 15 models is shown in table 3 detailed information for each model is provided in table s3 models trends are consistent with projected decreases starting from a spatially averaged reference annual value of snow water equivalent in the basin of 65 mm of approximately 50 60 and 70 in the periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 respectively hadracm projects a more remarkable decrease especially in 2070 2096 with the cs simulations in general models agreement is confirmed by the not too high variability of the outputs total standard deviation values lower than 15 for every period of course no model in any scenario projects snow accumulation increase 3 3 evapotranspiration fig 7 shows the average daily percentage changes of actual evapotranspiration et with hadracm as summarised by table 4 an et increase is projected for every correction method and every period in particular et increases in 2020 2049 where both precipitation and temperature increase is projected and in 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 where only temperature increase is projected despite the increasing temperatures a lower et increase in 2070 2096 than 2040 2069 indicates higher water stress i e less water available for evapotranspiration due to reduced precipitation the yearly et increase is generally uniformly distributed in space even though it is slightly more pronounced in 2070 2096 on the eastern side fig s2 the same increasing trend found at the yearly scale occurs in the irrigation april september period and even in summer tables s4 s7 except in 2070 2096 where et decrease is projected with all bias correction methods this behaviour is due to increased water shortage highlighting higher water stress for the vegetation the yearly average trend of all models is positive like hadracm but less pronounced table 4 the nb simulations almost always provide the highest average increase the annual reference value for the control period is approximately 740 mm all projections for all models and correction methods considering the whole year are shown in fig 8 models outputs are consistent at the yearly scale for 2020 2049 and 2040 2069 et increase is projected by 70 and 72 of the simulations respectively higher uncertainty was found for 2070 2096 et increase projected by 58 of the simulations et reduction is further amplified during the summer months where the average change of et projected by all models is negative in all periods up to 4 4 in 2070 2096 tables s4 s7 3 4 root zone soil moisture the increase of et induced by the temperature rise causes a reduction in soil moisture in the first layers namely in the root zone even in those simulations like hadracm in 2020 2049 that do not project a reduction in precipitation fig 9 shows for hadracm but the same behaviour persists for all simulations slightly negative or even positive changes of the root zone soil moisture rz during winter months due to the upper constraint given by the saturated conditions wet months precipitation combined with lower et values increases rz close to saturation so that at the end of the winter the highest values are reached anyway then the increased temperature causes a more robust reduction in the warmer and drier summer months implying yearly reductions varying from approximately 2 2020 2049 to 9 2070 2096 table 5 the spatial distribution of the yearly rz generally follows that of et fig s3 expanding the analysis to the whole ensemble table 5 shows that for all periods and correction methods average reductions are projected yearly with overall average values of 4 5 5 8 and 8 2 respectively for the periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 slightly higher percentages are achieved for the irrigation period tables s8 s11 in agreement with et outcomes the most significant decrease is projected by nb simulations simulations outputs are highly consistent in projecting reduction yearly fig 10 and seasonal tables s8 s11 3 5 groundwater storage the in strhym model accounts for downward water flow from the unsaturated zone towards the saturated zone as soon as the water content in the former is higher than the field capacity this condition occurs relatively often during wintertime even with reduced precipitation fig 11 shows that with hadracm winter recharge allows positive changes in the schematised unconfined aquifer depth aqdp hereafter at the end of the cold and wet season for 2020 2049 when precipitation increase is projected table 6 the behaviour is the same in the other two periods but shifted downwards negative yearly changes in all cases the spatial distribution of annual changes fig s4 shows that the most relevant changes occur in the two latter periods in the mountain areas while groundwater flow towards the valley reduces climate change effects table 6 shows that average yearly changes are negative regardless of the period considered overall average values equal to 2 1 2 9 and 4 3 respectively for 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 similar values are achieved in the irrigation period tables s12 s15 once more the most significant decrease is projected by nb simulations even though fig 12 highlights that almost all simulations agree in predicting aqdp reduction especially in the period 2070 2096 3 6 runoff in the schematisation proposed by the in strhym model surface runoff results from a saturation excess mechanism hence it strongly depends on soil saturation and the ability of groundwater to feed the river network therefore discharge q changes generally resemble those achieved for rz and aqdp and amplify them the annual reference value of the control period simulation driven by observations is approximately 14 m3s 1 table 7 and fig 13 highlight increasingly marked reductions from 2020 2049 to 2070 2096 such as for the previous variables the worst most significant reduction scenario is projected by the nb simulations looking at the sub yearly time scale on average the seasons with the highest percentage reductions are summer nb and ku and spring cs and qm tables s16 s19 the flow recession phase also due to the reduced contribution of snow melting is mainly affected by the projected climatic change enhancing water shortage issues in the irrigation period concerning the hadracm simulation table 7 and tables s16 s19 highlight a slight increase in the first future period but a more significant reduction in the following two compared to the average of projections this behaviour agrees with rz and aqdp variables for the same model however in addition to the evaluation of the annual or seasonal average changes which provide an idea of the available volumes it is also interesting to observe the variations in the discharge values daily frequency to verify whether a proportional change in the streamflow extremes both maximum and minimum is projected for this purpose the changes of some relevant flow percentiles were analysed flow percentile qn is the daily flow equal or exceeding for n of the time fig 14 shows the variability of q90 low flow reference value from the model driven by observations in the control period approximately equal to 0 8 m3s 1 q50 median flow reference value 5 3 m3s 1 and q10 high flow reference value 30 m3s 1 changes projected by the gcm rcm combinations percentage results for all models are reported in table s20 the primary outcome is that low flows q90 percentage reduction is more prominent than high flow q10 reduction in percentage overall discharge decrease induced by reduced precipitation and increased temperature affects more summer low flows due to missed wet season recharge than winter discharge peaks which in turn are mainly given by isolated high precipitation events interestingly in 2020 2049 the hadracm model black squares in fig 14 projects both q90 reductions and q10 increase with all the correction methods indicating more extreme low and high flow events 3 7 sources of uncertainty fig 15 shows the variance decomposition of uncertainties between gcm rcm projections and bias correction methods for the variables et rz aqdp and q yearly results highlight clearly that the gcm rcm combinations are the primary source of uncertainty the average value in the three future periods of the term nss gr varies from 74 8 with aqdp to 81 1 with et the variance attributed to the bias correction bc methods nss bc is equal to 8 5 3 3 overall while that due to interaction nss gr bc is slightly higher 13 4 1 7 even though there is no clear trend among the three future periods gcm rcm projections are responsible for a slightly greater variance in the first one next to the variance decomposition for all the available projections an uncertainty analysis is performed focusing only on the results achieved for bias correction methods i e cs ku and qm even though theoretically avoiding bias correction could be a reasonable option often it is unavoidable to allow proper use of rcms outputs in impact assessment studies therefore this further analysis allows isolating the effects of input data correction since previous results sections 3 2 to 3 6 highlighted the different nb projections behaviour the results achieved excluding the option of no bias correction slightly increase the role of gcm rcm projections nss gr varies from 78 0 aqdp to 83 5 q the variance related to bc methods decreases to 6 9 1 1 overall while that due to interactions remains almost the same 13 3 2 4 as explained in section 2 5 the large variety of gcm rcm combinations available allows further analysis of variance decomposition focusing on gcm or rcm contribution fig 16 shows the results achieved using the same gcm i e ichec ec earth in this case the sources of uncertainties are the rcm the bc methods or their interaction compared to the previous analysis involving both gcms and rcms the contribution to uncertainty due to the different rcms is much reduced the average nss rcm value in the three future periods varies from 37 3 q to 72 5 rz at the yearly scale the interaction term nss rcm bc increases overall average value of 30 1 23 8 while nss bc increases less 12 5 8 8 in particular the variance of q attributed exclusively to the rcms decreases significantly being the interaction term the greatest nss rcm bc almost always greater than 50 on the other hand excluding nb projections from the analysis cuts back bc contribution to the variance with nss bc reducing to 10 3 7 8 and nss rcm bc to 22 4 11 7 fig 17 considers model combinations always using the same rcm i e smhi rca4 therefore highlighting the effects on the uncertainty of the gcms only combined with the bc methods the results in this case are closer to those shown in fig 15 the average nss gcm value in the three future periods varies from 65 4 rz to 72 5 rz nevertheless the average nss bc increases reaching not negligible values considering all the projections overall average value of 17 3 7 4 reduced to 10 3 5 9 if nb projections are removed from the analysis 4 discussion our discussion will first focus on comparing the results of this study with other climate change projections in the mediterranean area primarily southern italy and then on the uncertainty analysis and the impact of different bias correction methods 4 1 comparison with other climate change studies our precipitation and temperature projections providing less evident precipitation decrease than temperature increase are consistent with other studies performed in the mediterranean basin e g zittis et al 2019 which use different cordex domains at a spatial resolution of 50 km specifically the mediterranean areas for which more significant rainfall reductions are expected are north western africa and the eastern mediterranean at the same time the central north mediterranean lies in the borders of a kind of transition zone where projections are more uncertain tuel and eltahir 2020 in their previous study in the crati river basin senatore et al 2011 considered sres a2 and a1b scenarios comparing the future period 2070 2099 to the reference period 1961 1990 they also found a moderate decrease in cumulative yearly precipitation and a more marked temperature increase concerning snow we found reductions varying from 50 to 70 from 2020 2049 to 2070 2096 respectively table 3 in their previous study on the same area senatore et al 2011 estimated decreases ranging from 82 to 92 no other examples of snow projection at the catchment scale in southern italy are available to our knowledge di sante et al 2021 project relevant snow reductions in the central and eastern mediterranean using euro cordex cmip5 and cmip6 simulations but their analysis is at a lower resolution higher detail studies focusing on spanish mountain ranges highlight reductions like those achieved in the crati catchment collados lara et al 2019 using rcp8 5 and considering the future period 2071 2100 found a mean reduction in the area covered by the snow of 60 in spanish sierra nevada lópez moreno et al 2017 using both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 found reductions varying from 40 to 60 in the sierra nevada and the pyrenees by 2050 regarding et we projected mean annual changes ranging from 4 2 ipsrca4 cs 2070 2096 to 8 1 eceracmr12 nb 2070 2096 tables s4 s7 senatore et al 2011 also found results for the period 2070 2099 that disagreed concerning the sign of the projected change at the yearly scale with variations ranging from 8 3 to 2 5 nevertheless all models projected sharp negative changes during the summer months perra et al 2018 focusing on a sardinian catchment considering the sres a1b emission scenario and the future period 2041 2070 generally four of the five hydrological models used found et reductions up to 12 especially during summertime pumo et al 2016 focused their analysis on reference evapotranspiration for small catchments in sicily and periods 2045 2065 and 2081 2100 finding percentage increments in the range from 0 35 rcp4 5 to 8 2 rcp8 5 in general all results related to southern italy agree in projecting an increasing inability of the actual evapotranspiration flow to match the potential demand particularly during the summer months this behaviour is due to drier soil conditions than the reference period in their projections of root zone soil moisture senatore et al 2011 found an unequivocal reduction in the crati river basin ranging from 13 to 21 more intense than in this study from 7 6 to 9 5 in 2070 2096 on average table 5 with not negligible reduction even in wintertime the simulations performed by perra et al 2018 also showed a reduction of the soil water content at 1 m depth for the future period approximately 9 on the other hand pumo et al 2016 found different intensities of climate change effects in the analysed non perennial catchments since soil hydraulic characteristics can mitigate the impact of the meteorological forcing finally d oria et al 2019 in their analysis concerning northern tuscany scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 and periods ranging from 2030 to 2060 highlighted that reduced soil moisture reflects not only in reduced et but also reduced percolation previous projections on groundwater storage achieved by senatore et al 2011 in the crati river basin showed reductions varying from 7 to 12 these reductions are sharper than projected in this study from 3 7 to 5 5 in 2070 2096 on average table 6 similarly to rz in their study area in tuscany d oria et al 2019 estimated percolation volume variations of 3 3 in 2031 2040 and 8 1 in 2051 2060 pumo et al 2016 showed that climate change effects could reduce subsurface flow contribution in small mediterranean catchments another result concerning the italian territory even though not addressing an area with mediterranean climate was shown by citrini et al 2020 which projected ensemble mean discharges for a pre alpine karst spring lower than observations 3 23 despite the not clear trend in precipitation both there and in the analysed case study even slightly increased annual precipitation cannot balance increases in evapotranspiration rates finally concerning surface runoff projection results in agreement with previous literature highlight that the problem of water scarcity connected to low flows will be particularly emphasised senatore et al 2011 projected average yearly reductions varying from 25 to 41 in the same basin we found from 15 5 to 19 1 in 2070 2096 on average table 7 perra et al 2018 estimated average decreases of 31 in their sardinian catchment while d oria et al 2019 found for their catchment in tuscany that the decrease in the streamflow volume is two times the precipitation decrease peres et al 2019 estimated a significant reduction of future inflow in one of the most critical sicilian reservoirs similar runoff reductions were projected in other northern mediterranean regions e g between 10 and 30 through the 21st century in spain estrela et al 2012 such an increasing drying scenario requires adequate tools for planning e g maiolo et al 2017 and emergency management e g mendicino and versace 2007 on the other hand both the results of this study and previous projections show that in the analysed area it is also necessary to continue keeping the flood risk under control since high flows will not decrease as much in general comparison with existing literature shows that this study confirms the trends previously detected even though some previous sharp projections are smoothed the overall drying scenario is the most likely 4 2 uncertainty analysis and impact of bias correction methods the results achieved with the uncertainty analysis further support the assumption that the primary source is the gcm chen et al 2013 ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 which is responsible for approximately the 80 of the total uncertainty the main ccs features do not change significantly considering the whole ensemble whether a bias correction method is applied or not nevertheless comparisons between the nb and the bias correction methods outcomes unequivocally show that bias correction reduces the projected hydrological impact of the changing climate forcing especially on river runoff with this variable the average decrease of yearly discharge with nb is about 3 higher than the average of the results achieved with the bias correction methods in every future period table 7 this result agrees with previous literature and can be generalised limiting the analysis on rcm and bc methods i e using the same gcm fig 16 the uncertainties associated with these two components are more comparable with the latter even prevailing during the irrigation period not shown when low flows occur this result holds either considering or not the nb option with the overall uncertainty attributable to the rcm varying from 57 including nb in the anova to 67 excluding nb in particular the interaction term contributes to total uncertainty up to 30 and is particularly relevant for runoff this outcome agrees with recent studies highlighting the effects of combined climate model drivers and bias correction techniques aryal et al 2019 meresa et al 2021 and can also be generalised to explain the more substantial influence of both bc derived and bc rcm interaction derived uncertainty on q it should be considered that streamflow results from the combined effect of other processes namely snow melting interception infiltration evapotranspiration and baseflow the in strhym framework assuming a saturation excess mechanism follows this assumption the analysis performed in this study addresses only a tiny portion of the overall cascade of uncertainty concerning the projection of climate change hydrological impact virtually the investigation could be extended almost indefinitely starting from the choice of the rcp e g the debated rcp8 5 which is the closest to reality for some authors schwalm et al 2020 highly unlikely for others hausfather and peters 2020 nevertheless the detailed analysis of a given model generation becomes less critical when a new model generation with improved capabilities comes out whereby the previously defined hierarchy of problems could be significantly changed e g the new generation of cmip6 earth system models portends improved simulations fernandez granja et al 2021 while convection permitting rcms should assure higher accuracy on rainfall extremes projections yu et al 2020 5 conclusions in this study we performed an uncertainty evaluation of the modelling chain to assess the climate change hydrological impact the interested portion of the chain included the gcm rcm combinations and bias correction methods the exercise was demonstrated in the crati river basin southern italy considering the rcp4 5 scenario 6 gcms and 5 high resolution 0 11 rcms were used in 15 combinations available through the euro cordex project furthermore precipitation and temperature data derived from the rcms and used as input for the hydrological model in strhym were uncorrected and corrected using three different bias correction methods the simulations performed considering all the available options led to 60 hydrological projections for three future periods 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2096 such projections allowed a detailed analysis of the projected trends of many meteo hydrological quantities and the evaluation of the contribution of different sources to the total predicted uncertainty of the projected variables concerning the amplitude and the uncertainty of the projected climate change signal precipitation projections indicate an increasing reduction in average even though simulations results are not unanimous on the other hand uncorrected projections of temperature unambiguously indicate a continuously increasing trend snow accumulation will reduce approximately from 50 to 70 regardless of the bc method used actual et will increase in the range of 0 5 to 2 even though there is partial model disagreement especially in the period 2070 2096 root zone soil moisture and groundwater storage simulations unequivocally project yearly reductions in the range of 4 to 9 5 and 1 5 to 5 5 respectively finally for runoff data models substantially agree on mean future reduction up to 19 1 in 2070 2096 projecting more frequent low flows and persisting high flows concerning the analysis of the relative contribution of different sources of uncertainty the relative effect of the bc methods compared with the overall gcm rcm modelling chain is generally small mainly due to the great influence of the gcm choice on the other hand the relative effect of the bc methods compared with the rcms only is more notable with an increasing impact of the interactions between bc methods and rcms furthermore it is shown that applying a bias correction method to the climate forcing produces a smoothing of the projected water resources reduction particularly concerning river runoff overall this study confirms the decreasing trend of projected water resources availability in the crati river basin with unprecedented detail furthermore it demonstrates that i multimodel approach especially concerning gcms is crucial for evaluating the uncertainty of the projected hydrological impact of climate change ii the bc methods do not modify the main features of the projected climate change signal substantially but their effects are not negligible especially when the analysis focuses on specific hydrological variables such as river runoff credit authorship contribution statement

constant scaling strictly speaking a change factor method does not correct modelled precipitation but only adjusts the observations with the modelled climate change signal ccs the adjusted adj subscript daily d precipitation values in the future fut scenario p adj fut d are calculated for each cell of the computational domain starting from the observed series in particular each observed obs

proposed by kunstmann et al 2004 is important in this research because it was adopted in the previous study on the hydrological impact of climate change over the crati river basin senatore et al 2011 therefore it can provide valuable insights into comparing old and new projections with the ku method historical and future rcms daily d precipitation p rcm ref d and p rcm fut d respectively and temperature t rcm ref d and t rcm fut d respectively are modified through a monthly correction parameter k depending on both modelled and observed variables as for precipitation p each monthly m

the future period 2020 2096 multiplying adding them by to the original daily precipitation temperature series non parametric quantile mapping approach with this method the projected daily precipitation value p rcm fut d is changed according to the correction of the daily precipitation distribution calculated through empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdfs as a first step the ecdfs of both the observed and simulated daily precipitation in the reference period ecdf obs d and ecdf rcm ref d respectively are determined including dry days specifically the related probabilities

precipitation values p cor fut d are provided adding the correction functions to p rcm fut d a 8 p cor fut d p rcm fut d cf rcm ref d further details about this method are provided by themeßl et al 2011 2012 and chen et al 2013 theoretically cfs can be calculated for each cell of the domain however since the basin under study is relatively small and the daily precipitation series in each domain cell are highly correlated the computational effort is reduced by calculating the correction coefficients based on the daily observed and simulated precipitation averaged in the whole contributing area further simplification concerns daily temperature data whose future projections are largely beyond the range of the reference period though the original qm method themeßl et al 2011 2012 allows temperature corrections extrapolating corrected values in these conditions would require the definition of theoretical distributions chen et al 2013 with related problems concerning the fitting process and a substantial loss of information compared to empirical distributions therefore in this study the corrected temperature combined with the qm corrected precipitation for hydrological

7888,study region yunnan province china study focus yunnan province yp is affected by frequent droughts that severely affect local agriculture and the ecological environment therefore the identification of droughts and an analysis of their driving factors are of significant importance for mitigating local drought losses and guiding agricultural practices this study identified the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic changes in drought events over yp period 1961 2018 using the severity area duration method the impact of el niño southern oscillation enso on seasonal droughts and their lag period were also quantified by employing the sliding correlation coefficient and cross wavelet analysis method new hydrological insights for the region 74 drought events were identified during 1961 2018 in yp which were mainly short duration that occurred in the 1980 s and 2000 s and most drought centers are located over the northern and eastern parts of yp we found that a significant correlation and different lag periods exist between oceanic niño index oni and seasonal precipitation in yp spring droughts mainly occurred in el niño years during the 1980 s and the 1990 s whilst winter droughts mainly occurred in la niña years during the 1990 s and the 2000 s with a lag period of up to 12 months graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought sad method spi3 enso yunnan province 1 introduction droughts are the most prominent natural hazards in china complex severe and recurrent extreme climate events that occur anywhere and anytime which differ from other disasters characterized by specific seasonal and regional distributions cheng et al 2020 hao and aghakouchak 2013 su et al 2021 the damages and losses caused by droughts are significantly greater than other natural hazards due to their wider spatial extent and longer influencing time ding and gao 2020 ma et al 2020 they significantly impact china s economy agriculture and environment liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 drought over yunnan is affected by anthropogenic climate change wang et al 2021 it experienced an overall drying trend liu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 hao et al 2017 and is projected to increase in the warming future chen and yuan 2021 the annual and interannual variations of precipitation and temperature are significant changes in yp liu et al 2014 li et al 2015a 2015b droughts occur annually in yp lasting for a long duration more than 3 months and prevailing over large areas causing tremendous losses to agriculture ecosystems the economy and social life yu et al 2020 li and liu 2011 over the past 60 years yp droughts are most likely to occur in winter spring and early summer in particular droughts with long duration and high severity mainly mostly occurred in the eastern and central of yp ma et al 2013 li et al 2015a 2019 2015b the meteorological disaster record in china yunnan mdrcy indicated that the crop area affected by droughts in yp reached a total of 1 479 410 000 km2 during 1950 1997 and about 50 of counties were affected by drought in varying degrees annually wen and liu 2006 however there have been few explorations of the development process and path shifting of droughts in yp therefore it is necessary to discuss the changing characteristics and path shifting of droughts in yp droughts are generally identified and characterized using drought indices hao and singh 2015 the spi based on cumulative precipitation probabilities is advantageous as it considers a range of timescales with stable frequencies of drought tayfur 2021 it helps identify the onset and recovery of individual drought event relative to the pdsi which is characterized by a single timescale and poor spatiotemporal comparability caloiero et al 2018 in terms of drought characteristics the severity area and duration are often identified by the time series of such drought indices zhai et al 2016 however the spatial extent of drought and how this evolves is an important aspect of the drought that is often not considered but needs to be taken into account to better characterize risks and drivers he et al 2020 andreadis et al 2005 developed the severity area duration sad method that provides a framework for identifying droughts considering their spatial and temporal dimensions it combines the severity area and duration to analyze the drought characteristics over time yang et al 2020a 2020b this method has been applied on global zhan et al 2020 he et al 2020 and regional scales wang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 zhai et al 2016 shao et al 2018 here we apply the sad method for drought identification in yp that considers the continuity and dynamic changes in the spatial and temporal dimensions the paths of drought centers also are displayed for further monitoring of the drought dynamic changes enso is a large scale climate phenomenon affecting atmospheric and marine teleconnection liu et al 2018 it is the strongest driver of interannual variation of tropical air sea interactions which significantly affects global climate philander 1983 yadav et al 2013 wanders et al 2017 torres valcarcela 2018 the occurrence of droughts in lower latitudes is generally influenced by the interaction between the monsoons and enso events cheng et al 2020 de oliveira júnior et al 2018 zambrano mera et al 2018 droughts in yp are closely linked to atmospheric circulation anomalies li et al 2019 with a lagged response to enso for example zhou et al 2021 found that agricultural droughts were lagged relative to enso as indicated by the correlation between climate and drought indices at 1 12 months also yao et al 2019 discovered that hydrological droughts had a significant response to enso with lags in sub basins mostly around 8 9 months however there have been few explorations of the response of meteorological drought to enso in yp meanwhile drought in southwest china has significant seasonal variations due to the joint influence of south asia monsoon and enso events li et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 ding and gao 2020 droughts occur more frequently in winter and spring than in other seasons wen and liu 2006 ding and gao 2020 which caused great losses to yunnan s agriculture and social economy research on the lagged impact of enso from the seasonality perspective is important for revealing the response period of seasonal droughts to enso and to inform the mechanisms of an early seasonal drought warning therefore this study aims to 1 employ the sad method to identify drought events in yp including quantifying their characteristics by using the 3 month spi 2 analyze their spatial and temporal dimensions to understand dynamic changes in drought centers and 3 explore possible multi scale relationships including the seasonally lagged response between droughts and the enso 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yp is to the southwest of china fig 1 with a land area of 394 100 km2 it belongs to the low latitude mountain plateau with a stepped distribution from north to south and has variable topography and landform yu et al 2020 the province is strongly affected by the dry continental climate system in winter and the humid south asian monsoon in summer cao et al 2012 which leads to evident dry and rainy seasons hao et al 2017 song et al 2019 as reported by the china meteorological disaster ceremony the dry season november to april of the subsequent year accounts for only 16 of the annual precipitation and had a relatively higher drought frequency broader range and longer duration than those of the other provinces of china 2 2 datasets daily precipitation data from 22 meteorological stations were collected from the chinese meteorological data sharing service http data cma cn fig 1 to analyze the spatial characterization of droughts precipitation data was interpolated into 10 km 10 km spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighting method yp area consisted of 4799 grid cells at this resolution the monthly oceanic niño index oni and southern oscillation index soi from 1961 to 2018 were collected from the noaa earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov the oni index was used to monitor the enso and was calculated as the 3 month running mean of sea surface temperature anomalies in the niño 3 4 region the range between 5 n 5 s and 120 170 w the value of oni at or exceeding 0 5 c and lasting for over 5 months was characterized as an el niño la niña event table 3 the geopotential height at 500 hpa horizontal and vertical wind at 850 hpa during 1961 2018 are collected from the ncep ncar reanalysis daily dataset with 2 5 2 5 resolution https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis pressure html it was collected to reveal the influence of large scale circulation on the drought shifting path 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi considers a deficit of precipitation at different time scales mckee et al 1993 this index is advantageous considering its flexible timescales and stable frequency for droughts which makes up for the deficiencies of the pdsi which is characterized by a single timescale and poor spatiotemporal comparability the world meteorological organization wmo describes the spi as a widely applied meteorological drought indicator used in over 70 countries owing to its versatility among the various time scales of spi the spi3 shows higher correlations between cropland exposed to drought and decreases in crop production than longer timescales udmale et al 2020 and it is commonly used to reflect the surplus and deficit of moisture at short timescales scaini et al 2015 meanwhile the 3 month scale of the drought indicator helps capture the length of the cropping season for example three to four months hence the spi3 was used here as the input dataset of the sad method to analyze drought characteristics in yp 2 3 2 sad method for drought identification drought is a process involving continuous dry conditions with a certain duration and in a contiguous area zhai et al 2016 the sad method applies a simple clustering algorithm based on the spatial proximity of grid cells that are in drought to characterize the severity areal extent and duration of contiguous drought events yang et al 2020a 2020b this study used a threshold of spi3 less than 1 to identify droughts spatially contiguous drought events can break up to form sub droughts furthermore several droughts could merge into a larger drought across a specified minimum area sheffield et al 2009 a suitable minimum area threshold of 150 000 km2 was selected for china 1 5 of china s land area according to wang et al 2011 following this principle we selected 6000 km2 as the minimum threshold to identify drought events in yp given the overall smaller area of yp based on spi3 severity s for each grid cell was calculated as 1a s 1 p t 1b p i spi 3 i min 1 j n spi 3 j max 1 j n spi 3 j min 1 j n spi 3 j where here p i is the standardized spi3 of month i p is the sum over for t months the grid cell with the maximum severity was identified as a drought center wang et al 2011 the 3 3 neighborhood cells with the highest severities were added to the drought center and then averaged for both severities over the drought area stopped this process when there was no drought grid in the neighboring cells the average severity of an event with different time intervals 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 months were selected based on the duration of droughts in yp and areas starting from 6000 km2 to the maximum drought extent of approximately 39 104 km2 in increments of 80 grid cells were determined while identifying drought events we identified the maximum severity event considering the interval and duration of each area based on the above procedure for calculating the sad relationships for each drought event sad curves are constructed according to the average drought severity of different areas for a given duration andreadis et al 2005 while the sad envelope curves were plotted by selecting the maximum severity of identifying events for the increment of each area which reflects the most severe event for each combination of area and duration in various drought affected areas yang et al 2020a 2020b 2 3 3 correlation analysis and wavelet analysis hudgins 1993 developed the cross wavelet analysis which is widely used to analyze the correlation between two time series across different time scales it helps identify significant relationships between different time intervals and frequency bands torrence and compo 1998 torrence andwebster 1999 therefore we used this method to explore the correlation between climate indices oni and soi and spi3 meanwhile the sliding correlation analysis method giovannettone and zhang 2019 was used to explore the seasonal variation in the relationship between the climate index oni and precipitation assuming that w x s and w y s are the wavelet transforms of x and y time series respectively the cross wavelet spectrums of x and y are defined as torrence and webster 1999 2 w n xy s w n x s w n y s where denotes a complex conjugation and s is the stretching scale a higher value of w n xy s indicates a significant correlation between the two time series the cross wavelet power with the red noise power spectra p k x and p k y can be expressed as follows 3 w n x s w n y s q x q y z v p v p k x p k y where q x and q y are the standard deviations of time series x and y while z v p represents the confidence level about probability p with a probability distribution function 3 results 3 1 drought characteristics of yunnan province fig 2 shows the percentage of the annual average drought area annual average severity and drought frequency for each month in yp during 1961 2018 74 drought events were identified in yp there are 44 droughts 60 of the total with durations shorter than 6 months the annual average severity and drought area showed an increasing trend in yp fig 2 a and b the months from january to may had the highest drought frequency during 1961 2018 fig 2 c fig 2 d indicates that average severity increases with the increment of the drought area as shown in fig 3 the average duration was longer in central and eastern yp and the numbers of drought events were more in western and southern regions the onset month of the droughts primarily occurred in summer fig 4 with approximately 12 droughts occurring in june the end month of the droughts mostly occurred in autumn additionally the droughts mainly started and ended in june during the 1960 s 1980 s 1990 s and 2000 s however droughts in the 2010 s mostly started in march and april which indicates that the drought onset months are getting earlier during study periods in general droughts occurred more frequently during 1980 2010 in yp and lasted for less than 12 months we compared the identified drought events using the sad method with the recorded drought events in mdrcy table 1 the droughts in 1966 1968 1969 1974 and 1984 had the largest affected area meanwhile those in 1968 1969 1971 1972 1979 1980 and 1984 had the highest severity 14 drought events were identified by the sad method that were consistent with historical records from the meteorological disaster record in china yunnan mdrcy and 6 events were identified that were not in the mdrcy conversely 4 drought events were recorded in the mdrcy but not identified by the sad method these droughts mostly have a short duration and small affected area it may be related to the threshold selecting and clustering algorithm in drought identification the sad method would ignore some mild drought events such as the grid with spi3 greater than 1 would not be clustered into drought grids 3 2 dynamic temporal and spatial characteristics of largest drought events we selected 6 largest drought events table 2 for each decade based on the ranked duration area and severity to further analyze the dynamic characteristics of droughts in yp the drought duration maximum affected area and severity of the selected events in the 1960 s 1970 s and 1980 s were higher than those in the other decades the maximum severity was nearly similar all above 0 9 which is consistent with fig 2 d which shows that the average severity approaches 0 8 for the largest droughts by area the most notable drought occurred in the 2010 s 2011 2012 occurring over 18 months and having the highest severity in terms of the affected area prominent droughts occurred in the 1960 s and the maximum affected area covered yp almost entirely sad curves for different durations 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 months were plotted to gain further insights into the characteristics of 6 largest droughts fig 5 for the 3 month duration fig 5 a the curves of the droughts in the 1960s 1970s 2000s and the 2010s are similar for areas less than 10 104 km2 whose severities were lower than those of the 1980s and 1990s meanwhile the drought in the 1990 s dominated for areas less than 3 104 km2 in terms of severity however the 1980s drought dominated as the area increased for the 6 month duration fig 5 b the slope of the curve for the drought in the 1990s rapidly decreases for the area above 8 104 km2 even less than that of the drought in the 2010s along with an increase in area in the 1960s the drought severity was significantly lower than that in other decades however the drought affected area was relatively large for durations of over 15 months fig 5 e and f there existed only one event which occurred in the 2010s with the severity and spatial area lower than that of the others this could have occurred as the average severity over the whole period would likely be lower as the drought developed and receded over a longer period fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the 6 largest droughts in terms of the drought area and severity in the peak month and also the paths of the drought centers for each month i e the track of the drought center from month to month during the drought duration the selected peak month was based on a comprehensive index which was calculated for each month as drought affected area multiplied by the average severity wang et al 2011 this indicates that these drought events had a wide extent with some covering yp almost entirely the paths of the drought centers underwent considerable changes each month the droughts in the 1960s 2000s and 2010s were more severe than the others for example the 1962 1963 drought fig 6 a occurred first in the southwest of yp located in pu er city and it moved toward eastern yp in the subsequent months the peak month of the drought occurred in yuxi city thereafter the drought faded away in northern yp dali city the 1978 1979 drought fig 6 b mainly existed in the southwest of yp in the early period while it shifted to the northeast of yp in the peak month the mdrcy recorded that the drought intensified in the lincang city in february 1979 which severely impacted the growth of crops such as flue cured tobacco spring corn and rape from october to december 1979 a continuous drought occurred in autumn and winter in southwest yp which also severely affected agricultural production the paths of the droughts identified by the sad method are generally consistent with the droughts recorded by the mdrcy the drought events in the 1980s and 1990s fig 6 c and d were shorter and less severe moreover the drought affected area was also smaller than that of other drought events in particular this study identified two severe drought events those of 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 both of which had the longest drought duration 18 and 11 months respectively however wang et al 2013 found a 100 year drought in 2009 2012 to be an individual drought event which differed from our results this could be related to the different periods and datasets both of those droughts were observed to mostly cover yp fig 6 e and f also the drought centers of 2009 2010 for each month were located in eastern yp however those of 2011 2012 were located in northeast and northwest yp although drought in the peak month november 2009 had a wide spatial extent the drought severity in the east was far greater than that in the west the results show that drought reached a peak from winter to next spring in these typical drought events to reveal the influence of large scale circulation on the shifting path of typical droughts we further analyzed the wind field at 850 hpa and geopotential height anomalies at 500 hpa in winter and spring for the august 1978 september 1979 drought we found that there were significantly negative geopotential height anomalies in the high latitudes and positive geopotential height anomalies on the east and west sides of middle latitudes fig 7 c this indicates that westerlies kept a relatively flat state the difference between positive and negative geopotential height anomalies in the low latitude was not obvious which was difficult for cold air to move to the south baikal lake displayed negative geopotential height anomalies and the northern arabian sea presents positive geopotential height anomalies fig 7 d it shows that the weak cold air in the north and the strong subtropical high in the western pacific may jointly affect yp drought shifting paths there were weak fluctuations in the south branch trough rong et al 2018 yang et al 2012 but the geopotential height anomalies in the bay of bengal were not significantly varied fig 7 e it indicates that the water vapor in yp in winter contributed less than that of other seasons which can lead to precipitation reduction the conclusion is the same as the results of song et al 2011 who found that the weak south branch trough system is the key reason for the reduction of precipitation in yp in spring fig 7 f there were positive geopotential height anomalies over the bay of bengal and the southwest wind on the east side of the bay of bengal was weak meanwhile from the wind field at 850 hpa we can find that the water vapor in the southwest reached sichuan province and the south of northwest china which led to an increase in precipitation over these regions but the water vapor transport over yp mainly came from the temperate zone north of 20 n resulting in significantly less precipitation in eastern yp the april 2011 september 2012 drought the negative geopotential height anomaly near baikal lake reflects that the pressure ridge was weakened fig 7 g meanwhile china was controlled by positive geopotential height anomalies in spring 2012 fig 7 h the pressure ridge of the qinghai tibet plateau developed and controlled yp which caused the precipitation to continually decrease during this period in this way the centers of this drought event involved most areas of yp 3 3 correlation and periodicity analysis between droughts and the enso fig 8 shows the temporal series of the oni and soi where the various enso event intensities are marked considering the enso events table 3 the most intense ei niño event in the last 6 decades was identified in 2014 2016 the strongest la niña events were identified in 1973 1974 and 1988 1989 the number of ei niño events 17 events was equal to the number of la niña events during 1961 2018 based on the identification method of the noaa earth system research laboratory to reveal the multi scale relationships and periodic properties between the climate indices oni and soi and the spi3 series a cross wavelet analysis was used the correlation between the oni and spi3 in spring fig 9 a was observed to be primarily negative with periods of 2 4 year bands during 1964 1972 the phase difference indicated that the change in the oni was faster than that for spi3 a noticeably positive correlation with similar period bands was found between the soi and spi3 during 1964 1972 fig 10 a moreover spi3 was ahead of the soi a significant positive correlation existed between the soi and spi3 during 4 6 years in summer fig 10 b fig 9 d demonstrated that the significant wavelet power was consistently distributed in the 2 3 year during 1969 1973 3 6 year during 1982 1990 and 2 4 year during 2008 2014 the phase relationships between the oni and spi3 for the periods 1969 1973 and 2008 2014 were prominent in the anti phase indicating the negative multi scale relationships between the two series across yp the phase of the significant regions fig 10 d was approximately 90 implying that the soi led the spi3 by nearly 3 months this indicated that the large scale atmospheric circulation showed strong linkages with the seasonal spi3 therefore it strongly influenced the occurrence of drought in yp undoubtedly precipitation is the most critical meteorological variable affecting drought yao et al 2019 yp droughts are affected by monsoon precipitation and show obvious seasonality ding and gao 2020 it is easy to form severe drought when the southwest monsoon and the southeast monsoon are relatively weak whilst many researchers considered that droughts were linked to global climate variability and had a lagged response to the enso the lag period varies depending on different impact factors yao et al 2019 li et al 2019 here the correlation coefficients were calculated between the oni and precipitation in different lag periods 3 6 9 and 12 months the results indicate a correlation between seasonal precipitation and the oni which indicates an association between the climate index and the occurrence of droughts in yp as illustrated in fig 11 a a negative correlation existed between the oni of the early four seasons and the later spring precipitation in yp from the mid 1980 s to the lat 1990 s which indicated that spring precipitation was less in the el niño years especially in 1987 1990 1993 1996 and 1999 2001 it can be verified from the identified drought events that 40 of them occurred in spring from the mid 1980 s to the mid 1990 s the lag period between the oni and precipitation fig 12 a was mostly 3 months before 1990 s and it was prolonged to 6 9 and 12 months in 2000 s this change may be related to the interdecadal shift of the enso that occurred around 1999 2000 in which the forecasted ssta always lagged observed for several months mcphaden 2012 hu et al 2013 2016 2017c 2020 a positive correlation was seen in the 2010 s such that spring precipitation was less in the la niña year of this period the lag period reached 12 months this study also identified 6 droughts that occurred in spring accounting for 54 of the total events in the 2010 s the 2011 2012 drought has the largest severity and longest duration with the drought affected area covering yp almost entirely a significant positive correlation was found between the oni of the early summer autumn and later winter precipitation fig 11 d during the 1980 s and 2000 s which indicates that the winter precipitation was less in the same period of the la niña year the lag period in winter fig 12 d was longer than other seasons from 1960 s to 1990 s but shortened in 2000 s el niño and la niña events have significant effects on autumn precipitation but the effect decade was varied the effect of the el niño event was mainly in the 1970 1980 s and the la niña event was in the 1990 2000 s the lag period of the two events for autumn precipitation was relatively long reaching 12 months this long lag period is exacerbated by the multiple factors such as the response of soil moisture natural vegetation hydrological and atmospheric systems to drought conditions that commonly occur in the response of climatic conditions to atmospheric circulation events ji and peters 2003 patel et al 2007 khan et al 2008 quiring and ganesh 2010 4 discussion drought identification has always been a hot issue and considering its spatial and temporal dimensions can help improve drought monitoring diaz et al 2019 wen et al 2020 results of identification of drought location and characteristics using the sad method in yp are discussed in this section it is obvious that the average drought severity and area have risen steadily over the past 58 years and droughts were most likely to occur from january to may the location where drought occurred severely and frequently varies during the study period among which the east and south of yp are the most prone to drought these results have been mentioned in other studies table 4 for example yu et al 2020 yang et al 2019 and li et al 2015a 2015b indicated that droughts significantly became more frequent with the extension of the timescale especially after 2000 s cheng et al 2020 found that the central southern and northeastern parts of yp experienced the longest drought duration and the higher drought severity occurred in the eastern and southwestern parts of yp yu et al 2013 indicated that march to may is more prone to drought on the temporal distribution which is in accordance with our results 6 largest drought events were identified including those of 1962 1963 1978 1979 1987 1992 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 these severe droughts were recorded by mdrcy in addition the spatial distribution of the peak month of the largest droughts was generally consistent with the recorded regions wen and liu 2006 mao et al 2009 2010 2011 2012 these findings demonstrate that the sad method can help identify droughts whilst also describing the joint drought characteristics including drought severity frequency and spatial distribution but the choice of thresholds for the sad method directly affects the number of identified drought events andreadis et al 2005 wang et al 2011 found that drought events might be repeated in different months when selecting different thresholds sheffield et al 2009 found that a smaller threshold could shrink drought clusters to a few grid cells and persist for many years to avoid this situation a minimum threshold 6000 km2 was set to identify the drought events based on the results wherein the suitable minimum area threshold was 1 5 of the study area wang et al 2011 meanwhile sheffield et al 2009 also found that the drought frequency between decades can be revealed by using different thresholds to identify drought events therefore the number of drought events could be further assessed using different thresholds or different regions in yp to understand the sensitivity of the approach this study explored the correlation and periodicity between climate indices oni and soi and spi3 the results found that the oni had a stronger correlation with spi3 in yp a significantly negative correlation was identified with periods of 2 4 year bands in 1964 1972 which is consistent with the results of cheng et al 2020 a sliding correlation method was used to analyze the impact of oni on seasonal precipitation and their lag periods results demonstrated that el niño and la niña years were associated with seasonal droughts in yp moreover droughts could occur in both el niño and la niña years but the lag period varied in different seasons for example the lag period of the effect of el niño on spring precipitation was about 3 months before the 1990 s but it was prolonged to 12 months from the 1990 2000 s in winter the negative correlation trend for different lag periods 3 6 9 and 12 months was similar from the 1980 s to the mid 1990 s which indicated that the la niña event had a significant effect on the later winter precipitation resulting in the decrease of later winter precipitation significantly droughts were more likely to occur in spring during el niño years and in winter during la niña years quantification of drought lag period is helpful to formulate drought measures to deal with the drought occurrence researchers have pointed out that the number and density of meteorological stations may be one of the factors affecting the precipitation interpolation sinha et al 2006 villarini and krajewski 2008 zhang et al 2011 shope and ram 2015 topographic elements such as elevation aspect and slope also affect the interpolation results however limited by the data availability we used 22 meteorological stations data to explore yp drought characteristics the results have been verified by using recorded drought events in mdrcy and many previous studies on droughts in yunnan province have used a similar number of meteorological stations yu et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2019 furthermore not only enso events were responsible for droughts in yp during our study period but other drivers also need to be identified yao et al 2019 various meteorological factors such as relative humidity temperature and wind speed need to be considered in future research on droughts in yp meanwhile human activities such as land cover change water resource management irrigation water use and groundwater withdrawal could also impact droughts wang and meng 2013 he et al 2017 sun et al 2019 yang et al 2020a 2020b these factors affecting the evolution and dynamic changes of droughts need further exploration 5 conclusion this study explored the spatial and temporal dynamics of drought characteristics in yp and quantified the correlation and periodicity between droughts and enso were explored to reveal the possible factors influencing yp droughts the result shows that 74 drought events were identified during 1961 2018 in yp the month of onset of a drought mainly occurred in summer while the end month mostly occurred in autumn the 2011 2012 drought was the most prominent with the highest duration and severity furthermore the peak month occurred in september 2011 with a drought area of 86 85 of the region of yp the drought center paths of the largest drought events underwent significant changes across yp with time the correlation between the spi3 and large scale climate indices oni and soi showed notable seasonal characteristics which indicate that yp droughts could be related to the el niño la niña events the relationship between precipitation and the oni demonstrates that droughts in spring mainly occurred in both el niño and la niña years during the 1980s and the 2010s and the lag period was about 3 months in the 1980s but it was prolonged to 12 months in the 2010s and those in winter mainly occurred in la niña years during the 1990s and the 2000s with a lag period of up to 12 months at present dynamic identification of drought occurrence and processes is crucial to drought monitoring and early warning the present study helps improve the drought monitoring mechanism and provides a potential reference for identifying drought evolution processes which can reduce the economic losses

7888,study region yunnan province china study focus yunnan province yp is affected by frequent droughts that severely affect local agriculture and the ecological environment therefore the identification of droughts and an analysis of their driving factors are of significant importance for mitigating local drought losses and guiding agricultural practices this study identified the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic changes in drought events over yp period 1961 2018 using the severity area duration method the impact of el niño southern oscillation enso on seasonal droughts and their lag period were also quantified by employing the sliding correlation coefficient and cross wavelet analysis method new hydrological insights for the region 74 drought events were identified during 1961 2018 in yp which were mainly short duration that occurred in the 1980 s and 2000 s and most drought centers are located over the northern and eastern parts of yp we found that a significant correlation and different lag periods exist between oceanic niño index oni and seasonal precipitation in yp spring droughts mainly occurred in el niño years during the 1980 s and the 1990 s whilst winter droughts mainly occurred in la niña years during the 1990 s and the 2000 s with a lag period of up to 12 months graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought sad method spi3 enso yunnan province 1 introduction droughts are the most prominent natural hazards in china complex severe and recurrent extreme climate events that occur anywhere and anytime which differ from other disasters characterized by specific seasonal and regional distributions cheng et al 2020 hao and aghakouchak 2013 su et al 2021 the damages and losses caused by droughts are significantly greater than other natural hazards due to their wider spatial extent and longer influencing time ding and gao 2020 ma et al 2020 they significantly impact china s economy agriculture and environment liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 drought over yunnan is affected by anthropogenic climate change wang et al 2021 it experienced an overall drying trend liu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 hao et al 2017 and is projected to increase in the warming future chen and yuan 2021 the annual and interannual variations of precipitation and temperature are significant changes in yp liu et al 2014 li et al 2015a 2015b droughts occur annually in yp lasting for a long duration more than 3 months and prevailing over large areas causing tremendous losses to agriculture ecosystems the economy and social life yu et al 2020 li and liu 2011 over the past 60 years yp droughts are most likely to occur in winter spring and early summer in particular droughts with long duration and high severity mainly mostly occurred in the eastern and central of yp ma et al 2013 li et al 2015a 2019 2015b the meteorological disaster record in china yunnan mdrcy indicated that the crop area affected by droughts in yp reached a total of 1 479 410 000 km2 during 1950 1997 and about 50 of counties were affected by drought in varying degrees annually wen and liu 2006 however there have been few explorations of the development process and path shifting of droughts in yp therefore it is necessary to discuss the changing characteristics and path shifting of droughts in yp droughts are generally identified and characterized using drought indices hao and singh 2015 the spi based on cumulative precipitation probabilities is advantageous as it considers a range of timescales with stable frequencies of drought tayfur 2021 it helps identify the onset and recovery of individual drought event relative to the pdsi which is characterized by a single timescale and poor spatiotemporal comparability caloiero et al 2018 in terms of drought characteristics the severity area and duration are often identified by the time series of such drought indices zhai et al 2016 however the spatial extent of drought and how this evolves is an important aspect of the drought that is often not considered but needs to be taken into account to better characterize risks and drivers he et al 2020 andreadis et al 2005 developed the severity area duration sad method that provides a framework for identifying droughts considering their spatial and temporal dimensions it combines the severity area and duration to analyze the drought characteristics over time yang et al 2020a 2020b this method has been applied on global zhan et al 2020 he et al 2020 and regional scales wang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 zhai et al 2016 shao et al 2018 here we apply the sad method for drought identification in yp that considers the continuity and dynamic changes in the spatial and temporal dimensions the paths of drought centers also are displayed for further monitoring of the drought dynamic changes enso is a large scale climate phenomenon affecting atmospheric and marine teleconnection liu et al 2018 it is the strongest driver of interannual variation of tropical air sea interactions which significantly affects global climate philander 1983 yadav et al 2013 wanders et al 2017 torres valcarcela 2018 the occurrence of droughts in lower latitudes is generally influenced by the interaction between the monsoons and enso events cheng et al 2020 de oliveira júnior et al 2018 zambrano mera et al 2018 droughts in yp are closely linked to atmospheric circulation anomalies li et al 2019 with a lagged response to enso for example zhou et al 2021 found that agricultural droughts were lagged relative to enso as indicated by the correlation between climate and drought indices at 1 12 months also yao et al 2019 discovered that hydrological droughts had a significant response to enso with lags in sub basins mostly around 8 9 months however there have been few explorations of the response of meteorological drought to enso in yp meanwhile drought in southwest china has significant seasonal variations due to the joint influence of south asia monsoon and enso events li et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 ding and gao 2020 droughts occur more frequently in winter and spring than in other seasons wen and liu 2006 ding and gao 2020 which caused great losses to yunnan s agriculture and social economy research on the lagged impact of enso from the seasonality perspective is important for revealing the response period of seasonal droughts to enso and to inform the mechanisms of an early seasonal drought warning therefore this study aims to 1 employ the sad method to identify drought events in yp including quantifying their characteristics by using the 3 month spi 2 analyze their spatial and temporal dimensions to understand dynamic changes in drought centers and 3 explore possible multi scale relationships including the seasonally lagged response between droughts and the enso 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yp is to the southwest of china fig 1 with a land area of 394 100 km2 it belongs to the low latitude mountain plateau with a stepped distribution from north to south and has variable topography and landform yu et al 2020 the province is strongly affected by the dry continental climate system in winter and the humid south asian monsoon in summer cao et al 2012 which leads to evident dry and rainy seasons hao et al 2017 song et al 2019 as reported by the china meteorological disaster ceremony the dry season november to april of the subsequent year accounts for only 16 of the annual precipitation and had a relatively higher drought frequency broader range and longer duration than those of the other provinces of china 2 2 datasets daily precipitation data from 22 meteorological stations were collected from the chinese meteorological data sharing service http data cma cn fig 1 to analyze the spatial characterization of droughts precipitation data was interpolated into 10 km 10 km spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighting method yp area consisted of 4799 grid cells at this resolution the monthly oceanic niño index oni and southern oscillation index soi from 1961 to 2018 were collected from the noaa earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov the oni index was used to monitor the enso and was calculated as the 3 month running mean of sea surface temperature anomalies in the niño 3 4 region the range between 5 n 5 s and 120 170 w the value of oni at or exceeding 0 5 c and lasting for over 5 months was characterized as an el niño la niña event table 3 the geopotential height at 500 hpa horizontal and vertical wind at 850 hpa during 1961 2018 are collected from the ncep ncar reanalysis daily dataset with 2 5 2 5 resolution https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis pressure html it was collected to reveal the influence of large scale circulation on the drought shifting path 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi considers a deficit of precipitation at different time scales mckee et al 1993 this index is advantageous considering its flexible timescales and stable frequency for droughts which makes up for the deficiencies of the pdsi which is characterized by a single timescale and poor spatiotemporal comparability the world meteorological organization wmo describes the spi as a widely applied meteorological drought indicator used in over 70 countries owing to its versatility among the various time scales of spi the spi3 shows higher correlations between cropland exposed to drought and decreases in crop production than longer timescales udmale et al 2020 and it is commonly used to reflect the surplus and deficit of moisture at short timescales scaini et al 2015 meanwhile the 3 month scale of the drought indicator helps capture the length of the cropping season for example three to four months hence the spi3 was used here as the input dataset of the sad method to analyze drought characteristics in yp 2 3 2 sad method for drought identification drought is a process involving continuous dry conditions with a certain duration and in a contiguous area zhai et al 2016 the sad method applies a simple clustering algorithm based on the spatial proximity of grid cells that are in drought to characterize the severity areal extent and duration of contiguous drought events yang et al 2020a 2020b this study used a threshold of spi3 less than 1 to identify droughts spatially contiguous drought events can break up to form sub droughts furthermore several droughts could merge into a larger drought across a specified minimum area sheffield et al 2009 a suitable minimum area threshold of 150 000 km2 was selected for china 1 5 of china s land area according to wang et al 2011 following this principle we selected 6000 km2 as the minimum threshold to identify drought events in yp given the overall smaller area of yp based on spi3 severity s for each grid cell was calculated as 1a s 1 p t 1b p i spi 3 i min 1 j n spi 3 j max 1 j n spi 3 j min 1 j n spi 3 j where here p i is the standardized spi3 of month i p is the sum over for t months the grid cell with the maximum severity was identified as a drought center wang et al 2011 the 3 3 neighborhood cells with the highest severities were added to the drought center and then averaged for both severities over the drought area stopped this process when there was no drought grid in the neighboring cells the average severity of an event with different time intervals 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 months were selected based on the duration of droughts in yp and areas starting from 6000 km2 to the maximum drought extent of approximately 39 104 km2 in increments of 80 grid cells were determined while identifying drought events we identified the maximum severity event considering the interval and duration of each area based on the above procedure for calculating the sad relationships for each drought event sad curves are constructed according to the average drought severity of different areas for a given duration andreadis et al 2005 while the sad envelope curves were plotted by selecting the maximum severity of identifying events for the increment of each area which reflects the most severe event for each combination of area and duration in various drought affected areas yang et al 2020a 2020b 2 3 3 correlation analysis and wavelet analysis hudgins 1993 developed the cross wavelet analysis which is widely used to analyze the correlation between two time series across different time scales it helps identify significant relationships between different time intervals and frequency bands torrence and compo 1998 torrence andwebster 1999 therefore we used this method to explore the correlation between climate indices oni and soi and spi3 meanwhile the sliding correlation analysis method giovannettone and zhang 2019 was used to explore the seasonal variation in the relationship between the climate index oni and precipitation assuming that w x s and w y s are the wavelet transforms of x and y time series respectively the cross wavelet spectrums of x and y are defined as torrence and webster 1999 2 w n xy s w n x s w n y s where denotes a complex conjugation and s is the stretching scale a higher value of w n xy s indicates a significant correlation between the two time series the cross wavelet power with the red noise power spectra p k x and p k y can be expressed as follows 3 w n x s w n y s q x q y z v p v p k x p k y where q x and q y are the standard deviations of time series x and y while z v p represents the confidence level about probability p with a probability distribution function 3 results 3 1 drought characteristics of yunnan province fig 2 shows the percentage of the annual average drought area annual average severity and drought frequency for each month in yp during 1961 2018 74 drought events were identified in yp there are 44 droughts 60 of the total with durations shorter than 6 months the annual average severity and drought area showed an increasing trend in yp fig 2 a and b the months from january to may had the highest drought frequency during 1961 2018 fig 2 c fig 2 d indicates that average severity increases with the increment of the drought area as shown in fig 3 the average duration was longer in central and eastern yp and the numbers of drought events were more in western and southern regions the onset month of the droughts primarily occurred in summer fig 4 with approximately 12 droughts occurring in june the end month of the droughts mostly occurred in autumn additionally the droughts mainly started and ended in june during the 1960 s 1980 s 1990 s and 2000 s however droughts in the 2010 s mostly started in march and april which indicates that the drought onset months are getting earlier during study periods in general droughts occurred more frequently during 1980 2010 in yp and lasted for less than 12 months we compared the identified drought events using the sad method with the recorded drought events in mdrcy table 1 the droughts in 1966 1968 1969 1974 and 1984 had the largest affected area meanwhile those in 1968 1969 1971 1972 1979 1980 and 1984 had the highest severity 14 drought events were identified by the sad method that were consistent with historical records from the meteorological disaster record in china yunnan mdrcy and 6 events were identified that were not in the mdrcy conversely 4 drought events were recorded in the mdrcy but not identified by the sad method these droughts mostly have a short duration and small affected area it may be related to the threshold selecting and clustering algorithm in drought identification the sad method would ignore some mild drought events such as the grid with spi3 greater than 1 would not be clustered into drought grids 3 2 dynamic temporal and spatial characteristics of largest drought events we selected 6 largest drought events table 2 for each decade based on the ranked duration area and severity to further analyze the dynamic characteristics of droughts in yp the drought duration maximum affected area and severity of the selected events in the 1960 s 1970 s and 1980 s were higher than those in the other decades the maximum severity was nearly similar all above 0 9 which is consistent with fig 2 d which shows that the average severity approaches 0 8 for the largest droughts by area the most notable drought occurred in the 2010 s 2011 2012 occurring over 18 months and having the highest severity in terms of the affected area prominent droughts occurred in the 1960 s and the maximum affected area covered yp almost entirely sad curves for different durations 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 months were plotted to gain further insights into the characteristics of 6 largest droughts fig 5 for the 3 month duration fig 5 a the curves of the droughts in the 1960s 1970s 2000s and the 2010s are similar for areas less than 10 104 km2 whose severities were lower than those of the 1980s and 1990s meanwhile the drought in the 1990 s dominated for areas less than 3 104 km2 in terms of severity however the 1980s drought dominated as the area increased for the 6 month duration fig 5 b the slope of the curve for the drought in the 1990s rapidly decreases for the area above 8 104 km2 even less than that of the drought in the 2010s along with an increase in area in the 1960s the drought severity was significantly lower than that in other decades however the drought affected area was relatively large for durations of over 15 months fig 5 e and f there existed only one event which occurred in the 2010s with the severity and spatial area lower than that of the others this could have occurred as the average severity over the whole period would likely be lower as the drought developed and receded over a longer period fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the 6 largest droughts in terms of the drought area and severity in the peak month and also the paths of the drought centers for each month i e the track of the drought center from month to month during the drought duration the selected peak month was based on a comprehensive index which was calculated for each month as drought affected area multiplied by the average severity wang et al 2011 this indicates that these drought events had a wide extent with some covering yp almost entirely the paths of the drought centers underwent considerable changes each month the droughts in the 1960s 2000s and 2010s were more severe than the others for example the 1962 1963 drought fig 6 a occurred first in the southwest of yp located in pu er city and it moved toward eastern yp in the subsequent months the peak month of the drought occurred in yuxi city thereafter the drought faded away in northern yp dali city the 1978 1979 drought fig 6 b mainly existed in the southwest of yp in the early period while it shifted to the northeast of yp in the peak month the mdrcy recorded that the drought intensified in the lincang city in february 1979 which severely impacted the growth of crops such as flue cured tobacco spring corn and rape from october to december 1979 a continuous drought occurred in autumn and winter in southwest yp which also severely affected agricultural production the paths of the droughts identified by the sad method are generally consistent with the droughts recorded by the mdrcy the drought events in the 1980s and 1990s fig 6 c and d were shorter and less severe moreover the drought affected area was also smaller than that of other drought events in particular this study identified two severe drought events those of 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 both of which had the longest drought duration 18 and 11 months respectively however wang et al 2013 found a 100 year drought in 2009 2012 to be an individual drought event which differed from our results this could be related to the different periods and datasets both of those droughts were observed to mostly cover yp fig 6 e and f also the drought centers of 2009 2010 for each month were located in eastern yp however those of 2011 2012 were located in northeast and northwest yp although drought in the peak month november 2009 had a wide spatial extent the drought severity in the east was far greater than that in the west the results show that drought reached a peak from winter to next spring in these typical drought events to reveal the influence of large scale circulation on the shifting path of typical droughts we further analyzed the wind field at 850 hpa and geopotential height anomalies at 500 hpa in winter and spring for the august 1978 september 1979 drought we found that there were significantly negative geopotential height anomalies in the high latitudes and positive geopotential height anomalies on the east and west sides of middle latitudes fig 7 c this indicates that westerlies kept a relatively flat state the difference between positive and negative geopotential height anomalies in the low latitude was not obvious which was difficult for cold air to move to the south baikal lake displayed negative geopotential height anomalies and the northern arabian sea presents positive geopotential height anomalies fig 7 d it shows that the weak cold air in the north and the strong subtropical high in the western pacific may jointly affect yp drought shifting paths there were weak fluctuations in the south branch trough rong et al 2018 yang et al 2012 but the geopotential height anomalies in the bay of bengal were not significantly varied fig 7 e it indicates that the water vapor in yp in winter contributed less than that of other seasons which can lead to precipitation reduction the conclusion is the same as the results of song et al 2011 who found that the weak south branch trough system is the key reason for the reduction of precipitation in yp in spring fig 7 f there were positive geopotential height anomalies over the bay of bengal and the southwest wind on the east side of the bay of bengal was weak meanwhile from the wind field at 850 hpa we can find that the water vapor in the southwest reached sichuan province and the south of northwest china which led to an increase in precipitation over these regions but the water vapor transport over yp mainly came from the temperate zone north of 20 n resulting in significantly less precipitation in eastern yp the april 2011 september 2012 drought the negative geopotential height anomaly near baikal lake reflects that the pressure ridge was weakened fig 7 g meanwhile china was controlled by positive geopotential height anomalies in spring 2012 fig 7 h the pressure ridge of the qinghai tibet plateau developed and controlled yp which caused the precipitation to continually decrease during this period in this way the centers of this drought event involved most areas of yp 3 3 correlation and periodicity analysis between droughts and the enso fig 8 shows the temporal series of the oni and soi where the various enso event intensities are marked considering the enso events table 3 the most intense ei niño event in the last 6 decades was identified in 2014 2016 the strongest la niña events were identified in 1973 1974 and 1988 1989 the number of ei niño events 17 events was equal to the number of la niña events during 1961 2018 based on the identification method of the noaa earth system research laboratory to reveal the multi scale relationships and periodic properties between the climate indices oni and soi and the spi3 series a cross wavelet analysis was used the correlation between the oni and spi3 in spring fig 9 a was observed to be primarily negative with periods of 2 4 year bands during 1964 1972 the phase difference indicated that the change in the oni was faster than that for spi3 a noticeably positive correlation with similar period bands was found between the soi and spi3 during 1964 1972 fig 10 a moreover spi3 was ahead of the soi a significant positive correlation existed between the soi and spi3 during 4 6 years in summer fig 10 b fig 9 d demonstrated that the significant wavelet power was consistently distributed in the 2 3 year during 1969 1973 3 6 year during 1982 1990 and 2 4 year during 2008 2014 the phase relationships between the oni and spi3 for the periods 1969 1973 and 2008 2014 were prominent in the anti phase indicating the negative multi scale relationships between the two series across yp the phase of the significant regions fig 10 d was approximately 90 implying that the soi led the spi3 by nearly 3 months this indicated that the large scale atmospheric circulation showed strong linkages with the seasonal spi3 therefore it strongly influenced the occurrence of drought in yp undoubtedly precipitation is the most critical meteorological variable affecting drought yao et al 2019 yp droughts are affected by monsoon precipitation and show obvious seasonality ding and gao 2020 it is easy to form severe drought when the southwest monsoon and the southeast monsoon are relatively weak whilst many researchers considered that droughts were linked to global climate variability and had a lagged response to the enso the lag period varies depending on different impact factors yao et al 2019 li et al 2019 here the correlation coefficients were calculated between the oni and precipitation in different lag periods 3 6 9 and 12 months the results indicate a correlation between seasonal precipitation and the oni which indicates an association between the climate index and the occurrence of droughts in yp as illustrated in fig 11 a a negative correlation existed between the oni of the early four seasons and the later spring precipitation in yp from the mid 1980 s to the lat 1990 s which indicated that spring precipitation was less in the el niño years especially in 1987 1990 1993 1996 and 1999 2001 it can be verified from the identified drought events that 40 of them occurred in spring from the mid 1980 s to the mid 1990 s the lag period between the oni and precipitation fig 12 a was mostly 3 months before 1990 s and it was prolonged to 6 9 and 12 months in 2000 s this change may be related to the interdecadal shift of the enso that occurred around 1999 2000 in which the forecasted ssta always lagged observed for several months mcphaden 2012 hu et al 2013 2016 2017c 2020 a positive correlation was seen in the 2010 s such that spring precipitation was less in the la niña year of this period the lag period reached 12 months this study also identified 6 droughts that occurred in spring accounting for 54 of the total events in the 2010 s the 2011 2012 drought has the largest severity and longest duration with the drought affected area covering yp almost entirely a significant positive correlation was found between the oni of the early summer autumn and later winter precipitation fig 11 d during the 1980 s and 2000 s which indicates that the winter precipitation was less in the same period of the la niña year the lag period in winter fig 12 d was longer than other seasons from 1960 s to 1990 s but shortened in 2000 s el niño and la niña events have significant effects on autumn precipitation but the effect decade was varied the effect of the el niño event was mainly in the 1970 1980 s and the la niña event was in the 1990 2000 s the lag period of the two events for autumn precipitation was relatively long reaching 12 months this long lag period is exacerbated by the multiple factors such as the response of soil moisture natural vegetation hydrological and atmospheric systems to drought conditions that commonly occur in the response of climatic conditions to atmospheric circulation events ji and peters 2003 patel et al 2007 khan et al 2008 quiring and ganesh 2010 4 discussion drought identification has always been a hot issue and considering its spatial and temporal dimensions can help improve drought monitoring diaz et al 2019 wen et al 2020 results of identification of drought location and characteristics using the sad method in yp are discussed in this section it is obvious that the average drought severity and area have risen steadily over the past 58 years and droughts were most likely to occur from january to may the location where drought occurred severely and frequently varies during the study period among which the east and south of yp are the most prone to drought these results have been mentioned in other studies table 4 for example yu et al 2020 yang et al 2019 and li et al 2015a 2015b indicated that droughts significantly became more frequent with the extension of the timescale especially after 2000 s cheng et al 2020 found that the central southern and northeastern parts of yp experienced the longest drought duration and the higher drought severity occurred in the eastern and southwestern parts of yp yu et al 2013 indicated that march to may is more prone to drought on the temporal distribution which is in accordance with our results 6 largest drought events were identified including those of 1962 1963 1978 1979 1987 1992 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 these severe droughts were recorded by mdrcy in addition the spatial distribution of the peak month of the largest droughts was generally consistent with the recorded regions wen and liu 2006 mao et al 2009 2010 2011 2012 these findings demonstrate that the sad method can help identify droughts whilst also describing the joint drought characteristics including drought severity frequency and spatial distribution but the choice of thresholds for the sad method directly affects the number of identified drought events andreadis et al 2005 wang et al 2011 found that drought events might be repeated in different months when selecting different thresholds sheffield et al 2009 found that a smaller threshold could shrink drought clusters to a few grid cells and persist for many years to avoid this situation a minimum threshold 6000 km2 was set to identify the drought events based on the results wherein the suitable minimum area threshold was 1 5 of the study area wang et al 2011 meanwhile sheffield et al 2009 also found that the drought frequency between decades can be revealed by using different thresholds to identify drought events therefore the number of drought events could be further assessed using different thresholds or different regions in yp to understand the sensitivity of the approach this study explored the correlation and periodicity between climate indices oni and soi and spi3 the results found that the oni had a stronger correlation with spi3 in yp a significantly negative correlation was identified with periods of 2 4 year bands in 1964 1972 which is consistent with the results of cheng et al 2020 a sliding correlation method was used to analyze the impact of oni on seasonal precipitation and their lag periods results demonstrated that el niño and la niña years were associated with seasonal droughts in yp moreover droughts could occur in both el niño and la niña years but the lag period varied in different seasons for example the lag period of the effect of el niño on spring precipitation was about 3 months before the 1990 s but it was prolonged to 12 months from the 1990 2000 s in winter the negative correlation trend for different lag periods 3 6 9 and 12 months was similar from the 1980 s to the mid 1990 s which indicated that the la niña event had a significant effect on the later winter precipitation resulting in the decrease of later winter precipitation significantly droughts were more likely to occur in spring during el niño years and in winter during la niña years quantification of drought lag period is helpful to formulate drought measures to deal with the drought occurrence researchers have pointed out that the number and density of meteorological stations may be one of the factors affecting the precipitation interpolation sinha et al 2006 villarini and krajewski 2008 zhang et al 2011 shope and ram 2015 topographic elements such as elevation aspect and slope also affect the interpolation results however limited by the data availability we used 22 meteorological stations data to explore yp drought characteristics the results have been verified by using recorded drought events in mdrcy and many previous studies on droughts in yunnan province have used a similar number of meteorological stations yu et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2019 furthermore not only enso events were responsible for droughts in yp during our study period but other drivers also need to be identified yao et al 2019 various meteorological factors such as relative humidity temperature and wind speed need to be considered in future research on droughts in yp meanwhile human activities such as land cover change water resource management irrigation water use and groundwater withdrawal could also impact droughts wang and meng 2013 he et al 2017 sun et al 2019 yang et al 2020a 2020b these factors affecting the evolution and dynamic changes of droughts need further exploration 5 conclusion this study explored the spatial and temporal dynamics of drought characteristics in yp and quantified the correlation and periodicity between droughts and enso were explored to reveal the possible factors influencing yp droughts the result shows that 74 drought events were identified during 1961 2018 in yp the month of onset of a drought mainly occurred in summer while the end month mostly occurred in autumn the 2011 2012 drought was the most prominent with the highest duration and severity furthermore the peak month occurred in september 2011 with a drought area of 86 85 of the region of yp the drought center paths of the largest drought events underwent significant changes across yp with time the correlation between the spi3 and large scale climate indices oni and soi showed notable seasonal characteristics which indicate that yp droughts could be related to the el niño la niña events the relationship between precipitation and the oni demonstrates that droughts in spring mainly occurred in both el niño and la niña years during the 1980s and the 2010s and the lag period was about 3 months in the 1980s but it was prolonged to 12 months in the 2010s and those in winter mainly occurred in la niña years during the 1990s and the 2000s with a lag period of up to 12 months at present dynamic identification of drought occurrence and processes is crucial to drought monitoring and early warning the present study helps improve the drought monitoring mechanism and provides a potential reference for identifying drought evolution processes which can reduce the economic losses

7889,study region a mountain city in the coastal region of southeast china study focus this study elucidated the effect of digital elevation model dem resolution on flood simulation errors and inundation depth distributions through building treatment methods and river channel definition the optimal dem resolution was evaluated to determine whether satisfactory inundation simulation could be achieved for urban flash flood simulation uffs and fluvial overbank flood simulation fofs new hydrological insights for the region uffs and fofs presented opposite effects regarding inundation extent and the spatial distribution of inundation depth with coarsening dem resolution in uffs the inundation extent and inundation depth in low lying areas of the flood propagation pathway were underestimated this effect was attributed to the change of local flood pathway caused by different treatment of buildings at coarser dem resolution the simulation error was magnified considerably when the dem resolution was greater than the building width and gaps in fofs owing to the changed channel geometry at coarser resolution the inundation extent and inundation depth were overestimated using a dem resolution and computational cell size that are lower than the river width is recommended this study illustrated that a regional scale effect dependent on regional flood propagation behaviour and the impact of land use and topography on the flood propagation pathway could be observed by coarsening the dem resolution of inundation simulations keywords urban flash flood fluvial overbank flood digital elevation models building treatment methods resolution urban flood processes 1 introduction the frequency magnitude and impact of flood events have increased markedly owing to ongoing rapid urbanization and climate change bayazit et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 flooding disasters are gaining widespread attention because of their increasing severity and the extent of the damage they cause altenau et al 2017 bruwier et al 2018 sharma and regonda 2021 china has suffered many severe flood disasters in recent years cao et al 2020 ma et al 2018 mei et al 2020 shen and tan 2020 xing et al 2019 according to the ministry of emergency management of china in 2020 38 26 million people were affected by floods that caused economic losses of 109 7 billion chinese yuan numerical simulation is recognized as a reliable tool for flood forecasting and inundation mapping which is important for flood risk management and local disaster reduction gallegos et al 2009 saksena and merwade 2015 however owing to the lack of available high resolution data and the complexity of the underlying surface of urban environments accurate modelling and forecasting of urban floods remain challenging tasks for researchers and policy makers many studies have proposed and developed different hydrological modelling approaches to estimate hydrological input data for small scale and ungauged basins grimaldi et al 2013 introduced a fully continuous hydrologic hydraulic modelling framework for flood mapping in an ungauged basin for an event based approach the designed inflow hydrographic data and rainstorm data for each return period can be estimated using a width function based instantaneous unit hydrograph and intensity duration frequency curves respectively vojtek et al 2019 among the various sources of uncertainty in terms of model structure and model parameters topographic data have been identified as a one of the major contributors to flood simulation accuracy altenau et al 2017 lim and brandt 2019 sharma and regonda 2021 generally a flood inundation area is delineated using topographic data provided by a digital elevation model dem the characteristics of the dem have been proven to have a considerable effect on model performance shen and tan 2020 advances in the collection of high resolution data and the emergence of lidar technology have promoted the widespread application of dem products with varying resolution and vertical accuracy to numerical simulation of flooding leitão and sousa 2018 for example nardi et al 2019 developed a new dem product that could identify a floodplain boundary using a geospatial tool additionally quantitative comparison indicated that dems derived using data acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles could be an appropriate alternative to lidar derived products for flood mapping in small scale and ungauged basins annis et al 2020 high resolution dem data are assumed more accurate in describing the underlying surface and in reproducing small scale flow paths such that simulation results would be expected to have less error and uncertainty altenau et al 2017 kim et al 2021 yu and lane 2006 however previous studies that compared the differences between dem data products and sources in relation to flood simulation performance reported that both the quality and the accuracy of the dem were more relevant than the dem resolution ali et al 2015 talchabhadel et al 2021 in addition fine resolution models are sensitive to vertical errors in dem data but such sensitivity is reduced at low resolution jung and jasinski 2015 given the financial challenges associated with producing high resolution dems with a large spatial extent especially in developing countries many studies have investigated how to determine the optimal resolution for a certain scale and computational cost muthusamy et al 2021 for example a previous study evaluated the trade off relationship between dem resolution vertical accuracy and simulation error for a large floodplain jung and jasinski 2015 on a small scale several earlier studies demonstrated that a 5 m resolution dem was sufficient to provide an acceptable performance of numerical simulation of urban floods gallegos et al 2009 shen and tan 2020 xing et al 2019 previous studies associated with the effect of dem resolution on surface flood modelling mainly consist of two types depending on flood event and scale fluvial overbank flood fof modelling and urban flash flood uff modelling sharma and regonda 2021 david and schmalz 2021 xing et al 2019 the inundation extent ie and the average water stage were found to increase linearly with dem resolution in fof modelling saksena and merwade 2015 the topography of both the cross sectional and the longitudinal profiles of the channel varied with coarser resolution podhorányi et al 2013 while the main source of simulation error was the increase in elevation of most channel cells muthusamy et al 2021 moreover some studies that combined different resolutions and roughness found that the inundation area was highly sensitive to roughness variation in fine models with high resolution lim and brandt 2019 in uff modelling despite the relatively small scale from community level to several square kilometres hydrodynamic simulation and flow propagation are complicated owing to factors such as buildings underground drainage systems and streets yin et al 2016 xing et al 2021 for example at low spatial resolution drainage systems will increase the peak discharge because the effective impervious area is reduced krebs et al 2014 earlier studies demonstrated that buildings present a combined effect of storage blocking and resistance that can substantially affect flood volume and flow propagation bruwier et al 2018 shen and tan 2020 for flood modelling of urban areas several building treatment methods btms have been proposed e g the building resistance building block bb building hole and building porosity methods akoh et al 2017 gayer et al 2010 liang et al 2015 comprehensive comparison of the simulation results achieved for each btm at different dem resolutions is summarised in both schubert and sanders 2012 and schubert et al 2008 the bb method has greater sensitivity as grid resolution coarsens which results in greater range of underestimation therefore to better express flood behaviour between buildings and streets it is necessary for the computational cell size and the dem resolution to be smaller than the building scale shen and tan 2020 chen et al 2012a proposed a new layer regarding building features that adopts an area reduction factor width reduction factor arf wrf approach to characterize the effect of storage and resistance of buildings which has been proven to provide acceptable performance at coarse resolutions most previous studies investigated the response of either uffs or rural fofs to dem resolution but few studies have investigated the combined effect of multiple flood sources surface flooding behaviour shows an opposite effect regarding dem resolution i e peak flow is reduced at coarser resolution for larger storms but enhanced for smaller storms cao et al 2020 ghosh and hellweger 2012 even for the same inundation indicators studies have reported contrasting model performance with coarser dem resolution for example muthusamy et al 2021 reported that inundation depth increases with dem resolution in the range of 1 50 m however ozdemir et al 2013 found that inundation depth decreases with dem resolution in the range of 0 1 1 m even for the same inundation indicators earlier studies have reported contrasting model performances with coarser dem resolution this inconsistency requires more detailed analysis that should not only explore the results but also identify the root causes and key influencing factors of the observed differences such in depth analyses are relatively scarce in most previous studies the resolution of a dem also has a regional scale effect that is strongly affected by land use and terrain jung and jasinski 2015 for example channels with a greater slope will show more errors after resampling saksena and merwade 2015 and areas with greater building density are more sensitive to dem resolution compared with suburbs shen and tan 2020 a river and a developed area might exhibit different behaviours in terms of flood propagation when studied using different dems with different resolutions muthusamy et al 2021 most of the studies mentioned above only analysed the effect of dem resolution on individual environmental factors clarifying the changes in flow pathway and inundation performance by exploring additional factors that include btms definition of the river channel and distinctive flood propagation behaviours will help improve understanding of the effect of dem resolution on urban flood properties the current study investigated the separate and combined effects of dem resolution and btms on flood properties and simulation performance for a small city that is prone to flooding from multiple sources with different flood propagation behaviours i e uffs and fofs the objectives were as follows 1 to examine the effect of dem resolution and btms on flood performance including ie and the spatial distribution of inundation depth and to compare the sensitivity of different btms to dem resolution 2 to identify the separate and combined effects of different flood propagation behaviours uffs and fofs in response to different dem resolutions and 3 to reveal the appropriate dem resolution required to simulate cases of uffs and fofs and their controlling factors the current study provides a broader understanding of how btms and channel geometry change with various dem resolutions thereby providing important guidance for flood inundation mapping the key findings of this study could facilitate selection of the optimal dem resolution for the simulation of both uffs and fofs in areas where fine topographic data are unavailable 2 study area materials and methodologies 2 1 study area the meixi basin is a small scale area 101 km2 mountainous basin located in the coastal area of southeast china fig 1a c the main land use types are forest and cultivated land an alluvial plain is located in the lower reaches of the basin where an urbanised area that has a large proportion of impervious surface is located fig 1d the meixi basin can be characterised as either mountainous area or urbanised area on the basis of the marked spatial differences in topography land use and flood risk fig 1c using the spatial analysis tools in arcgis 10 2 the mountainous area was divided into five sub basins s1 s5 on the basis of terrain bajabaa et al 2014 the meixi river and the siduxi river that originate from s2 and s5 respectively both discharge into the dongxi river which marks the outlet of the meixi basin sub basins s1 s3 and s4 are relatively small and have no natural river channel however the urbanised area tua is affected by flash floods associated with these sub basins when rainstorm events occur fig 1d tua comprises a town that covers an area of 5 4 km2 with low elevation dense building coverage and a large proportion of impervious surface sub basins s1 s5 area 1 4 55 6 km2 are characterised by steep slopes fast flow and rapid convergence that can produce flash floods within a short lag time table 1 consequently multiple floods including flash flooding from s1 and overbank flooding along the meixi river have a major impact on tua the study area which is characterised by a subtropical marine monsoon climate with annual precipitation of 1000 1800 mm is typically affected by 2 3 typhoons annually ma et al 2018 mei et al 2020 in september 2016 typhoon molanti brought total rainfall of 259 mm that caused catastrophic flooding in the meixi basin that persisted for 16 h hereafter referred to as rainstorm 20160915 in total 13 people were declared missing or killed and there were economic losses of 6 billion chinese yuan in the current tua was considered to have practical value for investigating the combined effect of flood properties in relation to different propagation behaviours and btms 2 2 data collection and pre processing 2 2 1 topographic and building data in november 2018 unmanned aerial vehicle oblique photographic technology was used to collect high resolution dem data and high definition imagery 5 m resolution of tua additionally polygon feature layers of land use types and building features including geometric and positional information of tua were depicted manually according to the high definition images and validated on the basis of google street view using arcgis 10 2 tua comprises 1196 architectural features and statistics were generated regarding the size of gap between buildings and the width of separate buildings fig 2 which could affect floodwater propagation bruwier et al 2018 the gap between buildings was evaluated on the basis of the minimum gap between adjacent pairs of buildings as determined from the building contours using the geographic information system processing methods described by fewtrell et al 2008 to determine the width of individual buildings each building was approximated as a rectangle and the shortest dimension of each rectangle was obtained from the polygonal area and perimeter information shen and tan 2020 fig 2a shows that the vast majority 95 of building gaps are 5 m gallegos et al 2009 stipulated that urban inundation simulation requires at least one mesh to be set within the building gap which implies that the original 5 m resolution data were sufficient to meet this requirements in relation to tua 2 2 2 drainage system data drainage system data including geographic and geometric information on pipes and manholes were provided by the local drainage management bureau pipe diameters are in the range of 300 1200 mm and pipe slopes are in the range of 0 1 2 5 the drainage system of the dongxi river which includes 229 manholes and 10 outfalls o1 o10 has a drainage network density of 5 22 km km2 fig 1d the capacity of the underground drainage system is inadequate and the system has been mismanaged since it was constructed in the 1990 s it should be noted that the design drainage pipe standard in tua is only for average annual rainfall levels 2 2 3 hydrological data for the selected flood event according to a report of historical flood events provided by the local honglai hydrological gauging station the recent catastrophic flooding associated with rainstorm 20160915 caused the greatest amount of damage and the highest economic losses in the meixi basin during the last 60 years one of the most important reasons for opting to study this event was the availability of a suitable volume of detailed measured data the rainstorm data 1 h interval were obtained from the honglai hydrological gauging station fig 1c the hydrological model was calibrated and verified for each ungauged sub basin s1 s5 in the mountainous area owing to a lack of discharge data jiang et al 2020 hence external flash flood data relating to s1 s5 during the event were calculated using corresponding precipitation data fig 3 to provide the inflow hydrography at the boundary between each of the five sub basins and tua fig 1d the water stage data observed at the honglai hydrological gauging station and the differences along the dongxi river honglai section were also collected from the same station and the local drainage management bureau the water stage at specific locations o1 o10 along the dongxi river were estimated and set as the downstream boundary conditions for both the drainage system outfalls and the meixi river additionally historical inundation traces recorded during rainstorm 20160915 in tua were used for verification the maximum inundation depth at 10 different locations was estimated from flood traces on buildings during field investigation 2 3 methodologies 2 3 1 flo 2d model flo 2d is a raster based hydrodynamic model that can describe in detail the flow wave propagation of a channel and floodplain flo 2d software inc 2009 it has been used widely to simulate of mountainous storm surges and river channel overbank inundations dimitriadis et al 2016 grimaldi et al 2013 peng and lu 2013 multiple flood hydrographs can be introduced to the system either as floodplain or channel inflow in this study flo 2d was used for floodplain inundation simulation induced by uffs and fofs in tua the equations of motion are applied by computing independently the average flow velocity across each one of eight potential flow directions flo 2d software inc 2009 the governing equations are as follows 1 h t h v x 0 2 h x v g v x 1 g v t s o s f where h is flow depth m v is the depth averaged velocity in one of the eight flow directions x m s s f and s o represent the friction slope and the corresponding bed slope in one of the eight flow directions respectively and g is gravitational acceleration m s2 for a floodplain with a multi direction flow model the equations of motion in flo 2d are applied by computing the average flow velocity across a cell element boundary in one direction at a time there are eight potential flow directions north east south west northeast southeast southwest and northwest within one square computational cell thus each velocity computation is essentially a one dimensional problem that is solved independently of the other seven directions 2 3 2 hec ras for consideration of channels the flo 2d model incorporates hec ras software flo 2d software inc 2009 that employs 1 dimensional flood routing in both steady and unsteady flow conditions by applying an implicit forward finite difference scheme between successive natural cross sections of flexible geometry additional details regarding hec ras can be found in dimitriadis et al 2016 and podhorányi et al 2013 hec ras fluvial flooding requires two main inputs channel cross section geometry and river boundary conditions a previous study provided 55 geometric cross sections for a river with a length of 6 5 km for river floodplain inundation simulations cook and merwade 2009 in all 65 geometric cross sections which were extracted from the original dem data were imported for the meixi river 4 6 km and the siduxi river fig 1d reflecting the number of geometric cross sections considered sufficient for fluvial flood modelling in this study the upstream inflow hydrography of sub basins s2 and s5 and the downstream water stages were discussed in section 2 2 2 fig 3 in the flo 2d model fofs is computed when the channel capacity is exceeded channel floodplain exchange is computed for each channel bank element on the basis of the potential water surface elevation difference between the channel and the floodplain grid element containing either channel bank fig 4a the velocity of either the channel overbank flow or the return flow to the channel is computed using the diffusive wave momentum equation it is assumed that the overbank flow velocity is relatively small and thus acceleration terms are negligible for the return flow to the channel if the channel water surface is lower than the bank elevation the bank elevation is used to compute the return flow velocity 2 3 3 swmm the flo 2d model is internally coupled with the modular epa swmm flo 2d software inc 2009 swmm is a dynamic hydrology hydraulic water quality model that is used worldwide chen et al 2018 in this study sewer flow in the underground drainage system and node overflow to the surface were simulated using the swmm module in flo 2d the swmm module solves the saint venant equations using the implicit finite difference method the governing equations are as follows 3 a t q x 0 4 1 ga q t q ga x q a h x s 0 s f where q is the flow rate m3 s a is the flow cross sectional area m2 x is the longitudinal distance m h is the hydraulic head of water in the conduit m g is gravitational acceleration m s2 s f is the friction slope and s 0 is the slope of the pipe in the flo 2d model floodplain runoff discharge from the surface enters the pipeline system at inlets the inlet discharge is imposed as a surface water boundary condition that is passed to the storm drain layer for routing by the swmm module weir and orifice equations are used to calculate the inflow discharge under inlet control flo 2d software inc 2009 if the drainage system is surcharged excess water that overflows from the manholes to the surface might exacerbate urban inundation fig 4b hence the linkages between the surface and underground drainage systems channel and floodplain were considered bidirectionally in tua fig 4c 2 3 4 building treatment methods buildings account for a considerable proportion of an urban area and their walls usually prevent incursion of floodwater into their interior spaces thus water flows around buildings rather than into or through them unless their entrances are left open or the water level exceeds the crest height of any entrances in this study two btms were considered the bb and arf wrf methods the bb method is used in combination with the building height or raised ground elevation of areas containing buildings to characterize the physical situation in overland flow modelling shen and tan 2020 in implementing the bb method meshes inside buildings were regarded as blocks and non flooding zones in the flo 2d model the influence of buildings on flood propagation was modelled using the arf wrf method chen et al 2012a haltas et al 2016 the arf is a parameter that accounts for the reduced area of the computational domain occupied by buildings which is calculated using the mass conservation equation in the numerical scheme flo 2d software inc 2009 the arf parameter represents the ratio of the total area intersected by buildings to the total cell area as expressed in eq 5 and illustrated in fig 5a 5 arf total intersected area cell area area a area b area c cell area where arf is a dimensionless parameter that varies in the range of 0 1 total intersected area and cell area are the building area m2 and the total area m2 of one computational cell respectively the arf parameter is equal to 0 if there are no buildings obstructions in a cell and equal to 1 if the cell is completely occupied by a building although the arf parameter reflects the amount of water that one cell could store it cannot describe the diverse flow possibilities produced by the various alignments and locations of buildings inside a cell to distinguish the locations of different buildings the wrf parameter was adopted to represent the maximum occupancy ratios of buildings inside a cell in the flo 2d model one computational cell can be divided into nine sub cells and the wrf value of each sub cell refers to the percentage of the blockage in each direction flow from the centre of a cell is allowed to pass through eight possible directions depending on the wrf value of each sub cell fig 5b the wrf value for each sub cell can be calculated using eq 6 6 wrf subcell intersected subcell area subcell area where wrf is a dimensionless parameter that varies in the range of 0 1 wrfsubcell is the wrf value of one of the sub cells inside a computational cell intersected subcell area and subcell area are the intersected building area m2 and the corresponding area m2 of the same sub cell respectively the wrf algorithm assumes that flow from the centre of a cell cannot pass through a sub cell southeast direction in fig 5b of the cell itself or a neighbouring sub cell west direction in fig 5b that has a wrf value of 0 9 the arf wrf combination describes the effects of building blockage and alignment such that the flow predicted using this method is close to reality chen et al 2012b 2 3 5 model performance as mentioned in section 2 1 the surface inundation of tua is affected by multiple sources including uffs from s1 and fofs along the meixi river fig 1 given the actual situation of tua in terms of the interaction and mixing of floodwater from both sources it is difficult to identify the inundation process under different dem resolutions and btms previous studies suggested that uffs and fofs might have different inundation propagation behaviours and simulation results muthusamy et al 2021 savage et al 2016 xing et al 2019 therefore the two flooding processes were considered separately and the derived results were compared the uff simulation uffs was regarded as control group 1 inundation was affected only by the hydrography of s1 the fof simulation fofs was regarded as control group 2 inundation was affected by the hydrography of s2 s5 and the actual inundation of tua by all flood sources was regarded as the overall scenario group inundation was affected by the hydrography of s1 s5 fig 3 each simulation group had 10 scenarios 2 types of btm with 5 dem resolutions it should be noted that all physical processes and parameters other than the flood source remained unchanged for all 30 scenarios to compare the results obtained using different dem resolutions and btms for each simulation the commonly used root mean square error rmse of the maximum inundation depth was assessed the calculation is as follows 7 rmse i 1 n d i s d i b 2 n where d s and d b indicate the simulated and observed maximum inundation depth respectively and n is the number of selected sampling points for other scenarios at coarse resolutions the maximum inundation depth of the high resolution benchmark model was used to indicate d b a fit index fi analysis was conducted to compare the spatial inundation results the fi value is a measure of the error between reference and predicted flood areas muthusamy et al 2021 8 fit index f i a p a r a p a r 100 where ap and ar represent the predicted flood area and the reference flood area respectively essentially fi varies from 0 no model fit to 1 100 model fit based on the inundation area between the reference and predicted maps in this study the reference flood area was represented by the inundation map of the benchmark model 3 results 3 1 benchmark simulation and model verification the benchmark simulation conducted to reproduce the extreme events of rainstorm 20160915 in tua was performed using the original 5 m dem data for the arf wrf and bb methods adopting 5 m resolution computational cells 206 833 square meshes were generated and the infiltration rate was calculated using the green ampt method flo 2d software inc 2009 the roughness of different land use types underground drainage pipes and the green ampt infiltration parameters in tua are listed in table 2 all of which were based on the flo 2d user manual and previous studies chen et al 2018 gayer et al 2010 muthusamy et al 2021 the maximum inundation map produced using the arf wrf method is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that surface inundation in tua had two primary components flash flooding from sub basin s1 and overbank flooding along the meixi river the flash flooding from sub basin s1 mainly propagated along the main street mixed with the overbank flooding from the meixi river and finally resulted in inundation accumulation in the low lying central areas of tua fig 6 the flo 2d model was verified using the 10 recorded inundation traces fig 6 the results indicated a satisfactory performance for the two btms with rmse values of 0 13 and 0 19 for the arf wrf and the bb method respectively fig 7 the smaller rmse value for the arf wrf method suggested that the simulation of inundation in tua was more accurate compared with that of the bb method this might show that the bb method cannot provide appropriate results for very small building gaps compared with other studies associated with urban flood modelling the calculated rmse value of the simulation associated with the arf wrf method and the original 5 m resolution dem is lower than that reported by both xing et al 2019 and cheng et al 2020 evidence from in previous studies confirms that a dem with 5 m resolution is adequate for urban flood simulations gallegos et al 2009 shen and tan 2020 which suggests that the simulation result obtained in the current study using the original 5 m resolution dem is reliable hence the arf wrf method with the 5 m resolution dem was taken as the benchmark for subsequent scenarios 3 2 sensitivity of the urban flood process to dem resolution with different btms because of the low capacity of the underground drainage system in tua the impact of the drainage system is negligible jiang et al 2020 therefore this study focused mainly on the surface inundation and little attention was given to the performance of the underground drainage system previous studies demonstrated that bilinear interpolation methods gave the best performance among the available resampling techniques jung and jasinski 2015 shen and tan 2020 to identify the effect of different btms on the urban flooding process at different dem resolutions dem data with coarser resolution 10 15 20 and 30 m were generated from the original 5 m resolution dem using bilinear interpolation the computational cell size was consistent with the dem resolution for each simulation i e a 10 m cell size corresponded to a 10 m resolution dem because only a limited number of inundation traces six points in the centre of tua and four points near the meixi river were recorded fig 6 and previous studies have indicated that a small number of samples might not reflect the full extent of inundation xing et al 2019 dozens of additional points including the original 10 inundation traces were selected from the verified benchmark model figs 8 and 9 the selected points which covered most of the main area of inundation were used for subsequent comparison and calculation of the simulation error rmse between the benchmark model 5 m and the other scenarios with coarser resolutions 10 30 m 3 2 1 control group 1 uffs figs 8 and 9 show the spatial distributions of the inundation depth simulated using the arf wrf and bb methods respectively with various dem resolutions generally both btms produced similar results that showed a decrease in ie with coarsening of the dem resolution fig 10a similarly both btms underestimate the inundation depth in lower areas region 4 in fig 8 of the flood propagation pathway at coarse resolution figs 8 and 9 additionally the rmse rmseu values calculated using the 42 selected points fig 8 and the fi values fiu for control group 1 uffs indicated that the bb method was more sensitive than the arf wrf method to dem resolution fig 10b and c the rmseu of the bb method increased markedly from 0 13 to 0 56 m when the dem resolution changed from 5 to 10 m indicating that the resolution of 10 m was of concern fig 10b by contrast the rmseu values were small 0 18 m when the dem resolution changed from 5 to 15 m for the arf wrf method however relatively large rmseu increments were obtained at 20 m suggesting this was the tipping point for the arf wrf method fig 10b in the bb method the arrangement of buildings and elevation of the main streets were changed simultaneously with the resampled dem resolution fig 11 compared with the original arrangement and location of building features the buildings show considerable differences at coarser resolutions even at 10 m resolution some small building gaps and streets i e the flow propagation channels for the bb method were blocked following the resampling fig 11 owing to the blockage effect on the main streets and upstream building gaps the situation resulting from coarsening resolution 5 30 m caused overprediction of the inundation depth in both the upstream area region 1 in fig 9 and the main street of the flood propagation pathway but underestimation in the downstream area region 4 consequently the ieu became smaller with coarser resolution fig 10a owing to the lack of flow in areas with blocked building gaps and streets regions 3 and 4 in fig 9 statistics showed that the maximum frequency accounting for 53 of building gap width in tua was within the range of 5 10 m fig 2a this could explain the large rmseu obtained at 10 m resolution the results also suggested that the minimum computational size or minimum dem resolution for uff simulations employing the bb method should be smaller than the width of the gap between most buildings according to the arf wrf algorithm as the computational size increased the arf wrf method considered buildings by calculating different wrfs for eight sub cells based on the width of the building areas and the computational cell width consequent to achieving an equivalent effect at simulations with different dem resolution gaps in fig 5c e in regions 3 and 4 flow effectively passed through narrow gaps 5 m and cause inundation in all coarse resolution simulations 10 30 m using the arf wrf method region 3 in fig 8 conversely narrow gaps in region 3 were non flooding when using the bb method fig 9 consideration of flooding in narrow gaps was the main reason why the arf wrf method was less sensitive lower rmseu and higher fiu values than the bb method to dem resolution fig 10b and c the arf wrf method also had some sources of uncertainty as the resolution became coarser flow conveyance was potentially enlarged on section ab along the main street and greater flood volume could move in the direction of section bc fig 8 this situation directly decreased the flood volumes moving in other flow directions on sections bd and de resulting in an overprediction of inundation depth in region 2 and underprediction in region 4 in the centre of tua fig 8 a proportion of the flood volume could be stored inside building cells along the flood propagation pathway which might have enhanced the ie but reduced the flood volume accumulated in lower lying areas region 4 therefore both reasons caused the ieu to decrease with coarsening dem resolution when using the arf wrf method fig 10a it was also found that there were large differences in the semi closed building groups in region 3 when using the arf wrf method the variation trend of the maximum inundation depth of point f fig 12 was dissimilar to that at both point c increasing from 0 33 to 0 97 m and point e decreasing from 0 72 to 0 35 m with coarsening resolution fig 8 the maximum inundation depth of point f changed markedly at a resolution of 20 m figs 8 and 12 fig 12 illustrates that the direction of local flow in region 3 at coarse resolution 20 and 30 m was the opposite to that at 5 15 m resolution this can be explained by the disappearance of the building blockage effect at coarse resolution fig 5e when the computational cell was larger than the building width and it was split by the building see cells identified by red boxes in fig 12d and e with resolutions of 5 15 m flow could not enter into the building and therefore it propagated around the obstacle to reach the position of point f fig 12a c however this was not the situation for cases with a resolution of 20 and 30 m which allowed the flood flow to directly penetrate through the building cells to reach point f therefore changing the main direction of the flood flow produced large spatial variation in inundation depth figs 8 and 12 statistical analysis of building features showed that the building width in tua was mainly between 10 and 15 m fig 2b compared with cases with 5 15 m resolution computational cells were more likely to be divided by buildings at resolution of 20 and 30 m this could be the factor determining why the calculated rmseu and fiu values for the arf wrf method were sensitive at 20 m resolution in the current study this result also implied that building width was of great importance in affecting urban flood simulations adopting a dem resolution and computational cell width that are lower than the building width is recommended when using the arf wrf method 3 2 2 control group 2 fofs figs 13 and 14 show the spatial distribution of inundation depth at different dem resolutions for the arf wrf and bb methods respectively it can be seen that the ie increased with coarser resolution for both btms fig 10d in contrast to the spatial distribution of inundation depth in control group 1 the maximum inundation depth mostly increased with coarsening resolution 5 30 m within the ie figs 13 and 14 the average inundation depth of the selected 28 points fig 13 varied from 1 03 to 1 75 m and from 1 08 to 1 83 m with coarser resolution 5 30 m for the arf wrf and bb methods respectively poor performance was observed for both indicators fif and rmsef at coarse resolution fig 10e and f there were however some differences in terms of the indicators between btms for example the ief and fif values appeared to indicate that the arf wrf method was more sensitive than the bb method to resolution fig 10d and f however a larger rmsef was obtained with the bb method fig 10e previous studies suggested that variation in the cross sectional geometry of a river channel was the greatest source of error during resampling saksena and merwade 2015 podhorányi et al 2013 in this study two cross sectional elevation profiles derived at different dem resolutions were examined the profiles were located on the floodplain of the meixi river at points prone to overbank flooding fig 13a both cross sections x1 and x2 showed that the channel geometry was smoothed and the bottom elevation was raised after resampling fig 15a and b as the resolution became coarser the mean bank elevation of the meixi river illustrated that there was no specific trend in relation to resolution on either bank however the difference in mean elevation between the banks was reduced after resampling indicating that the channel bank geometry became unclear and diminished fig 15c therefore the cross sectional area and channel conveyance were both reduced at coarse resolution resulting in a greater overbank volume this was the fundamental reason for the expansion of ief and inundation depth furthermore the channel width at cross section x2 was 26 m fig 15b at 20 m resolution the elevation of the channel bottom was raised by more than 1 m although its thalweg remained however at 30 m resolution the channel geometry was completely smoothed fig 15b this indicated that the appropriate cell size or dem resolution should be smaller than the river width 3 2 3 overall scenario group combined performance of uffs and fofs in tua because of the contrasting effect of resolution on the ie for the uffs and fofs the ieo did not follow similar variations increasing or decreasing for the overall scenario group especially for the bb method fig 10g overall 70 points were selected within the main ie area fig 16a and used to evaluate the simulation errors rmseo comparison of the two btms in terms of the rmseo and fio values showed that the simulation errors of the arf wrf method were smaller than those of the bb method fig 10h and i the fi values of the uffs and fofs were 28 90 and 41 98 respectively fig 10c and f however the fio values of the overall performance in tua increased to 55 98 fig 10h this is because floods from the two directions became mixed and complemented each other in the lower lying area region 4 in the centre of tua consequently high fio values were obtained between the various resolutions and the spatial distributions of the inundation depth did not have major differences figs 16 and 17 the results also indicated that region 4 was the part of tua with the greatest uncertainty because it was vulnerable to the combined effects of flooding from multiple sources especially for the arf wrf method the inundation at points e and g in region 4 was attributable mainly to the uff volume from s1 in fine resolution simulations whereas it was dominated by the fof volume along the meixi river in coarse resolution simulations figs 8 13 16 and 18 although only a small difference in inundation depth was observed between the resolutions in terms of overall performance fig 18 the results of the overall scenario group masked the separate flooding processes uff and fof therefore the results suggested that simulation of urban inundation processes that is affected by multiple sources requires a dem with a resolution that is as fine as possible otherwise there will be both resolution simulation errors associated with resampling and also misrepresentation of the flooding source 4 discussion 4 1 uffs the results of the uffs demonstrated how different btms affect urban flood propagation and spatial inundation in relation to various dem resolutions the results of this study are generally consistent with those of previous studies that also applied the bb method to the urban scale schubert et al 2008 schubert and sanders 2012 the results of this study were generally consistent with those of previous studies that applied the bb method to the urban scale for instance xing et al 2019 and shen and tan 2020 made comparisons between the simulated maximum inundation depth and the field measured maximum inundation depth their results indicated that the simulated inundation depth in the upper area of the flood propagation pathway was overestimated whereas that in low lying areas was underestimated at coarser dem resolutions the results of this study demonstrated that the width of building gaps was the controlling factor in the bb method and confirmed the findings of previous studies that indicated that a resampling resolution coarser than the width of building gaps lead to poor performance bruwier et al 2018 gallegos et al 2009 shen and tan 2020 compared with the building hole method schubert and sanders 2012 and the arf wrf method haltas et al 2016 the bb method may not characterize the actual arrangement of buildings at coarse resolution thus the calculated error might only be acceptable at fine resolution schubert et al 2008 the arf wrf method can effectively consider small gaps by exploiting the advantage of sub cells hence its sensitivity and simulated errors at coarse resolutions are lower than those associated with the bb method chen et al 2012b schubert and sanders 2012 calculated the inundation extent simulated by different btms at coarser resolution it was found that the simulation results obtained using the bb method produced the smallest fi value and largest simulation error compared with the inundation extent recorded through field measurement this finding provides a possible explanation for the greater sensitivity of the bb method to dem resolution than that found for the arf wrf method in the present study the arf wrf method assumed that a computational cell could store water if the arf value was 1 additionally flow in the centre of a cell was allowed to pass through each sub cell if the wrf value of the sub cell was 0 9 this might have resulted in some errors at coarser resolution which included 1 more buildings being included in each computational cell leading to more water storage inside the building whereas it was non flooding at fine resolution 2 the flow propagation channels in the original building gaps were potentially amplified and the flow conveyance increased because the wrf values changed from 1 to 1 within the same cell figs 5c e and 3 the blockage effect of buildings disappeared and flow directions were changed owing to original single buildings bisecting a coarse cell fig 5e in this study the inundation depth of the low lying area was underpredicted and decreased with coarsening resolution for both btms however the main reasons for this similarity were distinct as previously mentioned the upper area was blocked in the bb method whereas the arf wrf method potentially enlarged the flow conveyance of channels and changed the flood flow direction propagating in wider places owing to the limited flood volume in the downstream area along the flood propagation paths no flood was observed in the low lying areas for both btms the arf wrf method has limitations regarding simulation at coarse resolutions in which the cell size is much larger than the building width evidence introduced by chen et al 2012b indicates that a building that splits a coarse computational cell changes the internal direction and movement of flow the results of this study showed that for all resolutions the arf wrf method produced a greater ie than that generated by the bb method fig 10a floodwater can pass through the interior of buildings in the arf wrf method which to some extent is similar to the building porosity method some earlier studies associated with urban flooding ozdemir et al 2013 gallegos et al 2009 showed increasing ie with coarsening resolution which is the converse of the results obtained in this study this might be the result of the scale effect associated with the micro topography and different btms used in their simulations 4 2 fofs numerous studies associated with fofs have documented how channel cross section geometry top width inundation depth and water stage vary when the resolution changes yu and lane 2006 sharma and regonda 2021 lim and brandt 2019 the increases in inundation depth and water stage at coarser resolution and larger computational cell size are mainly caused by the increase in riverbed elevation attributable to the smoothing effect after dem resampling this in turn causes reduction of channel flow conveyance that directly amplifies the ie and the inundation depth cook and merwade 2009 saksena and merwade 2015 podhorányi et al 2013 jung and jasinski 2015 indicated that simulation performance was acceptable when the dem resolution of the river channel was smaller than the average river width muthusamy et al 2021 demonstrated that the simulation rmse was magnified considerably when the dem resolution was greater than the river width in this study although the width of the meixi river varied in the range of 20 58 m in tua it is recommended that the dem resolution for fof simulation be less than the minimum width of 20 m otherwise the definition of the channel geometry including the thalweg was changed markedly and could even disappear the difference in mean bank elevation was reduced at coarser resolution which was consistent with the findings of jung and jasinski 2015 however the mean elevation of either bank did not exhibit a consistent trend of increase or decrease with coarsening resolution a possible explanation is that with a coarser dem resolution although most channel cells became elevated there were equal increases and decreases in the elevation of adjacent land cells muthusamy et al 2021 a previous study found that the ie and rmse increased linearly with dem resolution saksena and merwade 2015 however the present study did not find such a linear relationship at resolutions of 15 30 m fig 10d f especially for the bb method this discrepancy could be because the earlier study might not have considered the impact of buildings and infiltration on floodplains in rural fluvial flooding infiltration increases as the dem resolution and the size of the computational cells become coarser cao et al 2020 ghosh and hellweger 2012 there are potentially two possible reasons that could explain the results obtained in the current study infiltration of cropland and grassland on the floodplain along the meixi river fig 1d and the effect of buildings along the meixi river figs 13 and 14 as discussed in section 3 2 1 the bb method blocked the flow channel at 10 m resolution in the uffs owing to the sparse dispersion of buildings along the meixi river the blocked effect of the fofs appeared at 15 m resolution fig 10e and f therefore at resolutions of 15 30 m the overbank volume could not propagate into central parts of tua for the bb method and instead it accumulated on the low lying floodplain near the meixi river fig 14 for the arf wrf method greater flood volumes could be stored in the computational cells at 30 m resolution in comparison with that at 20 m resolution which might explain the negligible difference in rmsef between the resolutions of 20 and 30 m additionally there was a notable difference in the spatial distribution of inundation depth between the two btms figs 13 and 14 the ief value was smaller for the bb method while inundation depths at points located near the river were greater consequently a high fif value 0 6 was calculated at all resolutions for the bb method however this does not mean that the bb method is insensitive to dem resolution because the rmsef value produced by the bb method was much higher than that produced by the arf wrf method 4 3 combined performance the effects of dem resolution and size of computational cell on the simulation of inundation processes are usually regionally independent jung and jasinski 2015 for example areas with higher building density are more sensitive than areas with lower building density bruwier et al 2018 shen and tan 2020 the results of this study were different because tua is prone to flooding from multiple sources i e uffs and fofs here the dem resolution presented an opposite effect in terms of the ie and spatial distribution of inundation depth according to previous studies this might be attributable to the combined effects of different flood propagation behaviours topography and flooding sources muthusamy et al 2021 savage et al 2016 xing et al 2019 for the fofs the fluvial overbank volume was amplified remarkably in coarse resolution simulations overbank flow propagated by overcoming the slope from low lying areas to upper areas consequently increasing the inundation depth and ie for both btms however in the uffs the flood volume from s1 remained unchanged at all resolutions and the flow propagated by following the slope under the effects of gravity from upper areas to the low lying areas along the main street the flow pathway could become blocked and amplified by different btms at coarse resolutions therefore the inundation depth was overpredicted or underpredicted in different regions and the ie was decreased the results of the overall scenario group masked the combined inundation process responses to the btms and dem resolutions the results of this study suggest that urban floods from different directions that exhibit different propagation behaviours should be considered separately in inundation simulations this would help modellers and managers identify the dominant sources independent mechanisms and combined effects of inundation which would support the formulation of flood disaster reduction strategies and the adoption of mitigating measures to reduce the impact of the dominant flooding sources 5 conclusions this study conducted flood simulations for a mountain city threatened by uffs and fofs changes in flow pathway and inundation performance through the use of different btms definitions of river channel and distinctive flood propagation behaviours in response to different dem resolutions were clarified the optimal dem resolution was assessed for satisfactory inundation simulation for both uffss and fofss in the uffs the change in the local flood pathway caused by various btms at coarser dem resolution resulted in an underestimation of both the inundation extent and the inundation depth in low lying areas the simulation error was magnified considerably when the dem resolution was greater than the building width and gaps for the fofs as a result of the changed definition of the river channel and reduced channel conveyance at coarser resolution both the inundation extent and the inundation depth were overestimated a dem resolution smaller than the river width is recommended for fofs the ie and spatial inundation presented opposite effects in relation to different flood propagation behaviours uffs and fofs consequently the simulation error in the region where uffs and fofs were mixed masked the response of btms to various dem resolutions and could misrepresent the regionally dominant inundation sources the simulation of urban flooding is generally hindered by complexities associated with the underlying surface future works could focus on exploring the effect of using merged grids or merged dem resolutions for different land uses and regions in urban flood simulation as well as investigating the scale problems associated with the connection between merged grids and merged dem resolutions the error sources root causes and controlling factors of the effects of multiple flash flood simulations were recognised in our study the results provide a broader understanding of how changes associated with the btms and channel geometry in response to various dem resolutions play an important role in flood inundation mapping the key findings of this study could help modellers choose an appropriate dem resolution and btm for both uffs and fofs considering the availability of high

7889,study region a mountain city in the coastal region of southeast china study focus this study elucidated the effect of digital elevation model dem resolution on flood simulation errors and inundation depth distributions through building treatment methods and river channel definition the optimal dem resolution was evaluated to determine whether satisfactory inundation simulation could be achieved for urban flash flood simulation uffs and fluvial overbank flood simulation fofs new hydrological insights for the region uffs and fofs presented opposite effects regarding inundation extent and the spatial distribution of inundation depth with coarsening dem resolution in uffs the inundation extent and inundation depth in low lying areas of the flood propagation pathway were underestimated this effect was attributed to the change of local flood pathway caused by different treatment of buildings at coarser dem resolution the simulation error was magnified considerably when the dem resolution was greater than the building width and gaps in fofs owing to the changed channel geometry at coarser resolution the inundation extent and inundation depth were overestimated using a dem resolution and computational cell size that are lower than the river width is recommended this study illustrated that a regional scale effect dependent on regional flood propagation behaviour and the impact of land use and topography on the flood propagation pathway could be observed by coarsening the dem resolution of inundation simulations keywords urban flash flood fluvial overbank flood digital elevation models building treatment methods resolution urban flood processes 1 introduction the frequency magnitude and impact of flood events have increased markedly owing to ongoing rapid urbanization and climate change bayazit et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 flooding disasters are gaining widespread attention because of their increasing severity and the extent of the damage they cause altenau et al 2017 bruwier et al 2018 sharma and regonda 2021 china has suffered many severe flood disasters in recent years cao et al 2020 ma et al 2018 mei et al 2020 shen and tan 2020 xing et al 2019 according to the ministry of emergency management of china in 2020 38 26 million people were affected by floods that caused economic losses of 109 7 billion chinese yuan numerical simulation is recognized as a reliable tool for flood forecasting and inundation mapping which is important for flood risk management and local disaster reduction gallegos et al 2009 saksena and merwade 2015 however owing to the lack of available high resolution data and the complexity of the underlying surface of urban environments accurate modelling and forecasting of urban floods remain challenging tasks for researchers and policy makers many studies have proposed and developed different hydrological modelling approaches to estimate hydrological input data for small scale and ungauged basins grimaldi et al 2013 introduced a fully continuous hydrologic hydraulic modelling framework for flood mapping in an ungauged basin for an event based approach the designed inflow hydrographic data and rainstorm data for each return period can be estimated using a width function based instantaneous unit hydrograph and intensity duration frequency curves respectively vojtek et al 2019 among the various sources of uncertainty in terms of model structure and model parameters topographic data have been identified as a one of the major contributors to flood simulation accuracy altenau et al 2017 lim and brandt 2019 sharma and regonda 2021 generally a flood inundation area is delineated using topographic data provided by a digital elevation model dem the characteristics of the dem have been proven to have a considerable effect on model performance shen and tan 2020 advances in the collection of high resolution data and the emergence of lidar technology have promoted the widespread application of dem products with varying resolution and vertical accuracy to numerical simulation of flooding leitão and sousa 2018 for example nardi et al 2019 developed a new dem product that could identify a floodplain boundary using a geospatial tool additionally quantitative comparison indicated that dems derived using data acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles could be an appropriate alternative to lidar derived products for flood mapping in small scale and ungauged basins annis et al 2020 high resolution dem data are assumed more accurate in describing the underlying surface and in reproducing small scale flow paths such that simulation results would be expected to have less error and uncertainty altenau et al 2017 kim et al 2021 yu and lane 2006 however previous studies that compared the differences between dem data products and sources in relation to flood simulation performance reported that both the quality and the accuracy of the dem were more relevant than the dem resolution ali et al 2015 talchabhadel et al 2021 in addition fine resolution models are sensitive to vertical errors in dem data but such sensitivity is reduced at low resolution jung and jasinski 2015 given the financial challenges associated with producing high resolution dems with a large spatial extent especially in developing countries many studies have investigated how to determine the optimal resolution for a certain scale and computational cost muthusamy et al 2021 for example a previous study evaluated the trade off relationship between dem resolution vertical accuracy and simulation error for a large floodplain jung and jasinski 2015 on a small scale several earlier studies demonstrated that a 5 m resolution dem was sufficient to provide an acceptable performance of numerical simulation of urban floods gallegos et al 2009 shen and tan 2020 xing et al 2019 previous studies associated with the effect of dem resolution on surface flood modelling mainly consist of two types depending on flood event and scale fluvial overbank flood fof modelling and urban flash flood uff modelling sharma and regonda 2021 david and schmalz 2021 xing et al 2019 the inundation extent ie and the average water stage were found to increase linearly with dem resolution in fof modelling saksena and merwade 2015 the topography of both the cross sectional and the longitudinal profiles of the channel varied with coarser resolution podhorányi et al 2013 while the main source of simulation error was the increase in elevation of most channel cells muthusamy et al 2021 moreover some studies that combined different resolutions and roughness found that the inundation area was highly sensitive to roughness variation in fine models with high resolution lim and brandt 2019 in uff modelling despite the relatively small scale from community level to several square kilometres hydrodynamic simulation and flow propagation are complicated owing to factors such as buildings underground drainage systems and streets yin et al 2016 xing et al 2021 for example at low spatial resolution drainage systems will increase the peak discharge because the effective impervious area is reduced krebs et al 2014 earlier studies demonstrated that buildings present a combined effect of storage blocking and resistance that can substantially affect flood volume and flow propagation bruwier et al 2018 shen and tan 2020 for flood modelling of urban areas several building treatment methods btms have been proposed e g the building resistance building block bb building hole and building porosity methods akoh et al 2017 gayer et al 2010 liang et al 2015 comprehensive comparison of the simulation results achieved for each btm at different dem resolutions is summarised in both schubert and sanders 2012 and schubert et al 2008 the bb method has greater sensitivity as grid resolution coarsens which results in greater range of underestimation therefore to better express flood behaviour between buildings and streets it is necessary for the computational cell size and the dem resolution to be smaller than the building scale shen and tan 2020 chen et al 2012a proposed a new layer regarding building features that adopts an area reduction factor width reduction factor arf wrf approach to characterize the effect of storage and resistance of buildings which has been proven to provide acceptable performance at coarse resolutions most previous studies investigated the response of either uffs or rural fofs to dem resolution but few studies have investigated the combined effect of multiple flood sources surface flooding behaviour shows an opposite effect regarding dem resolution i e peak flow is reduced at coarser resolution for larger storms but enhanced for smaller storms cao et al 2020 ghosh and hellweger 2012 even for the same inundation indicators studies have reported contrasting model performance with coarser dem resolution for example muthusamy et al 2021 reported that inundation depth increases with dem resolution in the range of 1 50 m however ozdemir et al 2013 found that inundation depth decreases with dem resolution in the range of 0 1 1 m even for the same inundation indicators earlier studies have reported contrasting model performances with coarser dem resolution this inconsistency requires more detailed analysis that should not only explore the results but also identify the root causes and key influencing factors of the observed differences such in depth analyses are relatively scarce in most previous studies the resolution of a dem also has a regional scale effect that is strongly affected by land use and terrain jung and jasinski 2015 for example channels with a greater slope will show more errors after resampling saksena and merwade 2015 and areas with greater building density are more sensitive to dem resolution compared with suburbs shen and tan 2020 a river and a developed area might exhibit different behaviours in terms of flood propagation when studied using different dems with different resolutions muthusamy et al 2021 most of the studies mentioned above only analysed the effect of dem resolution on individual environmental factors clarifying the changes in flow pathway and inundation performance by exploring additional factors that include btms definition of the river channel and distinctive flood propagation behaviours will help improve understanding of the effect of dem resolution on urban flood properties the current study investigated the separate and combined effects of dem resolution and btms on flood properties and simulation performance for a small city that is prone to flooding from multiple sources with different flood propagation behaviours i e uffs and fofs the objectives were as follows 1 to examine the effect of dem resolution and btms on flood performance including ie and the spatial distribution of inundation depth and to compare the sensitivity of different btms to dem resolution 2 to identify the separate and combined effects of different flood propagation behaviours uffs and fofs in response to different dem resolutions and 3 to reveal the appropriate dem resolution required to simulate cases of uffs and fofs and their controlling factors the current study provides a broader understanding of how btms and channel geometry change with various dem resolutions thereby providing important guidance for flood inundation mapping the key findings of this study could facilitate selection of the optimal dem resolution for the simulation of both uffs and fofs in areas where fine topographic data are unavailable 2 study area materials and methodologies 2 1 study area the meixi basin is a small scale area 101 km2 mountainous basin located in the coastal area of southeast china fig 1a c the main land use types are forest and cultivated land an alluvial plain is located in the lower reaches of the basin where an urbanised area that has a large proportion of impervious surface is located fig 1d the meixi basin can be characterised as either mountainous area or urbanised area on the basis of the marked spatial differences in topography land use and flood risk fig 1c using the spatial analysis tools in arcgis 10 2 the mountainous area was divided into five sub basins s1 s5 on the basis of terrain bajabaa et al 2014 the meixi river and the siduxi river that originate from s2 and s5 respectively both discharge into the dongxi river which marks the outlet of the meixi basin sub basins s1 s3 and s4 are relatively small and have no natural river channel however the urbanised area tua is affected by flash floods associated with these sub basins when rainstorm events occur fig 1d tua comprises a town that covers an area of 5 4 km2 with low elevation dense building coverage and a large proportion of impervious surface sub basins s1 s5 area 1 4 55 6 km2 are characterised by steep slopes fast flow and rapid convergence that can produce flash floods within a short lag time table 1 consequently multiple floods including flash flooding from s1 and overbank flooding along the meixi river have a major impact on tua the study area which is characterised by a subtropical marine monsoon climate with annual precipitation of 1000 1800 mm is typically affected by 2 3 typhoons annually ma et al 2018 mei et al 2020 in september 2016 typhoon molanti brought total rainfall of 259 mm that caused catastrophic flooding in the meixi basin that persisted for 16 h hereafter referred to as rainstorm 20160915 in total 13 people were declared missing or killed and there were economic losses of 6 billion chinese yuan in the current tua was considered to have practical value for investigating the combined effect of flood properties in relation to different propagation behaviours and btms 2 2 data collection and pre processing 2 2 1 topographic and building data in november 2018 unmanned aerial vehicle oblique photographic technology was used to collect high resolution dem data and high definition imagery 5 m resolution of tua additionally polygon feature layers of land use types and building features including geometric and positional information of tua were depicted manually according to the high definition images and validated on the basis of google street view using arcgis 10 2 tua comprises 1196 architectural features and statistics were generated regarding the size of gap between buildings and the width of separate buildings fig 2 which could affect floodwater propagation bruwier et al 2018 the gap between buildings was evaluated on the basis of the minimum gap between adjacent pairs of buildings as determined from the building contours using the geographic information system processing methods described by fewtrell et al 2008 to determine the width of individual buildings each building was approximated as a rectangle and the shortest dimension of each rectangle was obtained from the polygonal area and perimeter information shen and tan 2020 fig 2a shows that the vast majority 95 of building gaps are 5 m gallegos et al 2009 stipulated that urban inundation simulation requires at least one mesh to be set within the building gap which implies that the original 5 m resolution data were sufficient to meet this requirements in relation to tua 2 2 2 drainage system data drainage system data including geographic and geometric information on pipes and manholes were provided by the local drainage management bureau pipe diameters are in the range of 300 1200 mm and pipe slopes are in the range of 0 1 2 5 the drainage system of the dongxi river which includes 229 manholes and 10 outfalls o1 o10 has a drainage network density of 5 22 km km2 fig 1d the capacity of the underground drainage system is inadequate and the system has been mismanaged since it was constructed in the 1990 s it should be noted that the design drainage pipe standard in tua is only for average annual rainfall levels 2 2 3 hydrological data for the selected flood event according to a report of historical flood events provided by the local honglai hydrological gauging station the recent catastrophic flooding associated with rainstorm 20160915 caused the greatest amount of damage and the highest economic losses in the meixi basin during the last 60 years one of the most important reasons for opting to study this event was the availability of a suitable volume of detailed measured data the rainstorm data 1 h interval were obtained from the honglai hydrological gauging station fig 1c the hydrological model was calibrated and verified for each ungauged sub basin s1 s5 in the mountainous area owing to a lack of discharge data jiang et al 2020 hence external flash flood data relating to s1 s5 during the event were calculated using corresponding precipitation data fig 3 to provide the inflow hydrography at the boundary between each of the five sub basins and tua fig 1d the water stage data observed at the honglai hydrological gauging station and the differences along the dongxi river honglai section were also collected from the same station and the local drainage management bureau the water stage at specific locations o1 o10 along the dongxi river were estimated and set as the downstream boundary conditions for both the drainage system outfalls and the meixi river additionally historical inundation traces recorded during rainstorm 20160915 in tua were used for verification the maximum inundation depth at 10 different locations was estimated from flood traces on buildings during field investigation 2 3 methodologies 2 3 1 flo 2d model flo 2d is a raster based hydrodynamic model that can describe in detail the flow wave propagation of a channel and floodplain flo 2d software inc 2009 it has been used widely to simulate of mountainous storm surges and river channel overbank inundations dimitriadis et al 2016 grimaldi et al 2013 peng and lu 2013 multiple flood hydrographs can be introduced to the system either as floodplain or channel inflow in this study flo 2d was used for floodplain inundation simulation induced by uffs and fofs in tua the equations of motion are applied by computing independently the average flow velocity across each one of eight potential flow directions flo 2d software inc 2009 the governing equations are as follows 1 h t h v x 0 2 h x v g v x 1 g v t s o s f where h is flow depth m v is the depth averaged velocity in one of the eight flow directions x m s s f and s o represent the friction slope and the corresponding bed slope in one of the eight flow directions respectively and g is gravitational acceleration m s2 for a floodplain with a multi direction flow model the equations of motion in flo 2d are applied by computing the average flow velocity across a cell element boundary in one direction at a time there are eight potential flow directions north east south west northeast southeast southwest and northwest within one square computational cell thus each velocity computation is essentially a one dimensional problem that is solved independently of the other seven directions 2 3 2 hec ras for consideration of channels the flo 2d model incorporates hec ras software flo 2d software inc 2009 that employs 1 dimensional flood routing in both steady and unsteady flow conditions by applying an implicit forward finite difference scheme between successive natural cross sections of flexible geometry additional details regarding hec ras can be found in dimitriadis et al 2016 and podhorányi et al 2013 hec ras fluvial flooding requires two main inputs channel cross section geometry and river boundary conditions a previous study provided 55 geometric cross sections for a river with a length of 6 5 km for river floodplain inundation simulations cook and merwade 2009 in all 65 geometric cross sections which were extracted from the original dem data were imported for the meixi river 4 6 km and the siduxi river fig 1d reflecting the number of geometric cross sections considered sufficient for fluvial flood modelling in this study the upstream inflow hydrography of sub basins s2 and s5 and the downstream water stages were discussed in section 2 2 2 fig 3 in the flo 2d model fofs is computed when the channel capacity is exceeded channel floodplain exchange is computed for each channel bank element on the basis of the potential water surface elevation difference between the channel and the floodplain grid element containing either channel bank fig 4a the velocity of either the channel overbank flow or the return flow to the channel is computed using the diffusive wave momentum equation it is assumed that the overbank flow velocity is relatively small and thus acceleration terms are negligible for the return flow to the channel if the channel water surface is lower than the bank elevation the bank elevation is used to compute the return flow velocity 2 3 3 swmm the flo 2d model is internally coupled with the modular epa swmm flo 2d software inc 2009 swmm is a dynamic hydrology hydraulic water quality model that is used worldwide chen et al 2018 in this study sewer flow in the underground drainage system and node overflow to the surface were simulated using the swmm module in flo 2d the swmm module solves the saint venant equations using the implicit finite difference method the governing equations are as follows 3 a t q x 0 4 1 ga q t q ga x q a h x s 0 s f where q is the flow rate m3 s a is the flow cross sectional area m2 x is the longitudinal distance m h is the hydraulic head of water in the conduit m g is gravitational acceleration m s2 s f is the friction slope and s 0 is the slope of the pipe in the flo 2d model floodplain runoff discharge from the surface enters the pipeline system at inlets the inlet discharge is imposed as a surface water boundary condition that is passed to the storm drain layer for routing by the swmm module weir and orifice equations are used to calculate the inflow discharge under inlet control flo 2d software inc 2009 if the drainage system is surcharged excess water that overflows from the manholes to the surface might exacerbate urban inundation fig 4b hence the linkages between the surface and underground drainage systems channel and floodplain were considered bidirectionally in tua fig 4c 2 3 4 building treatment methods buildings account for a considerable proportion of an urban area and their walls usually prevent incursion of floodwater into their interior spaces thus water flows around buildings rather than into or through them unless their entrances are left open or the water level exceeds the crest height of any entrances in this study two btms were considered the bb and arf wrf methods the bb method is used in combination with the building height or raised ground elevation of areas containing buildings to characterize the physical situation in overland flow modelling shen and tan 2020 in implementing the bb method meshes inside buildings were regarded as blocks and non flooding zones in the flo 2d model the influence of buildings on flood propagation was modelled using the arf wrf method chen et al 2012a haltas et al 2016 the arf is a parameter that accounts for the reduced area of the computational domain occupied by buildings which is calculated using the mass conservation equation in the numerical scheme flo 2d software inc 2009 the arf parameter represents the ratio of the total area intersected by buildings to the total cell area as expressed in eq 5 and illustrated in fig 5a 5 arf total intersected area cell area area a area b area c cell area where arf is a dimensionless parameter that varies in the range of 0 1 total intersected area and cell area are the building area m2 and the total area m2 of one computational cell respectively the arf parameter is equal to 0 if there are no buildings obstructions in a cell and equal to 1 if the cell is completely occupied by a building although the arf parameter reflects the amount of water that one cell could store it cannot describe the diverse flow possibilities produced by the various alignments and locations of buildings inside a cell to distinguish the locations of different buildings the wrf parameter was adopted to represent the maximum occupancy ratios of buildings inside a cell in the flo 2d model one computational cell can be divided into nine sub cells and the wrf value of each sub cell refers to the percentage of the blockage in each direction flow from the centre of a cell is allowed to pass through eight possible directions depending on the wrf value of each sub cell fig 5b the wrf value for each sub cell can be calculated using eq 6 6 wrf subcell intersected subcell area subcell area where wrf is a dimensionless parameter that varies in the range of 0 1 wrfsubcell is the wrf value of one of the sub cells inside a computational cell intersected subcell area and subcell area are the intersected building area m2 and the corresponding area m2 of the same sub cell respectively the wrf algorithm assumes that flow from the centre of a cell cannot pass through a sub cell southeast direction in fig 5b of the cell itself or a neighbouring sub cell west direction in fig 5b that has a wrf value of 0 9 the arf wrf combination describes the effects of building blockage and alignment such that the flow predicted using this method is close to reality chen et al 2012b 2 3 5 model performance as mentioned in section 2 1 the surface inundation of tua is affected by multiple sources including uffs from s1 and fofs along the meixi river fig 1 given the actual situation of tua in terms of the interaction and mixing of floodwater from both sources it is difficult to identify the inundation process under different dem resolutions and btms previous studies suggested that uffs and fofs might have different inundation propagation behaviours and simulation results muthusamy et al 2021 savage et al 2016 xing et al 2019 therefore the two flooding processes were considered separately and the derived results were compared the uff simulation uffs was regarded as control group 1 inundation was affected only by the hydrography of s1 the fof simulation fofs was regarded as control group 2 inundation was affected by the hydrography of s2 s5 and the actual inundation of tua by all flood sources was regarded as the overall scenario group inundation was affected by the hydrography of s1 s5 fig 3 each simulation group had 10 scenarios 2 types of btm with 5 dem resolutions it should be noted that all physical processes and parameters other than the flood source remained unchanged for all 30 scenarios to compare the results obtained using different dem resolutions and btms for each simulation the commonly used root mean square error rmse of the maximum inundation depth was assessed the calculation is as follows 7 rmse i 1 n d i s d i b 2 n where d s and d b indicate the simulated and observed maximum inundation depth respectively and n is the number of selected sampling points for other scenarios at coarse resolutions the maximum inundation depth of the high resolution benchmark model was used to indicate d b a fit index fi analysis was conducted to compare the spatial inundation results the fi value is a measure of the error between reference and predicted flood areas muthusamy et al 2021 8 fit index f i a p a r a p a r 100 where ap and ar represent the predicted flood area and the reference flood area respectively essentially fi varies from 0 no model fit to 1 100 model fit based on the inundation area between the reference and predicted maps in this study the reference flood area was represented by the inundation map of the benchmark model 3 results 3 1 benchmark simulation and model verification the benchmark simulation conducted to reproduce the extreme events of rainstorm 20160915 in tua was performed using the original 5 m dem data for the arf wrf and bb methods adopting 5 m resolution computational cells 206 833 square meshes were generated and the infiltration rate was calculated using the green ampt method flo 2d software inc 2009 the roughness of different land use types underground drainage pipes and the green ampt infiltration parameters in tua are listed in table 2 all of which were based on the flo 2d user manual and previous studies chen et al 2018 gayer et al 2010 muthusamy et al 2021 the maximum inundation map produced using the arf wrf method is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that surface inundation in tua had two primary components flash flooding from sub basin s1 and overbank flooding along the meixi river the flash flooding from sub basin s1 mainly propagated along the main street mixed with the overbank flooding from the meixi river and finally resulted in inundation accumulation in the low lying central areas of tua fig 6 the flo 2d model was verified using the 10 recorded inundation traces fig 6 the results indicated a satisfactory performance for the two btms with rmse values of 0 13 and 0 19 for the arf wrf and the bb method respectively fig 7 the smaller rmse value for the arf wrf method suggested that the simulation of inundation in tua was more accurate compared with that of the bb method this might show that the bb method cannot provide appropriate results for very small building gaps compared with other studies associated with urban flood modelling the calculated rmse value of the simulation associated with the arf wrf method and the original 5 m resolution dem is lower than that reported by both xing et al 2019 and cheng et al 2020 evidence from in previous studies confirms that a dem with 5 m resolution is adequate for urban flood simulations gallegos et al 2009 shen and tan 2020 which suggests that the simulation result obtained in the current study using the original 5 m resolution dem is reliable hence the arf wrf method with the 5 m resolution dem was taken as the benchmark for subsequent scenarios 3 2 sensitivity of the urban flood process to dem resolution with different btms because of the low capacity of the underground drainage system in tua the impact of the drainage system is negligible jiang et al 2020 therefore this study focused mainly on the surface inundation and little attention was given to the performance of the underground drainage system previous studies demonstrated that bilinear interpolation methods gave the best performance among the available resampling techniques jung and jasinski 2015 shen and tan 2020 to identify the effect of different btms on the urban flooding process at different dem resolutions dem data with coarser resolution 10 15 20 and 30 m were generated from the original 5 m resolution dem using bilinear interpolation the computational cell size was consistent with the dem resolution for each simulation i e a 10 m cell size corresponded to a 10 m resolution dem because only a limited number of inundation traces six points in the centre of tua and four points near the meixi river were recorded fig 6 and previous studies have indicated that a small number of samples might not reflect the full extent of inundation xing et al 2019 dozens of additional points including the original 10 inundation traces were selected from the verified benchmark model figs 8 and 9 the selected points which covered most of the main area of inundation were used for subsequent comparison and calculation of the simulation error rmse between the benchmark model 5 m and the other scenarios with coarser resolutions 10 30 m 3 2 1 control group 1 uffs figs 8 and 9 show the spatial distributions of the inundation depth simulated using the arf wrf and bb methods respectively with various dem resolutions generally both btms produced similar results that showed a decrease in ie with coarsening of the dem resolution fig 10a similarly both btms underestimate the inundation depth in lower areas region 4 in fig 8 of the flood propagation pathway at coarse resolution figs 8 and 9 additionally the rmse rmseu values calculated using the 42 selected points fig 8 and the fi values fiu for control group 1 uffs indicated that the bb method was more sensitive than the arf wrf method to dem resolution fig 10b and c the rmseu of the bb method increased markedly from 0 13 to 0 56 m when the dem resolution changed from 5 to 10 m indicating that the resolution of 10 m was of concern fig 10b by contrast the rmseu values were small 0 18 m when the dem resolution changed from 5 to 15 m for the arf wrf method however relatively large rmseu increments were obtained at 20 m suggesting this was the tipping point for the arf wrf method fig 10b in the bb method the arrangement of buildings and elevation of the main streets were changed simultaneously with the resampled dem resolution fig 11 compared with the original arrangement and location of building features the buildings show considerable differences at coarser resolutions even at 10 m resolution some small building gaps and streets i e the flow propagation channels for the bb method were blocked following the resampling fig 11 owing to the blockage effect on the main streets and upstream building gaps the situation resulting from coarsening resolution 5 30 m caused overprediction of the inundation depth in both the upstream area region 1 in fig 9 and the main street of the flood propagation pathway but underestimation in the downstream area region 4 consequently the ieu became smaller with coarser resolution fig 10a owing to the lack of flow in areas with blocked building gaps and streets regions 3 and 4 in fig 9 statistics showed that the maximum frequency accounting for 53 of building gap width in tua was within the range of 5 10 m fig 2a this could explain the large rmseu obtained at 10 m resolution the results also suggested that the minimum computational size or minimum dem resolution for uff simulations employing the bb method should be smaller than the width of the gap between most buildings according to the arf wrf algorithm as the computational size increased the arf wrf method considered buildings by calculating different wrfs for eight sub cells based on the width of the building areas and the computational cell width consequent to achieving an equivalent effect at simulations with different dem resolution gaps in fig 5c e in regions 3 and 4 flow effectively passed through narrow gaps 5 m and cause inundation in all coarse resolution simulations 10 30 m using the arf wrf method region 3 in fig 8 conversely narrow gaps in region 3 were non flooding when using the bb method fig 9 consideration of flooding in narrow gaps was the main reason why the arf wrf method was less sensitive lower rmseu and higher fiu values than the bb method to dem resolution fig 10b and c the arf wrf method also had some sources of uncertainty as the resolution became coarser flow conveyance was potentially enlarged on section ab along the main street and greater flood volume could move in the direction of section bc fig 8 this situation directly decreased the flood volumes moving in other flow directions on sections bd and de resulting in an overprediction of inundation depth in region 2 and underprediction in region 4 in the centre of tua fig 8 a proportion of the flood volume could be stored inside building cells along the flood propagation pathway which might have enhanced the ie but reduced the flood volume accumulated in lower lying areas region 4 therefore both reasons caused the ieu to decrease with coarsening dem resolution when using the arf wrf method fig 10a it was also found that there were large differences in the semi closed building groups in region 3 when using the arf wrf method the variation trend of the maximum inundation depth of point f fig 12 was dissimilar to that at both point c increasing from 0 33 to 0 97 m and point e decreasing from 0 72 to 0 35 m with coarsening resolution fig 8 the maximum inundation depth of point f changed markedly at a resolution of 20 m figs 8 and 12 fig 12 illustrates that the direction of local flow in region 3 at coarse resolution 20 and 30 m was the opposite to that at 5 15 m resolution this can be explained by the disappearance of the building blockage effect at coarse resolution fig 5e when the computational cell was larger than the building width and it was split by the building see cells identified by red boxes in fig 12d and e with resolutions of 5 15 m flow could not enter into the building and therefore it propagated around the obstacle to reach the position of point f fig 12a c however this was not the situation for cases with a resolution of 20 and 30 m which allowed the flood flow to directly penetrate through the building cells to reach point f therefore changing the main direction of the flood flow produced large spatial variation in inundation depth figs 8 and 12 statistical analysis of building features showed that the building width in tua was mainly between 10 and 15 m fig 2b compared with cases with 5 15 m resolution computational cells were more likely to be divided by buildings at resolution of 20 and 30 m this could be the factor determining why the calculated rmseu and fiu values for the arf wrf method were sensitive at 20 m resolution in the current study this result also implied that building width was of great importance in affecting urban flood simulations adopting a dem resolution and computational cell width that are lower than the building width is recommended when using the arf wrf method 3 2 2 control group 2 fofs figs 13 and 14 show the spatial distribution of inundation depth at different dem resolutions for the arf wrf and bb methods respectively it can be seen that the ie increased with coarser resolution for both btms fig 10d in contrast to the spatial distribution of inundation depth in control group 1 the maximum inundation depth mostly increased with coarsening resolution 5 30 m within the ie figs 13 and 14 the average inundation depth of the selected 28 points fig 13 varied from 1 03 to 1 75 m and from 1 08 to 1 83 m with coarser resolution 5 30 m for the arf wrf and bb methods respectively poor performance was observed for both indicators fif and rmsef at coarse resolution fig 10e and f there were however some differences in terms of the indicators between btms for example the ief and fif values appeared to indicate that the arf wrf method was more sensitive than the bb method to resolution fig 10d and f however a larger rmsef was obtained with the bb method fig 10e previous studies suggested that variation in the cross sectional geometry of a river channel was the greatest source of error during resampling saksena and merwade 2015 podhorányi et al 2013 in this study two cross sectional elevation profiles derived at different dem resolutions were examined the profiles were located on the floodplain of the meixi river at points prone to overbank flooding fig 13a both cross sections x1 and x2 showed that the channel geometry was smoothed and the bottom elevation was raised after resampling fig 15a and b as the resolution became coarser the mean bank elevation of the meixi river illustrated that there was no specific trend in relation to resolution on either bank however the difference in mean elevation between the banks was reduced after resampling indicating that the channel bank geometry became unclear and diminished fig 15c therefore the cross sectional area and channel conveyance were both reduced at coarse resolution resulting in a greater overbank volume this was the fundamental reason for the expansion of ief and inundation depth furthermore the channel width at cross section x2 was 26 m fig 15b at 20 m resolution the elevation of the channel bottom was raised by more than 1 m although its thalweg remained however at 30 m resolution the channel geometry was completely smoothed fig 15b this indicated that the appropriate cell size or dem resolution should be smaller than the river width 3 2 3 overall scenario group combined performance of uffs and fofs in tua because of the contrasting effect of resolution on the ie for the uffs and fofs the ieo did not follow similar variations increasing or decreasing for the overall scenario group especially for the bb method fig 10g overall 70 points were selected within the main ie area fig 16a and used to evaluate the simulation errors rmseo comparison of the two btms in terms of the rmseo and fio values showed that the simulation errors of the arf wrf method were smaller than those of the bb method fig 10h and i the fi values of the uffs and fofs were 28 90 and 41 98 respectively fig 10c and f however the fio values of the overall performance in tua increased to 55 98 fig 10h this is because floods from the two directions became mixed and complemented each other in the lower lying area region 4 in the centre of tua consequently high fio values were obtained between the various resolutions and the spatial distributions of the inundation depth did not have major differences figs 16 and 17 the results also indicated that region 4 was the part of tua with the greatest uncertainty because it was vulnerable to the combined effects of flooding from multiple sources especially for the arf wrf method the inundation at points e and g in region 4 was attributable mainly to the uff volume from s1 in fine resolution simulations whereas it was dominated by the fof volume along the meixi river in coarse resolution simulations figs 8 13 16 and 18 although only a small difference in inundation depth was observed between the resolutions in terms of overall performance fig 18 the results of the overall scenario group masked the separate flooding processes uff and fof therefore the results suggested that simulation of urban inundation processes that is affected by multiple sources requires a dem with a resolution that is as fine as possible otherwise there will be both resolution simulation errors associated with resampling and also misrepresentation of the flooding source 4 discussion 4 1 uffs the results of the uffs demonstrated how different btms affect urban flood propagation and spatial inundation in relation to various dem resolutions the results of this study are generally consistent with those of previous studies that also applied the bb method to the urban scale schubert et al 2008 schubert and sanders 2012 the results of this study were generally consistent with those of previous studies that applied the bb method to the urban scale for instance xing et al 2019 and shen and tan 2020 made comparisons between the simulated maximum inundation depth and the field measured maximum inundation depth their results indicated that the simulated inundation depth in the upper area of the flood propagation pathway was overestimated whereas that in low lying areas was underestimated at coarser dem resolutions the results of this study demonstrated that the width of building gaps was the controlling factor in the bb method and confirmed the findings of previous studies that indicated that a resampling resolution coarser than the width of building gaps lead to poor performance bruwier et al 2018 gallegos et al 2009 shen and tan 2020 compared with the building hole method schubert and sanders 2012 and the arf wrf method haltas et al 2016 the bb method may not characterize the actual arrangement of buildings at coarse resolution thus the calculated error might only be acceptable at fine resolution schubert et al 2008 the arf wrf method can effectively consider small gaps by exploiting the advantage of sub cells hence its sensitivity and simulated errors at coarse resolutions are lower than those associated with the bb method chen et al 2012b schubert and sanders 2012 calculated the inundation extent simulated by different btms at coarser resolution it was found that the simulation results obtained using the bb method produced the smallest fi value and largest simulation error compared with the inundation extent recorded through field measurement this finding provides a possible explanation for the greater sensitivity of the bb method to dem resolution than that found for the arf wrf method in the present study the arf wrf method assumed that a computational cell could store water if the arf value was 1 additionally flow in the centre of a cell was allowed to pass through each sub cell if the wrf value of the sub cell was 0 9 this might have resulted in some errors at coarser resolution which included 1 more buildings being included in each computational cell leading to more water storage inside the building whereas it was non flooding at fine resolution 2 the flow propagation channels in the original building gaps were potentially amplified and the flow conveyance increased because the wrf values changed from 1 to 1 within the same cell figs 5c e and 3 the blockage effect of buildings disappeared and flow directions were changed owing to original single buildings bisecting a coarse cell fig 5e in this study the inundation depth of the low lying area was underpredicted and decreased with coarsening resolution for both btms however the main reasons for this similarity were distinct as previously mentioned the upper area was blocked in the bb method whereas the arf wrf method potentially enlarged the flow conveyance of channels and changed the flood flow direction propagating in wider places owing to the limited flood volume in the downstream area along the flood propagation paths no flood was observed in the low lying areas for both btms the arf wrf method has limitations regarding simulation at coarse resolutions in which the cell size is much larger than the building width evidence introduced by chen et al 2012b indicates that a building that splits a coarse computational cell changes the internal direction and movement of flow the results of this study showed that for all resolutions the arf wrf method produced a greater ie than that generated by the bb method fig 10a floodwater can pass through the interior of buildings in the arf wrf method which to some extent is similar to the building porosity method some earlier studies associated with urban flooding ozdemir et al 2013 gallegos et al 2009 showed increasing ie with coarsening resolution which is the converse of the results obtained in this study this might be the result of the scale effect associated with the micro topography and different btms used in their simulations 4 2 fofs numerous studies associated with fofs have documented how channel cross section geometry top width inundation depth and water stage vary when the resolution changes yu and lane 2006 sharma and regonda 2021 lim and brandt 2019 the increases in inundation depth and water stage at coarser resolution and larger computational cell size are mainly caused by the increase in riverbed elevation attributable to the smoothing effect after dem resampling this in turn causes reduction of channel flow conveyance that directly amplifies the ie and the inundation depth cook and merwade 2009 saksena and merwade 2015 podhorányi et al 2013 jung and jasinski 2015 indicated that simulation performance was acceptable when the dem resolution of the river channel was smaller than the average river width muthusamy et al 2021 demonstrated that the simulation rmse was magnified considerably when the dem resolution was greater than the river width in this study although the width of the meixi river varied in the range of 20 58 m in tua it is recommended that the dem resolution for fof simulation be less than the minimum width of 20 m otherwise the definition of the channel geometry including the thalweg was changed markedly and could even disappear the difference in mean bank elevation was reduced at coarser resolution which was consistent with the findings of jung and jasinski 2015 however the mean elevation of either bank did not exhibit a consistent trend of increase or decrease with coarsening resolution a possible explanation is that with a coarser dem resolution although most channel cells became elevated there were equal increases and decreases in the elevation of adjacent land cells muthusamy et al 2021 a previous study found that the ie and rmse increased linearly with dem resolution saksena and merwade 2015 however the present study did not find such a linear relationship at resolutions of 15 30 m fig 10d f especially for the bb method this discrepancy could be because the earlier study might not have considered the impact of buildings and infiltration on floodplains in rural fluvial flooding infiltration increases as the dem resolution and the size of the computational cells become coarser cao et al 2020 ghosh and hellweger 2012 there are potentially two possible reasons that could explain the results obtained in the current study infiltration of cropland and grassland on the floodplain along the meixi river fig 1d and the effect of buildings along the meixi river figs 13 and 14 as discussed in section 3 2 1 the bb method blocked the flow channel at 10 m resolution in the uffs owing to the sparse dispersion of buildings along the meixi river the blocked effect of the fofs appeared at 15 m resolution fig 10e and f therefore at resolutions of 15 30 m the overbank volume could not propagate into central parts of tua for the bb method and instead it accumulated on the low lying floodplain near the meixi river fig 14 for the arf wrf method greater flood volumes could be stored in the computational cells at 30 m resolution in comparison with that at 20 m resolution which might explain the negligible difference in rmsef between the resolutions of 20 and 30 m additionally there was a notable difference in the spatial distribution of inundation depth between the two btms figs 13 and 14 the ief value was smaller for the bb method while inundation depths at points located near the river were greater consequently a high fif value 0 6 was calculated at all resolutions for the bb method however this does not mean that the bb method is insensitive to dem resolution because the rmsef value produced by the bb method was much higher than that produced by the arf wrf method 4 3 combined performance the effects of dem resolution and size of computational cell on the simulation of inundation processes are usually regionally independent jung and jasinski 2015 for example areas with higher building density are more sensitive than areas with lower building density bruwier et al 2018 shen and tan 2020 the results of this study were different because tua is prone to flooding from multiple sources i e uffs and fofs here the dem resolution presented an opposite effect in terms of the ie and spatial distribution of inundation depth according to previous studies this might be attributable to the combined effects of different flood propagation behaviours topography and flooding sources muthusamy et al 2021 savage et al 2016 xing et al 2019 for the fofs the fluvial overbank volume was amplified remarkably in coarse resolution simulations overbank flow propagated by overcoming the slope from low lying areas to upper areas consequently increasing the inundation depth and ie for both btms however in the uffs the flood volume from s1 remained unchanged at all resolutions and the flow propagated by following the slope under the effects of gravity from upper areas to the low lying areas along the main street the flow pathway could become blocked and amplified by different btms at coarse resolutions therefore the inundation depth was overpredicted or underpredicted in different regions and the ie was decreased the results of the overall scenario group masked the combined inundation process responses to the btms and dem resolutions the results of this study suggest that urban floods from different directions that exhibit different propagation behaviours should be considered separately in inundation simulations this would help modellers and managers identify the dominant sources independent mechanisms and combined effects of inundation which would support the formulation of flood disaster reduction strategies and the adoption of mitigating measures to reduce the impact of the dominant flooding sources 5 conclusions this study conducted flood simulations for a mountain city threatened by uffs and fofs changes in flow pathway and inundation performance through the use of different btms definitions of river channel and distinctive flood propagation behaviours in response to different dem resolutions were clarified the optimal dem resolution was assessed for satisfactory inundation simulation for both uffss and fofss in the uffs the change in the local flood pathway caused by various btms at coarser dem resolution resulted in an underestimation of both the inundation extent and the inundation depth in low lying areas the simulation error was magnified considerably when the dem resolution was greater than the building width and gaps for the fofs as a result of the changed definition of the river channel and reduced channel conveyance at coarser resolution both the inundation extent and the inundation depth were overestimated a dem resolution smaller than the river width is recommended for fofs the ie and spatial inundation presented opposite effects in relation to different flood propagation behaviours uffs and fofs consequently the simulation error in the region where uffs and fofs were mixed masked the response of btms to various dem resolutions and could misrepresent the regionally dominant inundation sources the simulation of urban flooding is generally hindered by complexities associated with the underlying surface future works could focus on exploring the effect of using merged grids or merged dem resolutions for different land uses and regions in urban flood simulation as well as investigating the scale problems associated with the connection between merged grids and merged dem resolutions the error sources root causes and controlling factors of the effects of multiple flash flood simulations were recognised in our study the results provide a broader understanding of how changes associated with the btms and channel geometry in response to various dem resolutions play an important role in flood inundation mapping the key findings of this study could help modellers choose an appropriate dem resolution and btm for both uffs and fofs considering the availability of high
