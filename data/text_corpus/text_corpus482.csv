2410,coal mining is a critical energy industry that considerably evolves and benefits the modernization and development of our society however the side effects such as degraded air and water quality fragmented vegetation landscape and aggravated soil erosion associated with coal mining also raise serious concerns previous studies have shown diverse hydrologic cycle responses after coal mining when the watershed is subjected to different magnitudes of local climates soil properties mining methods and watershed area how these factors combine to affect hydrologic cycle responses to changes in mining remains unclear a meta analysis including 717 paired observations collated from 62 studies worldwide was used to evaluate the effects of coal mining on soil and water loss at a watershed scale the results showed that runoff runoff depth and spring flow due to coal mining were significantly decreased by 24 46 32 55 and 56 88 while calculated soil erosion modulus and soil loss based on empirical equations were significantly increased by 202 44 and 199 50 respectively as runoff is the carrying force for soil loss the decreased runoff would actually reduce the carrying capacity of soil to enter the river system therefore the increased soil loss intensity and decreased runoff may lead to insignificant total soil loss 68 52 t hm 2 in addition coal mining decreases groundwater level 11 02 and baseflow 14 46 increases infiltration rate 42 86 soil erodibility k value 258 67 sediment yield 141 86 and soil erosion area 102 06 among them mean annual precipitation plays a dominant role in driving hydrological cycle processes while combined use of above ground and underground mining tends to increase soil erosion this study is crucial to a better understanding of soil and water conservation under coal mining activities keywords coal mining watershed hydrological cycle processes soil and water conservation soil erosion runoff time series data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion is a natural process but would be significantly accelerated by anthropogenic activities as well as by climate change amundson et al 2015 he et al 2006 marzen et al 2017 zheng 2006 soil erosion is an important driving force threatening ecological resilience resulting in reduced land productivity and increased natural disasters thereby seriously hampering economic and social sustainability and even human civilization bosco et al 2015 brown 1981 downes 1959 holz et al 2015 wuepper et al 2020 previous studies have extensively investigated the effects of rainfall patterns framing activities civil engineering and land use change on soil erosion borrelli et al 2017 caplan et al 2019 wan fell 2004 zhang et al 2022 a variety of countermeasures were developed to conserve soil and water diyabalanage et al 2017 coal as the pillar energy industry undoubtedly boosts the economy and society liu liu 2010 however the pollution and ecological damage issues about coal mining are concerned as the standards for well being are raised cornwall 2017 feng et al 2019 coal mining activities are considered as an important channel for aggravating soil erosion and inducing disasters among various anthropogenic activities karan et al 2019 santamarina et al 2019 coal mining is reported to significantly influence hydrological cycle by reducing runoff and groundwater tang et al 2021 however other reports considered degraded ecosystems made by coal mining which contradicted the intuitive sense of global greening martins et al 2022 sinha et al 2009 since coal mining activities bring disturbances to the environment the ecological challenges caused by coal mining have always been a hot topic li et al 2019 surface mining and underground mining are the two most widely used coal mining methods lien 2013 mukherjee pahari 2019 the other is termed combined mining that combines the above two methods together chen et al 2003 many previous studies have demonstrated that coal mining aggravates soil erosion which can be attributed to 1 surface mining destroys topsoil and vegetation changes soil physical and chemical properties and reduces the protective effect on the soil layer asiedu 2013 liu et al 2017 2 underground mining tends to cause uneven settlement and increased susceptibility to slope instability and soil erosion ma et al 2019 meng et al 2012 3 leachate from the long term accumulation of coal gangue would pollute the nearby water body and threaten the living environment liu 2018 shi et al 2016 wu et al 2021 most previous studies on the effect of coal mining on soil and water resources are mostly at regional scales lacking global and comprehensive conclusions and findings are not consistent at the site scale for soil infiltration weiss razem 1984 proposed that the soil infiltration rate decreases due to soil compaction while coal gangue decreases soil infiltration through increasing dispersion zhou et al 2010 however ritter gardner 1993 found that the stable infiltration rate increase over time the increase in soil infiltration is due to the increase in surface fractures caused by coal mining guebert gardner 2001 soil infiltration is an important part of the hydrological cycle affecting the partition of precipitation into runoff and evaporation brander et al 2004 edwards et al 2015 rumman et al 2005 for watershed runoff negley eshleman 2006 showed that surface mining and land reclamation increase watershed runoff because of a reduction in infiltration previous studies have shown that changes in flow paths due to coal mining play a crucial role in increasing runoff acharya kharel 2020 when infiltration decreases and runoff increases the capacity of runoff erosion increases which affects sediment transport and aggravates the degree of water and soil loss he et al 2014 yang et al 2021 however luan et al 2020 found that the runoff decreases significantly by 49 44 in the kuye river between 1998 and 2017 due to coal mining similarly guo et al 2019 and wu dong 2019 reported that coal mining contributed to a reduction in watershed runoff in summary for the numerous ecological problems currently faced by coal mining it is difficult to solve practical problems by understanding the impacts of coal mining on soil and water resources only at the site scale in addition it is not clear how soil erosion processes at watershed scale respond to coal mining therefore it is the key to reveal the evolution pattern of soil and water conservation caused by coal mining by carrying out the global meta analysis at watershed scale it is noteworthy that factors such as geographical situation local climatic vegetation conditions mining methods and soil and water conservation measures all regulate the impact of coal mining on soil loss shi et al 2021 the natural geographical features and local climatic conditions of the study area determine the ecological characteristics stenseth et al 2002 the mining of coal resources exacerbates ecological vulnerability and affects the structure and function of the ecosystem tai et al 2020 of these precipitation conditions are the main external force for soil hydra erosion vaezi et al 2017 yang et al 2022a yang et al 2022b temperature is also an important factor affecting soil erosion particularly for mines situated in freeze thaw areas wu et al 2018 yang et al 2022b in addition different mining methods also provide different entry points above or below ground for soil loss in mining areas reducing ecosystem stability asiedu 2013 li et al 2021a li et al 2021b ma et al 2019 the severely degraded vegetation community conditions caused by coal mining reduce soil and water conservation capacity and place enormous pressure on the natural ecosystem environment zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 however reasonable mining and implementation of soil and water conservation measures according to the actual conditions which can minimize soil erosion diyabalanage et al 2017 rong et al 2020 at the same time strict policies and regulations also had a significant effect on the ecological restoration of mining areas li 2006 miao marrs 2000 therefore the objective of this study was to investigate how coal mining would affect infiltration runoff and soil erosion at watershed scale a mixed effects meta analysis was conducted based on watershed scale research on soil and water conservation due to coal mining 2 materials and method 2 1 data collection to investigate the effect of coal mining on

of observations in the 62 peer reviewed studies are from 89 sites fig 1 china 42 peer reviewed studies 531 pairs 67 74 and america 14 peer reviewed studies 85 pairs 22 58 comprised the greatest number of study sites a relatively small number 6 peer reviewed studies 101 pairs 9 68 of reports can also be found in bangladesh estonia iran italy spain and niger 3 2 general effect of coal mining on all target variables the effects of coal mining on 11 target variables are shown in fig 2 compared with the pre mining data post mining significantly decreased the sf 56 88 p 0 05 r 24 46 p 0 05 and rd 32 55 p 0 05 significantly increased the sem 202 44 p 0 05 and sl 199 50 p 0 05 in addition coal mining decreased gi 11 02 and bf 14 46 increase i 42 86 k 258 67 sy 141 86 and sea 102 06 among them the cis band of the k 95 cis 40 87 558 21 and sy 95 cis 63 01 346 73 varies significantly because it has strong heterogeneity and poor reliability on average coal mining affects the hydrologic cycle process across all studies coal mining reduces r in the watershed but increases soil erosion sl normally the reduced runoff should be associated with decreased soil erosion because runoff is the driving force for soil erosion and carries eroded soil to the river system the following sections would then focus on runoff and soil erosion and their governing factors 3 3 impact of coal mining on runoff time series 3 3 1 relationship between runoff and coal mining history a total of 474 pairs of observations were included in the quantitative synthesis of the runoff time series the runoff was monitored between 1 and 35 years after coal mining the majority of the observed time series of runoff was significantly decreased since the operation of coal mines in that watershed p 0 001 fig 3 only limited observations demonstrate that the runoff might increase within 10 years of coal mining 3 3 2 relationship between runoff and ndvi in the watershed scale in the pre mining period ndvi was smaller and runoff showed an increasing trend figure 4 illustrates that the ndvi of vegetation is increasing year by year and the overall ecological environment tends to develop better landsat satellite images are only available after 1985 and so is ndvi data at the watershed scale the runoff reduction effect decreases as time advances and ndvi increases fig 4 revegetation helps reduce soil losses in mining areas however the role played by mining in reducing runoff cannot be ignored 3 3 3 relationship between runoff and local climate most of the data were collected from studies in geographical locations having mat ranging from 7 9 to 9 6 fig 5 a and map ranging from 380 to 450 mm yr 1 fig 5b which belong to arid to semi arid climates there have strong heterogeneity and poor reliability with mat 10 and map 1200 mm yr 1 the results show that the effect size of runoff was significantly increased with mat p 0 001 and map in other words coal mining in dry or cold areas is more effective in water conservation for mining while wet areas or high temperature areas are prone to runoff loss figures 5 c and 5 d suggest that the runoff reduction effect decreases as time advances and mat map changes from year to year respectively moreover the impact of increasing map year by year has a greater effect on runoff than mat 3 3 4 relationship between runoff and soil properties the blue dots in fig 6 show the soil texture classification of the runoff studies included in this meta analysis figures 6 a and 6 b are based on the united states department of agriculture usda and the chinese soil texture classification system respectively figure 6 a suggests that the soil texture at the study sites which includes runoff indicators is predominantly distributed over loamy soil 61 54 with few studies 38 46 belonging to loamy sand sandy loam and clay soil as 67 74 of the studies were from china we have specifically mapped the distribution of runoff studies in the chinese soil texture triangle as shown in fig 6 b the result found that the runoff study was distributed over 38 46 sandy silt soil 30 77 loam soil 15 38 heavy sandy and 15 38 other i e very heavy sandy heavy clay figure 7 relates the effect size of runoff to soil properties most of the data were collected from studies in geographical locations having soil bulk density ranging from 1 3 to 1 5 kg dm 3 and soil ph ranging from 4 5 to 8 5 figure 7 a demonstrated that the runoff was decreased by 5 23 with increasing soil bulk density study sites with higher soil bulk density have better runoff reduction in non mining or post mining areas compared to mining or pre mining areas in addition the effect size of runoff was significantly decreased by 25 39 p 0 05 with increasing soil ph fig 7b it is worth noting that coal mining with low soil ph tends to increase runoff while areas with ph 5 4 show the opposite trend 3 3 5 relationship between runoff and watershed areas and mining methods figure 8 a demonstrated that runoff decreased with increasing watershed area coal mining in small watersheds tends to increase runoff while the opposite trend was true for large watersheds effects of coal mining on runoff did differ significantly among different watershed areas p 0 001 table1 tabulates the three main mining methods reported in the studies analyzed fig 8 b shows the effect size of runoff for different mining methods an analysis of the extracted literatures reveals that more studies use surface mining than underground mining and no study on runoff adopts combined mining method additionally surface mining increases the possibility of runoff loss while underground mining is more conducive to reduce runoff 3 4 runoff depth in relationship to influence factors as runoff depth is the ratio between runoff and watershed area it would show a similar pattern with the runoff figure 9 illustrates that the runoff depth increased by 0 74 p 0 001 39 97 p 0 001 and 15 42 p 0 001 across all studies with the increase of altitude map and mat respectively in contrast increased watershed areas significantly reduced runoff depth by 42 72 p 0 001 in addition the runoff depth also shows a significant reduction 39 00 p 0 001 trend when the mining method changed from surface mining to underground mining 3 5 infiltration rates in relationship to influence factors figure 10 demonstrates that post mining significantly increases infiltration rates by 49 44 as map increases p 0 001 compared with the pre mining and the influence of map was much higher than other influencing factors the effect size for infiltration rates decreased by 21 69 1 59 and 16 23 with increased altitude mat and watershed areas respectively but was not significantly different from the pre mining p 0 001 the infiltration rates decreased by 16 92 when the mining method changed from surface mining to underground mining 3 6 soil erosion in relationship to influence factors soil erosion modulus sem was on average 35 49 9 29 and 4 41 greater than pre mining with the increase of map mat and watershed areas respectively but that was 39 72 lower with increased altitude fig 11 the altitude has the most powerful negative influence on the effect size of sem while the map has the powerful positive influence on it however the influence factors including altitude map mat mining methods and watershed areas were not significantly different from the pre mining p 0 001 in addition the sem was the highest at a mining method of combined mining followed by the mining methods of underground mining and surface mining in all studies fig 12 a under the influence of mat soil erodibility k value k was increased significantly by 81 63 p 0 001 compared to pre mining fig 13 the calculation formula of k was listed in table s2 as shown in fig 13 the influence of mat was much higher than other influencing factors while that of map exerts the minimal effect in addition the influence of altitude map mining methods and watershed areas on k was not significantly different from the pre mining p 0 001 moreover the k was on average 5 41 greater than pre mining under different mining methods k was the highest for combined mining followed by underground mining and surface mining in all studies which is consistent with the results of sem fig 12b figure 14 illustrates that the soil loss increased by an average of 68 52 t hm 2 according to the soil loss data in table s3 it was found that the soil loss increased from 47 87 t hm 2 before coal mining to 116 38 t hm 2 after coal mining and all of them were generally calculated by empirical models rather than observations it is worth noting that soil loss increased by up to 289 80 t hm 2 and decreased by up to 5 40 t hm 2 compared to the pre mining period 3 7 pearson correlation analysis of all influencing factors the results of the pearson correlation analysis involving the influencing factors in this meta analysis are shown in fig 15 overall the strongest correlations were found between soil properties among them the positive correlation coefficient between clay fraction and silt fraction was up to 0 52 and the negative correlation coefficient between clay fraction and sand fraction was down to 0 85 in addition the positive correlation coefficient between watershed area and mining method was the smallest at 0 044 and the negative correlation coefficient between watershed area and mat was the weakest at 0 011 4 discussion 4 1 general effect of coal mining on watershed hydrological cycle process our meta analysis suggests that coal mining contributes to water conservation by regulating the hydrological cycle at a watershed scale the watershed hydrological cycle is a complicated process involving multiple factors such as groundwater level baseflow runoff infiltration precipitation and evaporation among them coal mining has a positive effect on increased soil infiltration 42 86 and decreased runoff 24 46 and runoff depth 32 55 fig 2 under the impact of coal mining activities surface fissures appeared after soil structure reorganization resulting in higher infiltration this finding was consistent with the result of tang et al 2021 who suggested that a greater impact on soil infiltration is associated with deeper surface fissures in addition guebert gardner 2001 and ritter gardner 1993 proposed that soil infiltration rate continues to increase over time despite the delayed macropore return flow caused by surface fissures this finding echoed the results of our meta analysis where runoff significantly decreased with increasing years after coal mining fig 3 this may be attributed to the fact that soil infiltration processes are an important part of the hydrological cycle in watersheds and their dynamics have a significant impact on runoff processes brander et al 2004 rumman et al 2005 we also found that groundwater was not recharged by the increase in infiltration but instead decreased by 11 02 this is consistent with the findings of howladar 2013 who revealed the depletion of groundwater levels due to coal mining in addition they also suggested that groundwater levels decreased more with the deeper coal mining depth during the coal mining process the significant increase in mine drainage caused by the dewatering scheme may be the main reason for the declined groundwater levels akcil koldas 2006 howladar 2013 the mine drainage dynamics are consistent with local precipitation dynamics with a distinct seasonal and multi year cyclical pattern of variation on this basis baseflow also decreased by 14 46 even though it is usually as a more stable component of runoff in rivers tetzlaff soulsby 2008 therefore the changes in soil structure and water distribution largely explain why coal mining disturbs the surface and affects the hydrological processes deck et al 2003 vela almeida et al 2016 the unprecedented growth in the scope and scale of coal mining activities has increasingly influenced or disturbed the hydrological cycle processes agboola et al 2020 dubiński 2013 although coal mining does not contribute to supplying groundwater resources its role in promoting the watershed hydrologic cycle may have a positive effect on the watershed ecosystem 4 2 soil and water conservation response to main factors a linear relationship between the effect size of target variables and the influence factors was observed which indicates that soil and water conservation responses to coal mining are depends upon influencing factors such as altitude local climate soil properties watershed areas and mining methods shi et al 2021 stenseth et al 2002 as shown in fig 7 the effect size of watershed runoff decreased as soil bulk density and soil ph increased this is inconsistent with surface runoff which increases with increasing soil capacity tate et al 2004 increased bulk density reduces soil porosity and therefore leads to reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff shah et al 2017 however the results of our study suggested that watershed runoff shows an opposite trend to surface runoff fig 7a overall the increase in soil bulk density resulted in a 5 23 reduction in the runoff which was not significant p 0 324 in addition the increased soil ph resulted in a significant reduction in runoff p 0 05 soil ph 5 4 increases runoff while soil ph 5 4 decreases runoff and conserves water in mining areas however rhoton et al 2003 found that under simulated rainfall conditions acidic soils led to an average 20 reduction in runoff and alkaline soils led to an average 21 increase in runoff which was strongly related to the stability of soil aggregates the influence of map is followed by an increasing trend in runoff and sem precipitation provides kinetic energy for soil erosion generating runoff and sediment transport as well as providing a vehicle for soil hydra erosion liu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the kinetic energy of precipitation increases with increasing map resulting in a significant increase in runoff fig 5b and runoff depth fig 9 which aggravates soil erosion fig 11 the above result generally agrees with most previous studies all over the world marzen et al 2017 parsons stone 2006 sharpley 1985 in addition it is worth noting that coal mining increases runoff when the watershed area 2 800 km2 but it does not affect the overall trend fig 6a runoff and runoff depth decrease significantly with increasing watershed area fig 6a and 7 and soil erosion modulus and k subsequently increase figs 9 and 11 this indicates that runoff is more sensitive to mining areas on larger watershed areas as concluded by wu et al 2020 part of the reduced runoff was compensated by increased rainfall but 25 13 248 104 m3 out of 52 992 104 m3 reduced runoff was attributed to coal mining however increased rainfall due to climate change further amplifies the disturbance from mining activities and thus increases soil erosion which also deserves focused attention moreover it is awarded that underground mining is more effective in reducing runoff than surface mining fig 8b this can be understood from two aspects on the one hand underground mining is prone to the formation of unstable goaf regions which are more conducive to ponding zhou et al 2013 on the other hand the development of rock fractures due to blasting vibrations in mine area promotes water infiltration and decreases runoff sun et al 2015 it is worth noting that liu et al 2019 suggested that the risk of landslide hazards increases if underground mining is used in mines with large slopes furthermore combined mining methods decrease soil erodibility and induce more soil erosion than surface mining and underground mining fig 12 it brings a more serious hidden danger to the mine site when coal resources are mined from both above ground and underground perspectives therefore it is vital to select the appropriate coal mining methods saki et al 2020 4 3 control footprint of coal mining on soil erosion this meta analysis found that soil erosion did not decrease with a significant reduction of runoff due to coal mining which is inconsistent with site or slope scale studies the results of studies at the site or slope scale showed that the less runoff the weaker the sand carrying capacity and the less soil loss amount yang et al 2021 runoff erosion is an important manifestation of soil hydra erosion generally an increase in infiltration due to coal mining contributes to reducing runoff and thus erosion guebert gardner 2001 however our result showed that soil erosion was significantly influenced by coal mine activities it is well known that any environmental disturbance may increase soil erosion in this study it is mainly that the ecosystem stability is seriously disturbed by mining activities which led to an increase in soil erosion kalybekov et al 2020 in addition the analysis suggests that the reported increase in soil loss due to coal mining in this meta analysis is generally calculated by empirical models rather than observations table s3 the opinion of nearing 1998 for soil erosion models is that both empirical and physical models generally tend to overestimate small measurements and underestimate large measurements therefore the uncertainties in the calculated soil erosion bias our understanding of the influence of coal mining on soil erosion the data extracted in this meta analysis are mainly located in ohio usa and shaanxi province china which are ecologically fragile areas despite having abundant coal resources lv et al 2019 yang et al 2018 with the advancement of coal mining activities fragmented landscape and aggravated soil erosion further decreasing the eco environment carrying capacity amundson et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 after coal mining the soil erosion modulus increases significantly the soil erodibility factor k decreases and the soil erosion area increases which is consistent with liu et al 2019 although mining activities destroys surface vegetation and reduces the protective effect on the surface huang et al 2015 the vegetation coverage get effectively improve because of the ecological restoration measures reclamation reconstruction and rehabilitation accompanying the ecological evolution of mining areas it indicates that the influence of coal mining on surrounded ecological environment would be minimized and even converge to the pre mining state if soil and water conservation measures were adopted fig 4 at the same time ecosystems are resilient and can maintain their original functions to a certain extent in the face of external disturbances e g climate warming extreme rainfall events coal mining activities etc willis et al 2018 therefore the impact of coal mining on ecological environment was significantly reduced with the implementation of soil and water conservation measures however zulkarnain et al 2014 pointed that this does not restore to the original state especially in mining areas with active mining activities in other words water and soil conservation is the main contradiction in the development of coal resources and coal mining is also the main aspect of the contradiction in ecological protection therefore the implementation of soil and water conservation protection measures into the mining process is of great value for soil erosion control in mining areas 4 4 uncertainties in calculation of runoff soil loss and soil erosion modulus the uncertainties of calculation of runoff soil loss and soil erosion modulus usually came mainly from the following aspects 1 in this study only coal mining was considered as a human activity factor affecting runoff without considering the effects of residential water use irrigation water demand and industrial water consumption guo et al 2019 2 data before and after coal mining are subject to both spatial and temporal heterogeneity and cannot be analyzed quantitatively 3 the 10 papers containing soil erosion modulus data all give direct graphs and charts none of which illustrated or listed their calculation formulae 4 existing soil erosion models have limitations other than natural stochastic variability in soil loss measurements and the accuracy of soil erosion prediction values at different scales is difficult to estimate nearing 1998 5 the global distribution of study sites cannot completely reflect the real importance of coal mining on soil erosion at watershed scale because the collected studies only represent the research institutions or hydrologic observatories that have made relevant research on this scientific issue 6 the target variables varied considerably between different inter sites for example runoff data are from asia the americas and europe as shown in fig 16 the overall decrease in runoff after coal mining is 76 31 in asia and 6 93 in europe while it increased 77 92 in the america 7 the limited number of sites from specific climate zones may not fully represent its actual situation therefore we encourage more watershed scale studies on coal mining it these regions i e relative cold climate zone hot and dry zone in the future 8 therefore future studies should focus on the differences between soil erosion models and actual values as well as between models to effectively distinguish the mechanisms of diverse influences on soil and water conservation at watershed scale 5 conclusions among the existing literature many studies have investigated the effect of coal mining on soil and water conservation however the previous reports were often contradictory due to variations in geographical location local climates mining methods watershed area and coal mining history therefore a meta analysis was used to systematically evaluate and summarize the results of studies at a global scale to make an objective assessment of soil and water conservation in mining areas which can help in the restoration and management of the ecological environment in mining areas given the feedback of soil and water conservation to the coal mining process upon spatio temporal characteristics response the higher sensitivity of runoff to mining over time scale poses a challenge in predicting soil and water conservation effects under the impact of various factors overall it can regulate the hydrological erosion process of the watershed under the scenario of coal mining precipitation enhances the driving force of the effect size and promotes the hydrological cycle and vice versa changes in local climatic conditions watershed area and mining methods also have an impact on soil and water conservation runoff significantly decreased with increasing years after coal mining at the temporal scale while it showed a significant decrease with increasing watershed area at the spatial scale soil erosion showed an increasing trend after mining compared to the pre mining era or nearby areas without mining it is noteworthy that the precipitation and vegetation cover has increased significantly with climate warming and applied ecological restoration measures which may indicate that appropriate revegetation measures may buffer the side effects of coal mining on the ecological tendency however existing studies are highly spatial and temporal heterogeneous across sites and the statistical methods of the target variables are not consistent future studies of wider research scope covering more comprehensive and long term observations of more comprehensive parameters e g weather data

2410,coal mining is a critical energy industry that considerably evolves and benefits the modernization and development of our society however the side effects such as degraded air and water quality fragmented vegetation landscape and aggravated soil erosion associated with coal mining also raise serious concerns previous studies have shown diverse hydrologic cycle responses after coal mining when the watershed is subjected to different magnitudes of local climates soil properties mining methods and watershed area how these factors combine to affect hydrologic cycle responses to changes in mining remains unclear a meta analysis including 717 paired observations collated from 62 studies worldwide was used to evaluate the effects of coal mining on soil and water loss at a watershed scale the results showed that runoff runoff depth and spring flow due to coal mining were significantly decreased by 24 46 32 55 and 56 88 while calculated soil erosion modulus and soil loss based on empirical equations were significantly increased by 202 44 and 199 50 respectively as runoff is the carrying force for soil loss the decreased runoff would actually reduce the carrying capacity of soil to enter the river system therefore the increased soil loss intensity and decreased runoff may lead to insignificant total soil loss 68 52 t hm 2 in addition coal mining decreases groundwater level 11 02 and baseflow 14 46 increases infiltration rate 42 86 soil erodibility k value 258 67 sediment yield 141 86 and soil erosion area 102 06 among them mean annual precipitation plays a dominant role in driving hydrological cycle processes while combined use of above ground and underground mining tends to increase soil erosion this study is crucial to a better understanding of soil and water conservation under coal mining activities keywords coal mining watershed hydrological cycle processes soil and water conservation soil erosion runoff time series data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion is a natural process but would be significantly accelerated by anthropogenic activities as well as by climate change amundson et al 2015 he et al 2006 marzen et al 2017 zheng 2006 soil erosion is an important driving force threatening ecological resilience resulting in reduced land productivity and increased natural disasters thereby seriously hampering economic and social sustainability and even human civilization bosco et al 2015 brown 1981 downes 1959 holz et al 2015 wuepper et al 2020 previous studies have extensively investigated the effects of rainfall patterns framing activities civil engineering and land use change on soil erosion borrelli et al 2017 caplan et al 2019 wan fell 2004 zhang et al 2022 a variety of countermeasures were developed to conserve soil and water diyabalanage et al 2017 coal as the pillar energy industry undoubtedly boosts the economy and society liu liu 2010 however the pollution and ecological damage issues about coal mining are concerned as the standards for well being are raised cornwall 2017 feng et al 2019 coal mining activities are considered as an important channel for aggravating soil erosion and inducing disasters among various anthropogenic activities karan et al 2019 santamarina et al 2019 coal mining is reported to significantly influence hydrological cycle by reducing runoff and groundwater tang et al 2021 however other reports considered degraded ecosystems made by coal mining which contradicted the intuitive sense of global greening martins et al 2022 sinha et al 2009 since coal mining activities bring disturbances to the environment the ecological challenges caused by coal mining have always been a hot topic li et al 2019 surface mining and underground mining are the two most widely used coal mining methods lien 2013 mukherjee pahari 2019 the other is termed combined mining that combines the above two methods together chen et al 2003 many previous studies have demonstrated that coal mining aggravates soil erosion which can be attributed to 1 surface mining destroys topsoil and vegetation changes soil physical and chemical properties and reduces the protective effect on the soil layer asiedu 2013 liu et al 2017 2 underground mining tends to cause uneven settlement and increased susceptibility to slope instability and soil erosion ma et al 2019 meng et al 2012 3 leachate from the long term accumulation of coal gangue would pollute the nearby water body and threaten the living environment liu 2018 shi et al 2016 wu et al 2021 most previous studies on the effect of coal mining on soil and water resources are mostly at regional scales lacking global and comprehensive conclusions and findings are not consistent at the site scale for soil infiltration weiss razem 1984 proposed that the soil infiltration rate decreases due to soil compaction while coal gangue decreases soil infiltration through increasing dispersion zhou et al 2010 however ritter gardner 1993 found that the stable infiltration rate increase over time the increase in soil infiltration is due to the increase in surface fractures caused by coal mining guebert gardner 2001 soil infiltration is an important part of the hydrological cycle affecting the partition of precipitation into runoff and evaporation brander et al 2004 edwards et al 2015 rumman et al 2005 for watershed runoff negley eshleman 2006 showed that surface mining and land reclamation increase watershed runoff because of a reduction in infiltration previous studies have shown that changes in flow paths due to coal mining play a crucial role in increasing runoff acharya kharel 2020 when infiltration decreases and runoff increases the capacity of runoff erosion increases which affects sediment transport and aggravates the degree of water and soil loss he et al 2014 yang et al 2021 however luan et al 2020 found that the runoff decreases significantly by 49 44 in the kuye river between 1998 and 2017 due to coal mining similarly guo et al 2019 and wu dong 2019 reported that coal mining contributed to a reduction in watershed runoff in summary for the numerous ecological problems currently faced by coal mining it is difficult to solve practical problems by understanding the impacts of coal mining on soil and water resources only at the site scale in addition it is not clear how soil erosion processes at watershed scale respond to coal mining therefore it is the key to reveal the evolution pattern of soil and water conservation caused by coal mining by carrying out the global meta analysis at watershed scale it is noteworthy that factors such as geographical situation local climatic vegetation conditions mining methods and soil and water conservation measures all regulate the impact of coal mining on soil loss shi et al 2021 the natural geographical features and local climatic conditions of the study area determine the ecological characteristics stenseth et al 2002 the mining of coal resources exacerbates ecological vulnerability and affects the structure and function of the ecosystem tai et al 2020 of these precipitation conditions are the main external force for soil hydra erosion vaezi et al 2017 yang et al 2022a yang et al 2022b temperature is also an important factor affecting soil erosion particularly for mines situated in freeze thaw areas wu et al 2018 yang et al 2022b in addition different mining methods also provide different entry points above or below ground for soil loss in mining areas reducing ecosystem stability asiedu 2013 li et al 2021a li et al 2021b ma et al 2019 the severely degraded vegetation community conditions caused by coal mining reduce soil and water conservation capacity and place enormous pressure on the natural ecosystem environment zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 however reasonable mining and implementation of soil and water conservation measures according to the actual conditions which can minimize soil erosion diyabalanage et al 2017 rong et al 2020 at the same time strict policies and regulations also had a significant effect on the ecological restoration of mining areas li 2006 miao marrs 2000 therefore the objective of this study was to investigate how coal mining would affect infiltration runoff and soil erosion at watershed scale a mixed effects meta analysis was conducted based on watershed scale research on soil and water conservation due to coal mining 2 materials and method 2 1 data collection to investigate the effect of coal mining on

target variables the effects of coal mining on 11 target variables are shown in fig 2 compared with the pre mining data post mining significantly decreased the sf 56 88 p 0 05 r 24 46 p 0 05 and rd 32 55 p 0 05 significantly increased the sem 202 44 p 0 05 and sl 199 50 p 0 05 in addition coal mining decreased gi 11 02 and bf 14 46 increase i 42 86 k 258 67 sy 141 86 and sea 102 06 among them the cis band of the k 95 cis 40 87 558 21 and sy 95 cis 63 01 346 73 varies significantly because it has strong heterogeneity and poor reliability on average coal mining affects the hydrologic cycle process across all studies coal mining reduces r in the watershed but increases soil erosion sl normally the reduced runoff should be associated with decreased soil erosion because runoff is the driving force for soil erosion and carries eroded soil to the river system the following sections would then focus on runoff and soil erosion and their governing factors 3 3 impact of coal mining on runoff time series 3 3 1 relationship between runoff and coal mining history a total of 474 pairs of observations were included in the quantitative synthesis of the runoff time series the runoff was monitored between 1 and 35 years after coal mining the majority of the observed time series of runoff was significantly decreased since the operation of coal mines in that watershed p 0 001 fig 3 only limited observations demonstrate that the runoff might increase within 10 years of coal mining 3 3 2 relationship between runoff and ndvi in the watershed scale in the pre mining period ndvi was smaller and runoff showed an increasing trend figure 4 illustrates that the ndvi of vegetation is increasing year by year and the overall ecological environment tends to develop better landsat satellite images are only available after 1985 and so is ndvi data at the watershed scale the runoff reduction effect decreases as time advances and ndvi increases fig 4 revegetation helps reduce soil losses in mining areas however the role played by mining in reducing runoff cannot be ignored 3 3 3 relationship between runoff and local climate most of the data were collected from studies in geographical locations having mat ranging from 7 9 to 9 6 fig 5 a and map ranging from 380 to 450 mm yr 1 fig 5b which belong to arid to semi arid climates there have strong heterogeneity and poor reliability with mat 10 and map 1200 mm yr 1 the results show that the effect size of runoff was significantly increased with mat p 0 001 and map in other words coal mining in dry or cold areas is more effective in water conservation for mining while wet areas or high temperature areas are prone to runoff loss figures 5 c and 5 d suggest that the runoff reduction effect decreases as time advances and mat map changes from year to year respectively moreover the impact of increasing map year by year has a greater effect on runoff than mat 3 3 4 relationship between runoff and soil properties the blue dots in fig 6 show the soil texture classification of the runoff studies included in this meta analysis figures 6 a and 6 b are based on the united states department of agriculture usda and the chinese soil texture classification system respectively figure 6 a suggests that the soil texture at the study sites which includes runoff indicators is predominantly distributed over loamy soil 61 54 with few studies 38 46 belonging to loamy sand sandy loam and clay soil as 67 74 of the studies were from china we have specifically mapped the distribution of runoff studies in the chinese soil texture triangle as shown in fig 6 b the result found that the runoff study was distributed over 38 46 sandy silt soil 30 77 loam soil 15 38 heavy sandy and 15 38 other i e very heavy sandy heavy clay figure 7 relates the effect size of runoff to soil properties most of the data were collected from studies in geographical locations having soil bulk density ranging from 1 3 to 1 5 kg dm 3 and soil ph ranging from 4 5 to 8 5 figure 7 a demonstrated that the runoff was decreased by 5 23 with increasing soil bulk density study sites with higher soil bulk density have better runoff reduction in non mining or post mining areas compared to mining or pre mining areas in addition the effect size of runoff was significantly decreased by 25 39 p 0 05 with increasing soil ph fig 7b it is worth noting that coal mining with low soil ph tends to increase runoff while areas with ph 5 4 show the opposite trend 3 3 5 relationship between runoff and watershed areas and mining methods figure 8 a demonstrated that runoff decreased with increasing watershed area coal mining in small watersheds tends to increase runoff while the opposite trend was true for large watersheds effects of coal mining on runoff did differ significantly among different watershed areas p 0 001 table1 tabulates the three main mining methods reported in the studies analyzed fig 8 b shows the effect size of runoff for different mining methods an analysis of the extracted literatures reveals that more studies use surface mining than underground mining and no study on runoff adopts combined mining method additionally surface mining increases the possibility of runoff loss while underground mining is more conducive to reduce runoff 3 4 runoff depth in relationship to influence factors as runoff depth is the ratio between runoff and watershed area it would show a similar pattern with the runoff figure 9 illustrates that the runoff depth increased by 0 74 p 0 001 39 97 p 0 001 and 15 42 p 0 001 across all studies with the increase of altitude map and mat respectively in contrast increased watershed areas significantly reduced runoff depth by 42 72 p 0 001 in addition the runoff depth also shows a significant reduction 39 00 p 0 001 trend when the mining method changed from surface mining to underground mining 3 5 infiltration rates in relationship to influence factors figure 10 demonstrates that post mining significantly increases infiltration rates by 49 44 as map increases p 0 001 compared with the pre mining and the influence of map was much higher than other influencing factors the effect size for infiltration rates decreased by 21 69 1 59 and 16 23 with increased altitude mat and watershed areas respectively but was not significantly different from the pre mining p 0 001 the infiltration rates decreased by 16 92 when the mining method changed from surface mining to underground mining 3 6 soil erosion in relationship to influence factors soil erosion modulus sem was on average 35 49 9 29 and 4 41 greater than pre mining with the increase of map mat and watershed areas respectively but that was 39 72 lower with increased altitude fig 11 the altitude has the most powerful negative influence on the effect size of sem while the map has the powerful positive influence on it however the influence factors including altitude map mat mining methods and watershed areas were not significantly different from the pre mining p 0 001 in addition the sem was the highest at a mining method of combined mining followed by the mining methods of underground mining and surface mining in all studies fig 12 a under the influence of mat soil erodibility k value k was increased significantly by 81 63 p 0 001 compared to pre mining fig 13 the calculation formula of k was listed in table s2 as shown in fig 13 the influence of mat was much higher than other influencing factors while that of map exerts the minimal effect in addition the influence of altitude map mining methods and watershed areas on k was not significantly different from the pre mining p 0 001 moreover the k was on average 5 41 greater than pre mining under different mining methods k was the highest for combined mining followed by underground mining and surface mining in all studies which is consistent with the results of sem fig 12b figure 14 illustrates that the soil loss increased by an average of 68 52 t hm 2 according to the soil loss data in table s3 it was found that the soil loss increased from 47 87 t hm 2 before coal mining to 116 38 t hm 2 after coal mining and all of them were generally calculated by empirical models rather than observations it is worth noting that soil loss increased by up to 289 80 t hm 2 and decreased by up to 5 40 t hm 2 compared to the pre mining period 3 7 pearson correlation analysis of all influencing factors the results of the pearson correlation analysis involving the influencing factors in this meta analysis are shown in fig 15 overall the strongest correlations were found between soil properties among them the positive correlation coefficient between clay fraction and silt fraction was up to 0 52 and the negative correlation coefficient between clay fraction and sand fraction was down to 0 85 in addition the positive correlation coefficient between watershed area and mining method was the smallest at 0 044 and the negative correlation coefficient between watershed area and mat was the weakest at 0 011 4 discussion 4 1 general effect of coal mining on watershed hydrological cycle process our meta analysis suggests that coal mining contributes to water conservation by regulating the hydrological cycle at a watershed scale the watershed hydrological cycle is a complicated process involving multiple factors such as groundwater level baseflow runoff infiltration precipitation and evaporation among them coal mining has a positive effect on increased soil infiltration 42 86 and decreased runoff 24 46 and runoff depth 32 55 fig 2 under the impact of coal mining activities surface fissures appeared after soil structure reorganization resulting in higher infiltration this finding was consistent with the result of tang et al 2021 who suggested that a greater impact on soil infiltration is associated with deeper surface fissures in addition guebert gardner 2001 and ritter gardner 1993 proposed that soil infiltration rate continues to increase over time despite the delayed macropore return flow caused by surface fissures this finding echoed the results of our meta analysis where runoff significantly decreased with increasing years after coal mining fig 3 this may be attributed to the fact that soil infiltration processes are an important part of the hydrological cycle in watersheds and their dynamics have a significant impact on runoff processes brander et al 2004 rumman et al 2005 we also found that groundwater was not recharged by the increase in infiltration but instead decreased by 11 02 this is consistent with the findings of howladar 2013 who revealed the depletion of groundwater levels due to coal mining in addition they also suggested that groundwater levels decreased more with the deeper coal mining depth during the coal mining process the significant increase in mine drainage caused by the dewatering scheme may be the main reason for the declined groundwater levels akcil koldas 2006 howladar 2013 the mine drainage dynamics are consistent with local precipitation dynamics with a distinct seasonal and multi year cyclical pattern of variation on this basis baseflow also decreased by 14 46 even though it is usually as a more stable component of runoff in rivers tetzlaff soulsby 2008 therefore the changes in soil structure and water distribution largely explain why coal mining disturbs the surface and affects the hydrological processes deck et al 2003 vela almeida et al 2016 the unprecedented growth in the scope and scale of coal mining activities has increasingly influenced or disturbed the hydrological cycle processes agboola et al 2020 dubiński 2013 although coal mining does not contribute to supplying groundwater resources its role in promoting the watershed hydrologic cycle may have a positive effect on the watershed ecosystem 4 2 soil and water conservation response to main factors a linear relationship between the effect size of target variables and the influence factors was observed which indicates that soil and water conservation responses to coal mining are depends upon influencing factors such as altitude local climate soil properties watershed areas and mining methods shi et al 2021 stenseth et al 2002 as shown in fig 7 the effect size of watershed runoff decreased as soil bulk density and soil ph increased this is inconsistent with surface runoff which increases with increasing soil capacity tate et al 2004 increased bulk density reduces soil porosity and therefore leads to reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff shah et al 2017 however the results of our study suggested that watershed runoff shows an opposite trend to surface runoff fig 7a overall the increase in soil bulk density resulted in a 5 23 reduction in the runoff which was not significant p 0 324 in addition the increased soil ph resulted in a significant reduction in runoff p 0 05 soil ph 5 4 increases runoff while soil ph 5 4 decreases runoff and conserves water in mining areas however rhoton et al 2003 found that under simulated rainfall conditions acidic soils led to an average 20 reduction in runoff and alkaline soils led to an average 21 increase in runoff which was strongly related to the stability of soil aggregates the influence of map is followed by an increasing trend in runoff and sem precipitation provides kinetic energy for soil erosion generating runoff and sediment transport as well as providing a vehicle for soil hydra erosion liu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the kinetic energy of precipitation increases with increasing map resulting in a significant increase in runoff fig 5b and runoff depth fig 9 which aggravates soil erosion fig 11 the above result generally agrees with most previous studies all over the world marzen et al 2017 parsons stone 2006 sharpley 1985 in addition it is worth noting that coal mining increases runoff when the watershed area 2 800 km2 but it does not affect the overall trend fig 6a runoff and runoff depth decrease significantly with increasing watershed area fig 6a and 7 and soil erosion modulus and k subsequently increase figs 9 and 11 this indicates that runoff is more sensitive to mining areas on larger watershed areas as concluded by wu et al 2020 part of the reduced runoff was compensated by increased rainfall but 25 13 248 104 m3 out of 52 992 104 m3 reduced runoff was attributed to coal mining however increased rainfall due to climate change further amplifies the disturbance from mining activities and thus increases soil erosion which also deserves focused attention moreover it is awarded that underground mining is more effective in reducing runoff than surface mining fig 8b this can be understood from two aspects on the one hand underground mining is prone to the formation of unstable goaf regions which are more conducive to ponding zhou et al 2013 on the other hand the development of rock fractures due to blasting vibrations in mine area promotes water infiltration and decreases runoff sun et al 2015 it is worth noting that liu et al 2019 suggested that the risk of landslide hazards increases if underground mining is used in mines with large slopes furthermore combined mining methods decrease soil erodibility and induce more soil erosion than surface mining and underground mining fig 12 it brings a more serious hidden danger to the mine site when coal resources are mined from both above ground and underground perspectives therefore it is vital to select the appropriate coal mining methods saki et al 2020 4 3 control footprint of coal mining on soil erosion this meta analysis found that soil erosion did not decrease with a significant reduction of runoff due to coal mining which is inconsistent with site or slope scale studies the results of studies at the site or slope scale showed that the less runoff the weaker the sand carrying capacity and the less soil loss amount yang et al 2021 runoff erosion is an important manifestation of soil hydra erosion generally an increase in infiltration due to coal mining contributes to reducing runoff and thus erosion guebert gardner 2001 however our result showed that soil erosion was significantly influenced by coal mine activities it is well known that any environmental disturbance may increase soil erosion in this study it is mainly that the ecosystem stability is seriously disturbed by mining activities which led to an increase in soil erosion kalybekov et al 2020 in addition the analysis suggests that the reported increase in soil loss due to coal mining in this meta analysis is generally calculated by empirical models rather than observations table s3 the opinion of nearing 1998 for soil erosion models is that both empirical and physical models generally tend to overestimate small measurements and underestimate large measurements therefore the uncertainties in the calculated soil erosion bias our understanding of the influence of coal mining on soil erosion the data extracted in this meta analysis are mainly located in ohio usa and shaanxi province china which are ecologically fragile areas despite having abundant coal resources lv et al 2019 yang et al 2018 with the advancement of coal mining activities fragmented landscape and aggravated soil erosion further decreasing the eco environment carrying capacity amundson et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 after coal mining the soil erosion modulus increases significantly the soil erodibility factor k decreases and the soil erosion area increases which is consistent with liu et al 2019 although mining activities destroys surface vegetation and reduces the protective effect on the surface huang et al 2015 the vegetation coverage get effectively improve because of the ecological restoration measures reclamation reconstruction and rehabilitation accompanying the ecological evolution of mining areas it indicates that the influence of coal mining on surrounded ecological environment would be minimized and even converge to the pre mining state if soil and water conservation measures were adopted fig 4 at the same time ecosystems are resilient and can maintain their original functions to a certain extent in the face of external disturbances e g climate warming extreme rainfall events coal mining activities etc willis et al 2018 therefore the impact of coal mining on ecological environment was significantly reduced with the implementation of soil and water conservation measures however zulkarnain et al 2014 pointed that this does not restore to the original state especially in mining areas with active mining activities in other words water and soil conservation is the main contradiction in the development of coal resources and coal mining is also the main aspect of the contradiction in ecological protection therefore the implementation of soil and water conservation protection measures into the mining process is of great value for soil erosion control in mining areas 4 4 uncertainties in calculation of runoff soil loss and soil erosion modulus the uncertainties of calculation of runoff soil loss and soil erosion modulus usually came mainly from the following aspects 1 in this study only coal mining was considered as a human activity factor affecting runoff without considering the effects of residential water use irrigation water demand and industrial water consumption guo et al 2019 2 data before and after coal mining are subject to both spatial and temporal heterogeneity and cannot be analyzed quantitatively 3 the 10 papers containing soil erosion modulus data all give direct graphs and charts none of which illustrated or listed their calculation formulae 4 existing soil erosion models have limitations other than natural stochastic variability in soil loss measurements and the accuracy of soil erosion prediction values at different scales is difficult to estimate nearing 1998 5 the global distribution of study sites cannot completely reflect the real importance of coal mining on soil erosion at watershed scale because the collected studies only represent the research institutions or hydrologic observatories that have made relevant research on this scientific issue 6 the target variables varied considerably between different inter sites for example runoff data are from asia the americas and europe as shown in fig 16 the overall decrease in runoff after coal mining is 76 31 in asia and 6 93 in europe while it increased 77 92 in the america 7 the limited number of sites from specific climate zones may not fully represent its actual situation therefore we encourage more watershed scale studies on coal mining it these regions i e relative cold climate zone hot and dry zone in the future 8 therefore future studies should focus on the differences between soil erosion models and actual values as well as between models to effectively distinguish the mechanisms of diverse influences on soil and water conservation at watershed scale 5 conclusions among the existing literature many studies have investigated the effect of coal mining on soil and water conservation however the previous reports were often contradictory due to variations in geographical location local climates mining methods watershed area and coal mining history therefore a meta analysis was used to systematically evaluate and summarize the results of studies at a global scale to make an objective assessment of soil and water conservation in mining areas which can help in the restoration and management of the ecological environment in mining areas given the feedback of soil and water conservation to the coal mining process upon spatio temporal characteristics response the higher sensitivity of runoff to mining over time scale poses a challenge in predicting soil and water conservation effects under the impact of various factors overall it can regulate the hydrological erosion process of the watershed under the scenario of coal mining precipitation enhances the driving force of the effect size and promotes the hydrological cycle and vice versa changes in local climatic conditions watershed area and mining methods also have an impact on soil and water conservation runoff significantly decreased with increasing years after coal mining at the temporal scale while it showed a significant decrease with increasing watershed area at the spatial scale soil erosion showed an increasing trend after mining compared to the pre mining era or nearby areas without mining it is noteworthy that the precipitation and vegetation cover has increased significantly with climate warming and applied ecological restoration measures which may indicate that appropriate revegetation measures may buffer the side effects of coal mining on the ecological tendency however existing studies are highly spatial and temporal heterogeneous across sites and the statistical

2411,can total annual streamflow in any given year be largely characterised by a relatively small number of high flow events a comprehensive assessment of this is of high value as there is evidence to suggest that as flood events increase in rarity a more consistent response between streamflow extremes and temperatures increases can be established providing greater reliability in projections of rare events we propose here a novel methodology to characterise streamflow regimes in the context of total annual streamflow for water supply using the australian bureau of meteorology s hydrologic reference station database we developed annual event flow distributions that standardise the relationship between total annual streamflow and event flows it was found that the annual event flow distributions are primarily a function of local climate and catchment size and were largely insensitive to interannual variability represented by the el niño southern oscillation index mean annual temperature or total annual rainfall volume statistically significant trends were found in the timeseries of annual event flow distribution values signalling a move to a less even distribution in the southern latitudes and a more even distribution in the northern latitudes our results show that total annual streamflows can be characterised by a small number of high flow events this suggests that for australia s most critical surface drinking water supply catchments the streamflow yields can be represented by changes in a few high flow events independent of interannual variability as these relationships are non stationary they may provide a basis for understanding changes in water supply into the future keywords streamflow flood water supply trend analysis climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fresh surface water is the primary source of agricultural industrial and domestic water consumption for most of the global population yet it accounts for only 0 03 of the earth s total water resource shiklomanov 1993 in australia most of the population s water is sourced from surface runoff in streams creeks rivers and ultimately reservoirs and accounts for between 70 and 90 of the water supplied to australia s three most populous cities sydney melbourne and brisbane 2019 20 data bom 2016 however australia is also the driest inhabited continent on earth with most regions receiving less than 500 mm of rain annually geoscience australia 1994 australia is also subject to large climate variability at both annual and interannual cycles resulting in higher variations of annual rainfall king et al 2014 streamflow mcmahon et al 1992 mcmahon et al 1987 mcmahon et al 2007a mcmahon et al 2007b mcmahon et al 2007c and flooding kiem et al 2003 compared to the rest of the world this high dependency on surface water coupled with high variability in hydroclimate places australia s water security in an especially vulnerable position an important aspect of understanding australia s current and future water supply security is the characterisation of streamflow regimes that is how streamflow yields vary both spatially and temporally understanding how the temporal and spatial variability of streamflow is dependent on changes in temperature geography catchment size and climate modes e g el niño southern oscillation or enso is of utmost importance to policy makers and planners there is also a need to understand how the variability of streamflow at any given location may change with the increased evidence of marked changes in the global climate resulting from anthropogenic global warming beck et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2022 it has been shown that increases in temperature are leading to increases in mean precipitation across the globe but these changes are not universally observed due to altered atmospheric circulation patterns increases in precipitation are largely occurring over the tropics with decreases elsewhere beck et al 2019 sun et al 2021 furthermore the observed increases in extreme rainfall shown to align with the clausius clapeyron relationship sun et al 2021 have not appeared to translate into observed increases in streamflows sharma and wasko 2019 in the absence of snowmelt it has been shown that the larger high flow events that are more likely to lead to the filling and possible overtopping of water reservoirs are increasing milly et al 2002 whilst smaller more frequent high flow pulses that are relied upon for sustaining reservoirs are decreasing wasko and nathan 2019 closer inspection of the mechanisms underlying these streamflow trends suggests that antecedent soil moisture conditions are modulating the relationship between rainfall and streamflow wasko et al 2020a woldemeskel and sharma 2016 it was found that the opposing influence of drying soils and increased rainfall intensities on flow events varies with event rarity with flow trends increasing in line with rainfall for the rarest events sharma et al 2018 further suggest that the rarest floods are likely to increase in line with increases in extreme rainfalls and temperature while less extreme streamflow events particularly for larger catchments are likely to decrease there is a need to characterise these changes in streamflows in a way that can help inform the risks to water supply under climate change traditionally projections of climate change are grounded in simulations from general circulation models gcms with predefined climate forcings however whilst gcms have high skill in projecting temperatures they have lower skill in projecting precipitation du 2022 johnson et al 2011 johnson and sharma 2009 kim et al 2020 and hence streamflow changes peel et al 2015 for streamflow projections typically a model chain is used whereby gcms or gcm outputs such as temperature and precipitation are downscaled with bias correction for a specific local region and then input to catchment scale hydrological models however significant uncertainties in hydrological climate impact projections arise from several different sources within this model chain uncertainties cascade from one modelling step to another and the overall envelope of uncertainty is amplified along each step of the model chain any biases that are present in gcm projections of precipitation and temperature are subsequently amplified in simulated runoff hakala et al 2019 it has been shown that generally the largest proportion of uncertainty is associated with gcms addor et al 2014 an assessment of within gcm uncertainty that is the variability in gcm outputs arising from adopting slightly different but equally plausible initial conditions was undertaken eghdamirad et al 2016 kim et al 2020 peel et al 2015 and showed that uncertainties of the mean and standard deviation variability of annual runoff were up to 26 and 40 respectively this assessment of within gcm uncertainty did not include any assessment of uncertainty between different gcms or the uncertainty in overall trends produced from the gcm and so is likely to underestimate the overall uncertainty arising from gcms whilst gcms and the choice of gcm may account for the largest source of uncertainty the choice of downscaling methods is also an appreciable source of uncertainty nathan et al 2019 it has been shown that the choice of downscaling method can be of similar importance to that of gcms in hydrological impact studies teutschbein et al 2011 and that for extreme high flows the application of different downscaling methods can nearly double the range of results across different gcms wang et al 2017 owing to the significant and compounding uncertainties involved in the modelling chain from gcm to downscaling bias correction and hydrological modelling there is a clear need for investigating alternative approaches for projecting future climate streamflows one such approach would include characterising and quantifying a flow regimes dependency on a climate variable that might be confidently simulated by gcm models such as temperature roderick et al 2020 wasko 2021 for example wasko and sharma 2017 found that as flood events increase in rarity catchment characteristics such as initial soil moisture become less relevant and a more consistent response between streamflow extremes and temperatures increases can be established therefore if total annual streamflow can be predicted by a small number of high flow events then this might facilitate the projection of future changes on water supply reliability in this study we characterise the relationship between high flow events and total annual streamflow and use this to explore differences in streamflow regime across australia furthermore we investigate how such relationships might depend on interannual variability as well as on trends in temperature while there have been a number of previous studies that have investigated streamflow characteristics and trends at an international and australian continental scale chiew 2006 do et al 2017 ishak et al 2013 mcmahon et al 2007a mcmahon et al 2007b mcmahon et al 2007c milly et al 2005 milly et al 2018 sharma and wasko 2019 wasko et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 as far as the authors are aware characterisation of the relationship between total annual streamflow and flood events has not been attempted before 2 data 2 1 climate australia being a large country is comprised of multiple climate regimes that generally vary with latitude and proximity to the coast areas in the northern tropical latitudes are typically characterised by hot humid summers and warm drier winters with the majority of annual rainfall concentrated over the summer monsoon season approximately october to april the interior of the continent typically has hot dry summers and cold winters with low annual rainfalls the temperate southern coastal areas are characterised by warm mild summers and cool winters with moderate high annual rainfalls monthly rainfall is distributed approximately evenly over the year to define the extents of these climate zones modified köppen climate classifications peel et al 2007 were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology and represent the six major climate zones present across australia the major climate zones aggregate the total 25 köppen climate classifications which consider the seasonal distribution of temperature and precipitation the major climate zones are temperate grassland desert subtropical tropical and equatorial see fig 1 modified climate zones are defined using the climatic limits of native vegetation with the assumption that native vegetation is the best expression of climate in an area bom 2016 2 2 streamflow the streamflow data used here is the australian bureau of meteorology s hydrologic reference stations hrs bom 2021b the hrs national network comprises 467 stations recording daily streamflows the hrs are long high quality streamflows records that are spatially representative of all hydro climate regions in australia see fig 1 and represent the climate zones that are found across much of the world to be included in the hrs a station must satisfy a set of thorough data quality selection guidelines including but not limited to being a largely unregulated catchment with minimal land use change 10 having a long period of record 30 years containing less than 5 of missing data a maximum of 25 of flow volume outside gauging limits a maximum of 10 flow volume of infilled data data infilled using the gr4j hydrologic model given the large spatial and temporal extent of the dataset and the strict data quality requirements the hrs network provides a suitable dataset for establishing streamflow regimes identifying and assessing long term trends and predicting the effects of climate variability across australia s hydro climatic regions hrs streamflow records begin in 1950 with a small number of stations 50 the number of active stations increases rapidly between the mid 1960s to 1980s with a maximum number of stations reached by the 1990s see fig 2 streamflow records are hence typically between 45 and 55 years up to a maximum of 70 years catchment sizes are predominantly distributed between 102 and 103 km2 though extend from as small as 5 km2 to as large as 200 000 km2 catchment sizes and streamflow record lengths are spread across a broad range of latitudes over the continent with the highest concentration around the 40 30 degrees south bands in the temperate climate catchment yields ml km2 calculated by dividing mean annual streamflow by catchment size provide a useful comparative measure of hydro climatology fig 1 shows that there is a clear dependence between catchment yield and climate zone definitions catchments in the central arid region of the continent show low yields 50 ml km2 compared to catchments in the temperate south east which can be around 2 000 ml km2 wasko and guo 2022 the coefficient of variation for total annual streamflow depicts high spatial variability across the continent see fig 1 catchments in the centre of the continent and along the north east coast show high coefficients of variation 1 whilst catchments in the northernmost and southernmost latitudes show lower coefficients of variation 0 5 2 3 temperature and rainfall site temperature and rainfall data was obtained from the australian water availability project awap climate data outputs produced by the australian bureau of meteorology bom 2021a bom 2021c awap is an operational data assimilation and modelling system that monitors the state and trend of the australian terrestrial water balance at a gridded resolution of 0 05 degrees 5 5 km raupach et al 2009 grid outputs of daily maximum temperature and daily total rainfall depth were utilised and catchment averages calculated based on catchment boundaries 2 4 el niño southern oscillation the climates of the eastern and northern parts of australia are strongly impacted by the el niño southern oscillation the southern oscillation index soi is an indicative measure of the development and intensity of el niño or la niña events in the pacific ocean and is calculated using pressure differences between tahiti and darwin sustained negative soi values less than 7 typically indicate el niño events while sustained positive soi values greater than 7 typically indicate la niña events southern oscillation index values as published by the australian bureau of meteorology bom 2021d were used to determine the strongest el niño events 1965 1972 1977 1982 1991 1992 1994 1997 2002 2015 and la niña events 1950 1955 1956 1971 1973 1974 1975 1988 1998 2010 over the hrs data record 3 methodology 3 1 annual event flow distribution to characterise the distribution of high flow events for each of the stations in the hrs dataset as a percentage of total annual streamflow an annual event flow distribution was developed for each station streamflow events were sampled with differing frequency expressed in terms of their average annual frequency the annual event flow distribution was then calculated as the proportion of total streamflow in each year resulting from events of a given frequency the procedure is outlined in detail below step 1 identification of water year all analyses were undertaken on a water year basis where the month with lowest average flow was designated the first month of the water year wasko et al 2020b step 2 identification of events event identification was undertaken using the hydroevents r package developed by wasko and guo 2022 events were identified on the basis of exceeding a given baseflow index kaur et al 2017 using the eventsbaseflow function the baseflow index is defined as the proportion of streamflow that occurs as baseflow the function first computes the baseflow separation at every time step using a one parameter recursive lyne and hollick lh digital filter rdf a digital filter approach was selected as it provides an objective and repeatable estimate of an index of baseflow that is easily automated the lh rdf was used as it is the most extensively used rdf in the literature and is arguably the most parsimonious eckhardt 2008 wasko and guo 2022 the lh digital filter is described by nathan and mcmahon 1990 as 1 f k α f k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 where f k is the baseflow filtered streamflow at the kth sampling point y k is the unfiltered streamflow and α is the filter parameter a filter parameter of 0 925 was used as recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 flood events are then identified when streamflows exceed a baseflow index threshold for this analysis a baseflow index threshold of 0 5 was chosen thus the start of an event was defined as the timestep when filtered streamflow accounted for greater than 50 of total streamflow and the end of an event when filtered streamflow fell back below 50 of total streamflow a sensitivity analysis was performed on the chosen baseflow index for event separation by additionally undertaking the analysis documented herein with baseflow index thresholds of 0 4 and 0 6 the conclusions were found to remain unchanged step 3 sampling of events of a given frequency a sample of flood events was derived for each catchment using a peaks over threshold approach a threshold volume was selected that yielded on average a number of events per year with flow volumes equal to or greater than the nominated threshold a number of thresholds were selected to represent a range of event frequencies ranging from 12 exceedances per year events that occur once a month on average to 0 2 exceedances per year events that occur on average once every five years we adopted a frequency metric based on exceedances per year ey the inverse of the annual average recurrence interval ari as our focus is on small floods that may occur multiple times per year ey is defined herein as the exceedance frequency of events that are equal to or greater than a given threshold the frequencies considered here are 12 10 6 3 2 1 0 5 and 0 2 ey so for example for 12 ey events for a record length of 50 years the largest 12 50 600 events were sampled conversely for a 0 2 ey the largest 10 events were sampled step 4 calculation of proportion of total annual flow resulting from a given exceedance for each water year at each station for a given frequency e g 12 ey the total flow resulting from the sampled events was divided by the total annual streamflow this can be presented as follows 2 f e y x q y i 1 n e i y x j 1 m q j y 100 p y x 3 p x f e y x q y y y where e represents an event flow volume q a daily flow volume y the years on record and x the severity threshold of the flood where x corresponds to one of the defined eys the first term i 1 n e i y x is the sum of all event flows from rank 1 to n in the sample of average annual frequency x in water year y the second term j 1 m q j y is the sum of all daily flows from rank 1 to m where m is 365 366 in that same water year y dividing the first term by the second term gives the percentage of annual flow attributable to events of severity x in year y this was repeated for all y complete water years on record to obtain the set of values p x it is noted that some years may not contain any events particularly for the rarest frequencies as events were sampled on a peak over threshold approach in this case the year was omitted from the calculation for more frequent exceedance thresholds some sites may also not have a sufficient number of events on record and these were also omitted step 5 calculation of annual event flow distribution for each site for a given ey the median percentage for all the years with data is calculated the annual event flow distribution is then the curve resulting from calculating this median percentage for each ey in equations this is the median percent of total annual flow in p x as determined in equations 2 and 3 across all years y for each threshold x an example application is detailed below example results are presented for the hunter river in nsw hrs 210011 in fig 3 here each boxplot represents the distribution of percentages of total annual flow attributable to the sum of event flows for the respective event threshold i e the distribution of p y x values each histogram represents one event frequency ey with the median of all the years shown in bold the boxplot hence represents the interannual variability with boxes extending to the 25th q1 and 75th q3 percentiles and the whiskers extending out 1 5 times the interquartile range from q1 and q3 respectively for events less frequent than the 1 ey median values are approximately 45 with large ranges from less than 25 up to 80 however for events more frequent than the 6 ey median values are greater than 75 with smaller ranges between 70 and 90 from these results we can see that floods that are expected to occur once every year i e 1ey can account for as much as 75 of total annual streamflow though typically in any given year such floods account for approximately 45 of the total annual flow the vast majority 80 of total annual streamflow is accounted for by the 10ey events i e the 10 largest events that occur on average every year 3 2 determination of trend to analyse temporal trends in the proportion of annual flow volumes associated with different event thresholds the non parametric mann kendall test was applied at the 10 significance level the mann kendall test determines whether monotonically increasing or decreasing trends are present in a timeseries by analysing the differences in sign between consecutive events mann 1945 the mann kendall test assumes a null hypothesis of no trend and an alternative hypothesis of upward or downward trend the mann kendall test calculates the following statistic 4 s i 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x i where x denotes the annual flow proportion being investigated and uses the following test statistic to determine whether trends are significant to a predefined level eq 5 5 z s 1 σ i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 σ i f s 0 the magnitude of trend present in the timeseries was evaluated using the sen s slope estimator the sen s slope estimator was chosen as it is a robust non parametric method that is relatively insensitive to outliers by choosing the median of all slopes between pairs of data points sen 1968 the trend is determined by the following procedure 6 β m e d i a n x j x i j i j i where β is the slope estimator a value of β 0 indicates a monotonically increasing trend whilst a value of β 0 indicates a monotonically decreasing trend while temporal trends were investigated using mann kendall tests and sen s slopes relationships between variables were calculated by linear regression 4 results 4 1 median annual event flow distribution curve at hrs feature stations we first examine seven feature stations representing a range of differing catchment characteristics across the hrs network the feature stations are selected by the australian bureau of meteorology refer table 1 and comprise varying locations across australia s hydroclimates a range of catchment sizes and diversified land use the median annual event flow distribution curves for each station and a description of the catchment characteristics are presented in fig 4 and table 1 respectively the median annual event flow distributions for the feature stations suggest that the annual distribution of flows over events are a function of the catchment climate and the catchment size the feature catchment from australia s tropical region g8170002 in the northern territory typically has a higher proportion of annual streamflow concentrated in proportionally fewer events for example in any given year typically over 50 of the total annual streamflow is attributable to 1 ey events this is consistent with the highly seasonal nature of the tropical region s rainfall with most of the regions annual rainfall falling within the wet season october to april and the remaining months characterised by long dry spells characteristically the temperate and subtropical regions exhibit a relatively more moderate annual flow distribution with approximately 40 of flows in a typical year accounted for by events equal to or greater than the 1 ey the exception to this is station a2390519 temperate which exhibits a high proportion of total annual streamflow 65 provided by 1 ey events owing to the large catchment size when comparing within climate regions smaller catchments appear to have lower percentages of total annual streamflow for the smaller catchments 210011 temperate and 305202 temperate there is relatively less of the annual streamflow volume contained in larger less frequent events 4 2 median annual event flow distribution curves across australia the annual event flow distributions across all hrs sites across australia are presented in fig 5 the station medians as calculated in step 5 for each ey are presented as boxplots with the boxplots representing the climatic variability across australia fig 5 presents that across australia in any given year approximately 50 of total annual streamflow volume is attributable to 1 ey events for 6 ey events this increases to approximately 70 of total annual streamflow the number of stations represented by the boxplots is shown by the transparent histogram for events 0 2 ey to 4 ey almost all 467 hrs are included however for events more frequent than the 4 ey the number of included stations declines as the number of stations having the required number of independent events on average per year decreases the number of years on record at the respective stations represented by the median is shown by the colour bar as per section 2 2 hrs have record lengths typically between 45 and 55 years thus for events rarer than the 1ey much of the streamflow record will not have an observed event on average only 8 17 and 28 years of record are represented by each value for the 0 1 ey 0 5ey and 0 2 ey event thresholds respectively however summarising fig 5 does not show if any climatic variability exists or if any variability exists with catchment size hence thresholds of 0 2ey 1ey and 4 ey were chosen as a representative range to assess accounting for multi year recurrence intervals to sub yearly recurrence intervals and best balancing representation of the greatest number of sites and years 4 3 variability with respect to climate the percent of total annual streamflow attributed to 4 ey 1 ey and 0 2 ey events are plotted with modified köppen climate classifications across the australian continent to investigate variability with respect to climate see fig 6 tropical and sub tropical climates which have strongly summer dominant rainfall have a higher concentration of total annual streamflow across all event thresholds this distinction is most noticeable in the 4 ey threshold with median percentages of total annual streamflow between 70 and 90 across the tropical north a similar trend is also clear across the grassland and desert regions of central australia where although the rainfall is less seasonal few rainfall events occur in these areas around 60 90 of total annual streamflow is concentrated in events at all thresholds making these areas highly reliant on few rainfall flooding events for the entire year s streamflow the southern temperate areas along the southeast and southwest coast typically receive around 15 40 of the total annual streamflow from 0 2 ey and 1ey events and 30 60 of the total annual streamflow from 4 ey events this proportion of total annual streamflow is relatively less when compared to the northern half of the country however still represents a substantial dependence on a small number of events to account for the majority of total annual streamflow moreover there are two distinct regions where a more even distribution of total annual streamflow is evident the south eastern corner of new south wales and north eastern corner of victoria in addition to western tasmania all exhibit a relationship of approximately 15 30 of total annual streamflow from events across all thresholds these areas have very low aridity indexes and have some of the highest mean annual rainfall volumes in all australia of particular note in fig 6 is that most surface drinking water supply catchments around the most populous metropolitan areas of sydney south eastern temperate melbourne southern temperate brisbane eastern subtropical and perth south western subtropical temperate have approximately 60 70 of the total annual streamflow concentrated in 4 ey events this demonstrates the reliance of most of australia s fresh water supply on relatively few streamflow events in the year 4 4 variability with respect to catchment size as discussed in section 4 1 catchment size is a secondary factor affecting the proportion of annual flow volumes contributed to by event flows to assess the impact of catchment size on annual event flow distribution hrs catchment size was plotted against the site medians of the proportion of total annual flow from the three chosen event thresholds the 4 ey 1 ey and 0 2 ey see fig 7 it can be observed that the majority of stations are between 100 and 1 000 km2 with a small minority of stations greater than 10 000 km2 15 and less than 100 km2 60 linear regression was performed on each of the respective sets of paired data to visualise the direction and slope of the linear relationship across all event thresholds the proportion of annual flows derived from the selected events was found to have an increasing linear trend with catchment area smaller catchments of sizes around 100 km2 generally have over 20 less of total annual streamflow from the respective event thresholds than very large catchments around 10 000 km2 the trend slope was also found to be of similar magnitude across all event thresholds from multi year to multiple per year event recurrence intervals the relationship between catchment size and total annual streamflow concentration is physically described by the much longer response times of larger catchments caused by the greater effect of soil moisture storage and evapotranspiration summed over a greater catchment extent in simple terms a large event is needed to cause runoff in a large catchment 4 5 impact of interannual variability having developed a representation of the relationship between total annual streamflow and flood events we investigated the effects of interannual variability on the representation and the sensitivity to interannual variability in streamflows 4 5 1 el niño southern oscillation one of the strongest climate drivers in australia particularly for the northern and eastern parts of the continent is the el niño southern oscillation enso the el niño phase is characterised by higher maximum daily temperatures and reduced rainfalls in contrast to the la niña phase which is characterised by lower maximum daily temperatures and increased rainfalls the ten strongest el niño years since 1950 and ten strongest la niña years since 1950 based on soi were extracted from the records for each hrs and the annual event flow distribution derived results were then grouped according to each station s respective modified köppen climate classification this was repeated for each of the three chosen event thresholds see fig 8 given the very limited number of sites and events available for catchments in desert and equatorial climate zones boxplots could not be derived sites were aggregated based on climate classification however it is noted that not all stations are affected equally by enso generally the southern half of the continent experiences higher increases in temperature the eastern part of the continent experiences more dramatic decreases in rainfall and the south west experiences less pronounced changes overall results from the assessment of enso years show relatively small differences in percentages of total annual streamflow with respect to both climate zone and event magnitude for temperate climates results show little deviation in both range and median for la niña and el niño years across all event thresholds in subtropical climates there is a small decrease in the overall median from la niña to el niño years for the 4 ey and 1 ey event thresholds while for the 0 2 ey threshold there is an opposite trend of an increasing median value from la niña to el niño years in tropical climates a small increase in the overall median from la niña to el niño years for the 4 ey and 1 ey event thresholds is evident while for the 0 2 ey threshold there is also an opposing trend of a decreasing median value from la niña to el niño years in grassland climates there are very few stations though the ones analysed again showed only a small difference 5 between la niña and el niño year values the differences in percentages of total annual streamflow between la niña and el niño years are most pronounced for larger event thresholds such as the 0 2 ey larger event thresholds also appear to have opposed trends between la niña and el niño years when compared to smaller event thresholds however in general the difference in annual event flow distribution values between la niña and el niño years remain relatively small it is well documented kiem et al 2003 that la niña years typically have a considerably larger on average 70 average annual flow volume compared to el niño years however while the flow volume is likely to vary with soi annual event flow distribution is dominated by the effects of catchment climate and size and the interannual flux in soi within climate zones does not appear to have as significant an impact on the percentage of total annual flow accounted for by individual events 4 5 2 warm and cold years similar to the enso assessment the variability of annual event flow distributions with respect to annual temperature was investigated the years of record at each site were ranked according to the average annual daily maximum temperature as derived from the awap dataset the record was then spilt in half to represent the warmest years and coldest years on record and the annual event flow distribution derived for each set of years at each site results were then grouped according to each station s modified köppen climate classification this was repeated for each of the three chosen event thresholds see fig 9 given the very limited number of sites and events available for catchments in desert and equatorial climate zones boxplots could not be derived across all climate zones and event thresholds results generally show a very minor increase in total annual event flow distribution values for warm years over cold years with a largely consistent range however typically warmer years have a considerably smaller average annual flow volume milly et al 2018 hence it appears that while the flow volume is likely to vary with temperature the annual event flow distribution is again dominated by the effects of climate zone and catchment size the interannual temperature differences within climate zones does not appear to have as significant an impact on the percentage of total annual flow accounted for by individual events 4 5 3 wet and dry years thirdly an assessment of annual streamflow distribution variability with respect to rainfall or wetness was investigated the total annual rainfall was calculated at each hrs site using the awap data and the years of record at each site ranked according to annual rainfall depth the record was then spilt in half to represent the wettest years and driest years on record the annual event flow distribution values were calculated and grouped by each station s modified köppen climate classification results are presented in fig 10 this was repeated for each of the three chosen event thresholds given the very limited number of sites available for catchments in desert and equatorial climate zones boxplots could not be derived across all climate zones and event thresholds results generally show a very minor change in total annual event flow distribution values for wet years over dry years with a consistent range it is generally the case that annual event flow distribution is not significantly altered by interannual increases in annual rainfall magnitude within climate zones and catchments therefore the annual event flow distribution is again observed to be dominated by climate zone and catchment area 4 6 trends in percent of total annual flow accounted for by top flow percentiles finally due to possible non stationarity because of climate warming the presence and magnitude of trends in median annual event flow values was calculated for each hrs for each of the three event thresholds statistically significant trends were identified with the mann kendall test applied at the 10 significance level the magnitude of trends present in the timeseries were evaluated with the sen s slope estimator results of the trend analysis are displayed in fig 11 for the largest event threshold chosen 0 2 ey in the sub tropical and temperate areas of the south east of the continent stations have predominantly positive trends in the median percent of total annual streamflow values for smaller event thresholds 1ey and 4ey the trend majority appears to reverse into predominantly negative trends these trends describe a change in annual event flow distributions where the percent of total annual streamflow from the larger events with multi year return period is increasing while the percent of total annual streamflow from smaller more frequent events is decreasing elsewhere clear regional trends are less identifiable in the centre desert northern equatorial and tropical areas of the continent trends are more mixed due to the sparsity of stations in these locations less statistically significant trends were also found in the temperate south west trends are also more mixed though of the statistically significant trends a primarily decreasing trend was identified for the 1 ey and a primarily increasing trend identified for the 4 ey given the mix of trends we present median sen s slope trend estimates of the percentage of total annual streamflow for all event thresholds across all sites in each climate zone in a matrix heatmap fig 12 very few sites exist in the desert and equatorial zones 7 and 2 sites respectively and none with statistically significant trends but overall we can see a drying trend whereby when events do occur they are contributing less to the total annual streamflow for more frequent events grassland and subtropical zones present a small increase in the percentage of total annual streamflow but for the largest events again a decrease suggesting reduced runoff from the largest streamflow events most sites are located in temperate regions where while more frequent events have a decreasing contribution to the total annual streamflow larger events have an increasing contribution to total annual streamflow this provides evidence for the historical trends identified in wasko and nathan 2019 that flood magnitudes are increasing for the rarest events while decreasing for more frequent events across large parts of australia in the tropics for all event frequencies increases in the fraction of total annual streamflow were found consistent with the increasing trend in streamflow event magnitudes in this region but again it is noted the largest events are increasing the most and hence having the largest proportional increase of the percentage of total annual streamflow wasko et al 2019 it is well worth noting that the trends observed are small however when compounded over a 10 20 or 50 year period these trends result in non negligible changes to the share of total annual streamflow from each event for example the temperate 0 2 ey events with a trend slope of 0 69 over 50 years would result in a 40 increase in the share of total annual streamflow derived from 0 2 ey events 5 discussion with the large uncertainty in projecting water supply into the future there is a need to characterise flow regimes if total annual streamflow could be categorised as the change in a small number of well described peak events an avenue for estimating the impacts on the entire annual flow regime could be developed in general it was identified that streamflow volumes across australia as recorded by the hrs network can be characterised by a small number of high flow events it was observed that in any given year approximately 50 of total annual streamflow volume is attributable to events equal to or greater than the 1 ey it was determined that this distribution of total annual streamflow was primarily a function of climate zone classification and secondly catchment size interannual variability in soi temperature and rainfall volume as expected greatly impacts streamflow volumes though within climate zones it did not appear to greatly impact the total annual streamflow distribution hence it can be concluded that the typical shape of the annual cumulative flow diagram is largely characteristic of the site and is not significantly altered by interannual changes in flow volume rather it is just scaled in magnitude statistically significant spatially consistent trends in the timeseries of annual event flow distribution values were found that varied with event magnitude these trends signalled a move to a relatively less even distribution in the southeast of the continent where larger magnitude event flows were found to be increasing as a percentage of total annual streamflow whilst smaller more frequent events are decreasing the spatially dependent trends observed in annual event flow distribution are consistent with historical changes in precipitation increases observed in global precipitation have occurred over tropical areas with decreases elsewhere and soil moisture also showing wetting trends in the tropics and drying outside of the tropics wasko et al 2021 rainfall has also become increasingly sporadic across australia dey et al 2020 with short duration rainfall events 1 2 days increasing in intensity and becoming more frequent compared to a significant reduction in longer duration rainfall events 3 6 days in the southern areas of australia with an opposite trend observed in the northern tropics these trends in rainfall and soil moisture are consistent with an observed general decrease in annual streamflow volumes across australia sharma and wasko 2019 zhang et al 2016 due to less runoff in general it has been observed that in the tropics where soil moisture is increasing the proportion of total annual streamflow is increasing for all events ho et al 2022 though in temperate regions where soil moisture is decreasing only the largest events are corresponding to an increase in the proportion of total annual streamflow as smaller daily flows are being reduced to soil moisture storage wasko and nathan 2019 thus the observed trend of a less even distribution in the extratropics found in this study is consistent with the growing body of work investigating the changes in hydrologic characteristics with climate 6 conclusion in this study a representation of the annual event flow distribution was developed and implemented across australia utilising the hrs network standardising the representation of how total annual streamflow is distributed over a typical year to understand whether annual streamflow volumes can be characterised by flood events it was found that a small number of events are largely responsible for total annual streamflow a trend of increasingly skewed total annual event flow distributions was identified around australia s most important surface drinking water supply catchments near the most populous metropolitan areas of south east australia potentially posing a threat to future water security this study suggests that total annual streamflow is likely to become more dependent on a relatively small number of events making water supply systems more sensitive to failure there is a need to develop reliable water supply projection methodologies for a non stationary environment to safeguard against future water insecurity the work here suggests a large portion of the streamflow in water supply reservoirs can be approximated from a small number of streamflow events whose behaviour into the future can be relatively well constrained given the discussed influence of antecedent soil moisture conditions on more frequent flow magnitudes and the more palatable predictions of larger rainfalls and floods further work is envisioned in developing novel streamflow prediction methodologies that split streamflow records into a set of characteristic peak flow events and a characteristic baseflow according to a defined flow threshold once partitioned separate predictions can be made for peak flows and low flows respectively that may then be scaled based on non stationary climate variables and subsequently recombined to assess potential water security scenarios under a warming climate credit authorship contribution statement caleb dykman

2411,can total annual streamflow in any given year be largely characterised by a relatively small number of high flow events a comprehensive assessment of this is of high value as there is evidence to suggest that as flood events increase in rarity a more consistent response between streamflow extremes and temperatures increases can be established providing greater reliability in projections of rare events we propose here a novel methodology to characterise streamflow regimes in the context of total annual streamflow for water supply using the australian bureau of meteorology s hydrologic reference station database we developed annual event flow distributions that standardise the relationship between total annual streamflow and event flows it was found that the annual event flow distributions are primarily a function of local climate and catchment size and were largely insensitive to interannual variability represented by the el niño southern oscillation index mean annual temperature or total annual rainfall volume statistically significant trends were found in the timeseries of annual event flow distribution values signalling a move to a less even distribution in the southern latitudes and a more even distribution in the northern latitudes our results show that total annual streamflows can be characterised by a small number of high flow events this suggests that for australia s most critical surface drinking water supply catchments the streamflow yields can be represented by changes in a few high flow events independent of interannual variability as these relationships are non stationary they may provide a basis for understanding changes in water supply into the future keywords streamflow flood water supply trend analysis climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fresh surface water is the primary source of agricultural industrial and domestic water consumption for most of the global population yet it accounts for only 0 03 of the earth s total water resource shiklomanov 1993 in australia most of the population s water is sourced from surface runoff in streams creeks rivers and ultimately reservoirs and accounts for between 70 and 90 of the water supplied to australia s three most populous cities sydney melbourne and brisbane 2019 20 data bom 2016 however australia is also the driest inhabited continent on earth with most regions receiving less than 500 mm of rain annually geoscience australia 1994 australia is also subject to large climate variability at both annual and interannual cycles resulting in higher variations of annual rainfall king et al 2014 streamflow mcmahon et al 1992 mcmahon et al 1987 mcmahon et al 2007a mcmahon et al 2007b mcmahon et al 2007c and flooding kiem et al 2003 compared to the rest of the world this high dependency on surface water coupled with high variability in hydroclimate places australia s water security in an especially vulnerable position an important aspect of understanding australia s current and future water supply security is the characterisation of streamflow regimes that is how streamflow yields vary both spatially and temporally understanding how the temporal and spatial variability of streamflow is dependent on changes in temperature geography catchment size and climate modes e g el niño southern oscillation or enso is of utmost importance to policy makers and planners there is also a need to understand how the variability of streamflow at any given location may change with the increased evidence of marked changes in the global climate resulting from anthropogenic global warming beck et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2022 it has been shown that increases in temperature are leading to increases in mean precipitation across the globe but these changes are not universally observed due to altered atmospheric circulation patterns increases in precipitation are largely occurring over the tropics with decreases elsewhere beck et al 2019 sun et al 2021 furthermore the observed increases in extreme rainfall shown to align with the clausius clapeyron relationship sun et al 2021 have not appeared to translate into observed increases in streamflows sharma and wasko 2019 in the absence of snowmelt it has been shown that the larger high flow events that are more likely to lead to the filling and possible overtopping of water reservoirs are increasing milly et al 2002 whilst smaller more frequent high flow pulses that are relied upon for sustaining reservoirs are decreasing wasko and nathan 2019 closer inspection of the mechanisms underlying these streamflow trends suggests that antecedent soil moisture conditions are modulating the relationship between rainfall and streamflow wasko et al 2020a woldemeskel and sharma 2016 it was found that the opposing influence of drying soils and increased rainfall intensities on flow events varies with event rarity with flow trends increasing in line with rainfall for the rarest events sharma et al 2018 further suggest that the rarest floods are likely to increase in line with increases in extreme rainfalls and temperature while less extreme streamflow events particularly for larger catchments are likely to decrease there is a need to characterise these changes in streamflows in a way that can help inform the risks to water supply under climate change traditionally projections of climate change are grounded in simulations from general circulation models gcms with predefined climate forcings however whilst gcms have high skill in projecting temperatures they have lower skill in projecting precipitation du 2022 johnson et al 2011 johnson and sharma 2009 kim et al 2020 and hence streamflow changes peel et al 2015 for streamflow projections typically a model chain is used whereby gcms or gcm outputs such as temperature and precipitation are downscaled with bias correction for a specific local region and then input to catchment scale hydrological models however significant uncertainties in hydrological climate impact projections arise from several different sources within this model chain uncertainties cascade from one modelling step to another and the overall envelope of uncertainty is amplified along each step of the model chain any biases that are present in gcm projections of precipitation and temperature are subsequently amplified in simulated runoff hakala et al 2019 it has been shown that generally the largest proportion of uncertainty is associated with gcms addor et al 2014 an assessment of within gcm uncertainty that is the variability in gcm outputs arising from adopting slightly different but equally plausible initial conditions was undertaken eghdamirad et al 2016 kim et al 2020 peel et al 2015 and showed that uncertainties of the mean and standard deviation variability of annual runoff were up to 26 and 40 respectively this assessment of within gcm uncertainty did not include any assessment of uncertainty between different gcms or the uncertainty in overall trends produced from the gcm and so is likely to underestimate the overall uncertainty arising from gcms whilst gcms and the choice of gcm may account for the largest source of uncertainty the choice of downscaling methods is also an appreciable source of uncertainty nathan et al 2019 it has been shown that the choice of downscaling method can be of similar importance to that of gcms in hydrological impact studies teutschbein et al 2011 and that for extreme high flows the application of different downscaling methods can nearly double the range of results across different gcms wang et al 2017 owing to the significant and compounding uncertainties involved in the modelling chain from gcm to downscaling bias correction and hydrological modelling there is a clear need for investigating alternative approaches for projecting future climate streamflows one such approach would include characterising and quantifying a flow regimes dependency on a climate variable that might be confidently simulated by gcm models such as temperature roderick et al 2020 wasko 2021 for example wasko and sharma 2017 found that as flood events increase in rarity catchment characteristics such as initial soil moisture become less relevant and a more consistent response between streamflow extremes and temperatures increases can be established therefore if total annual streamflow can be predicted by a small number of high flow events then this might facilitate the projection of future changes on water supply reliability in this study we characterise the relationship between high flow events and total annual streamflow and use this to explore differences in streamflow regime across australia furthermore we investigate how such relationships might depend on interannual variability as well as on trends in temperature while there have been a number of previous studies that have investigated streamflow characteristics and trends at an international and australian continental scale chiew 2006 do et al 2017 ishak et al 2013 mcmahon et al 2007a mcmahon et al 2007b mcmahon et al 2007c milly et al 2005 milly et al 2018 sharma and wasko 2019 wasko et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 as far as the authors are aware characterisation of the relationship between total annual streamflow and flood events has not been attempted before 2 data 2 1 climate australia being a large country is comprised of multiple climate regimes that generally vary with latitude and proximity to the coast areas in the northern tropical latitudes are typically characterised by hot humid summers and warm drier winters with the majority of annual rainfall concentrated over the summer monsoon season approximately october to april the interior of the continent typically has hot dry summers and cold winters with low annual rainfalls the temperate southern coastal areas are characterised by warm mild summers and cool winters with moderate high annual rainfalls monthly rainfall is distributed approximately evenly over the year to define the extents of these climate zones modified köppen climate classifications peel et al 2007 were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology and represent the six major climate zones present across australia the major climate zones aggregate the total 25 köppen climate classifications which consider the seasonal distribution of temperature and precipitation the major climate zones are temperate grassland desert subtropical tropical and equatorial see fig 1 modified climate zones are defined using the climatic limits of native vegetation with the assumption that native vegetation is the best expression of climate in an area bom 2016 2 2 streamflow the streamflow data used here is the australian bureau of meteorology s hydrologic reference stations hrs bom 2021b the hrs national network comprises 467 stations recording daily streamflows the hrs are long high quality streamflows records that are spatially representative of all hydro climate regions in australia see fig 1 and represent the climate zones that are found across much of the world to be included in the hrs a station must satisfy a set of thorough data quality selection guidelines including but not limited to being a largely unregulated catchment with minimal land use change 10 having a long period of record 30 years containing less than 5 of missing data a maximum of 25 of flow volume outside gauging limits a maximum of 10 flow volume of infilled data data infilled using the gr4j hydrologic model given the large spatial and temporal extent of the dataset and the strict data quality requirements the hrs network provides a suitable dataset for establishing streamflow regimes identifying and assessing long term trends and predicting the effects of climate variability across australia s hydro climatic regions hrs streamflow records begin in 1950 with a small number of stations 50 the number of active stations increases rapidly between the mid 1960s to 1980s with a maximum number of stations reached by the 1990s see fig 2 streamflow records are hence typically between 45 and 55 years up to a maximum of 70 years catchment sizes are predominantly distributed between 102 and 103 km2 though extend from as small as 5 km2 to as large as 200 000 km2 catchment sizes and streamflow record lengths are spread across a broad range of latitudes over the continent with the highest concentration around the 40 30 degrees south bands in the temperate climate catchment yields ml km2 calculated by dividing mean annual streamflow by catchment size provide a useful comparative measure of hydro climatology fig 1 shows that there is a clear dependence between catchment yield and climate zone definitions catchments in the central arid region of the continent show low yields 50 ml km2 compared to catchments in the temperate south east which can be around 2 000 ml km2 wasko and guo 2022 the coefficient of variation for total annual streamflow depicts high spatial variability across the continent see fig 1 catchments in the centre of the continent and along the north east coast show high coefficients of variation 1 whilst catchments in the northernmost and southernmost latitudes show lower coefficients of variation 0 5 2 3 temperature and rainfall site temperature and rainfall data was obtained from the australian water availability project awap climate data outputs produced by the australian bureau of meteorology bom 2021a bom 2021c awap is an operational data assimilation and modelling system that monitors the state and trend of the australian terrestrial water balance at a gridded resolution of 0 05 degrees 5 5 km raupach et al 2009 grid outputs of daily maximum temperature and daily total rainfall depth were utilised and catchment averages calculated based on catchment boundaries 2 4 el niño southern oscillation the climates of the eastern and northern parts of australia are strongly impacted by the el niño southern oscillation the southern oscillation index soi is an indicative measure of the development and intensity of el niño or la niña events in the pacific ocean and is calculated using pressure differences between tahiti and darwin sustained negative soi values less than 7 typically indicate el niño events while sustained positive soi values greater than 7 typically indicate la niña events southern oscillation index values as published by the australian bureau of meteorology bom 2021d were used to determine the strongest el niño events 1965 1972 1977 1982 1991 1992 1994 1997 2002 2015 and la niña events 1950 1955 1956 1971 1973 1974 1975 1988 1998 2010 over the hrs data record 3 methodology 3 1 annual event flow distribution to characterise the distribution of high flow events for each of the stations in the hrs dataset as a percentage of total annual streamflow an annual event flow distribution was developed for each station streamflow events were sampled with differing frequency expressed in terms of their average annual frequency the annual event flow distribution was then calculated as the proportion of total streamflow in each year resulting from events of a given frequency the procedure is outlined in detail below step 1 identification of water year all analyses were undertaken on a water year basis where the month with lowest average flow was designated the first month of the water year wasko et al 2020b step 2 identification of events event identification was undertaken using the hydroevents r package developed by wasko and guo 2022 events were identified on the basis of exceeding a given baseflow index kaur et al 2017 using the eventsbaseflow function the baseflow index is defined as the proportion of streamflow that occurs as baseflow the function first computes the baseflow separation at every time step using a one parameter recursive lyne and hollick lh digital filter rdf a digital filter approach was selected as it provides an objective and repeatable estimate of an index of baseflow that is easily automated the lh rdf was used as it is the most extensively used rdf in the literature and is arguably the most parsimonious eckhardt 2008 wasko and guo 2022 the lh digital filter is described by nathan and mcmahon 1990 as 1 f k α f k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 where f k is the baseflow filtered streamflow at the kth sampling point y k is the unfiltered streamflow and α is the filter parameter a filter parameter of 0 925 was used as recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 flood events are then identified when streamflows exceed a baseflow index threshold for this analysis a baseflow index threshold of 0 5 was chosen thus the start of an event was defined as the timestep when filtered streamflow accounted for greater than 50 of total streamflow and the end of an event when filtered streamflow fell back below 50 of total streamflow a sensitivity analysis was performed on the chosen baseflow index for event separation by additionally undertaking the analysis documented herein with baseflow index thresholds of 0 4 and 0 6 the conclusions were found to remain unchanged step 3 sampling of events of a given frequency a sample of flood events was derived for each catchment using a peaks over threshold approach a threshold volume was selected that yielded on average a number of events per year with flow volumes equal to or greater than the nominated threshold a number of thresholds were selected to represent a range of event frequencies ranging from 12 exceedances per year events that occur once a month on average to 0 2 exceedances per year events that occur on average once every five years we adopted a frequency metric based on exceedances per year ey the inverse of the annual average recurrence interval ari as our focus is on small floods that may occur multiple times per year ey is defined herein as the exceedance frequency of events that are equal to or greater than a given threshold the frequencies considered here are 12 10 6 3 2 1 0 5 and 0 2 ey so for example for 12 ey events for a record length of 50 years the largest 12 50 600 events were sampled conversely for a 0 2 ey the largest 10 events were sampled step 4 calculation of proportion of total annual flow resulting from a given exceedance for each water year at each station for a given frequency e g 12 ey the total flow resulting from the sampled events was divided by the total annual streamflow this can be presented as follows 2 f e y x q y i 1 n e i y x j 1 m q j y 100 p y x 3 p x f e y x q y y y where e represents an event flow volume q a daily flow volume y the years on record and x the severity threshold of the flood where x corresponds to one of the defined eys the first term i 1 n e i y x is the sum of all event flows from rank 1 to n in the sample of average annual frequency x in water year y the second term j 1 m q j y is the sum of all daily flows from rank 1 to m where m is 365 366 in that same water year y dividing the first term by the second term gives the percentage of annual flow attributable to events of severity x in year y this was repeated for all y complete water years on record to obtain the set of values p x it is noted that some years may not contain any events particularly for the rarest frequencies as events were sampled on a peak over threshold approach in this case the year was omitted from the calculation for more frequent exceedance thresholds some sites may also not have a sufficient number of events on record and these were also omitted step 5 calculation of annual event flow distribution for each site for a given ey the median percentage for all the years with data is calculated the annual event flow distribution is then the curve resulting from calculating this median percentage for each ey in equations this is the median percent of total annual flow in p x as determined in equations 2 and 3 across all years y for each threshold x an example application is detailed below example results are presented for the hunter river in nsw hrs 210011 in fig 3 here each boxplot represents the distribution of percentages of total annual flow attributable to the sum of event flows for the respective event threshold i e the distribution of p y x values each histogram represents one event frequency ey with the median of all the years shown in bold the boxplot hence represents the interannual variability with boxes extending to the 25th q1 and 75th q3 percentiles and the whiskers extending out 1 5 times the interquartile range from q1 and q3 respectively for events less frequent than the 1 ey median values are approximately 45 with large ranges from less than 25 up to 80 however for events more frequent than the 6 ey median values are greater than 75 with smaller ranges between 70 and 90 from these results we can see that floods that are expected to occur once every year i e 1ey can account for as much as 75 of total annual streamflow though typically in any given year such floods account for approximately 45 of the total annual flow the vast majority 80 of total annual streamflow is accounted for by the 10ey events i e the 10 largest events that occur on average every year 3 2 determination of trend to analyse temporal trends in the proportion of annual flow volumes associated with different event thresholds the non parametric mann kendall test was applied at the 10 significance level the mann kendall test determines whether monotonically increasing or decreasing trends are present in a timeseries by analysing the differences in sign between consecutive events mann 1945 the mann kendall test assumes a null hypothesis of no trend and an alternative hypothesis of upward or downward trend the mann kendall test calculates the following statistic 4 s i 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x i where x denotes the annual flow proportion being investigated and uses the following test statistic to determine whether trends are significant to a predefined level eq 5 5 z s 1 σ i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 σ i f s 0 the magnitude of trend present in the timeseries was evaluated using the sen s slope estimator the sen s slope estimator was chosen as it is a robust non parametric method that is relatively insensitive to outliers by choosing the median of all slopes between pairs of data points sen 1968 the trend is determined by the following procedure 6 β m e d i a n x j x i j i j i where β is the slope estimator a value of β 0 indicates a monotonically increasing trend whilst a value of β 0 indicates a monotonically decreasing trend while temporal trends were investigated using mann kendall tests and sen s slopes relationships between variables were calculated by linear regression 4 results 4 1 median annual event flow distribution curve at hrs feature stations we first examine seven feature stations representing a range of differing catchment characteristics across the hrs network the feature stations are selected by the australian bureau of meteorology refer table 1 and comprise varying locations across australia s hydroclimates a range of catchment sizes and diversified land use the median annual event flow distribution curves for each station and a description of the catchment characteristics are presented in fig 4 and table 1 respectively the median annual event flow distributions for the feature stations suggest that the annual distribution of flows over events are a function of the catchment climate and the catchment size the feature catchment from australia s tropical region g8170002 in the northern territory typically has a higher proportion of annual streamflow concentrated in proportionally fewer events for example in any given year typically over 50 of the total annual streamflow is attributable to 1 ey events this is consistent with the highly seasonal nature of the tropical region s rainfall with most of the regions annual rainfall falling within the wet season october to april and the remaining months characterised by long dry spells characteristically the temperate and subtropical regions exhibit a relatively more moderate annual flow distribution with approximately 40 of flows in a typical year accounted for by events equal to or greater than the 1 ey the exception to this is station a2390519 temperate which exhibits a high proportion of total annual streamflow 65 provided by 1 ey events owing to the large catchment size when comparing within climate regions smaller catchments appear to have lower percentages of total annual streamflow for the smaller catchments 210011 temperate and 305202 temperate there is relatively less of the annual streamflow volume contained in larger less frequent events 4 2 median annual event flow distribution curves across australia the annual event flow distributions across all hrs sites across australia are presented in fig 5 the station medians as calculated in step 5 for each ey are presented as boxplots with the boxplots representing the climatic variability across australia fig 5 presents that across australia in any given year approximately 50 of total annual streamflow volume is attributable to 1 ey events for 6 ey events this increases to approximately 70 of total annual streamflow the number of stations represented by the boxplots is shown by the transparent histogram for events 0 2 ey to 4 ey almost all 467 hrs are included however for events more frequent than the 4 ey the number of included stations declines as the number of stations having the required number of independent events on average per year decreases the number of years on record at the respective stations represented by the median is shown by the colour bar as per section 2 2 hrs have record lengths typically between 45 and 55 years thus for events rarer than the 1ey much of the streamflow record will not have an observed event on average only 8 17 and 28 years of record are represented by each value for the 0 1 ey 0 5ey and 0 2 ey event thresholds respectively however summarising fig 5 does not show if any climatic variability exists or if any variability exists with catchment size hence thresholds of 0 2ey 1ey and 4 ey were chosen as a representative range to assess accounting for multi year recurrence intervals to sub yearly recurrence intervals and best balancing representation of the greatest number of sites and years 4 3 variability with respect to climate the percent of total annual streamflow attributed to 4 ey 1 ey and 0 2 ey events are plotted with modified köppen climate classifications across the australian continent to investigate variability with respect to climate see fig 6 tropical and sub tropical climates which have strongly summer dominant rainfall have a higher concentration of total annual streamflow across all event thresholds this distinction is most noticeable in the 4 ey threshold with median percentages of total annual streamflow between 70 and 90 across the tropical north a similar trend is also clear across the grassland and desert regions of central australia where although the rainfall is less seasonal few rainfall events occur in these areas around 60 90 of total annual streamflow is concentrated in events at all thresholds making these areas highly reliant on few rainfall flooding events for the entire year s streamflow the southern temperate areas along the southeast and southwest coast typically receive around 15 40 of the total annual streamflow from 0 2 ey and 1ey events and 30 60 of the total annual streamflow from 4 ey events this proportion of total annual streamflow is relatively less when compared to the northern half of the country however still represents a substantial dependence on a small number of events to account for the majority of total annual streamflow moreover there are two distinct regions where a more even distribution of total annual streamflow is evident the south eastern corner of new south wales and north eastern corner of victoria in addition to western tasmania all exhibit a relationship of approximately 15 30 of total annual streamflow from events across all thresholds these areas have very low aridity indexes and have some of the highest mean annual rainfall volumes in all australia of particular note in fig 6 is that most surface drinking water supply catchments around the most populous metropolitan areas of sydney south eastern temperate melbourne southern temperate brisbane eastern subtropical and perth south western subtropical temperate have approximately 60 70 of the total annual streamflow concentrated in 4 ey events this demonstrates the reliance of most of australia s fresh water supply on relatively few streamflow events in the year 4 4 variability with respect to catchment size as discussed in section 4 1 catchment size is a secondary factor affecting the proportion of annual flow volumes contributed to by event flows to assess the impact of catchment size on annual event flow distribution hrs catchment size was plotted against the site medians of the proportion of total annual flow from the three chosen event thresholds the 4 ey 1 ey and 0 2 ey see fig 7 it can be observed that the majority of stations are between 100 and 1 000 km2 with a small minority of stations greater than 10 000 km2 15 and less than 100 km2 60 linear regression was performed on each of the respective sets of paired data to visualise the direction and slope of the linear relationship across all event thresholds the proportion of annual flows derived from the selected events was found to have an increasing linear trend with catchment area smaller catchments of sizes around 100 km2 generally have over 20 less of total annual streamflow from the respective event thresholds than very large catchments around 10 000 km2 the trend slope was also found to be of similar magnitude across all event thresholds from multi year to multiple per year event recurrence intervals the relationship between catchment size and total annual streamflow concentration is physically described by the much longer response times of larger catchments caused by the greater effect of soil moisture storage and evapotranspiration summed over a greater catchment extent in simple terms a large event is needed to cause runoff in a large catchment 4 5 impact of interannual variability having developed a representation of the relationship between total annual streamflow and flood events we investigated the effects of interannual variability on the representation and the sensitivity to interannual variability in streamflows 4 5 1 el niño southern oscillation one of the strongest climate drivers in australia particularly for the northern and eastern parts of the continent is the el niño southern oscillation enso the el niño phase is characterised by higher maximum daily temperatures and reduced rainfalls in contrast to the la niña phase which is characterised by lower maximum daily temperatures and increased rainfalls the ten strongest el niño years since 1950 and ten strongest la niña years since 1950 based on soi were extracted from the records for each hrs and the annual event flow distribution derived results were then grouped according to each station s respective modified köppen climate classification this was repeated for each of the three chosen event thresholds see fig 8 given the very limited number of sites and events available for catchments in desert and equatorial climate zones boxplots could not be derived sites were aggregated based on climate classification however it is noted that not all stations are affected equally by enso generally the southern half of the continent experiences higher increases in temperature the eastern part of the continent experiences more dramatic decreases in rainfall and the south west experiences less pronounced changes overall results from the assessment of enso years show relatively small differences in percentages of total annual streamflow with respect to both climate zone and event magnitude for temperate climates results show little deviation in both range and median for la niña and el niño years across all event thresholds in subtropical climates there is a small decrease in the overall median from la niña to el niño years for the 4 ey and 1 ey event thresholds while for the 0 2 ey threshold there is an opposite trend of an increasing median value from la niña to el niño years in tropical climates a small increase in the overall median from la niña to el niño years for the 4 ey and 1 ey event thresholds is evident while for the 0 2 ey threshold there is also an opposing trend of a decreasing median value from la niña to el niño years in grassland climates there are very few stations though the ones analysed again showed only a small difference 5 between la niña and el niño year values the differences in percentages of total annual streamflow between la niña and el niño years are most pronounced for larger event thresholds such as the 0 2 ey larger event thresholds also appear to have opposed trends between la niña and el niño years when compared to smaller event thresholds however in general the difference in annual event flow distribution values between la niña and el niño years remain relatively small it is well documented kiem et al 2003 that la niña years typically have a considerably larger on average 70 average annual flow volume compared to el niño years however while the flow volume is likely to vary with soi annual event flow distribution is dominated by the effects of catchment climate and size and the interannual flux in soi within climate zones does not appear to have as significant an impact on the percentage of total annual flow accounted for by individual events 4 5 2 warm and cold years similar to the enso assessment the variability of annual event flow distributions with respect to annual temperature was investigated the years of record at each site were ranked according to the average annual daily maximum temperature as derived from the awap dataset the record was then spilt in half to represent the warmest years and coldest years on record and the annual event flow distribution derived for each set of years at each site results were then grouped according to each station s modified köppen climate classification this was repeated for each of the three chosen event thresholds see fig 9 given the very limited number of sites and events available for catchments in desert and equatorial climate zones boxplots could not be derived across all climate zones and event thresholds results generally show a very minor increase in total annual event flow distribution values for warm years over cold years with a largely consistent range however typically warmer years have a considerably smaller average annual flow volume milly et al 2018 hence it appears that while the flow volume is likely to vary with temperature the annual event flow distribution is again dominated by the effects of climate zone and catchment size the interannual temperature differences within climate zones does not appear to have as significant an impact on the percentage of total annual flow accounted for by individual events 4 5 3 wet and dry years thirdly an assessment of annual streamflow distribution variability with respect to rainfall or wetness was investigated the total annual rainfall was calculated at each hrs site using the awap data and the years of record at each site ranked according to annual rainfall depth the record was then spilt in half to represent the wettest years and driest years on record the annual event flow distribution values were calculated and grouped by each station s modified köppen climate classification results are presented in fig 10 this was repeated for each of the three chosen event thresholds given the very limited number of sites available for catchments in desert and equatorial climate zones boxplots could not be derived across all climate zones and event thresholds results generally show a very minor change in total annual event flow distribution values for wet years over dry years with a consistent range it is generally the case that annual event flow distribution is not significantly altered by interannual increases in annual rainfall magnitude within climate zones and catchments therefore the annual event flow distribution is again observed to be dominated by climate zone and catchment area 4 6 trends in percent of total annual flow accounted for by top flow percentiles finally due to possible non stationarity because of climate warming the presence and magnitude of trends in median annual event flow values was calculated for each hrs for each of the three event thresholds statistically significant trends were identified with the mann kendall test applied at the 10 significance level the magnitude of trends present in the timeseries were evaluated with the sen s slope estimator results of the trend analysis are displayed in fig 11 for the largest event threshold chosen 0 2 ey in the sub tropical and temperate areas of the south east of the continent stations have predominantly positive trends in the median percent of total annual streamflow values for smaller event thresholds 1ey and 4ey the trend majority appears to reverse into predominantly negative trends these trends describe a change in annual event flow distributions where the percent of total annual streamflow from the larger events with multi year return period is increasing while the percent of total annual streamflow from smaller more frequent events is decreasing elsewhere clear regional trends are less identifiable in the centre desert northern equatorial and tropical areas of the continent trends are more mixed due to the sparsity of stations in these locations less statistically significant trends were also found in the temperate south west trends are also more mixed though of the statistically significant trends a primarily decreasing trend was identified for the 1 ey and a primarily increasing trend identified for the 4 ey given the mix of trends we present median sen s slope trend estimates of the percentage of total annual streamflow for all event thresholds across all sites in each climate zone in a matrix heatmap fig 12 very few sites exist in the desert and equatorial zones 7 and 2 sites respectively and none with statistically significant trends but overall we can see a drying trend whereby when events do occur they are contributing less to the total annual streamflow for more frequent events grassland and subtropical zones present a small increase in the percentage of total annual streamflow but for the largest events again a decrease suggesting reduced runoff from the largest streamflow events most sites are located in temperate regions where while more frequent events have a decreasing contribution to the total annual streamflow larger events have an increasing contribution to total annual streamflow this provides evidence for the historical trends identified in wasko and nathan 2019 that flood magnitudes are increasing for the rarest events while decreasing for more frequent events across large parts of australia in the tropics for all event frequencies increases in the fraction of total annual streamflow were found consistent with the increasing trend in streamflow event magnitudes in this region but again it is noted the largest events are increasing the most and hence having the largest proportional increase of the percentage of total annual streamflow wasko et al 2019 it is well worth noting that the trends observed are small however when compounded over a 10 20 or 50 year period these trends result in non negligible changes to the share of total annual streamflow from each event for example the temperate 0 2 ey events with a trend slope of 0 69 over 50 years would result in a 40 increase in the share of total annual streamflow derived from 0 2 ey events 5 discussion with the large uncertainty in projecting water supply into the future there is a need to characterise flow regimes if total annual streamflow could be categorised as the change in a small number of well described peak events an avenue for estimating the impacts on the entire annual flow regime could be developed in general it was identified that streamflow volumes across australia as recorded by the hrs network can be characterised by a small number of high flow events it was observed that in any given year approximately 50 of total annual streamflow volume is attributable to events equal to or greater than the 1 ey it was determined that this distribution of total annual streamflow was primarily a function of climate zone classification and secondly catchment size interannual variability in soi temperature and rainfall volume as expected greatly impacts streamflow volumes though within climate zones it did not appear to greatly impact the total annual streamflow distribution hence it can be concluded that the typical shape of the annual cumulative flow diagram is largely characteristic of the site and is not significantly altered by interannual changes in flow volume rather it is just scaled in magnitude statistically significant spatially consistent trends in the timeseries of annual event flow distribution values were found that varied with event magnitude these trends signalled a move to a relatively less even distribution in the southeast of the continent where larger magnitude event flows were found to be increasing as a percentage of total annual streamflow whilst smaller more frequent events are decreasing the spatially dependent trends observed in annual event flow distribution are consistent with historical changes in precipitation increases observed in global precipitation have occurred over tropical areas with decreases elsewhere and soil moisture also showing wetting trends in the tropics and drying outside of the tropics wasko et al 2021 rainfall has also become increasingly sporadic across australia dey et al 2020 with short duration rainfall events 1 2 days increasing in intensity and becoming more frequent compared to a significant reduction in longer duration rainfall events 3 6 days in the southern areas of australia with an opposite trend observed in the northern tropics these trends in rainfall and soil moisture are consistent with an observed general decrease in annual streamflow volumes across australia sharma and wasko 2019 zhang et al 2016 due to less runoff in general it has been observed that in the tropics where soil moisture is increasing the proportion of total annual streamflow is increasing for all events ho et al 2022 though in temperate regions where soil moisture is decreasing only the largest events are corresponding to an increase in the proportion of total annual streamflow as smaller daily flows are being reduced to soil moisture storage wasko and nathan 2019 thus the observed trend of a less even distribution in the extratropics found in this study is consistent with the growing body of work investigating the changes in hydrologic characteristics with climate 6 conclusion in this study a representation of the annual event flow distribution was developed and implemented across australia utilising the hrs network standardising the representation of how total annual streamflow is distributed over a typical year to understand whether annual streamflow volumes can be characterised by flood events it was found that a small number of events are largely responsible for total annual streamflow a trend of increasingly skewed total annual event flow distributions was identified around australia s most important surface drinking water supply catchments near the most populous metropolitan areas of south east australia potentially posing a threat to future water security this study suggests that total annual streamflow is likely to become more dependent on a relatively small number of events making water supply systems more sensitive to failure there is a need to develop reliable water supply projection methodologies for a non stationary environment to safeguard against future water insecurity the work here suggests a large portion of the streamflow in water supply reservoirs can be approximated from a small number of streamflow events whose behaviour into the future can be relatively well constrained given the discussed influence of antecedent soil moisture conditions on more frequent flow magnitudes and the more palatable predictions of larger rainfalls and floods further work is envisioned in developing novel streamflow prediction methodologies that split streamflow records into a set of characteristic peak flow events and a characteristic baseflow according to a defined flow threshold once partitioned separate predictions can be made for peak flows and low flows respectively that may then be scaled based on non stationary climate variables and subsequently recombined to assess potential water security scenarios under a warming climate credit authorship contribution statement caleb dykman

2412,hydrological and meteorological droughts are complex hazards that cover a wide spatiotemporal spectrum and can affect the economic environmental and social sectors however it is challenging to characterize hydrometeorological drought and its propagation from precipitation deficits to soil moisture discharge and groundwater deficits and to ascertain to what extent catchment characteristics may affect drought features this research explores the link between hydrometeorological drought characteristics and catchment characteristics it investigates their propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought conditions in nine selected catchments from the awash basin in ethiopia using standardized indices of precipitation spi soil moisture deficits spei streamflow sri and base flow sbi the study results indicate that the propagation of meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts increases with increasing aggregation time scale and has a proportionally higher probability of propagation for moderate severe and extreme droughts across all catchments the average lag time between hydrological and meteorological drought magnitude occurrence is 4 6 months with lag times likely to increase by 7 8 months at a higher aggregation time scale meteorological drought has a 0 5 higher probability of occurrence than hydrological drought in a given period in contrast it has a lower 0 3 probability of the surface deficit becoming a groundwater deficit at a 3 month cumulative time scale the probability of propagating meteorological drought using the spi to hydrological drought using the sri is higher than that of propagating hydrological drought using the sbi therefore the results suggest that while the propagation of meteorological droughts spi and spei to hydrological droughts sri and sbi slightly increases with aggregation time the time taken for precipitation to become apparent in hydrological variables increases the results confirmed that the probability of meteorological drought leading to hydrological drought progression is critical and needs to be considered in water resource management and planning keywords drought propagation hydrometeorology extreme data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is one of the natural hazards that will most likely occur as a result of a lack of available water and natural variability which has an impact on economic social and ecosystem activities as well as the development of water resources ipcc 2014 hydrometeorological drought is a natural hazard that is highly complex uncertain and difficult to investigate this is a multihazard in nature and manifests itself in the water s relative deviation from long term standard mean conditions resulting in water scarcity in the surface and hydrological systems via the water cycle van loon and laaha 2015 hydrometeorological deficiencies are a complex hazard and cover a wide area with a slow onset that affects different social economic and environmental sectors at different impact scales quevauviller gemmer 2015 ayantobo et al 2017 gaitán et al 2020 although drought is predominantly caused by a lack of soil moisture streamflow and precipitation other factors such as prolonged abstraction and temperature are primarily involved in drought incidence and propagation similarly catchment and climate characteristics have a role in hydrometeorological drought through streamflow precipitation overland flow soil moisture groundwater discharge and evapotranspiration which are controlled by hydrological cycle components lin et al 2014 apurv et al 2017 this implies that an in depth investigation is required to evaluate the impact and associated linkages among various types of hydrometeorological drought to manage and adapt to drought induced effects mishra cherkauer 2010 ma et al 2020 however it is challenging to investigate the hydrometeorological drought characteristics and their propagation from climate to surface water and groundwater drought and measure to what extent the catchment and climate will affect the drought characteristics magnitude frequency and duration at a catchment scale drought propagation from meteorology to agriculture to hydrology has a major impact on water resource management which is heavily influenced by climate and catchment features van loon and van lanen 2012 barker et al 2016 as a result hydrological and agricultural drought features may reveal massive distinctions in different parts of the world van loon et al 2014 understanding hydrometeorological drought propagation e g time lag and probability of propagation from one to another and its influencing factors climate and physiography in a given catchment is required to reduce the effects of hydrometeorological droughts and better manage water resources many studies have examined the impact of hydrometeorological droughts and possible factors stagge et al 2015 meresa et al 2016 oguntunde et al 2017 hanel et al 2018 in addition to the spatial differences the main conclusion of these studies is that there will be an increase in hydrological and meteorological droughts in the future under climate change and variability meteorological drought conditions have been identified and addressed across the globe in recent decades such as in europe where there was a devastating drought condition in 2015 and 2018 ionita et al 2017 stagge et al 2015 in east africa during 1984 and 2015 there was water scarcity and a heatwave oguntunde et al 2017 funk et al 2019 in australia kirono et al 2020 and in the usa particularly in california drought is a pervasive phenomenon and affects both ecological biodiversity and agriculture vicente serrano and quiring 2019 he et al 2019 this implies that drought leads to unsecured food availability and water security including water supply irrigation and hydropower across the globe and regions therefore understanding drought characteristics is essential for effectively managing drought hazards and it is a major concern in water resources and needs more focus wilhite et al 2014 agricultural producers water supply operators and policy and decision makers can take measures to adapt and mitigate its dire impacts most previous studies have concentrated on individual indices of drought evaluation in contrast some studies have attempted to assess the link between hydrological and meteorological droughts and understand the complex mechanism of hydrometeorological drought propagation mishra cherkauer 2010 wang et al 2016 meresa et al 2016 bevacque et al 2021 investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts they concluded that the frequency of meteorological drought was less than that of hydrological drought in the lowland catchments in contrast in the highland catchments the frequency and magnitude of meteorological drought were greater than those of hydrological drought and propagation time was different considering various drought approaches and drought types van loon et al 2014 developed a large modeling experiment containing different hydroclimatic conditions to understand the climate s role in hydrological drought propagation they concluded that the effects of climate seasonality and the hydrological model were significant in drought propagation the changes and propagation rates of each hydrological drought characteristic severity and duration in low seasonality and high seasonality climates are different barker et al 2016 used the cross correlation between the 1 month standardized streamflow index ssi and various spi accumulation time scales to examine the relationship and its propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought and to investigate the impact of climate and catchment characteristics on hydrometeorological drought conditions in the uk their results showed that at short aggregation time scales meteorological drought conditions have smaller spatial variability than long accumulation period drought while hydrological drought events become fewer with longer durations of large severe hydrological drought magnitudes shin et al 2018 used bayesian conditional probability theory to understand the link and propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought using spi and phdi indices in south korea they concluded that the higher the aggregation time scale results the higher the probability of meteorological drought propagation to hydrological drought and the frequency of meteorological drought in south korea was higher than that of hydrological drought while the severity of the meteorological drought was less than that of hydrological drought to reduce the impact of hydrometeorological drought and to provide better drought induced impact mechanisms more knowledge regarding hydrometeorological drought changes interlinks and propagations of meteorological to hydrological drought characteristics is required in addition to existing information this study explores hydrometeorological drought characteristics and the links among different drought types and it detects drought propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought conditions this is crucial to understanding and identifying the impact of inter and intraseasonality of hydroclimatic characteristics on drought magnitude and frequency for the selected awash river catchments to this end we used a filtering approach to separate river streamflow into direct runoff and baseflow eckhardt 2008 which combined the fundamental principles of the filtering approach with the linear reservoir model which reflects the linear connection between groundwater storage and discharge in a basin furthermore the baseflow was used to understand groundwater dryness we used four indices spi spei sri and sbi at different aggregation timescales 1 3 6 and 12 months the knowledge of hydrometeorological drought propagation will allow for assessing their potential risks and the findings may be useful for regional and local drought disaster risk planning and water management strategies in crises and allow for building resilience and preparedness 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper awash basin climate is mainly controlled by the seasonal migration of the itcz intertropical convergence zone and associated local atmospheric circulation systems that are related to the complex topography feature of the country taye et al 2018 the nine most representative catchments were selected to understand the hydrometeorological drought propagation in the awash river basin these catchments are located in different geographical areas having different hydroclimatic conditions a wide range of drainage area variation streamflow coefficients climate elasticities and baseflow index bfi values the study catchments table 1 and fig 1 were selected based on having a good representation of hydroclimatic variabilities geological conditions and little human intervention seminatural river catchments with drainage areas ranging from 67 5 km2 at welen to 7656 0 km2 at koka the annual mean hydroclimatic and catchment descriptors are presented in table 1 and fig 1 the lowlands are in the eastern and central parts with elevations of less than 2000 m above sea level the daily mean precipitation varies from 1 8 mm at berga to 3 16 mm upstream of kaka and the daily mean streamflow ranges from 1 33 m3 s at akaki to 25 11 m3 s at the bello catchment the basin consists of heterogeneous topographic features with the precipitation and temperature variables having large spatial and temporal variations the southern part of the basin is mostly occupied by lowlands while the northern parts are mostly mountainous in summary the diverse topographic and meteorological features significantly contribute to spatial and temporal changes in precipitation and temperature and water resources in the area 2 2 hydrometeorological data in this study daily meteorological data precipitation and air temperature and hydrometric data streamflow were collected from 1981 to 2017 for nine gauged stations managed by the ethiopian meteorological office and water resource ministry respectively meteorological data were extracted from the 25 synoptic stations located within and near the awash basin and converted to a catchment scale using the theissen polygon approach the respective organization provided daily streamflow data from nine seminatural hydrological gauged stations with minimal human intervention from 1981 to 2017 the two most important screening procedures are used in streamflow gauge selection 1 only unregulated tributaries or gauges located upstream of dams and reservoirs are chosen to reduce the effect of human intervention or anthropogenic activity and 2 availability and adequacy data all gauges are expected to have a continuous record for 11 years of daily meteorological and streamflow data from 1981 to 2017 furthermore the daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated using elevation and temperature following the hamon technique 1963 this method is favored over less parsimonious catchments and in data scarce catchments 2 3 physiographic datasets a digital elevation model dem is a depiction of the bare ground topographic surface of the earth without buildings trees or any other surface bodies the dem was collected from the national center for environmental information noaa and the link is www ngdc noaa gov

are obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https modis gsfc nasa gov about design php at the same time the detailed features of the soil types of the study area are acquired from the harmonized world soil database v1 2 www fao org soils portal data hub soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 en 3 statistical and numerical methods the general framework of this research work is illustrated in fig 2 which is a conceptual flowchart of the propagation of drought from climate to baseflow dryness the baseflow time series was extracted from the observed streamflow using the automatic baseflow digital filter bflow technique to understand the complete picture of drought propagation we used four different hydrometeorological indices standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei standardized streamflow index sri and standardized baseflow index sbi the drought propagation lag time and its respective probability of drought were evaluated using different drought indices their results were compared based on their spatial and temporal drought characteristics in the given period 1981 2017 3 1 baseflow separation the evaluation of water resource availability kept in different layers of soil aquifers and surface storages and transferred along different routes in a catchment is crucial for its protection optimal water use and accurate river flood and low flow baseflow prediction baseflow is the sum of delayed shallow and deep subsurface flow and it is essential to separate them for a better understanding of water availability and planning gonzales et al 2009 mohammed scholz 2016 he et al 2019 michael et al 2019 miller et al 2022 he et al 2019 aboelnour et al 2020 it maintains river flow between heavy rains and is the groundwater recession component of streamflow understanding how baseflow is affected by climate and physiographic features is also critical for water resource management and in stream ecohydrological health the baseflow is separated using the automatic baseflow digital filter bflow technique which is the most commonly used technique in separating streamflow data into surface streamflow and baseflow by passing the filtering equation three times through the observed streamflow daily time series bosch et al 2017 shafii et al 2016 lee et al 2018 jung et al 2016 1 bf t α bf t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where bf is the baseflow at time t α is the filter parameter 0 85 and qt is the total streamflow at time t this equation is applied under only one condition bf qt eckhardt 2008 baseflow is a conservative filtering technique that allows the user to compute the baseflow by separating the daily total streamflow data herein baseflow filtered observed streamflow data were used to obtain stable filter parameters eckhardt 2008 3 2 drought indices many drought studies have examined the status of dryness using a range of hydrometeorological drought index types and or new indices wanders et al 2017 we select the most relevant subset of four hydrometeorological indices to evaluate different drought types and their propagation from meteorological to hydrological status the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standardized streamflow index sri shukla wood 2008 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2020 the standardized baseflow index sbi and the standardized streamflow index sri table 2 we characterized the drought indices at four different temporal aggregations e g 1 month 3 month 6 month and 12 month by using running sums of precipitation and moisture deficit for spi and spei and averages of baseflow and streamflow sri and sbi the classes of standardized sri spei spi sbi drought indices are shown in table 2 each drought index class represents the entire spectrum of drought and dryness conditions normal 0 5 0 5 mild 1 0 5 moderate 1 5 1 severe 2 1 5 and extreme xx 2 the indices were developed based on long term hydroclimatic variability and represent the most dominant range for specific dryness conditions mckee et al 1993 shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2010 the propagation of hydrometeorological drought from climate to baseflow dryness was evaluated on different time scales 1 3 6 and 12 months using spi spei sri and sbi and a threshold of 0 5 was chosen to indicate hydrometeorological conditions as it is a commonly used index xu 2014 stagge et al 2015 spinoni et al 2017 parsons et al 2019 the 1 3 6 and 12 month time scales were selected to identify the relationship among the hydrometeorological droughts and further investigate the drought propagation as they have the highest priority for different water related sectors reservoir management ecological and environmental health management poverty reduction and zero hunger etc 3 3 conditional probability for drought propagation estimation drought propagation is a way of translating water deficits from one drought condition to another most commonly from meteorological drought to hydrological drought eltahir and yeh 1999 propagation time which is the time required for the aggregation of deficiencies in meteorological drought conditions and is reflected in hydrological drought conditions provides vital information to risk reduction and water resource managers barker et al 2016 apurv et al 2017 in this study we used the conditional probability of meteorological drought occurrence for hydrological drought status at a given lag time the conditional probabilistic approach is expressed by two dependent drought conditions for instance as presented in fig 3 the probability of drought classes in the spi spei sri and sbi are dependent on each other this can show the propagation of drought from the spi to the spei to the sri to the sbi therefore this kind of conditional probability can be formulated using the conditional probability theorem ribeiro et al 2019 and expressed by eqn 10 let two drought indices spi and sri have their respective lag time tg we used the posterior and prior probability combination of spi with spei sri and sbi and links developed between two drought indices to indicate the direct influence of one to another this indicates that each hydrological drought class depends on each class of climatological drought class and magnitude this is expressed as 2 p sri i c m spi j tg m p sri i m spi j m p spi j where p sri spi is the propagation probability of spi to sri p spi sri is the sum of individual and combined probabilities at the specific lag time and tgm is the optimal lag time which reflects the highest correlation between respective drought conditions the likelihood of each drought status given by each class of another drought condition was estimated using the conditional probability model lag time and the probability of drought propagation from one state to another state were estimated for each station using the spi spei sri and sbi at different timescales for the given period fig 3 depicts hydrometeorological drought propagation lag times in one case and four consecutive drought events for illustration purposes for the 2002 2005 drought event and maximum drought event class iii a hydrological drought occurred 2 0 months after a meteorological drought began which is a meteorological drought based on the spi and was detected 2 0 months earlier than the sri as there were different delayed responses in each drought event the average drought propagation lag time was calculated at the selected stations as shown in fig 3 the hydrometeorological drought propagation lag time was 2 to 5 months on average from the meteorological drought propagation lag time using sri and sbi 3 4 climate and physiographic variables and drought characteristics we examined the potential influence of physiographic and climate variables table 3 a s1 and s2 on meteorological and hydrological drought duration and magnitude using nonlinear and correlation statistical analysis first we used a correlation analysis between the climate physiographic and drought characteristics to explore the relationship among the selected variables and understand the most important variables for the spi and sri these characteristics might be recognized as crucial in determining how meteorological and hydrological droughts in the basin would develop then using the akaike information criterion aic the best model from the backward stepwise selection technique is chosen then we used multinonlinear regression analysis backward stepwise selection and nonlinear interlinking to analyze a set of factors and forecast meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics severity and duration 4 results 4 1 the spatial temporal link of hydrometeorological drought variations it is also critical to assess the hydrometeorological drought link with different hydroclimatic variables to understand the response of heterogeneous features in catchments the spatial among the selected catchments and temporal yearly variation in hydrometeorological drought characteristics is assessed using precipitation moisture deficit streamflow and baseflow values at different time scales fig 4 according to sbi at 3 and 6 month time scales the distribution of the hydrological drought increased in magnitude as the respective cumulative mean flow and baseflow increased while the slope of these changes in each catchment was not the same across each time scale the precipitation moisture deficit streamflow and baseflow variables do not have one to one relationships with the spi spei sri and sbi values respectively which is a more cloudy relationship not a linear link in between in the 1 3 and 6 month time scales fig 4 upper second and third rows respectively the cloudy relationship between these variables and drought indices at 3 and 6 months is due to seasonal precipitation variability the 12 month aggregated time scale on the other hand shows a clearer one to one linear relationship with the respective variables as well as a more straight line relationship between the variable and the respective drought indices fig 4 lower row the seasonal variability is not significant and the annual 12 month aggregation of the main variables is smoother this indicates that the spatial variability in hydrometeorological drought is more visible at the 12 month time scale than at the 3 and 6 month time scales these catchment behaviors differ across accumulation periods and are not proportionally transmitted from meteorological to hydrological droughts this confirmed that the catchment difference increases over time from small to large furthermore the higher the aggregation time scale is the greater the transition from dry to wet negative to positive for example when we compare the drought situation at 3 6 and 12 month aggregation times the situation at 12 month aggregation times has a smaller slope and moves faster from the dry region to the wet region than at 3 to 6 month time scales this implies that the higher the aggregation time scale is the smaller the variability and the less uncertain the situation which results in less complex patterns of drought conditions fig 4 therefore different aggregation time scales in drought assessment may lead to different drought risk management strategies in the selected catchments significant changes in moisture deficit and precipitation are converted into high variations in spei and spi values respectively however the sri and sbi show slight variation concerning streamflow and baseflow variables respectively particularly at the 1 month accumulation period there is a linear transformation and changes in the spei and spi reflect the direction of changes in moisture deficit and precipitation interestingly sri and sbi have similar sensitivity to streamflow and baseflow for catchments c2 and c7 c3 and c6 are highly sensitive to changes in precipitation moisture deficit and spi and spei respectively on the other hand the relationship between drought indices and deriving variables reveals a cloudy and diverging catchment into mountainous and lowland areas the division is most likely based on the slope of each line for each catchment with a larger slope related to higher sensitivity and vice versa fig 4 from 1981 to 2017 there was an increase in the intensity of hydrometeorological droughts hydrometeorological droughts on a 3 month time scale were more severe than those on the 6 and 12 month scales fig 5 however hydrometeorological droughts in autumn and winter son and d j f were more severe than those in spring and summer m a m and j j a in general there is a clear overlap in meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts on a short time scale and winter d j f was severe in 1981 1984 1992 and 2015 the intensity of hydrological droughts increased from 1987 to 1998 and then decreased from 1999 to 2014 fig 5 and figure s1 in addition the intensity of hydrological droughts in the northern part c8 c9 at high elevations was smaller than that in the southern part c3 and c5 of the river basin fig 5 4 2 hydrometeorological drought characteristics fig 6 shows the number of drought events drought duration and severity for both hydrological and meteorological droughts and the nine selected catchments at 3 6 and 12 month timescales using one drought threshold we first evaluate the 3 month time scale fig 6 first column the duration of meteorological droughts is shorter than that of hydrological droughts fig 6 the number of meteorological droughts is higher than the number of hydrological droughts due to the dynamic characteristics of streamflow a physical process the drought severity across all the time scales shows no significant variations between hydrological and meteorological droughts despite the fact that meteorological and hydrological droughts exhibit similar characteristics at both short and long accumulation time scales the short time scale has lower internal variability than the long time scale due to annual variation similarly at short and long timescales the spi and spei have lower internal variability than the sri and sbi this implies that meteorological drought is less variable and uncertain than hydrological drought the spatial differences indicate that they agree on the greater magnitude of the drought occurring over the selected catchments when using spi and spei quantities rather than sri and sbi however although slight differences among the catchments have appeared in meteorological spi and spei and hydrological sri and sbi droughts these differences are not significant and considerable for example the c1 and c2 catchments show higher drought durations using the spi and spei at 3 6 and 12 month scales with 7 months and 8 months of drought duration respectively however the c5 and c6 catchments show a lower value in drought duration using the spi and spei at the 3 6 and 12 time scales with 4 months and 5 months of drought duration respectively however the number of drought events and severity showed a lower median using the meteorological indices and a higher median using the hydrological indices fig 6 the variations in the drought indices spi spei sri and sbi tended to be gentle with the increase in aggregation timescales the variability and instability also decreased with the increased length of the aggregation scale this means that the changes and variations in the spi spei sri and sbi were similar at different aggregation timescales however there were still slight differences in the drought indices which showed different drought intensities and frequencies the similarity increased with increasing timescale in all catchments fig 6 overall the duration and severity magnitudes are not robust and sustained in each catchment which implies a clear difference in magnitude and drought frequency the spi and spei are good at detecting meteorological drought while the sri and sbi are good at detecting hydrological drought fig 7 shows a comparison of drought classes using the spi spei sri and sbi indices at 3 6 and 12 month accumulation periods this would help to obtain more information about the various types of meteorological and hydrological droughts at a given time scale using multiple indices this is important for understanding the integrated drought frequency of each class at different accumulative time scales again it was confirmed that the shorter the aggregation time of the drought analysis the higher the variability and frequency of the various index values for the selected study catchments this was confirmed by using the spi spei sri and sbi to calculate the occurrence percentage of each type of drought class out of 100 propagation from meteorological to agricultural to hydrological drought however the extents of the spei and spi at the 12 month time scale are less extreme and more moderate than those at the 3 month time scale whereas the sri and sbi indicate higher drought values at the 3 month time scale than at the 12 month time scale fig 7 there is also a substantial difference between the spei and other drought index classes however among the spi sri and sbi each class s area is propagated proportionally from one drought class to another which maintains the behavior throughout the period when comparing different indices fig 7 shows that for spi3 spei3 sri3 and sbi3 which are commonly associated with meteorological agricultural hydrological and groundwater droughts the percentages of occurrence of these indices range up to 25 3 months 28 6 months and 33 12 months respectively the percentage of changes from extreme meteorological drought to hydrological drought is insignificant in most catchments for instance at c3 the extreme drought changes from 29 spei to 31 sbi similarly at c9 the percentage of extreme drought differs from 27 spi to 34 sri overall the meteorological indices show less than a 10 difference in detecting the extreme hydrometeorological drought class which is a slight difference in the occurrence of hydrometeorological classes therefore the patterns of the spei and spi are similar and show the same trend in each drought class simultaneously the area percentile under each drought class is higher using the spi than the spei this is due to increased evapotranspiration and is considered significant water loss the sri and sbi showed more mild and severe drought at the 12 month accumulation period by 2 and 3 respectively therefore both the sri and sbi show a clear shift move from normal drought classes to mild and moderate drought classes in the spi and spei this transition represents the transition from meteorological to hydrological drought 4 3 relative importance of climate and catchment storage on hydrometeorological droughts hydrometeorological drought characteristics were presented against standard average annual precipitation saap standard average annual flow saar and standard average annual moisture deficit saam and the respective correlation coefficients were determined spearman s correlation was used due to the nonlinear links between the climate and hydrometeorological drought characteristics spearman s correlations were also used to measure the degree of relationship between the catchment properties and hydrological drought characteristics table 3b shows the spearman correlations between hydrometeorological drought characteristics based on sri and sbi and including a propagation indicator spi spei n and saap standardized average annual precipitation standard average annual flow saar and standard average annual moisture deficit saam for all catchments grouped the correlations for all catchments showed more substantial and highly significant correlations at α 0 001 between saap and the hydrometeorological drought characteristics similar to the correlation with saar the correlation with saam is stronger and more significant at 0 01 than the correlation with saar which was nonsignificant and weak this hypothesis proposes that general moisture deficit and precipitation climate are more prominent in determining hydrological drought characteristics and propagation in all catchments where precipitation and moisture deficit are uniform but physiological and geology is more heterogeneous similarly a combination of 11 physiographic and climate features is selected table 3c it was noted that the combination of climate variables with catchment descriptors significantly improved the prediction of meteorological and hydrological drought indices r2 0 65 across the catchments among all the variables saap soil type area and elevation seem to be the most significant physiographic and climate variables that influence the drought characteristics for sri in the upper awash basin this model was able to predict a 17 variation in hydrometeorological drought magnitude for sri 12 overall the linear models developed through the integration of catchment and climate variables were found to be capable of predicting the magnitude of hydrological drought for short and medium term drought long term hydrometeorological drought duration on the other hand showed a weaker correlation with the factors studied fig 8 shows the relationship between saap saam and saaf saar and hydrometeorological drought characteristics for all selected catchments with dots colored by baseflow index bfi to indicate the linkage between catchment storage and hydrological drought characteristics using spi spei sri and sbi the plots show that the bfi decreases as saam and saap increase inversely proportional high storage reflects a higher bfi and catchments located in the awash basin s lowlands receive less precipitation fig 8 shows positive relationships between saaf and maximum or median severity but as saaf reaches approximately 10 m3 s there is little change in the hydrometeorological drought characteristics for further increases in saaf there was a negative correlation between saap and saam and maximum median duration and spei n spi n but again there was little change in the hydrometeorology drought and propagation characteristics for saaf values over 10 m3 s table 3 shows the strong and significant 0 001 links between saap saam and saaf and the hydrometeorological drought characteristics for all catchments 4 4 lag time between meteorological and hydrological drought indices for extreme hydrological risk management and planning the relationship between hydrological and meteorological droughts should be defined the lag times in the formation of droughts at various timescales were investigated fig 9 for hydrological operations the 12 month aggregation timescale is ideal for capturing the lag time between hydrological and meteorological droughts for agricultural activity 3 and 6 month aggregation times are preferable to estimate the lag time between hydrological and meteorological drought indices which is due to the hydrological cycle loop of 12 months and crop rotation and sawing periods respectively therefore the lag times versus their respective correlation coefficients at different time scales and using the spi spei sri and sbi are shown in fig 9 almost all the catchments have similar drought occurrence lag times ranging from 4 to 6 months the lag time for drought occurrence increases as the timescale increases for example on average the lag time on the smaller timescale is 3 months whereas on the larger timescale it is almost 5 months fig 9 this is mainly related to the seasonal precipitation distribution and storage memory of the catchments in particular catchments c1 and c6 have unstable correlation values with different lag times this may be due to the drainage area and shape of the catchments affecting the lag time which is relatively larger than the others similarly as explained earlier the sri and sbi have a reasonable correlation over a wide range of lag times while the spi and spei have a good correlation but only over a 4 month lag time this implies that the connection between the surface and groundwater is crucial and plays a major role in controlling the streamflow drought and groundwater drought in most catchments fig 9 overall the hydrological drought occurrence time is almost 4 6 months later than when the meteorological drought started as a result hydrological drought is expected to occur after 4 6 and 7 8 months of meteorological drought necessitating a rethinking of hydrological operations and agricultural activity respectively additionally this lag time is important to provide early warning information and to regulate the nearby water storage across the catchment sample the average lag time between meteorological and hydrological drought occurrences is 4 6 months with lag times likely to increase with the time scale therefore the results suggest that while the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological events sri and sbi increases the time taken for precipitation anomalies to become apparent in hydrological variables also increases therefore the average lag of drought propagation for all indices ranges between 4 and 6 months the lag time between meteorological and hydrological droughts is significant for water resource planning and extreme management due to the drainage area and storage memory 4 5 probability of drought propagation at the different time scales hydrometeorological drought propagation is a nonlinear process that emphasizes the propagation from climate to soil moisture status and or surface streamflow deficit or baseflow dryness in this study the climate and soil moisture deficit drought indicators were grouped under the meteorological drought type and surface streamflow deficit and baseflow dryness were grouped under the hydrological drought type as a result as explained in the lag time correlation the probability of meteorological drought to hydrological drought condition propagation was estimated and identified at a given lag time using conditional likelihood fig 9 hydrological drought reflects both meteorological drought and external factors which occur later than meteorological drought van lanen et al 2013 this was already confirmed earlier and showed a 4 6 month time gap between these drought conditions to understand the drought class probability of meteorological drought in the respective classes of hydrological drought we evaluated the drought classes of the spi to the spei sri and sbi table 4 the conditional probability of propagation from meteorological drought using the spi to hydrological drought using the sri is higher than that of hydrological drought using the sbi at the 12 month cumulative time scale however at 3 and 6 months these conditions and their respective probabilities were slightly dropped such a drop in the probability of propagation is mainly expressed by the seasonal variability of precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow which is similar to the results by chagas and chaffe 2018 in particular the meteorological drought using the spi has a 0 5 higher probability of occurrence as a hydrological drought over a 12 month accumulation period whereas it has a 0 4 lower probability over a 3 month accumulation period almost all the catchments show a similar probability of drought propagation except for c7 and c8 c7 and c8 show slightly higher probabilities of propagation from hydrological to baseflow dryness due to the high connectivity of surface and groundwater levels which has a short catchment memory interestingly we noticed that the drought propagation probability is higher in the long aggregation time scale 12 months than in the short time scale 3 months this could be because seasonal harmonics on the long term scale have been smoothed overall the most severe and extreme drought classes show a less propagable character and remain meteorological droughts however the normal mild and moderate drought classes were unstable and or propagated to hydrological drought with different probabilities of occurrence remarkably the moderate drought class has a significant probability of propagation to hydrological drought and its probability of occurrence increases from 0 26 to 0 53 therefore the results confirm that meteorological drought is propagable and show its contribution to hydrological drought however all drought types have different propagation probabilities this implies that drought mitigation and adaptation strategies will differ with varying drought indices and hydrometeorological classes therefore this information is crucial to providing a robust mitigation mechanism against moderate drought conditions in the river basin 5 discussion understanding changes in drought characteristics and their propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is critical for effective water resource and drought management strategies we estimated drought magnitude severity duration and frequency at different timescales using different drought indices to investigate the role of climate and physiographic characteristics on hydrometeorological drought characteristics and propagation these characteristics vary spatially and temporally in magnitude and frequency at different time scales meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought characteristics and their respective propagation behaviors at the different time scales of nine near natural ethiopian catchments were examined using the spi spei sri and sbi over a range of aggregation periods most of the hydrometeorological drought events duration frequency and severity characteristics showed little spatial variability however hydrological drought characteristics showed higher spatial temporal differences in drought magnitude frequency and number of events than meteorological drought the characterization of hydrometeorological drought has received more attention in the last two to three decades with more emphasis on exploring the trend and changes in magnitude for example barker et al 2016 examined the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought and stated that physiographic characteristics significantly influence baseflow ma et al 2020 also evaluated the propagation of drought characteristics and concluded that there are positive relationships between hydrological and meteorological droughts with less frequent drought events but longer propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought conditions according to trenberth et al 2014 the components of the hydrological cycle are not the same at all temporal and spatial scales and increased air temperature plays a significant role in water loss this would dry out the available water resources leading to dryness and droughts most of the previous studies were focused on hydrometeorological drought projection using spi and sri under climate change and estimated more severe drought mainly arising from a misunderstanding of the link among the drought types gevaert et al 2018 pena gellardo et al 2021 that do not capture the atmospheric water land interactions however our novel approach evaluates hydrometeorological drought propagation and its relationship among the indices the changes in hydrometeorological drought and their propagation from precipitation deficits to soil moisture discharge and groundwater deficiencies and to ascertain to what extent climate and physiographic factors may affect drought characteristics e g magnitude frequency and duration and propagation the drought pattern using the spi and spei across the selected catchments is uniform in contrast the sri and sbi confirm that catchment heterogeneity made a significant difference in reproducing historical hydrological drought characteristics this suggests that hydrological drought is a more dynamic and nonlinear process that requires special consideration in hydrological process modeling however the spatial temporal pattern in drought characteristics is not found in correspondents at different time scales we observed slightly higher hydrological drought events using the sbi and lower meteorological drought events using the spei index compared with the other indices this could lead to higher or lower drought frequency magnitude and events the spi and spei indices show reasonably higher correlation and drought less deviation from the long term cumulative precipitation and moisture deficit the variation in the spatial drought characteristics is very significant using sri and sbi but highly variable with timescale which is consistent with the findings of desalegn et al 2006 the smaller the time scale is the higher the difference and correlation with their respective variables spi and precipitation spei and moisture deficiency sri and streamflow and sbi and baseflow at a 12 month time scale the main variables and their respective drought indices have a clear linear relationship due to the effects of standardization and the hydrological cycle the spatial variation was visible using sbi indices which show two groups of catchments less responsive to changes in baseflow and highly responsive to changes in baseflow even though the level of propagation is low drought characteristics propagate from the spi to the spei sri and sbi the magnitude of each drought class proportionally increased from the spi to the spei to the sri and to the sbi due to the water abstractions and evapotranspiration effects on average almost all the catchments have a 4 6 month lag time from meteorological to hydrological drought as a result water resource management and planning documents should take into account meteorological drought and its progression to hydrological drought which adds 4 6 months to the duration of hydrological drought events this would have significant input for hydrological operations and ecological management purposes the drought propagation probability of different classes from meteorological drought to hydrological drought varied spatially and the class type of drought occurrence and the probability of propagation of different classes increased substantially from meteorological classes to hydrological classes in most catchments normal mild and moderate droughts propagated from meteorological to hydrological droughts this implies that hydrological drought is more frequent than meteorological drought and has a larger magnitude than meteorological drought therefore more precautions are required for hydrological drought events and a robust adaptation strategy however hydrometeorological drought is a complex hazard influenced by land use land cover change and human activities dam operations and urbanization the linear regression modeling framework incorporates a set of catchment descriptors and climate variables to predict the magnitude of hydrological drought for the catchments located in the upper awash river basin the results indicate that physiographic features have a higher influence on triggering hydrometeorological drought over the river basin compared to other factors e g climate in addition the combination of both catchment descriptors and climate variables can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of medium and short term droughts in the awash river basin moreover this study can also be expanded to an ungauged catchment where the availability of meteorological and hydrological data is inadequate however the aggregation time scale is one of the most important factors in determining hydrometeorological drought characteristics for example on a seasonal scale drought duration and magnitude might be more related to climate than to physiographic variables whereas at an annual scale catchment descriptors may have a more significant influence on the characteristics of hydrological drought furthermore the proposed modeling approach is useful for distinguishing the key role of physiographic characteristics and climate variables in the upper awash river basin s hydrometeorological drought previous studies by wang et al 2016 and veettil and mishra 2020 also found that the role of catchment characteristics is more significant than climate variables in reproducing historical drought magnitude and duration these findings can be helpful for hydrological operations water supply irrigation and hydropower climate change policymakers integrated water resource managers and other water related stakeholders to create a better environment for the coming generation better prepare for climate change crisis adaptation and develop coping mechanisms in the context of drought probability occurrence and vulnerability studies these comprehensive drought results can be used to estimate the seasonal drought risk for water supply and the annual drought risk for ecosystem management in most catchments the complex and vital drought time series component is 3 months the hydrological and meteorological drought indices at the 3 month accumulation period confirmed that the probability of mild and moderate drought propagation is expected to increase by 0 24 at the 12 month accumulation period this may require more attention and adaptation plans and disaster management for sustainable water resource use in agriculture water supply and ecosystems haslinger et al 2013 huang et al 2018 liang et al 2021 this study has likely limitations that readers should be aware of and some caveats regarding this research work hydrological parameters and hydrological structure may play a significant role in hydrological drought meresa and romanowicz 2017 in this study we used an observed hydrological and meteorological dataset this study used only one conceptual hydrological model which may limit our understanding of the role of hydrological model structure in hydrological drought conditions therefore in future hydrometeorological drought related studies it is recommended to consider a physical based hydrological model and hydrological parameter uncertainty analysis can shed more light on it it is even more interesting if such work can also integrate various socioenvironmental factors and climate change uncertainty meresa et al 2022 to identify the future drought risk level at each site and provide more concrete information to stakeholders further investigations are required to incorporate meteorological drought to fully understand how hydrological drought responds to natural and anthropogenic changes 6 conclusions drought has become more of a concern and a major issue in water resource management and planning in terms of the drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought hydrological droughts were typically found following moderate to severe sequences of below normal precipitation which eventually led to extreme meteorological drought episodes streamflow was generally responsive to precipitation events however streamflow dryness required days to weeks to develop due to a continuous lack of precipitation large precipitation events accompanied the end of the streamflow drought in this strategy however the end of the streamflow drought does not indicate that water is now available at normal levels instead water recovery has only begun drought propagation is strongly related to catchment features and climate type with slower propagation from the surface to the subsurface in dry seasons and quicker drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological in the short aggregation time scale summer drought frequency propagation tends to be faster than in the winter especially in high slope catchments this may be a consequence of the distinct dry and wet seasons in the former and the land use and land cover in the latter the probability of drought propagation from meteorological to streamflow drought is faster than that of baseflow dryness this might be linked to a significant proportion of streamflow thereby causing a higher portion of total streamflow meteorological drought severity and duration characteristics using the spi and spei showed slight spatial and temporal variability while hydrological drought characteristics using the sri and sbi showed substantial differences in high frequency short duration and more severe events in most of the catchments catchments underlain by large unsaturated aquifers tended to show a larger delay in drought propagation duration from meteorological to hydrological drought with increasing accumulative periods from smaller to larger the longer spi and spei accumulation periods are not strongly correlated with the shorter sbi and sri indices the standard period average annual precipitation magnitude was found to be important in controlling the hydrological drought severity duration and propagation in most of the catchments with lower aquifer storage while in the catchments located in the upper part of the basin the hydrometeorological drought severity duration and propagation were more influenced by catchment aquifer storage and other catchment properties this study s understanding of drought magnitude risk and its propagation can be applied and used as a foundation for future ecological and water resource developments in the basin laying the groundwork for improved hydrometeorological drought preparedness recovery and increased resilience to drought risk in a linear model climate and physiographic characteristics explained more than 67 of the hydrometeorological drought characteristics this can be improved by considering more catchment descriptors and climate variables however climate variables alone may not be robust and more reliable for hydrometeorological drought prediction this implies that both catchment descriptors and climate variables have a substantial influence on medium and short duration hydrometeorological droughts including land use types and precipitation overall the saap soil type drainage area and elevation variables exhibited a higher influence on the long medium and short term hydrometeorological drought in particular the catchment variables such as forest grassland pastureland shrub bush catchment area and elevation showed considerable influence on the average drought magnitude which was derived based on sri 3 the linear model was able to predict 67 variability in the hydrological drought characteristics for sri 3 whereas sri6 and sr12 improved the model performance to 72 and 78 respectively developing robust efficient and suitably functioning hydrometeorological drought early warning systems and recovery strategies specific to severe drought prone catchments and a short and medium term adaptation plan the integration of extreme drought risk management concepts into medium term development measures water harvesting technologies and connecting investors around the awash basin in different mitigation adaptation and intervention

2412,hydrological and meteorological droughts are complex hazards that cover a wide spatiotemporal spectrum and can affect the economic environmental and social sectors however it is challenging to characterize hydrometeorological drought and its propagation from precipitation deficits to soil moisture discharge and groundwater deficits and to ascertain to what extent catchment characteristics may affect drought features this research explores the link between hydrometeorological drought characteristics and catchment characteristics it investigates their propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought conditions in nine selected catchments from the awash basin in ethiopia using standardized indices of precipitation spi soil moisture deficits spei streamflow sri and base flow sbi the study results indicate that the propagation of meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts increases with increasing aggregation time scale and has a proportionally higher probability of propagation for moderate severe and extreme droughts across all catchments the average lag time between hydrological and meteorological drought magnitude occurrence is 4 6 months with lag times likely to increase by 7 8 months at a higher aggregation time scale meteorological drought has a 0 5 higher probability of occurrence than hydrological drought in a given period in contrast it has a lower 0 3 probability of the surface deficit becoming a groundwater deficit at a 3 month cumulative time scale the probability of propagating meteorological drought using the spi to hydrological drought using the sri is higher than that of propagating hydrological drought using the sbi therefore the results suggest that while the propagation of meteorological droughts spi and spei to hydrological droughts sri and sbi slightly increases with aggregation time the time taken for precipitation to become apparent in hydrological variables increases the results confirmed that the probability of meteorological drought leading to hydrological drought progression is critical and needs to be considered in water resource management and planning keywords drought propagation hydrometeorology extreme data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is one of the natural hazards that will most likely occur as a result of a lack of available water and natural variability which has an impact on economic social and ecosystem activities as well as the development of water resources ipcc 2014 hydrometeorological drought is a natural hazard that is highly complex uncertain and difficult to investigate this is a multihazard in nature and manifests itself in the water s relative deviation from long term standard mean conditions resulting in water scarcity in the surface and hydrological systems via the water cycle van loon and laaha 2015 hydrometeorological deficiencies are a complex hazard and cover a wide area with a slow onset that affects different social economic and environmental sectors at different impact scales quevauviller gemmer 2015 ayantobo et al 2017 gaitán et al 2020 although drought is predominantly caused by a lack of soil moisture streamflow and precipitation other factors such as prolonged abstraction and temperature are primarily involved in drought incidence and propagation similarly catchment and climate characteristics have a role in hydrometeorological drought through streamflow precipitation overland flow soil moisture groundwater discharge and evapotranspiration which are controlled by hydrological cycle components lin et al 2014 apurv et al 2017 this implies that an in depth investigation is required to evaluate the impact and associated linkages among various types of hydrometeorological drought to manage and adapt to drought induced effects mishra cherkauer 2010 ma et al 2020 however it is challenging to investigate the hydrometeorological drought characteristics and their propagation from climate to surface water and groundwater drought and measure to what extent the catchment and climate will affect the drought characteristics magnitude frequency and duration at a catchment scale drought propagation from meteorology to agriculture to hydrology has a major impact on water resource management which is heavily influenced by climate and catchment features van loon and van lanen 2012 barker et al 2016 as a result hydrological and agricultural drought features may reveal massive distinctions in different parts of the world van loon et al 2014 understanding hydrometeorological drought propagation e g time lag and probability of propagation from one to another and its influencing factors climate and physiography in a given catchment is required to reduce the effects of hydrometeorological droughts and better manage water resources many studies have examined the impact of hydrometeorological droughts and possible factors stagge et al 2015 meresa et al 2016 oguntunde et al 2017 hanel et al 2018 in addition to the spatial differences the main conclusion of these studies is that there will be an increase in hydrological and meteorological droughts in the future under climate change and variability meteorological drought conditions have been identified and addressed across the globe in recent decades such as in europe where there was a devastating drought condition in 2015 and 2018 ionita et al 2017 stagge et al 2015 in east africa during 1984 and 2015 there was water scarcity and a heatwave oguntunde et al 2017 funk et al 2019 in australia kirono et al 2020 and in the usa particularly in california drought is a pervasive phenomenon and affects both ecological biodiversity and agriculture vicente serrano and quiring 2019 he et al 2019 this implies that drought leads to unsecured food availability and water security including water supply irrigation and hydropower across the globe and regions therefore understanding drought characteristics is essential for effectively managing drought hazards and it is a major concern in water resources and needs more focus wilhite et al 2014 agricultural producers water supply operators and policy and decision makers can take measures to adapt and mitigate its dire impacts most previous studies have concentrated on individual indices of drought evaluation in contrast some studies have attempted to assess the link between hydrological and meteorological droughts and understand the complex mechanism of hydrometeorological drought propagation mishra cherkauer 2010 wang et al 2016 meresa et al 2016 bevacque et al 2021 investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts they concluded that the frequency of meteorological drought was less than that of hydrological drought in the lowland catchments in contrast in the highland catchments the frequency and magnitude of meteorological drought were greater than those of hydrological drought and propagation time was different considering various drought approaches and drought types van loon et al 2014 developed a large modeling experiment containing different hydroclimatic conditions to understand the climate s role in hydrological drought propagation they concluded that the effects of climate seasonality and the hydrological model were significant in drought propagation the changes and propagation rates of each hydrological drought characteristic severity and duration in low seasonality and high seasonality climates are different barker et al 2016 used the cross correlation between the 1 month standardized streamflow index ssi and various spi accumulation time scales to examine the relationship and its propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought and to investigate the impact of climate and catchment characteristics on hydrometeorological drought conditions in the uk their results showed that at short aggregation time scales meteorological drought conditions have smaller spatial variability than long accumulation period drought while hydrological drought events become fewer with longer durations of large severe hydrological drought magnitudes shin et al 2018 used bayesian conditional probability theory to understand the link and propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought using spi and phdi indices in south korea they concluded that the higher the aggregation time scale results the higher the probability of meteorological drought propagation to hydrological drought and the frequency of meteorological drought in south korea was higher than that of hydrological drought while the severity of the meteorological drought was less than that of hydrological drought to reduce the impact of hydrometeorological drought and to provide better drought induced impact mechanisms more knowledge regarding hydrometeorological drought changes interlinks and propagations of meteorological to hydrological drought characteristics is required in addition to existing information this study explores hydrometeorological drought characteristics and the links among different drought types and it detects drought propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought conditions this is crucial to understanding and identifying the impact of inter and intraseasonality of hydroclimatic characteristics on drought magnitude and frequency for the selected awash river catchments to this end we used a filtering approach to separate river streamflow into direct runoff and baseflow eckhardt 2008 which combined the fundamental principles of the filtering approach with the linear reservoir model which reflects the linear connection between groundwater storage and discharge in a basin furthermore the baseflow was used to understand groundwater dryness we used four indices spi spei sri and sbi at different aggregation timescales 1 3 6 and 12 months the knowledge of hydrometeorological drought propagation will allow for assessing their potential risks and the findings may be useful for regional and local drought disaster risk planning and water management strategies in crises and allow for building resilience and preparedness 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper awash basin climate is mainly controlled by the seasonal migration of the itcz intertropical convergence zone and associated local atmospheric circulation systems that are related to the complex topography feature of the country taye et al 2018 the nine most representative catchments were selected to understand the hydrometeorological drought propagation in the awash river basin these catchments are located in different geographical areas having different hydroclimatic conditions a wide range of drainage area variation streamflow coefficients climate elasticities and baseflow index bfi values the study catchments table 1 and fig 1 were selected based on having a good representation of hydroclimatic variabilities geological conditions and little human intervention seminatural river catchments with drainage areas ranging from 67 5 km2 at welen to 7656 0 km2 at koka the annual mean hydroclimatic and catchment descriptors are presented in table 1 and fig 1 the lowlands are in the eastern and central parts with elevations of less than 2000 m above sea level the daily mean precipitation varies from 1 8 mm at berga to 3 16 mm upstream of kaka and the daily mean streamflow ranges from 1 33 m3 s at akaki to 25 11 m3 s at the bello catchment the basin consists of heterogeneous topographic features with the precipitation and temperature variables having large spatial and temporal variations the southern part of the basin is mostly occupied by lowlands while the northern parts are mostly mountainous in summary the diverse topographic and meteorological features significantly contribute to spatial and temporal changes in precipitation and temperature and water resources in the area 2 2 hydrometeorological data in this study daily meteorological data precipitation and air temperature and hydrometric data streamflow were collected from 1981 to 2017 for nine gauged stations managed by the ethiopian meteorological office and water resource ministry respectively meteorological data were extracted from the 25 synoptic stations located within and near the awash basin and converted to a catchment scale using the theissen polygon approach the respective organization provided daily streamflow data from nine seminatural hydrological gauged stations with minimal human intervention from 1981 to 2017 the two most important screening procedures are used in streamflow gauge selection 1 only unregulated tributaries or gauges located upstream of dams and reservoirs are chosen to reduce the effect of human intervention or anthropogenic activity and 2 availability and adequacy data all gauges are expected to have a continuous record for 11 years of daily meteorological and streamflow data from 1981 to 2017 furthermore the daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated using elevation and temperature following the hamon technique 1963 this method is favored over less parsimonious catchments and in data scarce catchments 2 3 physiographic datasets a digital elevation model dem is a depiction of the bare ground

framework of this research work is illustrated in fig 2 which is a conceptual flowchart of the propagation of drought from climate to baseflow dryness the baseflow time series was extracted from the observed streamflow using the automatic baseflow digital filter bflow technique to understand the complete picture of drought propagation we used four different hydrometeorological indices standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei standardized streamflow index sri and standardized baseflow index sbi the drought propagation lag time and its respective probability of drought were evaluated using different drought indices their results were compared based on their spatial and temporal drought characteristics in the given period 1981

crucial for its protection optimal water use and accurate river flood and low flow baseflow prediction baseflow is the sum of delayed shallow and deep subsurface flow and it is essential to separate them for a better understanding of water availability and planning gonzales et al 2009 mohammed scholz 2016 he et al 2019 michael et al 2019 miller et al 2022 he et al 2019 aboelnour et al 2020 it maintains river flow between heavy rains and is the groundwater recession component of streamflow understanding how baseflow is affected by climate and physiographic features is also critical for water resource management and in stream ecohydrological health the baseflow is separated using the automatic baseflow digital filter bflow technique which is the most commonly used technique in separating streamflow data into surface streamflow and baseflow by passing the filtering equation three times through the observed streamflow daily time series bosch et al 2017 shafii et al 2016 lee

only one condition bf qt eckhardt 2008 baseflow is a conservative filtering technique that allows the user to compute the baseflow by separating the daily total streamflow data herein baseflow filtered observed streamflow data were used to obtain stable filter parameters eckhardt 2008 3 2 drought indices many drought studies have examined the status of dryness using a range of hydrometeorological drought index types and or new indices wanders et al 2017 we select the most relevant subset of four hydrometeorological indices to evaluate different drought types and their propagation from meteorological to hydrological status the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standardized streamflow index sri shukla wood 2008 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2020 the standardized baseflow index sbi and the standardized streamflow index sri table 2 we characterized the drought indices at four different temporal aggregations e g 1 month 3 month 6 month and 12 month by using running sums of precipitation and moisture deficit for spi and spei and averages of baseflow and streamflow sri and sbi the classes of standardized sri spei spi sbi drought indices are shown in table 2 each drought index class represents the entire spectrum of drought and dryness conditions normal 0 5 0 5 mild 1 0 5 moderate 1 5 1 severe 2 1 5 and extreme xx 2 the indices were developed based on long term hydroclimatic variability and represent the most dominant range for specific dryness conditions mckee et al 1993 shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2010 the propagation of hydrometeorological drought from climate to baseflow dryness was evaluated on different time scales 1 3 6 and 12 months using spi spei sri and sbi and a threshold of 0 5 was chosen to indicate hydrometeorological conditions as it is a commonly used index xu 2014 stagge et al 2015 spinoni et al 2017 parsons et al 2019 the 1 3 6 and 12 month time scales were selected to identify the relationship among the hydrometeorological droughts and further investigate the drought propagation as they have the highest priority for different water related sectors reservoir management ecological and environmental health management poverty reduction and zero hunger etc 3 3 conditional probability for drought propagation estimation drought propagation is a way of translating water deficits from one drought condition to another most commonly from meteorological drought to hydrological drought eltahir and yeh 1999 propagation time which is the time required for the aggregation of deficiencies in meteorological drought conditions and is reflected in hydrological drought conditions provides vital information to risk reduction and water resource managers barker et al 2016 apurv et al 2017 in this study we used the conditional probability of meteorological drought occurrence for hydrological drought status at a given lag time the conditional probabilistic approach is expressed by two dependent drought conditions for instance as presented in fig 3 the probability of drought classes in the spi spei sri and sbi are dependent on each other this can show the propagation of drought from the spi to the spei to the sri to the sbi therefore this kind of conditional probability can be formulated using the conditional probability theorem ribeiro et al 2019 and expressed by eqn 10 let two drought indices spi and sri have their respective lag time tg we used the posterior and prior probability combination of spi with spei sri and sbi and links developed between two drought indices to indicate the direct influence of one to another this indicates that each hydrological drought class depends on each class of climatological drought class and magnitude this is expressed as 2 p sri i c m spi j tg m p sri i m spi j m p spi j where p sri spi is the propagation probability of spi to sri p spi sri is the sum of individual and combined probabilities at the specific lag time and tgm is the optimal lag time which reflects the highest correlation between respective drought conditions the likelihood of each drought status given by each class of another drought condition was estimated using the conditional probability model lag time and the probability of drought propagation from one state to another state were estimated for each station using the spi spei sri and sbi at different timescales for the given period fig 3 depicts hydrometeorological drought propagation lag times in one case and four consecutive drought events for illustration purposes for the 2002 2005 drought event and maximum drought event class iii a hydrological drought occurred 2 0 months after a meteorological drought began which is a meteorological drought based on the spi and was detected 2 0 months earlier than the sri as there were different delayed responses in each drought event the average drought propagation lag time was calculated at the selected stations as shown in fig 3 the hydrometeorological drought propagation lag time was 2 to 5 months on average from the meteorological drought propagation lag time using sri and sbi 3 4 climate and physiographic variables and drought characteristics we examined the potential influence of physiographic and climate variables table 3 a s1 and s2 on meteorological and hydrological drought duration and magnitude using nonlinear and correlation statistical analysis first we used a correlation analysis between the climate physiographic and drought characteristics to explore the relationship among the selected variables and understand the most important variables for the spi and sri these characteristics might be recognized as crucial in determining how meteorological and hydrological droughts in the basin would develop then using the akaike information criterion aic the best model from the backward stepwise selection technique is chosen then we used multinonlinear regression analysis backward stepwise selection and nonlinear interlinking to analyze a set of factors and forecast meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics severity and duration 4 results 4 1 the spatial temporal link of hydrometeorological drought variations it is also critical to assess the hydrometeorological drought link with different hydroclimatic variables to understand the response of heterogeneous features in catchments the spatial among the selected catchments and temporal yearly variation in hydrometeorological drought characteristics is assessed using precipitation moisture deficit streamflow and baseflow values at different time scales fig 4 according to sbi at 3 and 6 month time scales the distribution of the hydrological drought increased in magnitude as the respective cumulative mean flow and baseflow increased while the slope of these changes in each catchment was not the same across each time scale the precipitation moisture deficit streamflow and baseflow variables do not have one to one relationships with the spi spei sri and sbi values respectively which is a more cloudy relationship not a linear link in between in the 1 3 and 6 month time scales fig 4 upper second and third rows respectively the cloudy relationship between these variables and drought indices at 3 and 6 months is due to seasonal precipitation variability the 12 month aggregated time scale on the other hand shows a clearer one to one linear relationship with the respective variables as well as a more straight line relationship between the variable and the respective drought indices fig 4 lower row the seasonal variability is not significant and the annual 12 month aggregation of the main variables is smoother this indicates that the spatial variability in hydrometeorological drought is more visible at the 12 month time scale than at the 3 and 6 month time scales these catchment behaviors differ across accumulation periods and are not proportionally transmitted from meteorological to hydrological droughts this confirmed that the catchment difference increases over time from small to large furthermore the higher the aggregation time scale is the greater the transition from dry to wet negative to positive for example when we compare the drought situation at 3 6 and 12 month aggregation times the situation at 12 month aggregation times has a smaller slope and moves faster from the dry region to the wet region than at 3 to 6 month time scales this implies that the higher the aggregation time scale is the smaller the variability and the less uncertain the situation which results in less complex patterns of drought conditions fig 4 therefore different aggregation time scales in drought assessment may lead to different drought risk management strategies in the selected catchments significant changes in moisture deficit and precipitation are converted into high variations in spei and spi values respectively however the sri and sbi show slight variation concerning streamflow and baseflow variables respectively particularly at the 1 month accumulation period there is a linear transformation and changes in the spei and spi reflect the direction of changes in moisture deficit and precipitation interestingly sri and sbi have similar sensitivity to streamflow and baseflow for catchments c2 and c7 c3 and c6 are highly sensitive to changes in precipitation moisture deficit and spi and spei respectively on the other hand the relationship between drought indices and deriving variables reveals a cloudy and diverging catchment into mountainous and lowland areas the division is most likely based on the slope of each line for each catchment with a larger slope related to higher sensitivity and vice versa fig 4 from 1981 to 2017 there was an increase in the intensity of hydrometeorological droughts hydrometeorological droughts on a 3 month time scale were more severe than those on the 6 and 12 month scales fig 5 however hydrometeorological droughts in autumn and winter son and d j f were more severe than those in spring and summer m a m and j j a in general there is a clear overlap in meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts on a short time scale and winter d j f was severe in 1981 1984 1992 and 2015 the intensity of hydrological droughts increased from 1987 to 1998 and then decreased from 1999 to 2014 fig 5 and figure s1 in addition the intensity of hydrological droughts in the northern part c8 c9 at high elevations was smaller than that in the southern part c3 and c5 of the river basin fig 5 4 2 hydrometeorological drought characteristics fig 6 shows the number of drought events drought duration and severity for both hydrological and meteorological droughts and the nine selected catchments at 3 6 and 12 month timescales using one drought threshold we first evaluate the 3 month time scale fig 6 first column the duration of meteorological droughts is shorter than that of hydrological droughts fig 6 the number of meteorological droughts is higher than the number of hydrological droughts due to the dynamic characteristics of streamflow a physical process the drought severity across all the time scales shows no significant variations between hydrological and meteorological droughts despite the fact that meteorological and hydrological droughts exhibit similar characteristics at both short and long accumulation time scales the short time scale has lower internal variability than the long time scale due to annual variation similarly at short and long timescales the spi and spei have lower internal variability than the sri and sbi this implies that meteorological drought is less variable and uncertain than hydrological drought the spatial differences indicate that they agree on the greater magnitude of the drought occurring over the selected catchments when using spi and spei quantities rather than sri and sbi however although slight differences among the catchments have appeared in meteorological spi and spei and hydrological sri and sbi droughts these differences are not significant and considerable for example the c1 and c2 catchments show higher drought durations using the spi and spei at 3 6 and 12 month scales with 7 months and 8 months of drought duration respectively however the c5 and c6 catchments show a lower value in drought duration using the spi and spei at the 3 6 and 12 time scales with 4 months and 5 months of drought duration respectively however the number of drought events and severity showed a lower median using the meteorological indices and a higher median using the hydrological indices fig 6 the variations in the drought indices spi spei sri and sbi tended to be gentle with the increase in aggregation timescales the variability and instability also decreased with the increased length of the aggregation scale this means that the changes and variations in the spi spei sri and sbi were similar at different aggregation timescales however there were still slight differences in the drought indices which showed different drought intensities and frequencies the similarity increased with increasing timescale in all catchments fig 6 overall the duration and severity magnitudes are not robust and sustained in each catchment which implies a clear difference in magnitude and drought frequency the spi and spei are good at detecting meteorological drought while the sri and sbi are good at detecting hydrological drought fig 7 shows a comparison of drought classes using the spi spei sri and sbi indices at 3 6 and 12 month accumulation periods this would help to obtain more information about the various types of meteorological and hydrological droughts at a given time scale using multiple indices this is important for understanding the integrated drought frequency of each class at different accumulative time scales again it was confirmed that the shorter the aggregation time of the drought analysis the higher the variability and frequency of the various index values for the selected study catchments this was confirmed by using the spi spei sri and sbi to calculate the occurrence percentage of each type of drought class out of 100 propagation from meteorological to agricultural to hydrological drought however the extents of the spei and spi at the 12 month time scale are less extreme and more moderate than those at the 3 month time scale whereas the sri and sbi indicate higher drought values at the 3 month time scale than at the 12 month time scale fig 7 there is also a substantial difference between the spei and other drought index classes however among the spi sri and sbi each class s area is propagated proportionally from one drought class to another which maintains the behavior throughout the period when comparing different indices fig 7 shows that for spi3 spei3 sri3 and sbi3 which are commonly associated with meteorological agricultural hydrological and groundwater droughts the percentages of occurrence of these indices range up to 25 3 months 28 6 months and 33 12 months respectively the percentage of changes from extreme meteorological drought to hydrological drought is insignificant in most catchments for instance at c3 the extreme drought changes from 29 spei to 31 sbi similarly at c9 the percentage of extreme drought differs from 27 spi to 34 sri overall the meteorological indices show less than a 10 difference in detecting the extreme hydrometeorological drought class which is a slight difference in the occurrence of hydrometeorological classes therefore the patterns of the spei and spi are similar and show the same trend in each drought class simultaneously the area percentile under each drought class is higher using the spi than the spei this is due to increased evapotranspiration and is considered significant water loss the sri and sbi showed more mild and severe drought at the 12 month accumulation period by 2 and 3 respectively therefore both the sri and sbi show a clear shift move from normal drought classes to mild and moderate drought classes in the spi and spei this transition represents the transition from meteorological to hydrological drought 4 3 relative importance of climate and catchment storage on hydrometeorological droughts hydrometeorological drought characteristics were presented against standard average annual precipitation saap standard average annual flow saar and standard average annual moisture deficit saam and the respective correlation coefficients were determined spearman s correlation was used due to the nonlinear links between the climate and hydrometeorological drought characteristics spearman s correlations were also used to measure the degree of relationship between the catchment properties and hydrological drought characteristics table 3b shows the spearman correlations between hydrometeorological drought characteristics based on sri and sbi and including a propagation indicator spi spei n and saap standardized average annual precipitation standard average annual flow saar and standard average annual moisture deficit saam for all catchments grouped the correlations for all catchments showed more substantial and highly significant correlations at α 0 001 between saap and the hydrometeorological drought characteristics similar to the correlation with saar the correlation with saam is stronger and more significant at 0 01 than the correlation with saar which was nonsignificant and weak this hypothesis proposes that general moisture deficit and precipitation climate are more prominent in determining hydrological drought characteristics and propagation in all catchments where precipitation and moisture deficit are uniform but physiological and geology is more heterogeneous similarly a combination of 11 physiographic and climate features is selected table 3c it was noted that the combination of climate variables with catchment descriptors significantly improved the prediction of meteorological and hydrological drought indices r2 0 65 across the catchments among all the variables saap soil type area and elevation seem to be the most significant physiographic and climate variables that influence the drought characteristics for sri in the upper awash basin this model was able to predict a 17 variation in hydrometeorological drought magnitude for sri 12 overall the linear models developed through the integration of catchment and climate variables were found to be capable of predicting the magnitude of hydrological drought for short and medium term drought long term hydrometeorological drought duration on the other hand showed a weaker correlation with the factors studied fig 8 shows the relationship between saap saam and saaf saar and hydrometeorological drought characteristics for all selected catchments with dots colored by baseflow index bfi to indicate the linkage between catchment storage and hydrological drought characteristics using spi spei sri and sbi the plots show that the bfi decreases as saam and saap increase inversely proportional high storage reflects a higher bfi and catchments located in the awash basin s lowlands receive less precipitation fig 8 shows positive relationships between saaf and maximum or median severity but as saaf reaches approximately 10 m3 s there is little change in the hydrometeorological drought characteristics for further increases in saaf there was a negative correlation between saap and saam and maximum median duration and spei n spi n but again there was little change in the hydrometeorology drought and propagation characteristics for saaf values over 10 m3 s table 3 shows the strong and significant 0 001 links between saap saam and saaf and the hydrometeorological drought characteristics for all catchments 4 4 lag time between meteorological and hydrological drought indices for extreme hydrological risk management and planning the relationship between hydrological and meteorological droughts should be defined the lag times in the formation of droughts at various timescales were investigated fig 9 for hydrological operations the 12 month aggregation timescale is ideal for capturing the lag time between hydrological and meteorological droughts for agricultural activity 3 and 6 month aggregation times are preferable to estimate the lag time between hydrological and meteorological drought indices which is due to the hydrological cycle loop of 12 months and crop rotation and sawing periods respectively therefore the lag times versus their respective correlation coefficients at different time scales and using the spi spei sri and sbi are shown in fig 9 almost all the catchments have similar drought occurrence lag times ranging from 4 to 6 months the lag time for drought occurrence increases as the timescale increases for example on average the lag time on the smaller timescale is 3 months whereas on the larger timescale it is almost 5 months fig 9 this is mainly related to the seasonal precipitation distribution and storage memory of the catchments in particular catchments c1 and c6 have unstable correlation values with different lag times this may be due to the drainage area and shape of the catchments affecting the lag time which is relatively larger than the others similarly as explained earlier the sri and sbi have a reasonable correlation over a wide range of lag times while the spi and spei have a good correlation but only over a 4 month lag time this implies that the connection between the surface and groundwater is crucial and plays a major role in controlling the streamflow drought and groundwater drought in most catchments fig 9 overall the hydrological drought occurrence time is almost 4 6 months later than when the meteorological drought started as a result hydrological drought is expected to occur after 4 6 and 7 8 months of meteorological drought necessitating a rethinking of hydrological operations and agricultural activity respectively additionally this lag time is important to provide early warning information and to regulate the nearby water storage across the catchment sample the average lag time between meteorological and hydrological drought occurrences is 4 6 months with lag times likely to increase with the time scale therefore the results suggest that while the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological events sri and sbi increases the time taken for precipitation anomalies to become apparent in hydrological variables also increases therefore the average lag of drought propagation for all indices ranges between 4 and 6 months the lag time between meteorological and hydrological droughts is significant for water resource planning and extreme management due to the drainage area and storage memory 4 5 probability of drought propagation at the different time scales hydrometeorological drought propagation is a nonlinear process that emphasizes the propagation from climate to soil moisture status and or surface streamflow deficit or baseflow dryness in this study the climate and soil moisture deficit drought indicators were grouped under the meteorological drought type and surface streamflow deficit and baseflow dryness were grouped under the hydrological drought type as a result as explained in the lag time correlation the probability of meteorological drought to hydrological drought condition propagation was estimated and identified at a given lag time using conditional likelihood fig 9 hydrological drought reflects both meteorological drought and external factors which occur later than meteorological drought van lanen et al 2013 this was already confirmed earlier and showed a 4 6 month time gap between these drought conditions to understand the drought class probability of meteorological drought in the respective classes of hydrological drought we evaluated the drought classes of the spi to the spei sri and sbi table 4 the conditional probability of propagation from meteorological drought using the spi to hydrological drought using the sri is higher than that of hydrological drought using the sbi at the 12 month cumulative time scale however at 3 and 6 months these conditions and their respective probabilities were slightly dropped such a drop in the probability of propagation is mainly expressed by the seasonal variability of precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow which is similar to the results by chagas and chaffe 2018 in particular the meteorological drought using the spi has a 0 5 higher probability of occurrence as a hydrological drought over a 12 month accumulation period whereas it has a 0 4 lower probability over a 3 month accumulation period almost all the catchments show a similar probability of drought propagation except for c7 and c8 c7 and c8 show slightly higher probabilities of propagation from hydrological to baseflow dryness due to the high connectivity of surface and groundwater levels which has a short catchment memory interestingly we noticed that the drought propagation probability is higher in the long aggregation time scale 12 months than in the short time scale 3 months this could be because seasonal harmonics on the long term scale have been smoothed overall the most severe and extreme drought classes show a less propagable character and remain meteorological droughts however the normal mild and moderate drought classes were unstable and or propagated to hydrological drought with different probabilities of occurrence remarkably the moderate drought class has a significant probability of propagation to hydrological drought and its probability of occurrence increases from 0 26 to 0 53 therefore the results confirm that meteorological drought is propagable and show its contribution to hydrological drought however all drought types have different propagation probabilities this implies that drought mitigation and adaptation strategies will differ with varying drought indices and hydrometeorological classes therefore this information is crucial to providing a robust mitigation mechanism against moderate drought conditions in the river basin 5 discussion understanding changes in drought characteristics and their propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is critical for effective water resource and drought management strategies we estimated drought magnitude severity duration and frequency at different timescales using different drought indices to investigate the role of climate and physiographic characteristics on hydrometeorological drought characteristics and propagation these characteristics vary spatially and temporally in magnitude and frequency at different time scales meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought characteristics and their respective propagation behaviors at the different time scales of nine near natural ethiopian catchments were examined using the spi spei sri and sbi over a range of aggregation periods most of the hydrometeorological drought events duration frequency and severity characteristics showed little spatial variability however hydrological drought characteristics showed higher spatial temporal differences in drought magnitude frequency and number of events than meteorological drought the characterization of hydrometeorological drought has received more attention in the last two to three decades with more emphasis on exploring the trend and changes in magnitude for example barker et al 2016 examined the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought and stated that physiographic characteristics significantly influence baseflow ma et al 2020 also evaluated the propagation of drought characteristics and concluded that there are positive relationships between hydrological and meteorological droughts with less frequent drought events but longer propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought conditions according to trenberth et al 2014 the components of the hydrological cycle are not the same at all temporal and spatial scales and increased air temperature plays a significant role in water loss this would dry out the available water resources leading to dryness and droughts most of the previous studies were focused on hydrometeorological drought projection using spi and sri under climate change and estimated more severe drought mainly arising from a misunderstanding of the link among the drought types gevaert et al 2018 pena gellardo et al 2021 that do not capture the atmospheric water land interactions however our novel approach evaluates hydrometeorological drought propagation and its relationship among the indices the changes in hydrometeorological drought and their propagation from precipitation deficits to soil moisture discharge and groundwater deficiencies and to ascertain to what extent climate and physiographic factors may affect drought characteristics e g magnitude frequency and duration and propagation the drought pattern using the spi and spei across the selected catchments is uniform in contrast the sri and sbi confirm that catchment heterogeneity made a significant difference in reproducing historical hydrological drought characteristics this suggests that hydrological drought is a more dynamic and nonlinear process that requires special consideration in hydrological process modeling however the spatial temporal pattern in drought characteristics is not found in correspondents at different time scales we observed slightly higher hydrological drought events using the sbi and lower meteorological drought events using the spei index compared with the other indices this could lead to higher or lower drought frequency magnitude and events the spi and spei indices show reasonably higher correlation and drought less deviation from the long term cumulative precipitation and moisture deficit the variation in the spatial drought characteristics is very significant using sri and sbi but highly variable with timescale which is consistent with the findings of desalegn et al 2006 the smaller the time scale is the higher the difference and correlation with their respective variables spi and precipitation spei and moisture deficiency sri and streamflow and sbi and baseflow at a 12 month time scale the main variables and their respective drought indices have a clear linear relationship due to the effects of standardization and the hydrological cycle the spatial variation was visible using sbi indices which show two groups of catchments less responsive to changes in baseflow and highly responsive to changes in baseflow even though the level of propagation is low drought characteristics propagate from the spi to the spei sri and sbi the magnitude of each drought class proportionally increased from the spi to the spei to the sri and to the sbi due to the water abstractions and evapotranspiration effects on average almost all the catchments have a 4 6 month lag time from meteorological to hydrological drought as a result water resource management and planning documents should take into account meteorological drought and its progression to hydrological drought which adds 4 6 months to the duration of hydrological drought events this would have significant input for hydrological operations and ecological management purposes the drought propagation probability of different classes from meteorological drought to hydrological drought varied spatially and the class type of drought occurrence and the probability of propagation of different classes increased substantially from meteorological classes to hydrological classes in most catchments normal mild and moderate droughts propagated from meteorological to hydrological droughts this implies that hydrological drought is more frequent than meteorological drought and has a larger magnitude than meteorological drought therefore more precautions are required for hydrological drought events and a robust adaptation strategy however hydrometeorological drought is a complex hazard influenced by land use land cover change and human activities dam operations and urbanization the linear regression modeling framework incorporates a set of catchment descriptors and climate variables to predict the magnitude of hydrological drought for the catchments located in the upper awash river basin the results indicate that physiographic features have a higher influence on triggering hydrometeorological drought over the river basin compared to other factors e g climate in addition the combination of both catchment descriptors and climate variables can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of medium and short term droughts in the awash river basin moreover this study can also be expanded to an ungauged catchment where the availability of meteorological and hydrological data is inadequate however the aggregation time scale is one of the most important factors in determining hydrometeorological drought characteristics for example on a seasonal scale drought duration and magnitude might be more related to climate than to physiographic variables whereas at an annual scale catchment descriptors may have a more significant influence on the characteristics of hydrological drought furthermore the proposed modeling approach is useful for distinguishing the key role of physiographic characteristics and climate variables in the upper awash river basin s hydrometeorological drought previous studies by wang et al 2016 and veettil and mishra 2020 also found that the role of catchment characteristics is more significant than climate variables in reproducing historical drought magnitude and duration these findings can be helpful for hydrological operations water supply irrigation and hydropower climate change policymakers integrated water resource managers and other water related stakeholders to create a better environment for the coming generation better prepare for climate change crisis adaptation and develop coping mechanisms in the context of drought probability occurrence and vulnerability studies these comprehensive drought results can be used to estimate the seasonal drought risk for water supply and the annual drought risk for ecosystem management in most catchments the complex and vital drought time series component is 3 months the hydrological and meteorological drought indices at the 3 month accumulation period confirmed that the probability of mild and moderate drought propagation is expected to increase by 0 24 at the 12 month accumulation period this may require more attention and adaptation plans and disaster management for sustainable water resource use in agriculture water supply and ecosystems haslinger et al 2013 huang et al 2018 liang et al 2021 this study has likely limitations that readers should be aware of and some caveats regarding this research work hydrological parameters and hydrological structure may play a significant role in hydrological drought meresa and romanowicz 2017 in this study we used an observed hydrological and meteorological dataset this study used only one conceptual hydrological model which may limit our understanding of the role of hydrological model structure in hydrological drought conditions therefore in future hydrometeorological drought related studies it is recommended to consider a physical based hydrological model and hydrological parameter uncertainty analysis can shed more light on it it is even more interesting if such work can also integrate various socioenvironmental factors and climate change uncertainty meresa et al 2022 to identify the future drought risk level at each site and provide more concrete information to stakeholders further investigations are required to incorporate meteorological drought to fully understand how hydrological drought responds to natural and anthropogenic changes 6 conclusions drought has become more of a concern and a major issue in water resource management and planning in terms of the drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought hydrological droughts were typically found following moderate to severe sequences of below normal precipitation which eventually led to extreme meteorological drought episodes streamflow was generally responsive to precipitation events however streamflow dryness required days to weeks to develop due to a continuous lack of precipitation large precipitation events accompanied the end of the streamflow drought in this strategy however the end of the streamflow drought does not indicate that water is now available at normal levels instead water recovery has only begun drought propagation is strongly related to catchment features and climate type with slower propagation from the surface to the subsurface in dry seasons and quicker drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological in the short aggregation time scale summer drought frequency propagation tends to be faster than in the winter especially in high slope catchments this may be a consequence of the distinct dry and wet seasons in the former and the land use and land cover in the latter the probability of drought propagation from meteorological to streamflow drought is faster than that of baseflow dryness this might be linked to a significant proportion of streamflow thereby causing a higher portion of total streamflow meteorological drought severity and duration characteristics using the spi and spei showed slight spatial and temporal variability while hydrological drought characteristics using the sri and sbi showed substantial differences in high frequency short duration and more severe events in most of the catchments catchments underlain by large unsaturated aquifers tended to show a larger delay in drought propagation duration from meteorological to hydrological drought with increasing accumulative periods from smaller to larger the longer spi and spei accumulation periods are not strongly correlated with the shorter sbi and sri indices the standard period average annual precipitation magnitude was found to be important in controlling the hydrological drought severity duration and propagation in most of the catchments with lower aquifer storage while in the catchments located in the upper part of the basin the hydrometeorological drought severity duration and propagation were more influenced by catchment aquifer storage and other catchment properties this study s understanding of drought magnitude risk and its propagation can be applied and used as a foundation for future ecological and water resource developments in the basin laying the groundwork for improved hydrometeorological drought preparedness recovery and increased resilience to drought risk in a linear model climate and physiographic characteristics explained more than 67 of the hydrometeorological drought characteristics this can be improved by considering more catchment descriptors and climate variables however climate variables alone may not be robust and more reliable for hydrometeorological drought prediction this implies that both catchment descriptors and climate variables have a substantial influence on medium and short duration hydrometeorological droughts including land use types and precipitation overall the saap soil type drainage area and elevation variables exhibited a higher influence on the long medium and short term hydrometeorological drought in particular the catchment variables such as forest grassland pastureland shrub bush catchment area and elevation showed considerable influence on the average drought magnitude which was derived based on sri 3 the linear model was able to predict 67 variability in the hydrological drought characteristics for sri 3 whereas sri6 and sr12 improved the model performance to 72 and 78 respectively developing robust efficient and suitably functioning hydrometeorological drought early warning systems and recovery strategies specific to severe drought prone catchments and a short and medium term adaptation plan the integration of extreme drought risk management concepts into medium term development measures water harvesting technologies and connecting investors around the awash basin in different mitigation adaptation and intervention

2413,riverbed morphology change is the complex evolution of river states and the concern in many river systems due to its relation to riverbank failures assessment of the morphological needs to account for natural and human factors in which some of them can be ignored in studies this limits our understanding of the evolution the vietnam mekong river is such case which received global concern of serious riverbank failures related to sandmining but the understanding of river flow regulation on riverbed morphology has been limited therefore this study aims at disclosing the evolution to complement the studies the selected case study is vam nao confluent area which is tidal influenced and free from sandmining and experienced riverbank failures this study applied numerical models of the saint venant telemac2d navier stokes telemac3d and exner sisyphe 2d equations we created two nested unstructured meshes using inverse distance interpolation 1 50 m 50 m size for telemac2d for hydrologic simulation timestep of 10 s to provide boundary conditions for telemac3d and sisyphe and 2 40 m 40 m for coupled telemac3d and sisyphe timestep of 4 s for riverbed morphology simulation duration of simulation was 2009 2018 data for model assessment were from measurements using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in may 2018 for discharge q and water elevation h and in 2017 for riverbed the applied models performed well with nse hourly in 4 days in may 2018 of 0 86 and 0 92 for water elevation h and discharge q respectively and 0 8 in 2017 for cross and longitudinal sections of riverbed elevation morphological simulation reported river flow as the main cause for the riverbed changes and the co existence of scouring and filling in the region study findings indicated that without the sandmining river flow can still cause the morphological changes results from the morphological change assessment carried out using the nested modeling approach are corroborated by bottom erosion and sedimentation observations at the study area keywords river morphology evolution mekong river sandmining riverbank failures data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction riverbed morphology indicates the river state which evolves as part of its flow behavior by nature the evolution includes a sequence of riverbed morphological changes and can cause riverbank failure which in many cases leads to serious property khoi et al 2020 and settlement losses das et al 2014 studying riverbed evolution can help reveal potential causes of riverbank failures to prevent the losses however assessing the evolution is somehow difficult due to field measurement constraints therefore numerical modeling can be alternatively applied to the evaluation to enhance the understanding of the nature of river regulation on the failures which are apart to from human causes the riverbed evolution can be assessed by combining hydrologic and sediment models 1d 2d and 3d the models often have specific applications depending on modeling capacities and study needs for this reason combining the models for the evolution study is difficult therefore model coupling for this study topic is the art of modeling arrangement to make sure the applied models can represent the evolution comprehensively the models such as mike 11 dansk hydraulisk institut dhi isis halcrow and hr

2020 isis lin et al 2006 can be useful for simulating river flow assessment as reported in the studies in the avon river england baban and foster 2002 and the mekong river ngo et al 2018 van et al 2012 however this model has limited computation nodes nkwunonwo et al 2020 alternatively open source telemac hervouet 1999 can simulate 2d and 3d river flows nguyen et al 2022 nkwunonwo et al 2020 for large scales but is time consuming for the evolution study such hydrologic models need to be coupled with sediment transport models some 1d models such as mobed krishnappan 1981 st1d papanicolaou et

sediment those with 2d 3d simulation capacity and open source functions can be more advantageous for application and should be explored the assistance of numerical modeling can help reveal river morphological evolution to support seeking for solutions coping with river state changes and riverbank failures such studies are highly demanded among the world s rivers the mekong river is the global concern because its basin supports about 65 million people commission 2011 but gets co effects of hydropower dam sea level rise and sandmining the riverbed of the vietnam mekong river typically consists of sand and mud allison et al 2017 riverbank failure in this area is a serious problem miyazawa et al 2008 nguyen et al 2022 which sandmining is considered the main cause brunier et al 2014 hackney et al 2020 kummu and varis 2007 studies in this region mostly focused on water riverbank failure and sandmining but the mechanism of flow regimes on the riverbed morphology has been relatively unknown the question on how river flow regulates the riverbed morphology has been raised but not fully answered when even the sandmining was not available and human residence was little in the region one reason for the knowledge limitation in this field is due to technological difficulty and the complexity of the river which has bifurcation and confluence for the reasons above we conducted a close up study to reveal the mechanism of the riverbed morphological evolution which emphasizes on disclosing 1 flow regulation and 2 riverbed morphology evolution by nature in the complex case study getting riverbank failure in 2017 tide effects and confluence flows 2 methodology 2 1 study site this study is located in the vietnamese part of the mekong river the 10th longest river in the world having a mean discharge of approx 15 000 m3 s letrung et al 2013 the study area is subject to semi tidal effects when entering vietnam the mekong river splits into tien river at tan chau and hau river or bassac river at chau doc which later confluence in vam nao area the study focus fig 1 measured data of hourly discharge q and water elevation h for the study area come from hydro meteorological stations at chau doc cd tan chau tc cho moi cm vam nao vn and long xuyen lx agphmc 2019 the riverbed elevation in this region ranges from 43 m to 6 m vietnam s hon dau datum an giang donre 2018 the discharge at tan chau is greater than that at chau doc letrung et al 2013 which results in partial water discharge from tien river to hau river through vam nao river fig 1 the maximum discharge at tan chau is approximately 3 5 times greater than at chau doc in overall the common spectrum for discharges at chau doc and tan chau exhibits the effects of a daily semi tide and a seasonal flood fig 2 and fig 3 this area has the typical flood season in august and november with high discharges these branching properties make the flow in this area complex 2 2 coupling hydrologic and sediment transport models modeling a particular water system needs boundary data of water discharge elevation which are sometimes not available hence hydrologic boundary data is often extracted from a 1d simulation for a large area however due to channel simplification the 1d model might simulate hydrological outcome not well fit to the real world therefore for error minimization this study designed a particular modeling set up with two stages fig 4 1 stage 1 using telemac2d to simulate q and h for the entire cd tc cm lx region riverbed mesh 50 m 50 m 11 490 ha 8 9930 nodes and 169 951 elements this mesh was interpolated by applying inverse distance weighting idw for riverbed elevation data points the boundaries of discharge q were at cd and tc stations while those of water elevation h were at cm and lx stations this stage is to simulate the boundaries of q and h for stage 2 2 stage 2 coupling telemac3d and sisyphe to run the riverbed morphology evolution for the ng vn bt area smaller part of cd tc cm lx with the boundary q at ng extracted from the telemac2d outcome in the stage 1 while that at vn obtained from the measurement at vam nao station the boundary h at bt was extracted from the telemac2d outcome the ng vn bt mesh is idw interpolated of resolution 40 m 40 m 941 5 ha 6 711 nodes and 12 681 elements the coupling details are shown in fig 4 telemac2d solves the following saint venant equations ata et al 2014 1 h t u h h d i v u s h 2 u t u u g z x s x 1 h d i v h v t u 3 v t u v g z y s y 1 h d i v h v t v where h is water depth which can be transformed from water elevation m u v are velocity components m s g is acceleration due to gravity m s2 vt is momentum coefficient m2 s z is free surface elevation m t is time s sh is source or sink of fluid m s and sx sy are source or sink terms in dynamic equations m s2 the simulation timestep is 10 s modeling with telemac2d was aimed at providing the hydrologic boundary data of discharge and water elevation for telemac3d sisyphe we used telemac3d to solve the navier stokes equations for non hydrostatic conditions edf r d 2016 as follows 4 d i v u 0 the momentum equation along x y and z directions are as follows 5 u t

components m s v is cinematic viscosity m2 s ρ is density and fx fy and fz m s2 are source terms of wave coriolis force and bottom friction fx and fy are ignored since our study area in the river system that wave is not significant and not large enough to take fy into account fz is set constant of 0 021 for the entire area because the area is relatively small the pressure is split up into a hydrostatic pressure and a dynamic pressure p as follows 8 p p atm p 0 g z s z p 0 g z z s δ p p 0 d z p d where p atm is atmospheric pressure is p 0 reference density p d is dynamic pressure in the telemac system when non hydrostatic version was selected telemac3d solves a w vertical velocity equation which is similar to the u and v equations with the additional gravity term the timestep for telemac3d is 4 s for each timestep besides simulating 3d hydrologic outcome telemac3d supplied 2d hydrodynamic data to sisyphe to compute the new riverbed which was the next input for telemac3d this loop was repeated until the simulation ended sisyphe solves the exner equation edf randd 2014 riesterer et al 2013 for riverbed change bottom elevation 9 1 n z f t q b 0 where n is porosity of non cohesive bed zf is bottom elevation m and qb is bed transport in a width unit m2 s which uses the meyer peter and müller equations 1948 when sisyphe was coupled with telemac3d bed shear stress was aligned with the near bed velocity to determine possible flow deviations while the magnitude of the bed shear stress was related to the depth averaged velocity except if the nikuradse friction law is applied the friction velocity u z1 m s is computed as follows 10 u z 1 u k ln z 1 z 0 where z0 is the function of nikuradse bed roughness z0 ks 30 m with ks the grain roughness height m z1 is the distance of the first vertical plan from the bed level m and k 0 4 is the von kármán constant the bedload transport rate m s equation is 11 s q b g s 1 d ch 3 where s is relative density ρ s ρ dch is the characteristic sand grain diameter dch for uniform grains d50 m and g is gravity m s2 the shields parameter θ is 12 θ μ τ 0 ρ s ρ g d ch where μ is the skin friction and τ 0 is the bottom shear stress pa the sediment transport rate b m s equation is as follows 13 b 0 i f θ θ c α mpm θ θ c 3 2 o t h e r w i s e where α mpm is coefficient 8 by default θ c is the crital shields parameter 0 047 by default the detailed computation process strictly followed the manual provided by électricité de france research development innovation 2014 in addition since the study focus area is small and previous total suspended solid concentration tss was stable which the dominant bedload change is not from the tss but flow we applied the equilibrium state with the average concentration of tss of the dry and rainy seasons of 0 207 kg m3 2 3 field measurement 2 3 1 field measurements and calibration for hydrologic data hourly measured data of discharge q and water elevation h was obtained from the stations at cd tc vn cm and lx in 2009 2018 period agphmc 2019 in which those at vn were used to compute the nse values for telemac2d assessment the sonar riverbed data in 2009 for the entire area of cd tc cm lx and in 2017 for vn was gathered from an giang donre an giang province department of natural resources and environment 2018 this study used adcp firmly mounted underneath a boat to measure q and h cross sectionally for telemac3d assessment and riverbed for sisyphe assessment we also sampled sediments and computed their d50 in dry may 2018 and flood seasons september 2018 to select proper bed load estimation method for this study all measured data regarding elevation was transformed regarding vietnam s geodetic hon dau datum which has elevation origin at mean sea level of the hon dau tide gauge minderhoud et al 2019 while all spatial data were projected to epsg 3405 vn 2000 utm zone 48 n 2 3 2 model assessment model results were assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse 14 nse 1 n 1 1 dobsi d s i m i n 1 1 dobs d o b s where dsim i is simulated data dobs i is observed data and i is series index model assessment was arranged with the friction of 0 021 models with nse 0 5 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 for more assessment references the transects of extraction of simulated data for telemac2d telemac3d and sisyphe in our study was set similar to that of nguyen xuan lan et al 2021 with the friction of 0 016 0 021 in our study the details of model assessment are shown in table 1 fig 1 and fig 5 3 results and discussions 3 1 results 3 1 1 model assessment telemac2d was calibrated by varying river bottom friction coefficient the continuity of the constraint at the fluid solid interface within the range of 0 016 0 026 and finally the value of 0 021 was selected for our study this value of the friction coefficient resulted in a high nse for the entire hourly h of year 2017 of 0 98 at the vam nao station denoted vn in the fig 1 this means that the telemac2d can simulate comprehensive hydrologic outcome to provide boundary data of q at ng and h at bt for coupled telemac3d sisyphe fig 1 and fig 5 using the same friction coefficient of 0 021 this study coupled telemac3d and sisyphe and simulated q and h for the entire year 2018 then we computed the nse values for hourly q and h of 0 92 and 0 86 respectively fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 for may 2018 this combination simulated water elevation a little higher than the observed data water at some points indeed we varied the coefficients and observed nses for q and h and finally decided to keep that of 0 021 with nses for q at very good level and h at good level the purpose of this selection was to ensure having comprehensive q and h for morphological simulation using the coupled telemac3d and sisyphe for sisyphe assessment we computed the nse for riverbed distance interval of 1 m in 2018 the computed nse was 0 8 for both vertical fig 8 and horizontal fig 9 transects the assessment results indicated the models of telemac2d telemac3d and sisyphe performed well according to the criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 where it is stated that nse 0 5 is considered satisfactory 3 1 2 flow regulation the evolution with bank erosion can be caused by secondary or recirculating flows effects close to the riverbank the study area is within a confluence area which is also influenced by tide forcing flow to be backed up the hau river the left branch fig 1 and at the same time redirecting flow from the vam nao river to the hau river fig 1 and fig 10 the simulation outcome showed that circulating flow average velocity of approx 0 32 m s occurred due to the combination between the flow toward downstream and toward upstream along riverbank due to tidal effects fig 10 the modeling results indicated that the circulation occurred when the flow upstream began in combination with the flow downstream fig 11 particularly we found that the flood season has more circulation frequency in 2009 2017 because the flow downstream in the flood season in hau river is dominant over the semi diurnal tide opposite to the dry season when the tide effects are dominant while the riverbed remains mostly unchanged the appearance of the circulating flows may be driven by downstream conditions 3 1 3 riverbed morphology evolution results from our field sampling showed that the main component up to 65 74 of bed sediments is sand in the fine to medium range d50 0 25 0 50 mm thus the meyer peters equations were applied for bedload rate computation to assess if the hydrology determines the erosion the riverbed of the deepest hole data was measured in year 2017 was lifted by 15 m while the hydrology was kept unchanged in the same year for this arrangement we found that the erosion still occurred in the middle of the river this common trend is similar to the case of morphological simulation in 2009 2018 without lifting the riverbed since this area has no sandmining activities and thus the morphological changes were mainly driven by flow induced transport processes fig 12 and fig 13 in other words the hydrology was the driver for the morphological change the results from the riverbed simulation showed the bed changes in 2009 2017 period particularly the vertical expansion of the deep scour hole over time the deepening of the hole in the river in the middle reflects the erosion in the mainstream shown in fig 14 and fig 15 part of the riverbank was eroded in 2017 presumably by recirculating flows which caused the bank failure results from this study indicated that flows in the upper hau river and the vam nao river after mixing and with the tide effect formed a unique flow behavior complicated by tidal effects most flow velocities were below 2 m s for this spectrum the erosion is gradual which explained that the bank failure is a prolonged process of flow effects on the riverbed morphology 4 discussions this study proved that hydrology particularly flow as the main cause for the morphological changes by nature in the region the integrated modeling procedure applied in this study was sufficient for the riverbed morphological evolution assessment the telemac2d performed well in our study regarding the nse of hourly h for the year 2017 which was similarly reported by nguyen xuan lan et al 2021 for the year 2009 the coupled telemac3d and sisyphe models performed well in simulating q and h and riverbed morphology the model assessment outcome showed that the modeling set up in our study was suitable for simulating comprehensive of q h and riverbed morphology in combination telemac3d link sisyphe was able to predict the bed change in our study which similarly experienced for the study in hirakud reservoir india with nse of 0 97 and rsr of 0 25 dutta and sen 2016 additionally telemac2d telemac3d and siysphe are able to utilize high performance computing hpc resources enabling larger studies to be conducted moulinec et al 2011 which our study took advantages from moreover because model performance assessment needs observed data the sampling technology providing parameter inputs and observed data can influence the justification of model assessment for example the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp is widely used to measure flow efficiently muste et al 2004 which our study applied the results showed that the applied techniques of measurement and modeling in this study are adequate our coupled telemac3d and sisyphe revealed circulating flows adjacent to riverbank which experienced riverbank failure in 2017 the additional analysis with telemac3d showed that the existence of 3d circular flow particularly when the upstream discharge was dominant the tendency was for flow to occur in the upstream downstream direction tidal effect causes the flow to change direction when tide is completely dominant flow in entirely upstream into the hau river these results indicate that the circulating flows are strongly influenced by upstream flow effects and tide with varying time scales the upstream flow effects are seasonal and dominant in the wetter months while tidal effects are semi diurnal and more pronounced in the dry season these observations are in broad agreement with dike et al 2015 who have conducted similar studies and also noted the formation of local scour holes in the vicinity of eddies dike et al 2015 our results are also similar to the case of ohio river where flow separation occurred in the area adjacent to the riverbank leading to the formation of circulating flows hubbs 2006 leifer 2019 has also reported similar studies in the same region nguyen et al 2022 simulated hydrologic modeling without sediment transport modeling and found the similar circulation flows though local conditions may differ our study and the studies mentioned here note the existence of circulating flows particularly in the flood season accompanied by riverbank scouring the circulating flows are not only related to flow but also the riverbed sharma 2020 pavoni and stein 1975 found out that bank erosion is influenced by weak shearing resistance of soil permeability and water level variation booth 2017 reported that besides the circulating flows the low flow periods when backwaters are lost can lead to scouring in our case due to the semi tidal effects the mekong river has two times of water level rise and fall per day and thus this tide significantly affects local flow and induce scouring youdeowei and abam 1997 reported that undercutting of the bank s toe and the shoaling of river circulating flows could lead to steepening bank slopes and caused the bank to be unstable and collapse in other words revealing the circulating flows can help identify potential scouring on riverbank but need to be combined with other factors such as backwater effects water level fluctuation and soil structure to fully address bank failures recent studies have reported the morphology of the mekong river in relation to sandmining for instance kummu and varis 2007 reported that the mekong has sediment transport capacity exceeds its supply in both dry and wet seasons due to the large amount of sediment trapped by the dams upstream and this resulted in channel bed degradation brunier et al 2014 also noticed that the overall morphological changes in the mekong river were driven by sandmining in addition hackney et al 2020 reported that sand extraction was the main cause for the riverbank instability for the whole mekong river for our study area which is free from sandmining the findings indicate that morphological change is fundamentally driven by the regulation of flow and tidal effects which can be observed via the riverbed erosion the riverbed morphology pattern in our study site however is evolving with the riverbed erosion happening not only in the middle but also extending downstream along the river our study outcome agreed with the study results of thi kim et al 2020 who reported the riverbed erosion in the middle of vinh hoa river channel another part of the vietnam mekong river which is also free from sandmining therefore the morphological changes are due to not only sandmining but also the nature of river flows in the mekong river the actual cause of riverbank failure is probably more related to case specific effects with without sandmining and the nature of river flows happening in particular areas of riverbank 5 conclusions by using adcp and hpc with the set up of 2d and 3d modeling of hydrology and sediment transport this study revealed the morphological evolution comprehensively the applied models performed well regarding nse values for discharge water elevation and riverbed they helped discover the flow pattern in the study area which has flow confluence and semi tide effects and also aid to reveal the mechanism of mixed and circular flows that have not been well studied in the mekong river particularly we found circulating flows an erosion factor close to riverbank contributing to riverbank failure in the study area the application of numerical modeling with telemac2d telemac3d and sisyphe is proper for assessment of morphological changes however their performance depends much on hpc and sampling techniques for model calibration and assessment for which adcp was useful for large study areas meshes for these models may contain errors that should be carefully assessed the findings from our study complement the current knowledge of the morphological changes in the mekong river we reported that for areas without sandmining the co effects of flows and semi tide are the main causes leading the morphological changes these factors can also cause the appearance of the circulating flows that can then give rise to morphological changes particularly riverbank erosion therefore assessment of riverbank instability or failure should consider the effects of river flows on river morphology besides other specific factors like sandmining credit authorship contribution statement tanh t n nguyen conceptualization formal analysis funding acquisition methodology project

discharge at tan chau is greater than that at chau doc letrung et al 2013 which results in partial water discharge from tien river to hau river through vam nao river fig 1 the maximum discharge at tan

fig 3 this area has the typical flood season in august and november with high discharges these branching properties make the flow in this area complex 2 2 coupling hydrologic and sediment transport models modeling a particular water system needs boundary data of water discharge elevation which are sometimes not available hence hydrologic boundary data is often extracted from a 1d simulation for a large area however due to channel simplification the 1d model might simulate hydrological outcome not well fit to the real world therefore for error minimization this study designed a particular modeling set up with two stages fig 4 1 stage 1 using telemac2d to simulate q and h for the entire cd tc cm lx region riverbed mesh 50 m 50 m 11 490 ha 8 9930 nodes and 169 951 elements this mesh was interpolated by applying inverse distance weighting idw for riverbed elevation data points the boundaries of discharge q were at cd and tc stations while those of water elevation h were at cm and lx stations this stage is to simulate the boundaries of q and h for stage 2 2 stage 2 coupling telemac3d and sisyphe to run the riverbed morphology evolution for the ng vn bt area smaller part of cd tc cm lx with the boundary q at ng extracted from the telemac2d outcome in the stage 1 while that at vn obtained from the measurement at vam nao station the boundary h at bt was extracted from the telemac2d outcome the ng vn bt mesh is idw interpolated of resolution 40 m 40 m 941 5 ha 6 711 nodes and 12 681 elements the coupling details are shown in fig 4 telemac2d solves the following saint

sisyphe we used telemac3d to solve the navier stokes equations for non hydrostatic conditions edf r d 2016 as follows 4 d i v u 0 the momentum equation along x y and z directions are as follows 5 u t

system that wave is not significant and not large enough to take fy into account fz is set constant of 0 021 for the entire area because the area is relatively small the pressure is split up into a hydrostatic pressure and a dynamic pressure p as follows 8 p p atm p 0 g z s z p 0 g z z s δ p p 0 d z p d where p atm is atmospheric pressure is p 0 reference density p d is dynamic pressure in the telemac system when non hydrostatic version was selected telemac3d solves a w vertical velocity equation which is similar to the u and v equations with the additional gravity term the timestep for telemac3d is 4 s for each timestep besides simulating 3d hydrologic outcome telemac3d supplied 2d hydrodynamic data to sisyphe to compute the new riverbed which was the next input for telemac3d this loop was repeated until the simulation ended sisyphe solves the exner equation edf randd 2014 riesterer et al 2013 for riverbed change bottom elevation 9 1 n z f t q b 0 where n is porosity of non cohesive bed zf is bottom elevation m and qb is bed transport in a width unit m2 s which uses the meyer peter and müller equations 1948 when sisyphe was coupled with telemac3d bed shear stress was aligned with the near bed velocity to determine possible flow deviations while the magnitude of the bed shear stress was related to the depth averaged velocity except if the nikuradse friction law is applied the friction velocity u z1 m s is computed as follows 10 u z 1 u k ln z 1 z 0 where z0 is the function of nikuradse bed roughness z0 ks 30 m with ks the grain roughness height m z1 is the

by default the detailed computation process strictly followed the manual provided by électricité de france research development innovation 2014 in addition since the study focus area is small and previous total suspended solid concentration tss was stable which the dominant bedload change is not from the tss but flow we applied the equilibrium state with the average concentration of tss of the dry and rainy seasons of 0 207 kg m3 2 3 field measurement 2 3 1 field measurements and calibration for hydrologic data hourly measured data of discharge q and water elevation h was obtained from the stations at cd tc vn cm and lx in 2009 2018 period agphmc 2019 in which those at vn were used to compute the nse values for telemac2d assessment the sonar riverbed data in 2009 for the entire area of cd tc cm lx and in 2017 for vn was gathered from an giang donre an giang province department of natural resources and environment 2018 this study used adcp firmly mounted underneath a boat to measure q and h cross sectionally for telemac3d assessment and riverbed for sisyphe assessment we also sampled sediments and computed their d50 in dry may 2018 and flood seasons september 2018 to select proper bed load estimation method for this study all measured data regarding elevation was transformed regarding vietnam s geodetic hon dau datum which has elevation origin at mean sea level of the hon dau tide gauge minderhoud et al 2019 while all spatial data were projected to epsg 3405 vn 2000 utm zone 48 n 2 3 2 model assessment model results were assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse 14 nse 1 n 1 1 dobsi d s i m i n 1 1 dobs d o b s where dsim i is simulated data dobs i is observed data and i is series index model assessment was arranged with the friction of 0 021 models with nse 0 5 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 for more assessment references the transects of extraction of simulated data for telemac2d telemac3d and sisyphe in our study was set similar to that of nguyen xuan lan et al 2021 with the friction of 0 016 0 021 in our study the details of model assessment are shown in table 1 fig 1 and fig 5 3 results and discussions 3 1 results 3 1 1 model assessment telemac2d was calibrated by varying river bottom friction coefficient the continuity of the constraint at the fluid solid interface within the range of 0 016 0 026 and finally the value of 0 021 was selected for our study this value of the friction coefficient resulted in a high nse for the entire hourly h of year 2017 of 0 98 at the vam nao station denoted vn in the fig 1 this means that the telemac2d can simulate comprehensive hydrologic outcome to provide boundary data of q at ng and h at bt for coupled telemac3d sisyphe fig 1 and fig 5 using the same friction coefficient of 0 021 this study coupled telemac3d and sisyphe and simulated q and h for the entire year 2018 then we computed the nse values for hourly q and h of 0 92 and 0 86 respectively fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 for may 2018 this combination simulated water elevation a little higher than the observed data water at some points indeed we varied the coefficients and observed nses for q and h and finally decided to keep that of 0 021 with nses for q at very good level and h at good level the purpose of this selection was to ensure having comprehensive q and h for morphological simulation using the coupled telemac3d and sisyphe for sisyphe assessment we computed the nse for riverbed distance interval of 1 m in 2018 the computed nse was 0 8 for both vertical fig 8 and horizontal fig 9 transects the assessment results indicated the models of telemac2d telemac3d and sisyphe performed well according to the criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 where it is stated that nse 0 5 is considered satisfactory 3 1 2 flow regulation the evolution with bank erosion can be caused by secondary or recirculating flows effects close to the riverbank the study area is within a confluence area which is also influenced by tide forcing flow to be backed up the hau river the left branch fig 1 and at the same time redirecting flow from the vam nao river to the hau river fig 1 and fig 10 the simulation outcome showed that circulating flow average velocity of approx 0 32 m s occurred due to the combination between the flow toward downstream and toward upstream along riverbank due to tidal effects fig 10 the modeling results indicated that the circulation occurred when the flow upstream began in combination with the flow downstream fig 11 particularly we found that the flood season has more circulation frequency in 2009 2017 because the flow downstream in the flood season in hau river is dominant over the semi diurnal tide opposite to the dry season when the tide effects are dominant while the riverbed remains mostly unchanged the appearance of the circulating flows may be driven by downstream conditions 3 1 3 riverbed morphology evolution results from our field sampling showed that the main component up to 65 74 of bed sediments is sand in the fine to medium range d50 0 25 0 50 mm thus the meyer peters equations were applied for bedload rate computation to assess if the hydrology determines the erosion the riverbed of the deepest hole data was measured in year 2017 was lifted by 15 m while the hydrology was kept unchanged in the same year for this arrangement we found that the erosion still occurred in the middle of the river this common trend is similar to the case of morphological simulation in 2009 2018 without lifting the riverbed since this area has no sandmining activities and thus the morphological changes were mainly driven by flow induced transport processes fig 12 and fig 13 in other words the hydrology was the driver for the morphological change the results from the riverbed simulation showed the bed changes in 2009 2017 period particularly the vertical expansion of the deep scour hole over time the deepening of the hole in the river in the middle reflects the erosion in the mainstream shown in fig 14 and fig 15 part of the riverbank was eroded in 2017 presumably by recirculating flows which caused the bank failure results from this study indicated that flows in the upper hau river and the vam nao river after mixing and with the tide effect formed a unique flow behavior complicated by tidal effects most flow velocities were below 2 m s for this spectrum the erosion is gradual which explained that the bank failure is a prolonged process of flow effects on the riverbed morphology 4 discussions this study proved that hydrology particularly flow as the main cause for the morphological changes by nature in the region the integrated modeling procedure applied in this study was sufficient for the riverbed morphological evolution assessment the telemac2d performed well in our study regarding the nse of hourly h for the year 2017 which was similarly reported by nguyen xuan lan et al 2021 for the year 2009 the coupled telemac3d and sisyphe models performed well in simulating q and h and riverbed morphology the model assessment outcome showed that the modeling set up in our study was suitable for simulating comprehensive of q h and riverbed morphology in combination telemac3d link sisyphe was able to predict the bed change in our study which similarly experienced for the study in hirakud reservoir india with nse of 0 97 and rsr of 0 25 dutta and sen 2016 additionally telemac2d telemac3d and siysphe are able to utilize high performance computing hpc resources enabling larger studies to be conducted moulinec et al 2011 which our study took advantages from moreover because model performance assessment needs observed data the sampling technology providing parameter inputs and observed data can influence the justification of model assessment for example the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp is widely used to measure flow efficiently muste et al 2004 which our study applied the results showed that the applied techniques of measurement and modeling in this study are adequate our coupled telemac3d and sisyphe revealed circulating flows adjacent to riverbank which experienced riverbank failure in 2017 the additional analysis with telemac3d showed that the existence of 3d circular flow particularly when the upstream discharge was dominant the tendency was for flow to occur in the upstream downstream direction tidal effect causes the flow to change direction when tide is completely dominant flow in entirely upstream into the hau river these results indicate that the circulating flows are strongly influenced by upstream flow effects and tide with varying time scales the upstream flow effects are seasonal and dominant in the wetter months while tidal effects are semi diurnal and more pronounced in the dry season these observations are in broad agreement with dike et al 2015 who have conducted similar studies and also noted the formation of local scour holes in the vicinity of eddies dike et al 2015 our results are also similar to the case of ohio river where flow separation occurred in the area adjacent to the riverbank leading to the formation of circulating flows hubbs 2006 leifer 2019 has also reported similar studies in the same region nguyen et al 2022 simulated hydrologic modeling without sediment transport modeling and found the similar circulation flows though local conditions may differ our study and the studies mentioned here note the existence of circulating flows particularly in the flood season accompanied by riverbank scouring the circulating flows are not only related to flow but also the riverbed sharma 2020 pavoni and stein 1975 found out that bank erosion is influenced by weak shearing resistance of soil permeability and water level variation booth 2017 reported that besides the circulating flows the low flow periods when backwaters are lost can lead to scouring in our case due to the semi tidal effects the mekong river has two times of water level rise and fall per day and thus this tide significantly affects local flow and induce scouring youdeowei and abam 1997 reported that undercutting of the bank s toe and the shoaling of river circulating flows could lead to steepening bank slopes and caused the bank to be unstable and collapse in other words revealing the circulating flows can help identify potential scouring on riverbank but need to be combined with other factors such as backwater effects water level fluctuation and soil structure to fully address bank failures recent studies have reported the morphology of the mekong river in relation to sandmining for instance kummu and varis 2007 reported that the mekong has sediment transport capacity exceeds its supply in both dry and wet seasons due to the large amount of sediment trapped by the dams upstream and this resulted in channel bed degradation brunier et al 2014 also noticed that the overall morphological changes in the mekong river were driven by sandmining in addition hackney et al 2020 reported that sand extraction was the main cause for the riverbank instability for the whole mekong river for our study area which is free from sandmining the findings indicate that morphological change is fundamentally driven by the regulation of flow and tidal effects which can be observed via the riverbed erosion the riverbed morphology pattern in our study site however is evolving with the riverbed erosion happening not only in the middle but also extending downstream along the river our study outcome agreed with the study results of thi kim et al 2020 who reported the riverbed erosion in the middle of vinh hoa river channel another part of the vietnam mekong river which is also free from sandmining therefore the morphological changes are due to not only sandmining but also the nature of river flows in the mekong river the actual cause of riverbank failure is probably more related to case specific effects with without sandmining and the nature of river flows happening in particular areas of riverbank 5 conclusions by using adcp and hpc with the set up of 2d and 3d modeling of hydrology and sediment transport this study revealed the morphological evolution comprehensively the applied models performed well regarding nse values for discharge water elevation and riverbed they helped discover the flow pattern in the study area which has flow confluence and semi tide effects and also aid to reveal the mechanism of mixed and circular flows that have not been well studied in the mekong river particularly we found circulating flows an erosion factor close to riverbank contributing to riverbank failure in the study area the application of numerical modeling with telemac2d telemac3d and sisyphe is proper for assessment of morphological changes however their performance depends much on hpc and sampling techniques for model calibration and assessment for which adcp was useful for large study areas meshes for these models may contain errors that should be carefully assessed the findings from our study complement the current knowledge of the morphological changes in the mekong river we reported that for areas without sandmining the co effects of flows and semi tide are the main causes leading the morphological changes these factors can also cause the appearance of the circulating flows that can then give rise to morphological changes particularly riverbank erosion therefore assessment of riverbank instability or failure should consider the effects of river flows on river morphology besides other specific factors like sandmining credit authorship contribution statement tanh t n nguyen conceptualization formal analysis funding acquisition methodology project

2414,during the production process of underground gas storage ugs with high salinity formation water salt deposition has been observed due to formation water evaporation this work aims at understanding the effect of salt deposition on petrophysical properties and pore structure firstly dynamic and static experiments are carried out to simulate the multi cycle gas injection and production of the ugs based on the core plugs rock debris and water from wen23 gas field secondly nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scan electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectrum eds are applied to investigate the change of pore structure and salt crystal morphology results indicate that the core permeability and porosity after water evaporation are averagely increased by 39 to 68 and 42 to 66 respectively compared with the initial water saturation conditions under different water salinity salt crystals in the reservoir are mainly deposited in large pores the dispersed and aggregated salt crystals are observed and most salt crystals are between 1 μm and 5 μm in size thus formation water evaporation is beneficial to the improvement of reservoir petrophysical properties

industry is in a phase of rapid growth braungardt et al 2019 zhu et al 2022 the problems of gas storage and seasonal peak shaving are becoming more and more prominent with the increase of natural gas

s natural gas industry at present about 75 of the world s ugs is built based on depleted reservoirs and the proportion of china s ugs based on reservoirs is higher than 90 zhang et al 2020 depleted oil gas reservoirs are favorable targets for ugs due to the good sealing and storage properties production wells in gas reservoirs occasionally experience rapid performance decline in many cases this behavior may be attributed to salt deposition in the near or within the wellbore for certain gas wells in the north sea salt accumulation has been indicated by mechanical wireline surveys fig 1 a and 1b bybee 2009 salt deposition occurs when the initial salinity of formation water is high andre et al 2014 peysson et al 2014 zeidouni et al 2009 causing security risks to the stable operation of ugs miri and hellevang 2016 ott et al 2015 ott et al 2021 zeidouni et al 2009 the formation salt deposition in the ugs is mainly affected by four factors including formation water evaporation alkan et al 2010 golghanddashti et al 2013 formation water salinity kim et al 2012 pressure and temperature tang and etzion 2004 the evaporation process will cause salt scale in porous media decreasing the

resulting in approximately 20 of porosity reductions kim et al 2013 salt deposition under stratigraphic conditions is simulated by injecting co2 into sandstone samples which are fully saturated with nacl brine and the permeability and porosity were analyzed the results show that salt deposition became more serious with the increase of formation water salinity the core permeability decreases more obviously with the increase of gas volume during the process of gas injection jeddizahed and rostami 2016 the distribution of salt crystals in pores after the deposition of gas storage is also a key research field cui et al 2018 ott et al ott et al 2014 ott et al 2010 ott et al 2012 used ct scanning technology to scan the core after salt deposition in formation water and observed the migration of salt crystals in pores on a microscopic level however these studies mainly use fully dried cores as initial conditions in fact the core often has initial formation water and the change of pore structure by salt deposition is also unclear understanding the salt deposition characteristics in the ugs is significant for its efficient development in this work dynamic and static experiments under formation conditions are designed to simulate salt deposition during multi cycle injection and production of the ugs nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scan electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectrum eds are applied to analyze the change of pore structure and salt crystal morphology after salt deposition this work can help engineers understand effects of salt deposition on reservoir petrophysical properties in the ugs 2 background of the gas field wen23 gas field is located in wenliu town henan province the construction of wen23 gas field can achieve the natural gas peak adjustment in north china which is significant to improve the safety of natural gas supply the gas bearing strata are the fourth member of shahejie formation lower tertiary with depth of 2750 to 3120 m the gas bearing area is 11 76 km2 and the geological reserves of natural gas are 130 108 m3 the development process of wen23 gas field can be divided into five stages fig 2 including development preparation stage 1977 1987 increasing production stage 1988 1990 stable production stage 1990 2001 production adjustment stage 2002 2006 and production decline stage 2007 present wen96 ugs is located around wen23 ugs salt formation has been found in the wellbore of wen96 ugs since the fourth production cycle well c12 is located in the north of the wen96 ugs with high injection and production capacity well c12 was unable to inject gas when the fifth cycle began on june 2 2017 fig 3 the gas injection ability of well c12 was significantly improved after water washing was used to remove salt deposition a large amount of salt deposition in formation and wellbore made natural gas unable to be effectively injected and produced wen23 ugs has just completed its first production cycle and no obvious salt deposition has been detected however due to the large area of salt deposition in wen23 gas field the wellbore and reservoir of wen23 ugs are expected to face a higher risk of salt deposition than that in the gas field development stage wen23 gas field was rebuilt into an ugs in 2018 the maximum pressure is 38 mpa and the minimum pressure is 15 mpa the effective working gas volume is 57 108 m3 the maximum daily gas injection is 2 4 107 m3 and the maximum daily gas extraction is 4 107 m3 the operation cycle of the ugs is 200 days for gas injection 150 days for gas recovery and 15 days for balance the construction of gas storage will be carried out in two phases the first phase of the project is mainly deployed high and medium capacity areas in the northern at present the construction of the first phase project facilities and the first cycle operation have been completed and the construction of the second phase project is under construction the formation water salinity changes from 24 to 30 104 mg l in the wen23 gas field which belongs to high salinity water salt deposition was not found in wen23 gas field at the initial stage of production and salt deposition in wen23 gas field was gradually exposed with the decrease of formation pressure the phenomenon of salt formation and blockage occurred on a large scale in the late stage of gas field development this seriously affects the normal development of gas fields for the wen23 ugs with high salinity formation water the risk of salt deposition may be more serious than in the gas reservoir development stage therefore it is of great significance to analyze the impact of salt deposition on reservoir petrophysical properties 3 experimental materials and experimental methods 3 1 experimental materials the experimental materials mainly include cores of the wen23 ugs gas and formation water due to the large amount of formation water required in the experiment compound formation water samples were used to replace the actual formation water some of the experimental cores were subjected to x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffraction is based on crystal lattice subject to certain conditions there are diffraction maxima corresponding to the bragg equation due to the difference of mineral composition the x ray intensity and position are different which can be used for material mineral analysis and content detection the first step is to grind the core fig 4 a then screened using a 200 mesh screen fig 4b and the resulting samples were sorted fig 4c finally the core composition was analyzed with x ray powder diffractometer fig 4d according to sandstone reservoir classification standard table 1 wen23 gas reservoir can be divided into three types type i reservoir porosity 15 permeability 10 md the porosity of type ii reservoir is between 10 and 15 and the permeability is between 1 and 10 md the reservoirs with porosity 10 and permeability 1 md belong to type iii among them type i and type ii reservoirs are conventional reservoirs which can be developed by conventional means the core porosity and permeability are measured by meter for porosity permeability fig 5 b the plunger core fig 5a was placed in the core holder fig 5c of the meter for porosity permeability 3 2 experimental methods salt deposition experiment of ugs includes dynamic experiment and static experiment dynamic experiments mainly include a core flooding experiment the core initial water saturation is established and the core porosity and permeability under initial water saturation are measured as the initial porosity and permeability the core is placed in a core holder flooded by formation water with different salinity then natural gas floods the formation water to establish core initial water saturation conditions the cores porosity and permeability are measured after drying the static experiment mainly includes nmr sem and eds the nmr core measurement is mainly used to measure the relaxation characteristics of h containing fluid in rock pores in the detection of saturated hydrogen fluid in rock pores the amplitude of hydrogen proton relaxation time is proportional to the pore size of the formation bai et al n d the sem is characterized by several major features including a spatial resolution in secondary electron mode on solid specimens which can exceed 1 nm on a routine basis an incident probe current density of the order of 106 a cm2 and the ability to maintain these levels of performance over an accelerating voltage range of from 1 to 30 kev joy 1991 a dynamic experiments dynamic experiments include core flooding experiment and core drying experiment the connection of experimental equipment is shown in fig 6 n2 is used to check air tightness after the equipment is connected the experimental temperature 120 is the actual formation temperature to simulate the real formation conditions the experiment steps are as follows 1 the cores are put into the core holder the confining pressure is set to 38 mpa formation pressure and the environment temperature is set to 120 formation temperature the brine is used to flood the core which is composed of real formation water ions the core is flooded by gas to establish core initial water saturation conditions and then core porosity and permeability are measured as initial value 2 the cores need to be dried after flooding with deionized water 3 water samples with different salinity are prepared based on field formation water water samples are then poured into intermediate containers 4 water with different salinity is used to flood the core and natural gas is used to displace water to establish initial water saturation conditions within cores 5 porosity and permeability were measured after core drying the effect of water evaporation on core properties can be obtained 6 the water salinity is 1 105 mg l 2 105 mg l and 3 105 mg l and steps 2 to 5 can be repeated by three times to analyze the change of porosity and permeability after salt deposition b static experiments the experiment steps are as follows 1 after core porosity and permeability are measured saturated water is used to avoid the dissolution of salt crystals deposited in the core the nmr experiments is further performed on the cores 2 after the dynamic experiment the sem eds experiments are carried out on the positions of salt crystal deposition in the cores 4 results and discussions this work firstly analyzes the properties of the rock and formation water the impact of salt deposition on the reservoir is analyzed by dynamic and static experiments the dynamic experiments are conducted to analyze the effect of salt deposition on permeability and porosity finally the mechanism of salt deposition is discussed during the production process of the ugs 4 1 properties of rock formation water salt scale and gas the compositions were divided according to the triangulation diagram of rock composition classification fig 7 these cores belong to lithic arkose and feldspathic the content of quartz is 75 and the content of feldspar and rock debris is between 25 and 75 some cores appear to be either low porosity with high permeability or high porosity with low permeability therefore the cores are classified according to porosity which is the most important indicator for the ugs storage capacity the experimental results show that fig 8 the core of the type i reservoir accounts for 15 the type ii accounts for 40 and the type iii with poor properties only accounts for 30 nine cores are selected to perform the dynamic experiments and the specific properties of core samples are shown in the table 2 the ionic composition of filtered water samples can be determined using routine ion chromatography analysis rica the total dissolved solid tds is about 301180 mg l belonging to a relatively high salinity water salt deposition is easy to occur during the multi cycle production the water type is nahco3 based on the surin classification method table 3 the salt scale samples obtained from the well a1 were dissolved in deionized water and analyzed by rica the salt scale is composed of na k cl and so4 2 the salt scale inside the wellbore is almost entirely composed of nacl 99 6 seen in table 4 the natural gas produced from wen23 ugs is mainly composed of ch4 97 13 n2 0 48 and co2 0 33 table 5 therefore a mixture of ch4 n2 and co2 is used as the injection gas in the experiments in addition the gas purity is higher than 99 99 high purity nitrogen is also used to measure porosity and permeability of core samples the effect of salt deposition on core petrophysical properties is analyzed based on the porosity and permeability of cores before and after dynamic experiments 4 2 effects of salt deposition on permeability and porosity the permeability of core samples before and after salt deposition are tested to compare the effect of water evaporation under different salinity on permeability as shown in fig 9 a to 9i the core permeability is enhanced after water evaporation compared to initial water saturation conditions increased by 33 to 162 for 100000 mg l 22 to 155 for 200000 mg l and 5 to 151 for 300000 mg l it s found that the average incremental degree of permeability changes from 68 to 58 and further 39 when formation water salinity increases from 100000 mg l to 200000 mg l and 300000 mg l the incremental degree of permeability decreases more with higher salinity and higher permeability under initial conditions since the core with higher permeability is easier to be saturated by formation water fig 9j the initial water saturation increases with the increase of core permeability more salt crystals are left in the high permeability cores after evaporation of high salinity water these salt crystals block the gas flow channel in the porous media c incremental degree of permeability after water evaporation under different salinity to analyze the impact of water evaporation under different salinity on porosity the porosity of core samples before and after salt deposition are obtained as shown from fig 10 a to 10i the porosity after water evaporation with different salinity is improved compared to the initial water saturation conditions increased by 45 to 122 for 100000 mg l 34 to 106 for 200000 mg l and 13 to 94 for 300000 mg l the core porosity under initial water saturation conditions is minimal due to the presence of water phase the core porosity is increased by an average value of 66 53 and 42 when the formation water salinity is 100000 mg l 200000 mg l and 300000 mg l the blocking effect of salt crystals in the core is significantly lighter than that of the initial water after the water evaporation the incremental degree of porosity decreases more with higher salinity and higher porosity fig 10j however the incremental degree of porosity is generally lower than the incremental degree of permeability in the same core shown in fig 7 d incremental degree of porosity after water evaporation under different salinity in general water evaporation in the reservoir can enhance formation permeability and porosity without formation water supply the impact of salt crystal deposition cannot be ignored when the formation water salinity is high although salt crystal deposition poses some problems for natural gas injection and production water evaporation may increase the working gas volume during multi cycle production of ugs the improved storage volume can be calculated based on the increase of porosity and drying radius of the gas well during the production of the ugs in order to observe the salt crystals on the core fig 11 presents images of core 4 after water evaporation under different salinity there are no salt crystals on the core under the initial conditions fig 11a the white salt crystals can be gradually observed on the core with the increase of the water salinity fig 11b and 11c when the water salinity reaches 300000 mg l the core is almost covered with salt crystals fig 11d 4 3 effects of salt deposition on pore structure nmr can be used to analyze the features of pore structure since the pore size of cores increases with the increase of transverse relaxation time t2 there are one or two peaks in the t2 distribution spectrum of different cores fig 12 core 4 and core 9 with high porosity show two peaks due to strong heterogeneity and core 2 with low porosity shows one peak the peak of core 2 appears near 10 ms in the initial conditions and the peak of core 2 gradually shifts to the left with the increase of salinity finally the peak of core 2 appears near 6 ms the two peaks of core 4 and core 9 appear around 3 ms and 60 ms the peak on the right side of the core 4 and core 9 changed from 60 ms to 30 ms during the last measurement while the peak on the left side remained almost unchanged the reason is that salt deposition usually occurs in larger pores in general with the increase of salt crystals deposited inside the core the average pore radius of the sample gradually decreases from the initial conditions to the first salt deposition 100000 mg l and the effect of salt deposition on the pore structure is the most obvious 4 4 the size and morphology of salt crystals sem is applied to understand the micro feature of salt crystals as shown in fig 13 most of salt crystals are scattered inside the core the images show that the sizes of salt crystals are between 1 μm and 5 μm the aggregated salt crystals can be seen in fig 11f while irregular salt crystals are found in fig 13a 13b 13c 13d and 13e the eds results show that salt is nacl crystal which is the same as the salt scale components in wen23 ugs the irregular salt crystals have limited impact on core physical properties however the aggregated salt crystals form in the reservoir with water evaporation if the aggregated salt crystals are formed in narrow pore throat this will seriously affect the flow ability of gas for the ugs this phenomenon is more pronounced in the near well in the process of gas well production a pressure drop funnel will be formed near wellbore the gas in the reservoir will flow from the far end to the bottom of the well at the same time the flow of natural gas accelerates the evaporation of formation water which leads to supersaturation of ions in formation water resulting in salting out and injury therefore salt deposition in the ugs should be paid attention to 4 5 salt deposition mechanism of the ugs ugs is a kind of artificial gas field which formed by re injecting commercial natural gas the formation water will be evaporated by the injected dry gas and the multi cycle injection and production of ugs will cause the salt deposition the injection and production process of ugs is shown in fig 14 the salt deposition during multi cycle injection and production of ugs can be divided into four stages including the initial status before gas injection and production stage 1 water saturation declining stage stage 2 salt deposition stage stage 3 and reservoir drying stage stage 4 the schematic diagram of salt deposition during four stages is shown in fig 15 stage 1 the ugs has not been operated in this stage taking wen23 ugs as an example the initial water saturation of the reservoir is between 33 and 55 the formation water salinity is not saturated and there is no salt deposition in the porous media stage 2 the salinity of the remaining formation water is gradually increased due to the loss of condensate water by water evaporation during the development process of the ugs however the formation water is still not saturated and there is no salt deposition in the formation in the stage 2 the gas storage and production capacity of ugs is enhanced due to the reduction of water saturation stage 3 the formation water salinity is significantly enhanced in the later stage of the ugs due to further water evaporation when the formation water becomes saturated salt crystals begin to deposit in the pores meanwhile the volume of deposited salt is less than the volume of evaporated water the gas storage and production capacity still be further improved compared to stage 2 stage 4 after the multi cycle injection and production of the ugs the formation water is completely evaporated and the salt from the formation water is left in the pores the core permeability is increased by an average of 68 100000 mg l 58 200000 mg l 39 300000 mg l compared to stage 1 for wen23 ugs the porosity of all cores is increased by an average of 66 65 100000 mg l 53 23 200000 mg l and 42 68 300000 mg l the salt crystals remain in the pores rather than being carried away by the gas although the deposited salt crystals may reduce the gas flow ability and gas storage capacity the gas flow ability and gas storage capacity can be improved compared with the initial formation conditions after the reservoir is completely dried bottom hole pressure should be controlled to avoid serious salt deposition due to excessive pressure differential layers with high water saturation and aquifers should not be perforated to avoid the production of moveable water these measures can effectively prevent water intrusion the effect of water evaporation and salt deposition will be positive without movable water 5 conclusions in this work dynamic and static experiments are performed to simulate the multi cycle gas injection and production of the ugs to understand the impact of salt deposition on petrophysical properties and pore structure 1 the core permeability is increased by an average of 68 100000 mg l 58 200000 mg l 39 300000 mg l compared to initial water saturation conditions the porosity of all cores increased by an average of 66 65 100000 mg l 53 23 200000 mg l and 42 68 300000 mg l water evaporation helps ugs to improve gas storage capacity without new formation water replenishment and the improvement of gas storage capacity decreases with the increase of formation water salinity 2 salt crystals in the reservoir are mainly deposited in large pores and the average pore radius decreases with the increase of water salinity with the increase of salt crystals deposited inside the core the average pore radius gradually decreases from the initial conditions to the first salt deposition 100000 mg l the peak offset and peak area change the most 3 the salt crystals in the core can be divided into two forms dispersion and aggregation form the salt crystal in dispersed form accounts for the most and the salt crystal size ranged from 1 μm to 5 μm salt crystals with aggregate form have a significant effect on gas flow channel but this type of salt crystals is rare 4 this work divides the salt deposition of the ugs into four stages including the initial status before gas injection and production water saturation declining stage salt deposition stage and reservoir drying stage without formation water supply the gas flow ability and gas storage capacity can be improved compared with the initial formation conditions after the reservoir is completely dried 5 this work focuses on the change of physical properties pore structure and salt crystal morphology after evaporation under initial water saturation if there is no replenishment of formation water in the reservoir the effect of water evaporation and salt deposition on ugs production and operation may be positive if there is moveable water in the reservoir the effect will be negative with the accumulation of salt the impact of movable water and rock wettability on salt deposition can be considered in the future this work can provide an effective method to investigate the impact of salt deposition caused by formation water evaporation on the petrophysical properties fluid flow ability and gas storage capacity of both the ugs and co2 geological storage credit authorship contribution statement yong tang resources

2414,during the production process of underground gas storage ugs with high salinity formation water salt deposition has been observed due to formation water evaporation this work aims at understanding the effect of salt deposition on petrophysical properties and pore structure firstly dynamic and static experiments are carried out to simulate the multi cycle gas injection and production of the ugs based on the core plugs rock debris and water from wen23 gas field secondly nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scan electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectrum eds are applied to investigate the change of pore structure and salt crystal morphology results indicate that the core permeability and porosity after water evaporation are averagely increased by 39 to 68 and 42 to 66 respectively compared with the initial water saturation conditions under different water salinity salt crystals in the reservoir are mainly deposited in large pores the dispersed and aggregated salt crystals are observed and most salt crystals are between 1 μm and 5 μm in size thus formation water evaporation is beneficial to the improvement of reservoir petrophysical properties without formation water supplement this work provides an effective method to understand the impact of salt deposition caused by formation water evaporation on the petrophysical properties fluid flow

stable gas supply molikova et al 2022 plaat 2009 zhang et al 2020 at the end of 2020 there were 661 ugs facilities in operation worldwide the global working gas capacity 423 billion m3 is equivalent to 11 of the global gas demand world natural gas production was 3 85 trillion m3 in 2020 ugs is regarded as one of the world s leading methods of gas storage and peak shaving china s natural gas industry is in a phase of rapid growth braungardt et al 2019 zhu et al 2022 the problems of gas storage and seasonal peak shaving are becoming more and more prominent with the increase of natural gas demand and the acceleration of the construction of large long distance gas pipelines hence how to achieve a sustainable development of ugs business has become one of the major challenges facing china s natural gas industry at present about 75 of the world s ugs is built based on depleted reservoirs and the proportion of china s ugs based on reservoirs is higher than 90 zhang et al 2020 depleted oil gas reservoirs are favorable targets for ugs due to the good sealing and storage properties production wells in gas reservoirs occasionally experience rapid performance decline in many cases this behavior may be attributed to salt deposition in the near or within the wellbore for certain gas wells in the north sea salt accumulation has been indicated by mechanical wireline surveys fig 1 a and 1b bybee 2009 salt deposition occurs when the initial salinity of formation water is high andre et al 2014 peysson et al 2014 zeidouni et al 2009 causing security risks to the stable operation of ugs miri and hellevang 2016 ott et al 2015 ott et al 2021 zeidouni et al 2009 the formation salt deposition in the ugs is mainly affected by four factors including formation water evaporation alkan et al 2010 golghanddashti et al 2013 formation water salinity kim et al 2012 pressure and temperature tang and etzion 2004 the evaporation process will cause salt scale in porous media decreasing the porosity and permeability the core permeability decreases significantly when the initial water salinity is high jeddizahed and rostami 2016 miri et al 2014 miri et al 2015 spycher and pruess 2010 tang et al 2021a tang et al 2015 and the evaporation process is more serious under high temperature and low pressure giorgis et al 2007 at present the study of salt deposition in the ugs mainly focuses on the damage of salt crystallization to petrophysical properties experimental results indicated that porosity can be decreased by 14 6 and permeability can be decreased by 83 3 due to salt deposition tang et al 2015 however the study of salt deposition mainly focuses on the process of co2 geological sequestration li et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 experimental results show that core porosity is reduced by 3 5 and core permeability is reduced by 13 75 after injecting dry co2 bacci et al 2012 an on chip laboratory method was developed to analyze salt deposition dynamics during co2 sequestration resulting in approximately 20 of porosity reductions kim et al 2013 salt deposition under stratigraphic conditions is simulated by injecting co2 into sandstone samples which are fully saturated with nacl brine and the permeability and porosity were analyzed the results show that salt deposition became more serious with the increase of formation water salinity the core permeability decreases more obviously with the increase of gas volume during the process of gas injection jeddizahed and rostami 2016 the distribution of salt crystals in pores after the deposition of gas storage is also a key research field cui et al 2018 ott et al ott et al 2014 ott et al 2010 ott et al 2012 used ct scanning technology to scan the core after salt deposition in formation water and observed the migration of salt crystals in pores on a microscopic level however these studies mainly use fully dried cores as initial conditions in fact the core often has initial formation water and the change of pore structure by salt deposition is also unclear understanding the salt deposition characteristics in the ugs is significant for its efficient development in this work dynamic and static experiments under formation conditions are designed to simulate salt deposition during multi cycle injection and production of the ugs nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scan electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectrum eds are applied to analyze the change of pore structure and salt crystal morphology after salt deposition this work can help engineers understand effects of salt deposition on reservoir petrophysical properties in the ugs 2 background of the gas field wen23 gas field is located in wenliu town henan province the construction of wen23 gas field can achieve the natural gas peak adjustment in north china which is significant to improve the safety of natural gas supply the gas bearing strata are the fourth member of shahejie formation lower tertiary with depth of 2750 to 3120 m the gas bearing area is 11 76 km2 and the geological reserves of natural gas are 130 108 m3 the development process of wen23 gas field can be divided into five stages fig 2 including development preparation stage 1977 1987 increasing production stage 1988 1990 stable production stage 1990 2001 production adjustment stage 2002 2006 and production decline stage 2007 present wen96 ugs is located around wen23 ugs salt formation has been found in the wellbore of wen96 ugs since the fourth production cycle well c12 is located in the north of the wen96 ugs with high injection and production capacity well c12 was unable to inject gas when the fifth cycle began on june 2 2017 fig 3 the gas injection ability of well c12 was significantly improved after water washing was used to remove salt deposition a large amount of salt deposition in formation and wellbore made natural gas unable to be effectively injected and produced wen23 ugs has just completed its first production cycle and no obvious salt deposition has been detected however due to the large area of salt deposition in wen23 gas field the wellbore and reservoir of wen23 ugs are expected to face a higher risk of salt deposition than that in the gas field development stage wen23 gas field was rebuilt into an ugs in 2018 the maximum pressure is 38 mpa and the minimum pressure is 15 mpa the effective working gas volume is 57 108 m3 the maximum daily gas injection is 2 4 107 m3 and the maximum daily gas extraction is 4 107 m3 the operation cycle of the ugs is 200 days for gas injection 150 days for gas recovery and 15 days for balance the construction of gas storage will be carried out in two phases the first phase of the project is mainly deployed high and medium capacity areas in the northern at present the construction of the first phase project facilities and the first cycle operation have been completed and the construction of the second phase project is under construction the formation water salinity changes from 24 to 30 104 mg l in the wen23 gas field which belongs to high salinity water salt deposition was not found in wen23 gas field at the initial stage of production and salt deposition in wen23 gas field was gradually exposed with the decrease of formation pressure the phenomenon of salt formation and blockage occurred on a large scale in the late stage of gas field development this seriously affects the normal development of gas fields for the wen23 ugs with high salinity formation water the risk of salt deposition may be more serious than in the gas reservoir development stage therefore it is of great significance to analyze the impact of salt deposition on reservoir petrophysical properties 3 experimental materials and experimental methods 3 1 experimental materials the experimental materials mainly include cores of the wen23 ugs gas and formation water due to the large amount of formation water required in the experiment compound formation water samples were used to replace the actual formation water some of the experimental cores were subjected to x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffraction is based on crystal lattice subject to certain conditions there are diffraction maxima corresponding to the bragg equation due to the difference of mineral composition the x ray intensity and position are different which can be used for material mineral analysis and content detection the first step is to grind the core fig 4 a then screened using a 200 mesh screen fig 4b and the resulting samples were sorted fig 4c finally the core composition was analyzed with x ray powder diffractometer fig 4d according to sandstone reservoir classification standard table 1 wen23 gas reservoir can be divided into three types type i reservoir porosity 15 permeability 10 md the porosity of type ii reservoir is between 10 and 15 and the permeability is between 1 and 10 md the reservoirs with porosity 10 and permeability 1 md belong to type iii among them type i and type ii reservoirs are conventional reservoirs which can be developed by conventional means the core porosity and permeability are measured by meter for porosity permeability fig 5 b the plunger core fig 5a was placed in the core holder fig 5c of the meter for porosity permeability 3 2 experimental methods salt deposition experiment of ugs includes dynamic experiment and static experiment dynamic experiments mainly include a core flooding experiment the core initial water saturation is established and the core porosity and permeability under initial water saturation are measured as the initial porosity and permeability the core is placed in a core holder flooded by formation water with different salinity then natural gas floods the formation water to establish core initial water saturation conditions the cores porosity and permeability are measured after drying the static experiment mainly includes nmr sem and eds the nmr core measurement is mainly used to measure the relaxation characteristics of h containing fluid in rock pores in the detection of saturated hydrogen fluid in rock pores the amplitude of hydrogen proton relaxation time is proportional to the pore size of the formation bai et al n d the sem is characterized by several major features including a spatial resolution in secondary electron mode on solid specimens which can exceed 1 nm on a routine basis an incident probe current density of the order of 106 a cm2 and the ability to maintain these levels of performance over an accelerating voltage range of from 1 to 30 kev joy 1991 a dynamic experiments dynamic experiments include core flooding experiment and core drying experiment the connection of experimental equipment is shown in fig 6 n2 is used to check air tightness after the equipment is connected the experimental temperature 120 is the actual formation temperature to simulate the real formation conditions the experiment steps are as follows 1 the cores are put into the core holder the confining pressure is set to 38 mpa formation pressure and the environment temperature is set to 120 formation temperature the brine is used to flood the core which is composed of real formation water ions the core is flooded by gas to establish core initial water saturation conditions and then core porosity and permeability are measured as initial value 2 the cores need to be dried after flooding with deionized water 3 water samples with different salinity are prepared based on field formation water water samples are then poured into intermediate containers 4 water with different salinity is used to flood the core and natural gas is used to displace water to establish initial water saturation conditions within cores 5 porosity and permeability were measured after core drying the effect of water evaporation on core properties can be obtained 6 the water salinity is 1 105 mg l 2 105 mg l and 3 105 mg l and steps 2 to 5 can be repeated by three times to analyze the change of porosity and permeability after salt deposition b static experiments the experiment steps are as follows 1 after core porosity and permeability are measured saturated water is used to avoid the dissolution of salt crystals deposited in the core the nmr experiments is further performed on the cores 2 after the dynamic experiment the sem eds experiments are carried out on the positions of salt crystal deposition in the cores 4 results and discussions this work firstly analyzes the properties of the rock and formation water the impact of salt deposition on the reservoir is analyzed by dynamic and static experiments the dynamic experiments are conducted to analyze the effect of salt deposition on permeability and porosity finally the mechanism of salt deposition is discussed during the production process of the ugs 4 1 properties of rock formation water salt scale and gas the compositions were divided according to the triangulation diagram of rock composition classification fig 7 these cores belong to lithic arkose and feldspathic the content of quartz is 75 and the content of feldspar and rock debris is between 25 and 75 some cores appear to be either low porosity with high permeability or high porosity with low permeability therefore the cores are classified according to porosity which is the most important indicator for the ugs storage capacity the experimental results show that fig 8 the core of the type i reservoir accounts for 15 the type ii accounts for 40 and the type iii with poor properties only accounts for 30 nine cores are selected to perform the dynamic experiments and the specific properties of core samples are shown in the table 2 the ionic composition of filtered water samples can be determined using routine ion chromatography analysis rica the total dissolved solid tds is about 301180 mg l belonging to a relatively high salinity water salt deposition is easy to occur during the multi cycle production the water type is nahco3 based on the surin classification method table 3 the salt scale samples obtained from the well a1 were dissolved in deionized water and analyzed by rica the salt scale is composed of na k cl and so4 2 the salt scale inside the wellbore is almost entirely composed of nacl 99 6 seen in table 4 the natural gas produced from wen23 ugs is mainly composed of ch4 97 13 n2 0 48 and co2 0 33 table 5 therefore a mixture of ch4 n2 and co2 is used as the injection gas in the experiments in addition the gas purity is higher than 99 99 high purity nitrogen is also used to measure porosity and permeability of core samples the effect of salt deposition on core petrophysical properties is analyzed based on the porosity and permeability of cores before and after dynamic experiments 4 2 effects of salt deposition on permeability and porosity the permeability of core samples before and after salt deposition are tested to compare the effect of water evaporation under different salinity on permeability as shown in fig 9 a to 9i the core permeability is enhanced after water evaporation compared to initial water saturation conditions increased by 33 to 162 for 100000 mg l 22 to 155 for 200000 mg l and 5 to 151 for 300000 mg l it s found that the average incremental degree of permeability changes from 68 to 58 and further 39 when formation water salinity increases from 100000 mg l to 200000 mg l and 300000 mg l the incremental degree of permeability decreases more with higher salinity and higher permeability under initial conditions since the core with higher permeability is easier to be saturated by formation water fig 9j the initial water saturation increases with the increase of core permeability more salt crystals are left in the high permeability cores after evaporation of high salinity water these salt crystals block the gas flow channel in the porous media c incremental degree of permeability after water evaporation under different salinity to analyze the impact of water evaporation under different salinity on porosity the porosity of core samples before and after salt deposition are obtained as shown from fig 10 a to 10i the porosity after water evaporation with different salinity is improved compared to the initial water saturation conditions increased by 45 to 122 for 100000 mg l 34 to 106 for 200000 mg l and 13 to 94 for 300000 mg l the core porosity under initial water saturation conditions is minimal due to the presence of water phase the core porosity is increased by an average value of 66 53 and 42 when the formation water salinity is 100000 mg l 200000 mg l and 300000 mg l the blocking effect of salt crystals in the core is significantly lighter than that of the initial water after the water evaporation the incremental degree of porosity decreases more with higher salinity and higher porosity fig 10j however the incremental degree of porosity is generally lower than the incremental degree of permeability in the same core shown in fig 7 d incremental degree of porosity after water evaporation under different salinity in general water evaporation in the reservoir can enhance formation permeability and porosity without formation water supply the impact of salt crystal deposition cannot be ignored when the formation water salinity is high although salt crystal deposition poses some problems for natural gas injection and production water evaporation may increase the working gas volume during multi cycle production of ugs the improved storage volume can be calculated based on the increase of porosity and drying radius of the gas well during the production of the ugs in order to observe the salt crystals on the core fig 11 presents images of core 4 after water evaporation under different salinity there are no salt crystals on the core under the initial conditions fig 11a the white salt crystals can be gradually observed on the core with the increase of the water salinity fig 11b and 11c when the water salinity reaches 300000 mg l the core is almost covered with salt crystals fig 11d 4 3 effects of salt deposition on pore structure nmr can be used to analyze the features of pore structure since the pore size of cores increases with the increase of transverse relaxation time t2 there are one or two peaks in the t2 distribution spectrum of different cores fig 12 core 4 and core 9 with high porosity show two peaks due to strong heterogeneity and core 2 with low porosity shows one peak the peak of core 2 appears near 10 ms in the initial conditions and the peak of core 2 gradually shifts to the left with the increase of salinity finally the peak of core 2 appears near 6 ms the two peaks of core 4 and core 9 appear around 3 ms and 60 ms the peak on the right side of the core 4 and core 9 changed from 60 ms to 30 ms during the last measurement while the peak on the left side remained almost unchanged the reason is that salt deposition usually occurs in larger pores in general with the increase of salt crystals deposited inside the core the average pore radius of the sample gradually decreases from the initial conditions to the first salt deposition 100000 mg l and the effect of salt deposition on the pore structure is the most obvious 4 4 the size and morphology of salt crystals sem is applied to understand the micro feature of salt crystals as shown in fig 13 most of salt crystals are scattered inside the core the images show that the sizes of salt crystals are between 1 μm and 5 μm the aggregated salt crystals can be seen in fig 11f while irregular salt crystals are found in fig 13a 13b 13c 13d and 13e the eds results show that salt is nacl crystal which is the same as the salt scale components in wen23 ugs the irregular salt crystals have limited

gas in the reservoir will flow from the far end to the bottom of the well at the same time the flow of natural gas accelerates the evaporation of formation water which leads to supersaturation of ions in formation water resulting in salting out and injury therefore salt deposition in the ugs should be paid attention to 4 5 salt deposition mechanism of the ugs ugs is a kind of artificial gas field which formed by re injecting commercial natural gas the formation water will be evaporated by the injected dry gas and the multi cycle injection and production of ugs will cause the salt deposition the injection and production process of ugs is shown in fig 14 the salt deposition during multi cycle injection and production of ugs can be divided into four stages including the initial status before gas injection and production stage 1 water saturation declining stage stage 2 salt deposition stage stage 3 and reservoir drying stage stage 4 the schematic diagram of salt deposition during four stages is shown in fig 15 stage 1 the ugs has not been operated in this stage taking wen23 ugs as an example the initial water saturation of the reservoir is between 33 and 55 the formation water salinity is not saturated and there is no salt deposition in the porous media stage 2 the salinity of the remaining formation water is gradually increased due to the loss of condensate water by water evaporation during the development process of the ugs however the formation water is still not saturated and there is no salt deposition in the formation in the stage 2 the gas storage and production capacity of ugs is enhanced due to the reduction of water saturation stage 3 the formation water salinity is significantly enhanced in the later stage of the ugs due to further water evaporation when the formation water becomes saturated salt crystals begin to deposit in the pores meanwhile the volume of deposited salt is less than the volume of evaporated water the gas storage and production capacity still be further improved compared to stage 2 stage 4 after the multi cycle injection and production of the ugs the formation water is completely evaporated and the salt from the formation water is left in the pores the core permeability is increased by an average of 68 100000 mg l 58 200000 mg l 39 300000 mg l compared to stage 1 for wen23 ugs the porosity of all cores is increased by an average of 66 65 100000 mg l 53 23 200000 mg l and 42 68 300000 mg l the salt crystals remain in the pores rather than being carried away by the gas although the deposited salt crystals may reduce the gas flow ability and gas storage capacity the gas flow ability and gas storage capacity can be improved compared with the initial formation conditions after the reservoir is completely dried bottom hole pressure should be controlled to avoid serious salt deposition due to excessive pressure differential layers with high water saturation and aquifers should not be perforated to avoid the production of moveable water these measures can effectively prevent water intrusion the effect of water evaporation and salt deposition will be positive without movable water 5 conclusions in this work dynamic and static experiments are performed to simulate the multi cycle gas injection and production of the ugs to understand the impact of salt deposition on petrophysical properties and pore structure 1 the core permeability is increased by an average of 68 100000 mg l 58 200000 mg l 39 300000 mg l compared to initial water saturation conditions the porosity of all cores increased by an average of 66 65 100000 mg l 53 23 200000 mg l and 42 68 300000 mg l water evaporation helps ugs to improve gas storage capacity without new formation water replenishment and the improvement of gas storage capacity decreases with the increase of formation water salinity 2 salt crystals in the reservoir are mainly deposited in large pores and the average pore radius decreases with the increase of water salinity with the increase of salt crystals deposited inside the core the average pore radius gradually decreases from the initial conditions to the first salt deposition 100000 mg l the peak offset and peak area change the most 3 the salt crystals in the core can be divided into two forms dispersion and aggregation form the salt crystal in dispersed form accounts for the most and the salt crystal size ranged from 1 μm to 5 μm salt crystals with aggregate form have a significant effect on gas flow channel but this type of salt crystals is rare 4 this work divides the salt deposition of the ugs into four stages including the initial status before gas injection and production water saturation declining stage salt deposition stage and reservoir drying stage without formation water supply the gas flow ability and gas storage capacity can be improved compared with the initial formation conditions after the reservoir is completely dried 5 this work focuses on the change of physical properties pore structure and salt crystal morphology after evaporation under initial water saturation if there is no replenishment of formation water in the reservoir the effect of water evaporation and salt deposition on ugs production and operation may be positive if there is moveable water in the reservoir the effect will be negative with the accumulation of salt the impact of movable water and rock wettability on salt deposition can be considered in the future this work can provide an effective method to investigate the impact of salt deposition caused by formation water evaporation on the petrophysical properties fluid flow ability and gas storage capacity of both the ugs and co2 geological storage credit authorship contribution statement yong tang resources
