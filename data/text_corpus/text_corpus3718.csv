18590,the sulfur bioconversion associated processes sbap for sewage treatment have been extensively reported so far in this study biological thiosulfate reduction btr driven biotechnology for high rate sulfidogenesis and organic removal was explored to further close the gap of our knowledge on the sulfur cycle based sewage treatment bioprocess with thiosulfate as the electron acceptor the sulfidogenic rate in the uasb rector is 105 6 mg s l h with the sludge yield of only 0 044 g mlvss g codsubstrate thus providing sufficient electron donors or chemical sources i e hs for the downstream autotrophic denitrification or for the cost effective heavy metal precipitation thiosulfate disproportionation was not observed in btr reactor high throughput pyrosequencing analysis reveals that desulfobulbus and desulfomicrobium are the predominant thiosulfate reducing genera and the thiosulfate disproportionation bacteria were at much lower genus level the specific thiosulfate reducer i e dethiosulfatibacter which could utilize thiosulfate but not sulfate as the electron acceptor was also identified batch testing results indicate that the sulfidogenic activity on thiosulfate was 1 5 times that on sulfate the optimal ph for btr activity was between 7 0 and 8 0 a typical ph range of the municipal sewage thiosulfate can be efficiently recovered in the sulfide driven denitritation reactor enriched with abundant sulfide oxidizing genera mainly including thiobacillus and sulfurimonas finally a conceptual model of the sulfur cycle based on the

in addition to carbon dioxide generating excessive waste activated sludge was and linking to issue of the global climate change wan et al 2016 therefore the energy efficient sewage treatment processes with minimal sludge production have been developed in the last two decades among which the sulfur bioconversion associated process sbap is one of the representative inventions for both domestic sewage and metal laden industrial wastewater treatments wang et al 2009 gopi kiran et al 2017 the was could be minimized in this process mainly due to the low biomass yields of both biological sulfate reduction bsr to sulfide for organic removal in stage a and sulfide based autotrophic denitrification for biological nitrogen removal in stage b qian et al 2019a 2019b sun et al 2018 for example the large scaled sbap has been demonstrated to reduce approximately 70 biowastes production in the sulfate rich saline sewage treatment in the coast region wu et al 2016 however sulfate is always deficient in most of the fresh sewage in inland areas hindering its broad application for sludge minimization qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 thiosulfate s2o3 2 is a rather bioavailable sulfur specie and could induce high bacterial activities zhang et al 2017 most of sulfate reducing bacteria srb could utilize thiosulfate as the respiratory electron acceptor in the anaerobic environment zeng et al 2019 from the perspective of electron transfer in biochemical reaction biological thiosulfate reduction btr requires half of electrons compared with sulfate reduction eqs 1 and 2 implying a more rapid sulfidogenesis and shorter start up period in sulfidogenic reactor liang et al 2014 although btr has been reported to play an essential role in the sulfur cycle of geological and marine environments ravot et al 1995 stoffels et al 2011 no information on thiosulfate as an electron acceptor to facilitate the sbap application is available its application may be extended to the treatment of metal laden wastewater via sulfide precipitation eq 3 such as acid mine drainage amd due to the enrichment of sulfide producers under thiosulfate reducing condition lee et al 2011 on the other hand thiosulfate disproportionation to sulfate and sulfide was observed in both the pure and mixed cultures without the organic consumption qian et al 2015a cypionka et al 1998 leading to the deterioration of organic removal capacity in btr thus a thorough examination of btr using organic carbon as the electron donor with the possible occurrence of thiosulfate disproportionation is deserved with these overall considerations as well as the above potential benefits and drawbacks of btr in view we are motived to employ thiosulfate as the electron acceptor in the sbap for organic and nitrogen removal in the fresh sewage treatment and potential heavy metal removal from the metal laden industrial wastewater 1 ch3coo s2o3 2 h2o 2hs 2hco3 h 2 ch3coo so4 2 hs 2hco3 3 me2 hs mes h two bench scaled up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors namely sulfidogenic uasb s uasb and denitrifying uasb d uasb and a heavy metal precipitator were established we mainly aim to 1 evaluate the sulfidogenic capacity and the sludge yield of btr in the s uasb reactor and the btr based biological nitrogen removal bnr performance in the d uasb reactor 2 explore the microbial community structures with the main focuses on the genera driving the btr and btr based bnr respectively 3 assess the btr application for the heavy metal removal the sulfidogenic activities between sulfate and thiosulfate reductions are compared although thiosulfate is not available in the wastewater a new sulfur cycle based on the continuous biotransformation between thiosulfate and sulfide is demonstrated in this study for the thiosulfate recovery and sustainable low sludge yield sewage treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 operating of the btr based system both s uasb and d uasb reactors were made of transparent plexiglass to facilitate the observations of the morphology of bio aggregates height of the sludge blanket and possible occurrence of sludge floatation stratification the configurations of two bioreactors can be seen in fig 1 the fresh synthetic domestic wastewater composition in table s1 and analytical grade sodium thiosulfate solution were prepared on a daily base they were preserved separately in two sterilized bulks under 4 c and fed to the s uasb reactor by two peristaltic pumps longerpump bt100 2j the seeding sludge originated from a sulfate reducing anaerobic sequential batch reactor sbr and was cultivated for more than four months 500 ml mixed liquor was transferred from sbr to s uasb reactor resulted in the initial biomass concentration of 9 2 g mlvss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids l the ph of influent was adjusted to 7 8 0 2 by 6 m hcl naoh solutions and the temperature was controlled at 25 0 1 0 c in an air conditioning room influent carbonaceous chemical oxygen demand cod and thiosulfate concentrations were 350 mg cod l a typical cod level of municipal sewage in china and equivalent to about 130 mg toc l and 500 mg s2o3 2 s l respectively the ratio of cod to s2o3 2 s 0 7 could ensure the complete organic compound removal according to stoichiometry see eq 1 the entire operation period of btr based system consists of four different phases in phases i and ii s uasb reactor was operated alone to examine the sulfidogenic performances the hrt was set to 5 h in phase i day 0 51 and reduced to the half in phase ii day 52 102 in phase iii day 103 167 the btr based autotrophic denitrification ad for bnr was evaluated the d uasb reactor inoculated with autotrophic denitrifying bacterial rich anoxic sludge was operated and connected with the s uasb reactor the synthetic sodium nitrite solution at the concentration of 120 mg n l was supplemented as the nitrogen source and electron acceptor for ad while the electron donor was mainly the sulfide from the s uasb reactor s effluent the ratio of influent flow rates of s uasb reactor s effluent to synthetic nitrite solution is 1 1 so the actual influent nitrite concentration of d uasb reactor is 60 mg n l during the two uasb reactor s operation samples from both influent and effluent were withdrawn regularly subjected to the analysis of total organic carbon toc thiosulfate sulfide sulfate and nitrite in phase iv day 168 196 the application of btr for the heavy metal removal recovery in acid mine drainage amd was assessed the ph of the real amd normally ranged from 2 7 to 4 3 sahinkaya et al 2011 while the sulfidogenic activity dropped dramatically when ph decreases to 6 0 reflected by the batch test result of ph effect on btr in section 3 6 so a two stage metal removal system was established and constitutes of a chemical precipitation compartment and a biological sulfidogenic compartment shown in fig s1 the s uasb reactor was disconnected with d uasb reactor and posterior to the chemical precipitator for synergistic metal removal the operating conditions of the s uasb reactor were the same with those in phases ii and iii the metals in synthetic amd consist of fe cu co mn pb and zn table s2 each proportion was referred to bekmezcia et al 2011 2 2 batch assays batch assays were performed to assess 1 sulfidogenic activities with different electron acceptors including s2o3 2 and so4 2 2 btr activities under different ph conditions the organic fermentation acidification and sulfidogenesis driven mineralization always co participated in the biological sulfur reduction jiang et al 2013 in order to examine the organic abatement only associated with sulfidogenesis acetate the major organic component of the s uasb reactor s feeding and a simple organic matter which can be directly degraded into inorganic carbon coupled with sulfidogenesis by srb was selected as the organic source in the batch experiment qian et al 2019a the analytical graded nitrogen gas was purged into each reactor for at least 30 min to maintain the oxygen free conditions before the following tests 2 2 1 sulfidogenic activities with different electron acceptors at the end of s uasb reactor s operation in phase ii the anaerobic sludge was withdrawn for the batch testing two reactors 2 l flask were established and operated in parallel in batch test i the mixed cultures were withdrawn from s uasb reactor given that the s usab reactor was fed with thiosulfate as the sulfur source the mixed cultures may not adapt to sulfate reducing conditions immediately hence prior to the batch assay the two reactors were operated in sequential batch reactor sbr mode for more than two months for the biomass acclimation to each sulfur source the details of the biomass acclimatization could be found in si 1 in the supplementary information analytical graded sodium acetate was dosed in each reactor obtaining initial toc concentration of about 95 mg l and the initial sulfur s2o3 2 so4 2 concentrations were 100 mg s l in both rectors the ph of each reactor was conditioned at 7 5 0 2 by na2hpo4 nah2po4 buffer solution and the temperature was controlled at 25 0 1 0 c in the air conditioning room the initial biomass concentrations were approximately 600 mg mlvss l both reactors were sealed tightly with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals the batch assay lasts for 48 h 2 2 2 btr under different ph conditions ph is one of the key factors directly affecting the sulfidogenic activities qian et al 2015b it also determines the ionization of h2s which is generally a true inhibitor of microbial respirations instead of the ionized hs and s2 pan et al 2013 for example under 25 c the proportion of h2s to the total dissolved sulfide tds h2s hs s2 declines from 90 to 10 as ph increases from 6 0 to 8 0 so ph effect on btr activity was assessed in batch test ii four batch reactors were operated in parallel with ph controlled at 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 by na2hpo4 nah2po4 buffer solution initial acetate and s2o3 2 concentrations were 56 mg toc l 150 mg cod l and 100 mg s l respectively so the organic sufficient condition was created in all the reactors for the complete thiosulfate reduction to sulfide the batch test lasted for 24 h during the batch experiment mixed liquor samples from the abovementioned batch reactors were taken at a predetermined time interval through a 10 ml syringe then the samples were immediately filtrated through disposable millipore filters 0 22 μm pore size for chemical analysis thiosulfate sulfate sulfide and acetate were measured within 4 h the batch test results were reported as the average of the triplicate with the standard deviation below 5 the sulfidogenic activities in the two batch tests were expressed as the biomass specific sulfide generation rate mg s g mlvss h which was determined from the linear regression of sulfide concentrations mg s l versus time hour and normalized by the biomass concentration g mlvss l 2 3 chemical physical analysis thiosulfate sulfate nitrite and acetate were detected with an ion chromatograph dionex 900 sulfide measurement was undertaken according to the methylene blue method after the sample pretreatment with naoh and znac apha 2005 total organic carbon toc was analyzed by a toc analyzer shimadzu 5000a because of disturbance of sulfide and thiosulfate on cod measurement cod concentrations were converted from toc concentrations i e 2 67 g cod equivalent to 1 g toc poinapen et al 2007 each metal concentration was quantified by a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 990 purkinje beijing china ph and temperature were monitored with a ph meter phsj 4f mlss and mlvss concentrations were measured following the standard methods apha 2005 mixed liquor sludge samples were periodically taken from the three layers of the s uasb reactor i e bottom middle and top layers and properly mixed with equal volume before measuring the biomass concentrations g mlss l and g mlvss l the sludge yield g mlvss g cod of s uasb reactor was determined accordingly and calculated as accumulative biomass growth rate g mlvss d derived from fig 2 d average cod removal rate g cod d average inf cod concentration average eff cod concentration flow rate 2 4 microbial community analysis microbial community analysis in both s uasb sample taken on day 102 and d uasb sample taken on day 167 reactors were performed via 16s rrna high throughput pyrosequencing the samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min and the centrifuged sludge were collected for dna extraction the detailed methods for genomic dna extraction 16s rrna amplification purification and pyrosequencing of amplicons as well as data analysis can be referred to the previous works qian et al 2015b su et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic removal and sulfidogenesis in s uasb reactor the s uasb reactor was continuously operated for 196 days in different operation statuses the reactor s performance in terms of organic removal and sulfide generation can be seen in fig 2a and b in phase i average toc removal efficiency achieved 92 under the sulfur sufficient condition resulted in the organic removal rate of 0 58 kg toc day m3 at hrt of 5 h the toc removal efficiency could still remain above 90 at steady state in the following phases ii iii and iv though the hrt was halved the long term test results confirm the feasibility and large organic removal capacity via implementing the btr driven biotechnology and average 276 and 264 mg s l of sulfide were detected in the effluent under the htr of 5 and 2 5 h respectively table s3 the sulfide generation rate was 105 6 mg s l h corresponding to the organic removal capacity of 1 16 kg toc d m3 under hrt of 2 5 h at the steady state compared to the sbap with other sulfurous species as the electron acceptor both higher sulfidogenic rate and organic removal capacity are demonstrated in btr see table s4 the produced sulfide the pka1 of h2s is 7 0 can almost be dissolved in the liquid phase in the primary form of hs as the effluent ph maintains above 8 5 see table s3 thereby mitigating the odor problem of the h2s volatilization and alleviating the toxicity of unionized h2s specie to the micro ecosystem vela et al 2018 although the gaseous h2s was not measured in this study its level was much less than the aqueous h2s in the anaerobic process and could be negligible compared with the tds in the aqueous phase liu et al 2018 the average mass ratio of toc removal to sulfide generation toc s2 is 0 44 a little higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 0 375 so thiosulfate reduction actually contributes to 85 i e 1 0 44 0 375 0 44 100 organic removal in the s uasb reactor in the absence of methanogens see the microbial community analysis results below the unexpectedly excessive organic consumption could be attributed to assimilation of organic carbon for the microbial anabolism we are also informed by the sulfur mass balance analysis that most of the influent thiosulfate was recovered by sulfide and thiosulfate with less than 20 mg s l of sulfate in the effluent fig s2 so negligible elemental sulfur was accumulated in the s uasb reactor these information also indicate that thiosulfate disproportionation would not occur during the thiosulfate reduction and the organic removal capacity were not negatively affected in the s uasb reactor 3 2 sludge production in s uasb reactor the sludge yield during the long term s uasb reactor s operation was calculated three parts were considered for the calculation i the net biomass growth in the s uasb reactor ii samples withdrawn from the reactor for sludge concentration measurements and microbial community analysis iii the biomass washout in the effluent the accumulative biomass growth rate and average cod removal rate are determined to be 0 1433 g mlvss d derived from figs 2d and 3 27 g cod d derived from fig 2a according to our result from day 58 196 with thiosulfate as the sole electron acceptor the actual biomass yield was 0 044 g mlvss g codsubstrate comparable with that in biological sulfate sulfite reduction 0 02 0 09 g mlvss g codsubstrate qian et al 2015c lu et al 2012 whereas the was production in cas process is as high as 0 41 g mlvss codsubstrate on average wei et al 2003 liu et al 2005 so the btr driven biotechnology inherits the characteristic of sludge minimization of the sbap reducing the greenhouse gas emission and saving the operation cost in the post sludge treatment 3 3 nitrite removal in d uasb reactor the s uasb reactor s effluent provided sufficient electron donors i e sulfide in the subsequent high rate ad reactor in phase iii as shown in fig s3a the nitrite could be efficiently removed via sulfide based denitritation in the d uasb reactor with the no2 removal efficiency of 93 6 on average at the end of phase iii compared with traditional heterotrophic denitrification hd this sulfide based ad could minimize the biowaste production and reduce n2o a major greenhouse gas exhibiting much higher global warming potential than co2 and ch4 generation yang et al 2016 sun and nemati 2012 the sulfur mass balance over the d uasb reactor was also conducted here most of the sulfurous species of the d uasb reactor s influent mainly sulfide were recovered as thiosulfate and sulfate in the effluent it is suggested that elemental sulfur was not accumulated in the reactor whereas thiosulfate presents a major sulfurous compound besides sulfate in the effluent fig s3b the finding is not in agreement with the results of nitrate denitrification where massive sulfide was converted to elemental sulfur coupled with nitrate reduction to nitrite reyes avila et al 2004 as shown in eq 4 as more free energy could be released in sulfide oxidation to thiosulfate than sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur eqs 5 and 6 it is reasonable that sulfide is more inclined to be oxidized to thiosulfate from the thermodynamic view so in denitritation nitrite from an aerobic nitritation reactor thiosulfate may be efficiently recovered as the final product of the sulfide oxidation and be recycled in anaerobic btr for high rate sulfidogenesis further discussions are presented in following parts 4 s2 no3 h2o s0 no2 2oh 2s2 1 34no2 5 34h 2s0 0 66n2 2 66h2o 5 δg0 480 6 kj

the lactococcus a fermentative bacteria was the most populated genus in the s uasb reactor with the relative abundance of 26 8 fig 3 a the complex organic compound which may not readily utilized by srb could be degraded by this genus into simple ones andersen et al 2002 the simple organics could be further converted to inorganic carbon coupled with btr by srb moreover another two fermentative genera i e carnobacterium and trichococcus accounted for 9 7 and 6 6 at the genus level respectively rabus et al 2013 collins et al 1987 the possible thiosulfate reducers are identified to be desulfobulbus and desulfomicrobium the species affiliated to these two genera are capable of using the s2o3 2 as the electron acceptor in the anaerobic sulfate reducing respiration chain barton and hamilton 2007 they were also the dominant srb groups in biological sulfate and sulfite reducing reactor qian et al 2015b in total the recognized srb accounts for 32 9 at the genus level the diversified and abundant srb genera in the s uasb reactor may also indicate the high sulfidogenic rate presented in section 3 1 it is also noteworthy that dethiosulfatibacter was detected at the genus level of 0 36 it is a specific thiosulfate reducer which could utilize thiosulfate as the electron acceptor but not sulfate or sulfite takii et al 2007 desulfovirbio is an srb related genus functioning in both the btr and thiosulfate disproportionation qian et al 2015a the level of which was observed at only 0 52 the predominance of thiosulfate reducing bacteria over the thiosulfate disproportionation bacteria is in agreement with the nonoccurrence of thiosulfate disproportionation in the s uasb reactor the bacterial diversity and abundance were also classified at the genus level in d uasb reactor at its steady state operation thiobacillus and sulfurimonas two well known sulfur oxidizers koenig et al 2005 takai et al 2006 which could drive the sulfide based ad are the predominant autotrophic denitrifying related genera and accounts for 16 2 and 17 5 fig 3b paracoccus capable of oxidizing sulfide coupled with denitrification uemoto and saiki 1996 is observed at 1 9 ofgenus level the microbial community analysis results confirm the enrichment and abundance of the functional sulfide oxidizers driving a high rate bnr in the d uasb reactor 3 5 sulfidogenic activities with different electron acceptors the sulfidogenic activities were evaluated with different electron acceptors under the same ph condition the average electron accepting capabilities of the s are 4 mol e mol s2o3 2 s and 8 mol e mol so4 2 s supposing both of them are completely reduced to sulfide respectively theoretically when the same amount of electron donor is oxidized the sulfide generation in btr could be as twice as in sulfate reduction the sulfidogenesis in both reactors versus time are illustrated in fig 4 a sulfide was readily accumulated in thiosulfate reducing reactor but there is lag phase for the sulfate reduction in thiosulfate reducing reactor the sulfide concentration constantly increased and reached the highest at 89 mg s l since the 10th hour while the sulfide was not detectable until the 2nd hour in sulfate reducing reactor though its concentration is comparable to that in thiosulfate reducing reactor finally biomass specific sulfide generation rates were obtained from the linear parts in fig 4a and summarized in table 1 the sulfidogenic activity in btr was 20 5 mg s g mlvss h 1 5 times of that in sulfate reduction the ratio of organic consumption to sulfide generation i e toc s2 is about 0 39 of thiosulfate reducing batch reactor at the end of test very close to the stoichiometric ratio of 0 375 the batch test result also supports nonoccurrence of thiosulfate disproportionation in the btr in our study 3 6 btr under different ph conditions the sufidogenesis of btr under different ph conditions was depicted in fig 4b accordingly the biomass specific sulfide generation rates were calculated and summarized in table 2 with sufficient sodium acetate in each batch reactors the sulfidogenic activities peaked at between 18 and 21 mg s g mlvss h at ph 7 0 and 8 0 see table 2 the sulfidogenic activity at ph 6 0 was only 55 of that under ph 7 0 moreover the sulfidogenesis rate declined by 30 when ph raised from 8 0 to 9 0 this ph related trend in btr is the same with that in biological co sulfate sulfite reduction qian et al 2015b the same optimal ph condition for both sulfate sulfite reduction and thiosulfate reduction may be most possibly linked to abundance of desulfomicrobium and desulfobulbus two well known sulfur reducers in biological sewage treatment system in both reactors qian et al 2015b liu et al 2018 indicated by fig 3a the optimal ph we found here is also among representative ph range in the municipal sewage suggesting the possibility of high rate organic removal in municipal sewage via thiosulfate reduction driven biotechnology the unionized sulfide h2s may exhibit the inhibitory effect on the anaerobic microorganisms including both srb in the anaerobic treatment process liu et al 2018 reis et al 1992 illustrated that h2s directly inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction activities and completely depress the srb growth at the concentration above 500 mg s l in the pure desulfovibrio cultures nevertheless no obvious inhibition of h2s on the thiosulfate reducing activities was found in our mixed cultures in the four batch reactors the main reasons could be most associated with the different h2s accumulation levels and different cultures employed in each study 3 7 heavy metal removal via btr fig s4 displays the heavy metal removal performance in the two stage system on day 188 each metal could be efficiently removed in the chemical compartment the alkalinity produced from btr eq 1 and the high ph of the sulfidogenic reactor s effluent favor the metal sulfide precipitation in the two stage system sahinkaya 2009 regarding to the application of sulfide induced metal precipitation external organic compounds should be dosed to facilitate the sulfidogenesis due to the deficiency of organics in amd the cost evaluation illustrates that btr is more cost effective than sulfate reduction for the metal removal recovery from amd though sulfate is available in amd the details of cost analysis could be seen in si 2 in the supplementary information 3 8 environmental implications of this study btr in the mixed cultures for high rate organic removal and sufidogenesis in sewage treatment is poorly understood the thorough exploration of this biotechnology could close the knowledge gap in sbap and further construct the framework of the sulfur cycle in biological sewage treatment as well as offer new insights into sludge minimization in sulfur deficient sewage treatment in this study the high organic removal capacity and low sludge yield were confirmed with thiosulfate as the electron acceptor due to the characteristics of high bioavailability and less electron requirement the higher sulfidogenic activity was demonstrated in btr compared with sulfate in the batch mode test the highest sulfidogenic activity was achieved under the normal ph condition 7 0 8 0 in the real sewage treatment facility manifesting the feasibility of implementing btr for sulfur deficient municipal sewage treatment for sludge minimization meanwhile the thiosulfate reduction induced sulfidogenesis could also provide sufficient sulfide serving as an electron donor for the downstream bnr or as the chemical source for the heavy metal removal in industrial wastewater treatment thiosulfate is generally not available in the sewage even though the high rate organic removal and sulfidogenesis are demonstrated in our study so the adequate supplementation of thiosulfate source is the elemental point for its practical application however additional thiosulfate dosage could inevitably increase the operation cost and may cause the secondary contamination here the accumulation of thiosulfate as the sulfide oxidation product in sulfide based denitritation see section 3 3 implies us to propose a new sulfur cycle in the municipal sewage treatment process see fig 5 this new sulfur cycle based process consists of an anaerobic phase s2o3 2 reducing to hs coupled with organic removal and an anoxic phase hs oxidation to s2o3 2 coupled with denitritation and nitrite recycled from a nitritation reactor therefore a continuous sulfur biotransformation between thiosulfate and sulfide could be established for sustainable sewage treatment and the sludge minimization future study on how to achieve this new bioprocess in the field application is much needed and the long term stable accumulation of thiosulfate in the sulfide oxidation denitritation deserves to be further explored 4 conclusions thiosulfate as the electron acceptor in sbap was explored in this study the organic removal rate in the thiosulfate reduction uasb reactor could reach 1 16 kg toc d m3 with the sulfidogenic rate of 105 6 mg s l h the sludge yield was determined to be only 0 044 g mlvss g codsubstrate through the long term s uasb reactor s operation the occurrence of thiosulfate disproportionation was not observed in btr thus not affecting the organic removal capacity the sulfidogenic activity driven by thiosulfate was 1 5 times of that driven by sulfate dethiosulfatibacter was a specific thiosulfate reducer at low genus level of 0 35 in s uasb reactor in addition to desulfobulbus and desulfumicrobium sulfide oxidizing bacteria including thiobacillus 16 2 and sulfurimonas 17 5 were enriched in the subsequent btr based denitritation reactor and thiosulfate could be partially recovered from the sulfide oxidation btr is also cost effective for the heavy metal removal via sulfide induced precipitation in amd a new sulfur cycle based on the continuous biotransformation between thiosulfate and sulfide demonstrated here could offer a new insight into the sustainable sulfur deficient sewage treatment as well as sludge minimization

18590,the sulfur bioconversion associated processes sbap for sewage treatment have been extensively reported so far in this study biological thiosulfate reduction btr driven biotechnology for high rate sulfidogenesis and organic removal was explored to further close the gap of our knowledge on the sulfur cycle based sewage treatment bioprocess with thiosulfate as the electron acceptor the

downstream autotrophic denitrification or for the cost effective heavy metal precipitation thiosulfate disproportionation was not observed in btr reactor high throughput pyrosequencing analysis

large scaled sbap has been demonstrated to reduce approximately 70 biowastes production in the sulfate rich saline sewage treatment in the coast region wu et al 2016 however sulfate is always deficient in most of the fresh sewage in inland areas hindering its broad application for sludge minimization qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 thiosulfate s2o3 2 is a rather bioavailable sulfur specie and could induce high bacterial activities zhang et al 2017 most of sulfate reducing bacteria srb could utilize thiosulfate as the respiratory electron acceptor in the anaerobic environment zeng et al 2019 from the perspective of electron transfer in biochemical reaction biological thiosulfate reduction btr requires half of electrons compared with sulfate reduction eqs 1 and 2 implying a more rapid sulfidogenesis and shorter start up period in sulfidogenic reactor liang et al 2014 although btr has been reported to play an essential role in the sulfur cycle of geological and marine environments ravot et al 1995 stoffels et al 2011 no information on thiosulfate as an electron acceptor to facilitate the sbap application is available its application may be extended to the treatment of metal laden wastewater via sulfide precipitation eq 3 such as acid mine drainage amd due to the enrichment of sulfide producers under thiosulfate reducing condition lee et al 2011 on the other hand thiosulfate disproportionation to sulfate and sulfide was observed in both the pure and mixed cultures without the organic consumption qian et al 2015a cypionka et al 1998 leading to the deterioration of organic removal capacity in btr thus a thorough examination of btr using organic carbon as the electron donor with the possible occurrence of thiosulfate disproportionation is deserved with these overall considerations as well as the above potential benefits and drawbacks of btr in view we are motived to employ thiosulfate as the electron acceptor in the sbap for organic and nitrogen removal in the fresh sewage treatment and potential heavy metal removal from the metal laden industrial wastewater 1 ch3coo s2o3 2 h2o 2hs 2hco3 h 2 ch3coo so4 2 hs 2hco3 3 me2 hs mes h two bench scaled up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors namely sulfidogenic uasb s uasb and denitrifying uasb d uasb and a heavy metal precipitator were established we mainly aim to 1 evaluate the sulfidogenic capacity and the sludge yield of btr in the s uasb reactor and the btr based biological nitrogen removal bnr performance in the d uasb reactor 2 explore the microbial community structures with the main focuses on the genera driving the btr and btr based bnr respectively 3 assess the btr application for the heavy metal removal the sulfidogenic activities between sulfate and thiosulfate reductions are compared although thiosulfate is not available in the wastewater a new sulfur cycle based on the continuous biotransformation between thiosulfate and sulfide is demonstrated in this study for the thiosulfate recovery and sustainable low sludge yield sewage treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 operating of the btr based system both s uasb and d uasb reactors were made of transparent plexiglass to facilitate the observations of the morphology of bio aggregates height of the sludge blanket and possible occurrence of sludge floatation stratification the configurations of two bioreactors can be seen in fig 1 the fresh synthetic domestic wastewater composition in table s1 and analytical grade sodium thiosulfate solution were prepared on a daily base they were preserved separately in two sterilized bulks under 4 c and fed to the s uasb reactor by two peristaltic pumps longerpump bt100 2j the seeding sludge originated from a sulfate reducing anaerobic sequential batch reactor sbr and was cultivated for more than four months 500 ml mixed liquor was transferred from sbr to s uasb reactor resulted in the initial biomass concentration of 9 2 g mlvss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids l the ph of influent was adjusted to 7 8 0 2 by 6 m hcl naoh solutions and the temperature was controlled at 25 0 1 0 c in an air conditioning room influent carbonaceous chemical oxygen demand cod and thiosulfate concentrations were 350 mg cod l a typical cod level of municipal sewage in china and equivalent to about 130 mg toc l and 500 mg s2o3 2 s l respectively the ratio of cod to s2o3 2 s 0 7 could ensure the complete organic compound removal according to stoichiometry see eq 1 the entire operation period of btr based system consists of four different phases in phases i and ii s uasb reactor was operated alone to examine the sulfidogenic performances the hrt was set to 5 h in phase i day 0 51 and reduced to the half in phase ii day 52 102 in phase iii day 103 167 the btr based autotrophic denitrification ad for bnr was evaluated the d uasb reactor inoculated with autotrophic denitrifying bacterial rich anoxic sludge was operated and connected with the s uasb reactor the synthetic sodium nitrite solution at the concentration of 120 mg n l was supplemented as the nitrogen source and electron acceptor for ad while the electron donor was mainly the sulfide from the s uasb reactor s effluent the ratio of influent flow rates of s uasb reactor s effluent to synthetic nitrite solution is 1 1 so the actual influent nitrite concentration of d uasb reactor is 60 mg n l during the two uasb reactor s operation samples from both influent and effluent were withdrawn regularly subjected to the analysis of total organic carbon toc thiosulfate sulfide sulfate and nitrite in phase iv day 168 196 the application of btr for the heavy metal removal recovery in acid mine drainage amd was assessed the ph of the real amd normally ranged from 2 7 to 4 3 sahinkaya et al 2011 while the sulfidogenic activity dropped dramatically when ph decreases to 6 0 reflected by the batch test result of ph effect on btr in section 3 6 so a two stage metal removal system was established and constitutes of a chemical precipitation compartment and a biological sulfidogenic compartment shown in fig s1 the s uasb reactor was disconnected with d uasb reactor and posterior to the chemical precipitator for synergistic metal removal the operating conditions of the s uasb reactor were the same with those in phases ii and iii the metals in synthetic amd consist of fe cu co mn pb and zn table s2 each proportion was referred to bekmezcia et al 2011 2 2 batch assays batch assays were performed to assess 1 sulfidogenic activities with different electron acceptors including s2o3 2 and so4 2 2 btr activities under different ph conditions the organic fermentation acidification and sulfidogenesis driven mineralization always co participated in the biological sulfur reduction jiang et al 2013 in order to examine the organic abatement only associated with sulfidogenesis acetate the major organic component of the s uasb reactor s feeding and a simple organic matter which can be directly degraded into inorganic carbon coupled with sulfidogenesis by srb was selected as the organic source in the batch experiment qian et al 2019a the analytical graded nitrogen gas was purged into each reactor for at least 30 min to maintain the oxygen free conditions before the following tests 2 2 1 sulfidogenic activities with different electron acceptors at the end of s uasb reactor s operation in phase ii the anaerobic sludge was withdrawn for the batch testing two reactors 2 l flask were established and operated in parallel in batch test i the mixed cultures were withdrawn from s uasb reactor given that the s usab reactor was fed with thiosulfate as the sulfur source the mixed cultures may not adapt to sulfate reducing conditions immediately hence prior to the batch assay the two reactors were operated in sequential batch reactor sbr mode for more than two months for the biomass acclimation to each sulfur source the details of the biomass acclimatization could be found in si 1 in the supplementary information analytical graded sodium acetate was dosed in each reactor obtaining initial toc concentration of about 95 mg l and the initial sulfur s2o3 2 so4 2 concentrations were 100 mg s l in both rectors the ph of each reactor was conditioned at 7 5 0 2 by na2hpo4 nah2po4 buffer solution and the temperature was controlled at 25 0 1 0 c in the air conditioning room the initial biomass concentrations were approximately 600 mg mlvss l both reactors were sealed tightly with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals the batch assay lasts for 48 h 2 2 2 btr under different ph conditions ph is one of the key factors directly affecting the sulfidogenic activities qian et al 2015b it also determines the ionization of h2s which is generally a true inhibitor of microbial respirations instead of the ionized hs and s2 pan et al 2013 for example under 25 c the proportion of h2s to the total dissolved sulfide tds h2s hs s2 declines from 90 to 10 as ph increases from 6 0 to 8 0 so ph effect on btr activity was assessed in batch test ii four batch reactors were operated in parallel with ph controlled at 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 by na2hpo4 nah2po4 buffer solution initial acetate and s2o3 2 concentrations were 56 mg toc l 150 mg cod l and 100 mg s l respectively so the organic sufficient condition was created in all the reactors for the complete thiosulfate reduction to sulfide the batch test lasted for 24 h during the batch experiment mixed liquor samples from the abovementioned batch reactors were taken at a predetermined time interval through a 10 ml syringe then the samples were immediately filtrated through disposable millipore filters 0 22 μm pore size for chemical analysis thiosulfate sulfate sulfide and acetate were measured within 4 h the batch test results were reported as the average of the triplicate with the standard deviation below 5 the sulfidogenic activities in the two batch tests were expressed as the biomass specific sulfide generation rate mg s g mlvss h which was determined from the linear regression of sulfide concentrations mg s l versus time hour and normalized by the biomass concentration g mlvss l 2 3 chemical physical analysis thiosulfate sulfate nitrite and acetate were detected with an ion chromatograph dionex 900 sulfide measurement was undertaken according to the methylene blue method after the sample pretreatment with naoh and znac apha 2005 total organic carbon toc was analyzed by a toc analyzer shimadzu 5000a because of disturbance of sulfide and thiosulfate on cod measurement cod concentrations were converted from toc concentrations i e 2 67 g cod equivalent to 1 g toc poinapen et al 2007 each metal concentration was quantified by a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 990 purkinje beijing china ph and temperature were monitored with a ph meter phsj 4f mlss and mlvss concentrations were measured following the standard methods

day 102 and d uasb sample taken on day 167 reactors were performed via 16s rrna high throughput pyrosequencing the samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min and the centrifuged sludge were collected for dna extraction the detailed methods for genomic dna extraction 16s rrna amplification purification and pyrosequencing of amplicons as well as data analysis can be referred to the previous works qian et al 2015b su et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic removal and sulfidogenesis in s uasb reactor the s uasb reactor was continuously operated for 196 days in different operation statuses the reactor s performance in terms of organic removal and sulfide generation can be seen in fig 2a and b in phase i average toc removal efficiency achieved 92 under the sulfur sufficient condition resulted in the organic removal rate of 0 58 kg toc day m3 at hrt of 5 h the toc removal efficiency could still remain above 90 at steady state in the following phases ii iii and iv though the hrt was halved the long term test results confirm the feasibility and large organic removal capacity via implementing the btr driven biotechnology and average 276 and 264 mg s l of sulfide were detected in the effluent under the htr of 5 and 2 5 h respectively table s3 the sulfide generation rate was 105 6 mg s l h corresponding to the organic removal capacity of 1 16 kg toc d m3 under hrt of 2 5 h at the steady state compared to the sbap with other sulfurous species as the electron acceptor both higher sulfidogenic rate and organic removal capacity are demonstrated in btr see table s4 the produced sulfide the pka1 of h2s is 7 0 can almost be dissolved in the liquid phase in the primary form of hs as the effluent ph maintains above 8 5 see table s3 thereby mitigating the odor problem of the h2s volatilization and alleviating the toxicity of unionized h2s specie to the micro ecosystem vela et al 2018 although the gaseous h2s was not measured in this study its level was much less than the aqueous h2s in the anaerobic process and could be negligible compared with the tds in the aqueous phase liu et al 2018 the average mass ratio of toc removal to sulfide generation toc s2 is 0 44 a little higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 0 375 so thiosulfate reduction actually contributes to 85 i e 1 0 44 0 375 0 44 100 organic removal in the s uasb reactor in the absence of methanogens see the microbial community analysis results below the unexpectedly excessive organic consumption could be attributed to assimilation of organic carbon for the microbial anabolism we are also informed by the sulfur mass balance analysis that most of the influent thiosulfate was recovered by sulfide and thiosulfate with less than 20 mg s l of sulfate in the effluent fig s2 so negligible elemental sulfur was accumulated in the s uasb reactor these information also indicate that thiosulfate disproportionation would not occur during the thiosulfate reduction and the organic removal capacity were not negatively affected in the s uasb reactor 3 2 sludge production in s uasb reactor the sludge yield during the long term s uasb reactor s operation was calculated three parts were considered for the calculation i the net biomass growth in the s uasb reactor ii samples withdrawn from the reactor for sludge concentration measurements and microbial community analysis iii the biomass washout in the effluent the accumulative biomass growth rate and average cod removal rate are determined to be 0 1433 g mlvss d derived from figs 2d and 3 27 g cod d derived from fig 2a according to our result from day 58 196 with thiosulfate as the sole electron acceptor the actual biomass yield was 0 044 g mlvss g codsubstrate comparable with that in biological sulfate sulfite reduction 0 02 0 09 g mlvss g codsubstrate qian et al 2015c lu et al 2012 whereas the was production in cas process is as high as 0 41 g mlvss codsubstrate on average wei et al 2003 liu et al 2005 so the btr driven biotechnology inherits the characteristic of sludge minimization of the sbap reducing the greenhouse gas emission and saving the operation cost in the post sludge treatment 3 3 nitrite removal in d uasb reactor the s uasb reactor s effluent provided sufficient electron donors i e sulfide in the subsequent high rate ad reactor in phase iii as shown in fig s3a the nitrite could be efficiently removed via sulfide based denitritation in the d uasb reactor with the no2 removal efficiency of 93 6 on average at the end of phase iii compared with traditional heterotrophic denitrification hd this sulfide based ad could minimize the biowaste production and reduce n2o a major greenhouse gas exhibiting much higher global warming potential than co2 and ch4 generation yang et al 2016 sun and nemati 2012 the sulfur mass balance over the d uasb reactor was also conducted here most of the sulfurous species of the d uasb reactor s influent mainly sulfide were recovered as thiosulfate and sulfate in the effluent it is suggested that elemental sulfur was not accumulated in the reactor whereas thiosulfate presents a major sulfurous compound besides sulfate in the effluent fig s3b the finding is not in agreement with the results of nitrate denitrification where massive sulfide was converted to elemental sulfur coupled with nitrate reduction to nitrite reyes avila et al 2004 as shown in eq 4 as more free energy could be released in sulfide oxidation to thiosulfate than sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur eqs 5 and 6 it is reasonable that sulfide is more inclined to be oxidized to thiosulfate from the thermodynamic view so in denitritation nitrite from an aerobic nitritation reactor thiosulfate may be efficiently recovered as the final product of the sulfide oxidation and be recycled in anaerobic btr for high rate sulfidogenesis further discussions are presented in following parts 4 s2 no3 h2o s0 no2 2oh 2s2 1 34no2 5 34h 2s0 0 66n2 2 66h2o 5 δg0 480 6 kj

the lactococcus a fermentative bacteria was the most populated genus in the s uasb reactor with the relative abundance of 26 8 fig 3 a the complex organic compound which may not readily utilized by srb could be degraded by this genus into simple ones andersen et al 2002 the simple organics could be further converted to inorganic carbon coupled with btr by srb moreover another two fermentative genera i e carnobacterium and trichococcus accounted for 9 7 and 6 6 at the genus level respectively rabus et al 2013 collins et al 1987 the possible thiosulfate reducers are identified to be desulfobulbus and desulfomicrobium the species affiliated to these two genera are capable of using the s2o3 2 as the electron acceptor in the anaerobic sulfate reducing respiration chain barton and hamilton 2007 they were also the dominant srb groups in biological sulfate and sulfite reducing reactor qian et al 2015b in total the recognized srb accounts for 32 9 at the genus level the diversified and abundant srb genera in the s uasb reactor may also indicate the high sulfidogenic rate presented in section 3 1 it is also noteworthy that dethiosulfatibacter was detected at the genus level of 0 36 it is a specific thiosulfate reducer which could utilize thiosulfate as the electron acceptor but not sulfate or sulfite takii et al 2007 desulfovirbio is an srb related genus functioning in both the btr and thiosulfate disproportionation qian et al 2015a the level of which was observed at only 0 52 the predominance of thiosulfate reducing bacteria over the thiosulfate disproportionation bacteria is in agreement with the nonoccurrence of thiosulfate disproportionation in the s uasb reactor the bacterial diversity and abundance were also classified at the genus level in d uasb reactor at its steady state operation thiobacillus and sulfurimonas two well known sulfur oxidizers koenig et al 2005 takai et al 2006 which could drive the sulfide based ad are the predominant autotrophic denitrifying related genera and accounts for 16 2 and 17 5 fig 3b paracoccus capable of oxidizing sulfide coupled with denitrification uemoto and saiki 1996 is observed at 1 9 ofgenus level the microbial community analysis results confirm the enrichment and abundance of the functional sulfide oxidizers driving a high rate bnr in the d uasb reactor 3 5 sulfidogenic activities with different electron acceptors the sulfidogenic activities were evaluated with different electron acceptors under the same ph condition the average electron accepting capabilities of the s are 4 mol e mol s2o3 2 s and 8 mol e mol so4 2 s supposing both of them are completely reduced to sulfide respectively theoretically when the same amount of electron donor is oxidized the sulfide generation in btr could be as twice as in sulfate reduction the sulfidogenesis in both reactors versus time are illustrated in fig 4 a sulfide was readily accumulated in thiosulfate reducing reactor but there is lag phase for the sulfate reduction in thiosulfate reducing reactor the sulfide concentration constantly increased and reached the highest at 89 mg s l since the 10th hour while the sulfide was not detectable until the 2nd hour in sulfate reducing reactor though its concentration is comparable to that in thiosulfate reducing reactor finally biomass specific sulfide generation rates were obtained from the linear parts in fig 4a and summarized in table 1 the sulfidogenic activity in btr was 20 5 mg s g mlvss h 1 5 times of that in sulfate reduction the ratio of organic consumption to sulfide generation i e toc s2 is about 0 39 of thiosulfate reducing batch reactor at the end of test very close to the stoichiometric ratio of 0 375 the batch test result also supports nonoccurrence of thiosulfate disproportionation in the btr in our study 3 6 btr under different ph conditions the sufidogenesis of btr under different ph conditions was depicted in fig 4b accordingly the biomass specific sulfide generation rates were calculated and summarized in table 2 with sufficient sodium acetate in each batch reactors the sulfidogenic activities peaked at between 18 and 21 mg s g mlvss h at ph 7 0 and 8 0 see table 2 the sulfidogenic activity at ph 6 0 was only 55 of that under ph 7 0 moreover the sulfidogenesis rate declined by 30 when ph raised from 8 0 to 9 0 this ph related trend in btr is the same with that in biological co sulfate sulfite reduction qian et al 2015b the same optimal ph condition for both sulfate sulfite reduction and thiosulfate reduction may be most possibly linked to abundance of desulfomicrobium and desulfobulbus two well known sulfur reducers in biological sewage treatment system in both reactors qian et al 2015b liu et al 2018 indicated by fig 3a the optimal ph we found here is also among representative ph range in the municipal sewage suggesting the possibility of high rate organic removal in municipal sewage via thiosulfate reduction driven biotechnology the unionized sulfide h2s may exhibit the inhibitory effect on the anaerobic microorganisms including both srb in the anaerobic treatment process liu et al 2018 reis et al 1992 illustrated that h2s directly inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction activities and completely depress the srb growth at the concentration above 500 mg s l in the pure desulfovibrio cultures nevertheless no obvious inhibition of h2s on the thiosulfate reducing activities was found in our mixed cultures in the four batch reactors the main reasons could be most associated with the different h2s accumulation levels and different cultures employed in each study 3 7 heavy metal removal via btr fig s4 displays the heavy metal removal performance in the two stage system on day 188 each metal could be efficiently removed in the chemical compartment the alkalinity produced from btr eq 1 and the high ph of the sulfidogenic reactor s effluent favor the metal sulfide precipitation in the two stage system sahinkaya 2009 regarding to the application of sulfide induced metal precipitation external organic compounds should be dosed to facilitate the sulfidogenesis due to the deficiency of organics in amd the cost evaluation illustrates that btr is more cost effective than sulfate reduction for the metal removal recovery from amd though sulfate is available in amd the details of cost analysis could be seen in si 2 in the supplementary information 3 8 environmental implications of this study btr in the mixed cultures for high rate organic removal and sufidogenesis in sewage treatment is poorly understood the thorough exploration of this biotechnology could close the knowledge gap in sbap and further construct the framework of the sulfur cycle in biological sewage treatment as well as offer new insights into sludge minimization in sulfur deficient sewage treatment in this study the high organic removal capacity and low sludge yield were confirmed with thiosulfate as the electron acceptor due to the characteristics of high bioavailability and less electron requirement the higher sulfidogenic activity was demonstrated in btr compared with sulfate in the batch mode test the highest sulfidogenic activity was achieved under the normal ph condition 7 0 8 0 in the real sewage treatment facility manifesting the feasibility of implementing btr for sulfur deficient municipal sewage treatment for sludge minimization meanwhile the thiosulfate reduction induced sulfidogenesis could also provide sufficient sulfide serving as an electron donor for the downstream bnr or as the chemical source for the heavy metal removal in industrial wastewater treatment thiosulfate is generally not available in the sewage even though the high rate organic removal and sulfidogenesis are demonstrated in our study so the adequate supplementation of thiosulfate source is the elemental point for its practical application however additional thiosulfate dosage could inevitably increase the operation cost and may cause the secondary contamination here the accumulation of thiosulfate as the sulfide oxidation product in sulfide based denitritation see section 3 3 implies us to propose a new sulfur cycle in the municipal sewage treatment process see fig 5 this new sulfur cycle based process consists of an anaerobic phase s2o3 2 reducing to hs coupled with organic removal and an anoxic phase hs oxidation to s2o3 2 coupled with denitritation and nitrite recycled from a nitritation reactor therefore a continuous sulfur biotransformation between thiosulfate and sulfide could be established for sustainable sewage treatment and the sludge minimization future study on how to achieve this new bioprocess in the field application is much needed and the long term stable accumulation of thiosulfate in the sulfide oxidation denitritation deserves to be further explored 4 conclusions thiosulfate as the electron acceptor in sbap was explored in this study the organic removal rate in the thiosulfate reduction uasb reactor could reach 1 16 kg toc d m3 with the sulfidogenic rate of 105 6 mg s l h the sludge yield was determined to be only 0 044 g mlvss g codsubstrate through the long term s uasb reactor s operation the occurrence of thiosulfate disproportionation was not observed in btr thus not affecting the organic removal capacity the sulfidogenic activity driven by thiosulfate was 1 5 times of that driven by sulfate dethiosulfatibacter was a specific thiosulfate reducer at low genus level of 0 35 in s uasb reactor in addition to desulfobulbus and desulfumicrobium sulfide oxidizing bacteria including thiobacillus 16 2 and sulfurimonas 17 5 were enriched in the subsequent btr based denitritation reactor and thiosulfate could be partially recovered from the sulfide oxidation btr is also cost effective for the heavy metal removal via sulfide induced precipitation in amd a new sulfur cycle based on the continuous biotransformation between thiosulfate and sulfide demonstrated here could offer a new insight into the sustainable sulfur deficient sewage treatment as well as sludge minimization

18591,2 methylisobornel mib is one of the most widespread and problematic biogenic compounds causing taste and odor problems in freshwater to investigate the causes of mib production and develop models to predict the mib concentration we have applied empirical dynamic modeling edm a nonlinear approach based on chaos theory to the long term water quality dataset of kamafusa reservoir in japan the study revealed the dynamic nature of mib production in the reservoir and determined causal variables for mib production including water temperature ph transparency light intensity and green phormidium moreover edm established that the system is three dimensional and the approach found elevated nonlinearity from 1 5 to 3 across the whole study period 1996 2015 by taking only one or two candidate predictors with varying time lags multivariate models for predicting mib production best model r 0 83 p 0 001 root mean squared error 3 1 ng l were successfully established the modeling

assuming the independency among explanatory variables and samples however some models are dependent and are thus inappropriate for odor production processes that are influenced by various variables in the face of such limitations machine learning algorithms have been more intensively used for odor prediction such as neural networks random forest and support vector machines thuan et al 2012 parinet

unable to account for too many influential factors and currently applied models are either too simple e g linear models or too complicated e g random forest for interpretation therefore alternative approaches are needed to clarify the odor production processes or make predictions in ecosystems relations among variables commonly change over time indicating the necessity for applying dynamic tools empirical dynamic modeling edm is an equation free approach that allows for investigation of such dynamic systems from various perspectives sugihara and may 1990 ye et al 2015 bozorgmagham et al 2015 noted the robustness of edm in revealing causal relationships even when the interaction is time varying mcgowan et al 2017 reported the nonlinearity of phytoplankton dynamics by employing edm in the time series of phytoplankton dynamics in the coast of southern california from a dynamic perspective they investigated the meaningful combinations of causal variables for algal bloom and tested the hypothesis that algal bloom arises when the water column is stable and surface nutrients are exhausted in this region this approach resulted in the successful prediction of algal bloom events however there has been no application of edm for understanding t o mechanisms the aim of this study was to deepen our understanding of odor production processes in a water supply reservoir by applying edm to a long term data set specifically we employed edm for the first time to reveal causal relationships between environmental variables and t o production and to develop models that forecast t o among the t o compounds this study focused on mib as a representative compound to investigate the applicability of edm and the odor production processes to this end we utilized the time series of mib and relevant variables monitored in kamafusa reservoir in japan which has a long history of mib induced t o problems 2 study site and dataset kamafusa reservoir was built in 1970 in the natori river basin in northeast japan appendix s2 fig s1 and is a multi functional reservoir for flood control irrigation domestic and industrial water supply and electric power generation three rivers namely the taro

drinking water resource for sendai city and its suburban areas however it has suffered from t o problem since it started functioning in 1970 the cause of t o in kamafusa reservoir is mib produced by a type of cyanobacteria phormidium spp to counter frequent t o occurrences sendai waterworks has set a guideline of 2 ng l for the mib concentration in the reservoir a t o threshold for this study was therefore defined as when the mib concentration is equal to or greater than 2 ng l in kamafusa reservoir basic flow conditions inflow outflow residence time and water level and physio chemical and

parameters mib and phormidium are monitored by sendai waterworks bureau at irregular intervals according to when outbreaks of t o occur mib concentrations are measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry detection limit 1 ng l and phormidium spp is identified by microscopy based on morphological observation in addition because light conditions influence mib synthesis and cyanobacterial growth wang and li 2015 light intensity and light duration data were also collected from the japan meteorological agency data for parameters with a sampling frequency of more than once a month were averaged by month so that the sampling frequency was aligned as a monthly step for the analysis observed values below the analytical detection limit were treated as half the detection limit the time period for the whole dataset dataset a was from november 1996 to december 2015 and comprised a total of 230 sets of observations some observations were missed in dataset a one data point each was missed in time series for water temperature ph transparency dissolved oxygen do and biochemical oxygen demand bod and 83 data points were missed for both green phormidium and brown phormidium in addition another continuous time series dataset b period april 2008 to december 2015 was extracted from dataset a and contained 93 sets of observations without any missing values for all variables data before 1996 were not used in the study due to incomplete observation of key parameters 3 methods 3 1 empirical dynamic modeling edm is a nonparametric approach to studying dynamic systems by reconstructing a dynamic attractor from observed time series data instead of using parametric equations sugihara and may 1990 sugihara et al 2012 deyle et al 2016 mcgowan et al 2017 thus it requires no assumptions and avoids problems that appear in parameter estimation mcgowan et al 2017 ye et al 2015 in this section we provide a general description of the concepts and methods of edm used in this study to implement the edm algorithms we used redm package available in r 3 1 1 state space reconstruction depending on system states the correlation between two variables in nonlinear systems may change appearing to change with time known as mirage correlation sugihara et al 2012 such state dependent behavior is a fundamental property of nonlinear systems which are ubiquitous in nature sugihara et al 2012 ye et al 2015 chang et al 2017 based on takens s theorem takens 1981 a nonlinear system can be reconstructed from a set of observations of the state of the system i e state space reconstruction through re plotting the data in a multidimensional state space the evolution of the states over time forms a dynamic attractor that reveals the rules governing the system dynamics sugihara et al 2012 as an example assuming that a system is determined by zooplankton z phytoplankton p and fish f the state of the system at time t is x t z t p t f t which appears as one point on the dynamic attractor in a three dimensional state space s the system state x t changes with the dynamics of z p and f by plotting a sequence of x t the dynamic attractor x x 1 x 2 x t that empirically describes how the three variables interact at a certain time or how their interactions change over time i e how phytoplankton and fish affect zooplankton in practice however we may not have observations of fish phytoplankton or both or we cannot figure out if other variables e g nutrients matter scientists demonstrated that even with an incomplete dataset a shadow version of the attractor can be constructed by use of lags of a single variable as representative for those unavailable variables packard et al 1980 takens 1981 sauer et al 1991 takens also stated that the shadow version of the attractor retains essential mathematic properties of the original system takens 1981 assuming that only z time series is available in the given example the state at time t on the true attractor x t z t p t f t can be represented as x z t z t z t τ z t 2τ z t e 1 τ where e is the embedding dimension i e the number of coordinates and τ is the time lag extending of takens s theorem allows attractor reconstruction with multiple time series deyle and sugihara 2011 if observations of z and p are available then x t can be represented as x z p t z t z t τ p t p t τ where the number of the involved coordinates is e obviously for each given value of e with different combinations of lagged coordinates of z and p we can get many representative shadow attractors given e of 2 and time lags of 0 or 1 there are four candidate coordinates z t p t z t τ and p t τ so we can build six possible models with them z t p t z t z t τ p t p t τ z t p t τ p t z t τ and z t τ p t τ as multiple variables provide more information multivariate models e g x z p t usually are better representatives of the system than univariate models with a single variable and its lags e g x z t 3 1 2 prediction system dimension and nonlinearity evaluation of reconstructed attractors is based on their ability to forecast a target variable e g z t in this study we used two forecasting methods of edm simplex projection and s map simplex projection which was originally proposed by sugihara and may 1990 is a nearest neighbor foresting algorithm that utilizes nearby points on the attractor for predicting future values by seeing where they move at future time step in dynamic systems hsieh et al 2005 given an e value simplex projection looks at e 1 nearby points to compute the weighted average of their future values some time steps tp ahead and takes the average as forecast of the target point details in appendix s1 then the forecast skill is assessed by pearson s correlation r between predictions and observations the optimal system dimension e is chosen to maximize the forecast skill different from simplex projection s map sequential locally weighted global linear map makes prediction with all data points and can quantify nonlinearity i e state dependency of a system sugihara 1994 specifically s map assigns greater weight to points nearest the current state on the attractor which is controlled by the nonlinear parameter θ details in appendix s1 a larger θ value gives a higher weight for nearer states and in this way the nonlinearity i e state dependency is integrated for prediction thus the improved prediction performance at θ 0 indicates the nonlinear nature of the system 3 1 3 causality test according to takens s theorem takens 1981 the reconstructed attractor e g x z with a single variable is a shadow version of the original multivariate attractor x i e topological invariance thus all the reconstructed shadow versions of x give one to one maps to x and causal relationship between two single variables e g zooplankton and phytoplankton leads to the one to one mapping of their corresponding reconstructed attractors e g x z and x p chang et al 2017 based on this idea and the algorithm of simplex projection convergent cross mapping ccm is developed for nonlinear causality test between two variables in dynamic systems sugihara et al 2012 details in appendix s1 the principle of ccm is that the causal variable can be predicted cross mapped from the affected variable if the cross map skill is 1 statistically significant and 2 increases with library size causality can be implied mcgowan et al 2017 thus only when the cross map skill satisfies these two criteria can we infer causality in this study we applied simplex projection s map and ccm to determine causal variables for mib production and to predict mib production fig 1 specifically we used the observations prior to 2015 as library data for model construction and selection and observations in 2015 as prediction data for model validation these procedures applied to both dataset a and dataset b the following sections 3 2 3 4 describes of the modeling procedures in more detail 3 2 nonlinearity test and causality analysis we conducted univariate analysis to the time series of the target variable mib concentration to determine the optimal system dimension and examine the system nonlinearity the system dimension e is the optimal number of lags that maximize the best forecast skill for mib measured by r using simplex projection function simplex in the redm package the optimal dimension e was to be determined from 0 to 10 at a time lag τ of 0 5 months half of the data interval then s map function s map in the redm package was used with cross validation with e at τ 0 5 months under the default range of θ 0 8 system nonlinearity was assessed by determining the relation of forecast skill r to the nonlinearity parameter θ next we applied ccm function ccm in the redm package to investigate how well an environmental factor can be predicted from the mib time series and thus infer the causal effect of the factor on mib production since the response time of a variable to its causes may vary the prediction time step tp was set as a value between 2 and 0 months and the best tp for each variable was selected as ccm uses a response variable to predict explanatory variables the lag time is negative to test the statistical significance of the cross map skill surrogate data were created by randomly permutating the values of the original time series tsonis et al 2015 using the function make surrogate data in the redm package with random shuffle as the method argument 3 3 multivariate analysis model construction the causal variables that were identified by ccm were applied for mib forecasting the maximum number of coordinates used in the edm models was set to be the value of the optimal e determined by simplex projection we made our target variable mib concentration at time t as one fixed coordinate predicted variable and considered additional 1 2 or e 1 coordinates as predictors to construct models with 2 3 or e coordinates candidates for those additional coordinates consisted of 0 1 or 2 month lagged time series of causal factors and 1 or 2 month lagged time series of mib a 2 month lag was considered long enough to have an effect on the current state therefore given m causal variables the number of candidate predictors is 3m 2 in this manner different combinations of those candidate predictors were generated and formed multivariate models with the target variable fig 2 and then these multivariate models were used for prediction given that variables have different numerical scales data normalization is necessary in multivariate analysis by edm to avoid constructing a distorted state space chang et al 2017 therefore before proceeding with multivariate analysis for odor prediction all 21 variables were normalized using the function scale in r to ensure that all variables have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to test the prediction performance of each multivariate model s map was applied with leave one out cross validation on the library data observations up to december 2014 using the function block lnlp in the redm package with the argument method as s map and the theta set as the determined system nonlinearity θ in univariate analysis one month ahead predictions one time step ahead default setting of tp in the function block lnlp were computed in our practice we set both library set argument lib and prediction set argument pred as the library data we described earlier to enable leave on our cross validation default setting of the function block lnlp note that e is not a parameter in the block lnlp function and the test of those multivariate models was made possible by varying the input data for example when testing mib t 1 mib t we utilized the time series of mib t 1 and mib t defined mib t as the target and proceeded the prediction process forecast skill r and root mean squared error rmse were metrics for model evaluation and selection 3 4 out of sample test model validation based on forecast skill r and rmse of each multivariate model we selected two 2d models and one 3d models for each datasets dataset a and b and validated their performance on the prediction data observations of 2015 that were not used for the generation or selection of those models to do so same procedures with the same value of θ as the test of all multivariate models by s map were adopted but on the whole dataset specifically in the block lnlp function lib argument was set as the library data observations up to december 2014 and the pred argument was set as the prediction data observations of 2015 in addition to evaluate model performance on identifying outbreaks observations and predictions of mib concentration by those selected multivariate models output of the concentration prediction were classified into two categories outbreak mib concentration 2 ng l and non outbreak mib concentration 2 ng l considering a classifier that generates only two classes positive or negative the classification results can be shown in a two by two confusion matrix also called a contingency table fig 3 recall and precision relate only to the positive column and yes row respectively focusing only on true positive instances and positive predictions respectively by contrast specificity relates only to the negative column in the classification accuracy takes into account both positive and negative classes in this study we calculated four metrics recall specificity precision and accuracy from the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of model prediction for odor outbreaks in 2015 4 results 4 1 causality analysis simplex projection results revealed that the best embedding dimension e for univariate analysis of the mib time series of dataset a and dataset b was three in both cases fig 4 a nonlinearity test by s map showed that the best forecast skill was found at θ 1 5 for dataset a and θ 3 for dataset b indicating the nonlinearity of the system for both datasets however mib alone can explain only a little of its variability for the study period of dataset a the highest r value was 0 2 at e 3 and θ 1 5 while in the case of dataset b a higher r value up to 0 55 was obtained this indicated that the lag coordinates of mib itself were not capable of uncovering its own dynamics and mib production was possibly dependent on other environmental drivers given this nonlinearity the nonlinear causality test ccm was applied to identify environmental drivers for mib production for the two study periods based on the operational criteria and the output from the ccm test several causal variables were identified for two periods the four common causal variables in both datasets were water temperature transparency light intensity and green phormidium while each study period had some unique causes table 2 table 3 fig 5 and fig 6 interestingly some of the variables that showed significant linear correlations with mib were not determined as significant causes by ccm while some of the others were identified as causal variables even though they showed no significant linear correlation with mib 4 2 prediction of mib production model generation and validation in each multivariate model besides the unlagged mib time series up to two additional coordinates were considered because the best e was three for both dataset a and dataset b as suggested by ccm five and nine causal variables were selected in dataset a and dataset b respectively consequently 153 unique multivariate models 17 2d and 136 3d models were generated from dataset a and 435 unique multivariate models 29 2d and 406 3d models were generated from dataset b summary in table 4 two 2d and one 3d models for each of dataset a and dataset b were selected as good models based on their forecasting skills on the library datasets observations up tp december 2014 appendix s2 fig s3 from dataset a the three models a1 mib t 1 mib t a2 green phormidium t mib t and a3 green phormidium t 2 mib t 1 mib t showed statistically significant prediction with forecasting skill around 0 50 r 0 45 0 44 and 0 52 respectively p 0 001 appendix s2 fig s3 a from dataset b the two 2d model b1 total phormidium t mib t and b2 mib t 1 mib t were found to yield the same forecasting skill r 0 57 p 0 001 and the best 3d model was total phormidium t 1 mib t 1 mib t r 0 60 p 0 001 showing fairly good performance appendix s2 fig s3 b generally these six models captured precisely most peaks appearing in the original mib time series though they overestimated the mib concentration during non outbreak periods and slightly underestimated the odor level during outbreak periods in both datasets appendix s2 fig s4 to demonstrate the validity i e generalization or out of sample prediction of those models we computed predictions for the prediction dataset observations of 2015 that was not used in the process of model construction and selection for dataset a the three models a1 a2 and a3 were found to yield statistically significant prediction with forecasting skill over 0 50 r 0 59 0 55 and 0 60 respectively p 0 05 fig 7 for dataset b model b1 showed fairly good performance r 0 56 p 0 05 while model b2 and b3 showed very strong forecasting skill on the validation data r 0 8 p 0 001 fig 7 in terms of rmse the 3d model a3 green phormidium t 2 mib t 1 mib t rmse 3 43 ng l was the best out of the three selected multivariate models from dataset a while the best for dataset b was b3 total phormidium t 1 mib t 1 mib t rmse 3 10 ng l note that the optimal embedding dimension for both datasets was e 3 as determined by simplex projection fig 4 despite the good performance evaluated by r and rmse we observed some obvious errors gaps between prediction and observation at some points e g 2015 03 by a2 and 2015 05 by b1 fig 8 overall mib prediction from the six models followed the trend of observed mib concentration in 2015 especially from those models having mib t 1 as one coordinate i e a1 a3 b2 and b3 fig 8 as an additional test we evaluated how well those models can identify mib outbreak occurred in 2015 by calculating recall specificity precision and accuracy appendix s2 fig s2 the overall binary prediction skill of the selected models varied from moderate a2 accuracy of 0 55 to good b2 and b3 accuracy of 0 82 table 5 models selected from dataset b made better outbreak prediction of 2015 showing higher values of recall and precision than those of a1 a2 and a3 while the identification of non outbreak indicated by specificity by the two sets of models made little difference table 5 5 discussion 5 1 causes of mib production there are two different processes that are responsible for the introduction of mib into water namely introduction while the producers are alive and introduction while the producers are decomposing after death e g natural death or death due to competition with other species attempts to reveal a relationship between mib and some environmental variables mainly temperature and irradiance have been made from considerations of the limited literature available but no consistent conclusion has been reached wang and li 2015 zimba et al 1999 chlorophyll a is commonly considered to be an important explanatory variable in prediction models for odor compounds e g kehoe et al 2015 thuan et al 2012 but chlorophyll a is actually an indicator of phytoplankton mass and not the mass of mib producers wang and li 2015 observed that a larger proportion of mib produced by pseudanabaena sp was released under growth inhibiting conditions light and temperature thus they speculated that an elevated level of mib may inhibit the growth of other species and keep the position of the mib producers dominant in contrast to this zimba et al 1999 reported a tendency for coincidence between mib production and photo pigment accumulation for variation of light irradiance consistent with the findings of wang and li 2015 it was clearly seen in the kamafusa reservoir that a high level of mib tended to occur during periods with low chlorophyll a concentration appendix s2 fig s5 and fig s6 apart from chlorophyll a the interactions between mib production and some environmental variables such as flow conditions were revealed by linear correlation analysis for the two study periods dataset a and dataset b similar to the response to change in chlorophyll a very high mib concentrations appeared only within certain ranges of nutrients total nitrogen total phosphorus and nitrogen phosphorus ratio bod and cod levels appendix s2 fig s5 and fig s6 nevertheless the insignificant cross map skills mib x i or absence of convergence as analyzed by edm suggested that these parameters were not the direct causes of mib production correlation does not always imply causality chang et al 2017 so it was not surprising that highly correlated variates were not identified as drivers for mib production overall for both study periods dataset a and dataset b water temperature transparency light intensity and green phormidium were found to have causal relationships for mib production in the kamafusa reservoir as green phormidium is a group of cyanobacteria that is capable of producing mib in the reservoir it was expected to be an important driver of mib production and this expectation was confirmed by it having the highest cross map skills among all variables mib green phormidium 0 54 for dataset a and 0 52 for dataset b p 0 05 and the occurrence of convergence with increasing library size figs 5 and 6 there would seem to be no clear relationship between mib production and water temperature transparency and light intensity at least no simple linear correlation was evident table 2 table 3 appendix s2 fig s5 and fig s6 in fact temperature and irradiation were demonstrated to affect mib synthesis in phormidium spp pseudanabaena sp and pseudanabaena galeata at the gene and molecular levels by laboratory scale experiments kakimoto et al 2014 wang and li 2015 consistent with their findings we identified nonlinear interactions between mib production and water temperature or light factors duration intensity using the nonlinear causality test i e ccm different causes of mib production were identified for dataset a and dataset b for the time series of mib concentrations across the whole period from 1996 to 2015 appendix s2 fig s4 the most severe t o events were observed before 2000 and these were included in dataset a but not in dataset b dakos et al 2017 pointed out that elevated nonlinearity is a useful signal for critical transitions in dynamic systems indeed our analysis revealed an elevated nonlinearity θ 1 5 for dataset a θ 3 for dataset b which is possibly related to the different results in causality 5 2 prediction of mib production the prediction of concentration of odorous compounds using various modeling approaches has attracted much research focus but predictions featuring a time lag have rarely been studied the value of forecasting models is to assist management of t o issue as it provides early warning to reservoir managers and even water utilities to the best of our knowledge this study is one of only two studies that have targeted the forecasting of the odor level in the present study for the first time edm was used to reveal mib dynamics in the two study periods also an independent study successfully built random forest models to predict threshold odor number with a lead time of two weeks r2 0 71 in a drinking water reservoir kehoe et al 2015 levin 1992 pointed out that ecosystems are complex nonlinear systems in which physical chemical and biological components interact with each other and ecosystems generally display characteristic variability at temporal and spatial scales our analysis of dataset a and dataset b by edm suggested the nonlinear nature of the systems emphasizing the necessity and suitability of nonlinear tools many nonlinear analytical methods for analysis of time series data have been developed over recent decades including edm sugihara and may 1990 the principles of the edm approach and the model results from this study have demonstrated that edm was able to unravel the dynamics of mib production and make precise predictions with only one or two predictors several factors were identified as key drivers for mib production table 4 abundance of phormidium spp especially green phormidium transparency and light factors intensity duration even if only one or two predictors were chosen by edm the approach yielded a high predictive capacity out of the six selected multivariate models for dataset a and dataset b four contained a coordinate of phormidium spp green phormidium or total phormidium with different time lags despite there being plenty of influential factors on mib production the importance of phormidium spp as a predictor for mib concentration was highlighted when we ranked all 3d models generated from the library set of dataset a and b by r among the top 20 3d models 27 of 136 for dataset a and 81 of 406 for dataset b 56 and 86 had phormidium spp as at least one predictor coordinate respectively for two datasets this finding could be attributed to the fact that other related variables also showed causal relationships with phormidium spp and thus phormidium spp dynamics contained recoverable information about these variables sugihara et al 2012 the performance of those selected six models in identifying outbreaks in 2015 varied recall 0 33 1 00 precision 0 25 0 60 meaning that 33 100 of observed outbreaks could be predicted and that 25 60 of predicted outbreaks actually occurred however five of the six models could identify 75 of observed non outbreaks specificity 0 75 and even the worst one reached specificity of 0 63 the moderate to high values of accuracy indicated that those models had fairly good performance in classifying outbreaks and non outbreaks occurred in 2015 in practice higher value of recall and specificity might be the target of reservoir managers as mib concentrations exceeding the critical threshold may incur public complaints and could signal the need for water treatment plants to apply additional treatment from such point of view this study highlighted the usefulness of edm in identifying odor outbreaks non outbreaks towards better reservoir management 5 3 empirical dynamic modeling for nonlinear analysis to date efforts on investigating odor events have mostly focused on laboratory scale experiments e g zimba et al 1999 kakimoto et al 2014 wang and li 2015 or machine learning approaches in combination with simple correlation analyses e g thuan et al 2012 kehoe et al 2015 typically those modeling based investigations have relied on linear correlation to search for influential variables on odor production and then considered these as key input parameters for the prediction models e g thuan et al 2012 in nonlinear systems however mirage correlations might appear or change significance and slope over time sugihara et al 2012 therefore these previous attempts have rarely succeeded when it comes to a nonlinear system in fact prior to data analysis by edm when separating the time series into two periods e g dataset a and dataset b apparent correlations mirage correlations changed appendix s2 fig s5 and fig s6 implying that mib production exhibited nonlinear dynamics and therefore nonlinear tools are needed to clarify the target process this is another reason why we applied edm which is generally robust in revealing causal relationships through the use of ccm even when the interaction is time varying bozorgmagham et al 2015 we also confirmed the reconstructed attractors throughout the period of 2008 2015 by projecting them onto 2d figures fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 although the attractors were not clearly seen on these 2d spaces we can still observe certain patterns which are the projected attractors in addition we confirmed the mirage correlations between mib and the most important predictors as shown in the smaller panels in figs 9 figs 10 and 11 the trajectories of mib t and mib t 1 in the period 2008 2015 were always in the shape of a circle fig 9 while the trajectories of mib t and total phormidium t 1 or green phormidium t 2 clearly shifted over this period figs 10 and 11 this was probably caused by the long term changes in the reservoir condition and management practices e g aeration system installed in 2004 interestingly the trajectory in fig 10 looks like a combination of two different attractors i e one for high mib and another for low mib the abundance of green phormidium decreased around 2012 after which it stayed under 20 filaments ml appendix s2 fig s4 and this shift in the phormidium community was reflected in the trajectory small panels in fig 10 it is not possible to visualize attractors of multivariate cases but edm helped us to detect such a temporal shift i e regime shift in the phytoplankton community despite the usefulness of edm in causality analysis and prediction of mib production there remains the potential to improve modeling performance first the variables included in this study were many but not complete several variables showed neither causal relationships nor linear correlation with mib while some other unavailable variables for example thermocline strength index and the population of predators of phormidium spp might potentially affect though green phormidium is a responsible variable for mib production the abundance of mib producing genes could be a better index than cyanobacterial abundance second we conducted the analysis without a differentiation between odor outbreak and non outbreak periods due to the limited observations the mechanistic dynamics in odor outbreak periods is possibly different from non outbreak periods and may even vary among outbreak periods e g differences in causality between dataset a and dataset b as discussed above therefore differentiation between outbreak and non outbreak periods could help improve model performance and provide other important insights into the production mechanisms when a longer and higher resolved time series data set is available the performance of edm achieved by simplex projection s map and ccm displayed in this work offered a new alternative for researchers to understand complex causality of odor problem and for reservoir managers or water treatment facilities to tackle with those t o compounds e g mib and geosmin to understand nonlinear systems edm uses time series data to reconstruct an attractor and proceeds analysis of causality and prediction through several neighboring forecasting algorithms based on the reconstructed attractor thus availability of time series is a critical issue prior to justifying the suitability of edm in our work we used monthly time series data throughout the investigation by edm and tested its performance on two datasets with different lengths and completeness the output interestingly revealed that edm analysis on the short but complete dataset i e dataset b with 93 sets of observation outperform that on the twice longer but incomplete dataset i e dataset a with 230 sets of observation in fact such result is reasonable while reconstructing system attractor through embedding edm ignores those vectors with missing data chang et al 2017 meaning that some sets of observation in dataset a were useless sugihara et al 2012 suggested that 35 40 sets of observation is the minimum requirement of edm but the required length of time series probably varies with the system complexity our investigation on the two time series lengths was not sufficient to suggest a threshold for the data requirement thus a careful investigation on how the performance of edm varies with data length is considered as a further step of the present work the length of time series is not the only concern with the available time series data though access to all related variables is not required by edm to proceed the analysis only attractors reconstructed from causally related variables can be one to one mapped chang et al 2017 meaning that causal variables could provide much more information than non causes for revealing the dynamics of target variable therefore dataset involving causally related variables could be a premise for prediction however we caution that the causality varies from site to site and can even change over time e g different causes identified from dataset a and b in this study thus the identified causes and constructed models in the present work may not be applicable in other lakes or reservoirs but the analytical steps under edm framework can be of great use to them where data is accessible 6 conclusions this study introduced edm to t o issue for the first time including an exploration of the nonlinear causal relationship and t o prediction by multivariate low dimensional models it revealed the nonlinear nature of the t o process and suggesting the changing mechanisms of mib production across the whole study period in the kamafusa reservoir particularly considering the complex t o as a nonlinear phenomenon our work demonstrated that edm method not only provides mechanistic insight into the t o occurrence by a unique nonlinear causality analysis but also makes reliable out of sample prediction of mib production with low dimensional models constructed from historical observations as a powerful tool for nonlinear causality analysis and forecasting edm identified phormidium spp green phormidium brown phormidium total phormidium as the most important cause and predictor of mib production implying the value of algal community data in demonstrating the production mechanisms as interactions among cyanobacteria can be revealed by algal taxonomic data despite the involvement of only one or two predictors edm was able to make out of sample prediction of mib production concentration and t o outbreaks thus the current monitoring scheme of phormidium spp and mib provides essential information and allow reliable predictions so as to aid in the reservoir management however we would recommend to add some more parameters to monitor which would not only potentially improve the predictive models but also allow further understanding of the t o mechanisms moreover the reservoir managers could utilize those predictive models as a tool of early earning to adopt countermeasures in time and to inform water utilities to prepare for extra treatment for mib removal the tests on two datasets confirmed that a shorter but complete time series could be better revealed than a longer but incomplete time series and therefore a continuous and regular monitoring plan is recommended if the cost of extensive monitoring cannot be justified for further studies in kamafusa reservoir modeling of phormidium spp would enhance our understanding of its habitat suitability and provide insightful information for proposing a specific strategy to control its excessive growth we have highlighted the advantages of edm in identifying causes and predicting the production of t o compounds in other lakes or reservoirs as it is inevitable and essential to have a basic understanding of the theoretical background and general algorithms of edm the description illustration and demonstration in the method section and those corresponding references can be instructive to edm users again we emphasize the necessity of time series data with more than 35 40 sets of observations and the importance of involving causal variables that could be hypothesized through field observation and tested by causality analysis moreover the combination of edm with high resolved data e g frequent monitoring on a weekly basis may extract much more information e g analysis at varying time scales and transitions of mib production mechanisms thus providing added value for reservoir management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

zimba et al 1999 has not yet been proven it has been speculated that they might be released for primary producers to maintain their own biomass wang and li 2015 in general the biosynthesis pathways of mib and geosmin by cyanobacterial actinomyces are well understood and extensive lab scale experiments have revealed the relation of temperature and or light to their productions wang and li 2015 zimba et al 1999 long term data provide an opportunity to apply data driven approaches for understanding the process of odor production in reservoirs such data driven approaches might be used for predicting odor level e g mib geosmin concentration which would allow for early warning of odor outbreaks there have been attempts to build models that predict cyanobacteria abundance e g some phormidium strains and the production of their odorous secondary metabolites e g mib and geosmin to date most studies have employed linear models to predict the concentration of odorous compounds such as mib and geosmin and or the abundance of their producers biomass or cell counts smith et al 2002 davies et al 2004 dzialowski et al 2009 thuan et al 2012 harris 2017 linear models barely rely on correlation analysis assuming the independency among explanatory variables and samples however some models are dependent and are thus inappropriate for odor production processes that are influenced by various variables in the face of such limitations machine learning algorithms have been more intensively used for odor prediction such as neural networks random forest and support vector machines thuan et al 2012 parinet and rodriguez 2013 kehoe et al 2015 bertone and halloran 2016 harris 2017 geer et al 2017 nevertheless it is still difficult to interpret the production processes e g how predictors determine the response variable despite the high accuracy of these machine learning models in predicting quantities of odorous compounds or their producers in reservoirs in general laboratory scale studies are unable to account for too many influential factors and currently applied models are either too simple e g linear models or too complicated e g random forest for interpretation therefore alternative approaches are needed to clarify the odor production processes or make predictions in ecosystems relations among variables commonly change over time indicating the necessity for applying dynamic tools empirical dynamic modeling edm is an equation free approach that allows for investigation of such dynamic systems from various perspectives sugihara and may 1990 ye et al 2015 bozorgmagham et al 2015 noted the robustness of edm in revealing causal relationships even when the interaction is time varying mcgowan et al 2017 reported the nonlinearity of phytoplankton dynamics by employing edm in the time series of phytoplankton dynamics in the coast of southern california from a dynamic perspective they investigated the meaningful combinations of causal variables for algal bloom and tested the hypothesis that algal bloom arises when the water column is stable and surface nutrients are exhausted in this region this approach resulted in the successful prediction of algal bloom events however there has been no application of edm for understanding t o mechanisms the aim of this study was to deepen our understanding of odor production processes in a water supply reservoir by applying edm to a long term data set specifically we employed edm for the first time to reveal causal relationships between environmental variables and t o production and to develop models that forecast t o among the t o compounds this study focused on mib as a representative compound to investigate the applicability of edm and the odor production processes to this end we utilized the time series of mib and relevant variables monitored in kamafusa reservoir in japan which has a long history of mib induced t o problems 2 study site and dataset kamafusa reservoir was built in 1970 in the natori river basin in northeast japan appendix s2 fig s1 and is a multi functional reservoir for flood control irrigation domestic and industrial water supply and electric power generation three rivers namely the taro river kita river and mae river flow into the reservoir the catchment area is 192 25 km2 and the total active storage is 39 3 million cubic meters kolokytha et al 2017 kamafusa reservoir is the main drinking water resource for sendai city and its suburban areas however it has suffered from t o problem since it started functioning in 1970 the cause of t o in kamafusa reservoir is mib produced by a type of cyanobacteria phormidium spp to counter frequent t o occurrences sendai waterworks has set a guideline of 2 ng l for the mib concentration in the reservoir a t o threshold for this study was therefore defined as when the mib concentration is equal to or greater than 2 ng l in kamafusa reservoir basic flow conditions inflow outflow residence time and water level and physio chemical and odor related parameters mib and phormidium spp have been continuously monitored since 1985 see details in table 1 the water samples are taken at a facility near the dam site the odor related parameters mib and phormidium are monitored by sendai waterworks bureau at irregular intervals according to when outbreaks of t o occur mib concentrations are measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry detection limit 1 ng l and phormidium spp is identified by microscopy based on morphological observation in addition because light conditions influence mib synthesis and cyanobacterial growth wang and li 2015 light intensity and light duration data were also collected from the japan meteorological agency data for parameters with a sampling frequency of more than once a month were averaged by month so that the sampling frequency was aligned as a monthly step for the analysis observed values below the analytical detection limit were treated as half the detection limit the time period for the whole dataset dataset a was from november 1996 to december 2015 and comprised a total of 230 sets of observations some observations were missed in dataset a one data point each was missed in time series for water temperature ph transparency dissolved oxygen do and biochemical oxygen demand bod and 83 data points were missed for both green phormidium and brown phormidium in addition another continuous time series dataset b period april 2008 to december 2015 was extracted from dataset a and contained 93 sets of observations without any missing values for all variables data before 1996 were not used in the study due to incomplete observation of key parameters 3 methods 3 1 empirical dynamic modeling edm is a nonparametric approach to studying dynamic systems by reconstructing a dynamic attractor from observed time series data instead of using parametric equations sugihara and may 1990 sugihara et al 2012 deyle et al 2016 mcgowan et al 2017 thus it requires no assumptions and avoids problems that appear in parameter estimation mcgowan et al 2017 ye et al 2015 in this section we provide a general description of the concepts and methods of edm used in this study to implement the edm algorithms we used redm package available in r 3 1 1 state space reconstruction depending on system states the correlation between two variables in nonlinear systems may change appearing to change with time known as mirage correlation sugihara et al 2012 such state dependent behavior is a fundamental property of nonlinear systems which are ubiquitous in nature sugihara et al 2012 ye et al 2015 chang et al 2017 based on takens s theorem takens 1981 a nonlinear system can be reconstructed from a set of observations of the state of the system i e state space reconstruction through re plotting the data in a multidimensional state space the evolution of the states over time forms a dynamic attractor that reveals the rules governing the system dynamics sugihara et al 2012 as an example assuming that a system is determined by zooplankton z phytoplankton p and fish f the state of the system at time t is x t z t p t f t which appears as one point on the dynamic attractor in a three dimensional state space s the system state x t changes with the dynamics of z p and f by plotting a sequence of x t the dynamic attractor x x 1 x 2 x t that empirically describes how the three variables interact at a certain time or how their interactions change over time i e how phytoplankton and fish affect zooplankton in practice however we may not have observations of fish phytoplankton or both or we cannot figure out if other variables e g nutrients matter scientists demonstrated that even with an incomplete dataset a shadow version of the attractor can be constructed by use of lags of a single variable as representative for those unavailable variables packard et al 1980 takens 1981 sauer et al 1991 takens also stated that the shadow version of the attractor retains essential mathematic properties of the original system takens 1981 assuming that only z time series is available in the given example the state at time t on the true attractor x t z t p t f t can be represented as x z t z t z t τ z t 2τ z t e 1 τ where e is the embedding dimension i e the number of coordinates and τ is the time lag extending of takens s theorem allows attractor reconstruction with multiple time series deyle and sugihara 2011 if observations of z and p are available then x t can be represented as x z p t z t z t τ p t p t τ where the number of the involved coordinates is e obviously for each given value of e with different combinations of lagged coordinates of z and p we can get many representative shadow attractors given e of 2 and time lags of 0 or 1 there are four candidate coordinates z t p t z t τ and p t τ so we can build six possible models with them z t p t z t z t τ p t p t τ z t p t τ p t z t τ and z t τ p t τ as multiple variables provide more information multivariate models e g x z p t usually are better representatives of the system than univariate models with a single variable and its lags e g x z t 3 1 2 prediction system dimension and nonlinearity evaluation of reconstructed attractors is based on their ability to forecast a target variable e g z t in this study we used two forecasting methods of edm simplex projection and s map simplex projection which was originally proposed by sugihara and may 1990 is a nearest neighbor foresting algorithm that utilizes nearby points on the attractor for predicting future values by seeing where they move at future time step in dynamic systems hsieh et al 2005 given an e value simplex projection looks at e 1 nearby points to compute the weighted average of their future values some time steps tp ahead and takes the average as forecast of the target point details in appendix s1 then the forecast skill is assessed by pearson s correlation r between predictions and observations the optimal system dimension e is chosen to maximize the forecast skill different from simplex projection s map sequential locally weighted global linear map makes prediction with all data points and can quantify nonlinearity i e state dependency of a system sugihara 1994 specifically s map assigns greater weight to points nearest the current state on the attractor which is controlled by the nonlinear parameter θ details in appendix s1 a larger θ value gives a higher weight for nearer states and in this way the nonlinearity i e state dependency is integrated for prediction thus the improved prediction performance at θ 0 indicates the nonlinear nature of the system 3 1 3 causality test according to takens s theorem takens 1981 the reconstructed attractor e g x z with a single variable is a shadow version of the original multivariate attractor x i e topological invariance thus all the reconstructed shadow versions of x give one to one maps to x and causal relationship between two single variables e g zooplankton and phytoplankton leads to the one to one mapping of their corresponding reconstructed attractors e g x z and x p chang et al 2017 based on this idea and the algorithm of simplex projection convergent cross mapping ccm is developed for nonlinear causality test between two variables in dynamic systems sugihara et al 2012 details in appendix s1 the principle of ccm is that the causal variable can be predicted cross mapped from the affected variable if the cross map skill is 1 statistically significant and 2 increases with library size causality can be implied mcgowan et al 2017 thus only when the cross map skill satisfies these two criteria can we infer causality in this study we applied simplex projection s map and ccm to determine causal variables for mib production and to predict mib production fig 1 specifically we used the observations prior to 2015 as library data for model construction and selection and observations in 2015 as prediction data for model validation these procedures applied to both dataset a and dataset b the following sections 3 2 3 4 describes of the modeling procedures in more detail 3 2 nonlinearity test and causality analysis we conducted univariate analysis to the time series of the target variable mib concentration to determine the optimal system dimension and examine the system nonlinearity the system dimension e is the optimal number of lags that maximize the best forecast skill for mib measured by r using simplex projection function simplex in the redm package the optimal dimension e was to be determined from 0 to 10 at a time lag τ of 0 5 months half of the data interval then s map function s map in the redm package was used with cross validation with e at τ 0 5 months under the default range of θ 0 8 system nonlinearity was assessed by determining the relation of forecast skill r to the nonlinearity parameter θ next we applied ccm function ccm in the redm package to investigate how well an environmental factor can be predicted from the mib time series and thus infer the causal effect of the factor on mib production since the response time of a variable to its causes may vary the prediction time step tp was set as a value between 2 and 0 months and the best tp for each variable was selected as ccm uses a response variable to predict explanatory variables the lag time is negative to test the statistical significance of the cross map skill surrogate data were created by randomly permutating the values of the original time series tsonis et al 2015 using the function make surrogate data in the redm package with random shuffle as the method argument 3 3 multivariate analysis model construction the causal variables that were identified by ccm were applied for mib forecasting the maximum number of coordinates used in the edm models was set to be the value of the optimal e determined by simplex projection we made our target variable mib concentration at time t as one fixed coordinate predicted variable and considered additional 1 2 or e 1 coordinates as predictors to construct models with 2 3 or e coordinates candidates for those additional coordinates consisted of 0 1 or 2 month lagged time series of causal factors and 1 or 2 month lagged time series of mib a 2 month lag was considered long enough to have an effect on the current state therefore given m causal variables the number of candidate predictors is 3m 2 in this manner different combinations of those candidate predictors were generated and formed multivariate models with the target variable fig 2 and then these multivariate models were used for prediction given that variables have different numerical scales data normalization is necessary in multivariate analysis by edm to avoid constructing a distorted state space chang et al 2017 therefore before proceeding with multivariate analysis for odor prediction all 21 variables were normalized using the function scale in r to ensure that all variables have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to test the prediction performance of each multivariate model s map was applied with leave one out cross validation on the library data observations up to december 2014 using the function block lnlp in the redm package with the argument method as s map and the theta set as the determined system nonlinearity θ in univariate analysis one month ahead predictions one time step ahead default setting of tp in the function block lnlp were computed in our practice we set both library set argument lib and prediction set argument pred as the library data we described earlier to enable leave on our cross validation default setting of the function block lnlp note that e is not a parameter in the block lnlp function and the test of those multivariate models was made possible by varying the input data for example when testing mib t 1 mib t we utilized the time series of mib t 1 and mib t defined mib t as the target and proceeded the prediction process forecast skill r and root mean squared error rmse were metrics for model evaluation and selection 3 4 out of sample test model validation based on forecast skill r and rmse of each multivariate model we selected two 2d models and one 3d models for each datasets dataset a and b and validated their performance on the prediction data observations of 2015 that were not used for the generation or selection of those models to do so same procedures with the same value of θ as the test of all multivariate models by s map were adopted but on the whole dataset specifically in the block lnlp function lib argument was set as the library data observations up to december 2014 and the pred argument was set as the prediction data observations of 2015 in addition to evaluate model performance on identifying outbreaks observations and predictions of mib concentration by those selected multivariate models output of the concentration prediction were classified into two categories outbreak mib concentration 2 ng l and non outbreak mib concentration 2 ng l considering a classifier that generates only two classes positive or negative the classification results can be shown in a two by two confusion matrix also called a contingency table fig 3 recall and precision relate only to the positive column and yes row respectively focusing only on true positive instances and positive predictions respectively by contrast specificity relates only to the negative column in the classification accuracy takes into account both positive and negative classes in this study we calculated four metrics recall specificity precision and accuracy from the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of model prediction for odor outbreaks in 2015 4 results 4 1 causality analysis simplex projection results revealed that the best embedding dimension e for univariate analysis of the mib time series of dataset a and dataset b was three in both cases fig 4 a nonlinearity test by s map showed that the best forecast skill was found at θ 1 5 for dataset a and θ 3 for dataset b indicating the nonlinearity of the system for both datasets however mib alone can explain only a little of its variability for the study period of dataset a the highest r value was 0 2 at e 3 and θ 1 5 while in the case of dataset b a higher r value up to 0 55 was obtained this indicated that the lag coordinates of mib itself were not capable of uncovering its own dynamics and mib production was possibly dependent on other environmental drivers given this nonlinearity the nonlinear causality test ccm was applied to identify environmental drivers for mib production for the two study periods based on the operational criteria and the output from the ccm test several causal variables were identified for two periods the four common causal variables in both datasets were water temperature transparency light intensity and green phormidium while each study period had some unique causes table 2 table 3 fig 5 and fig 6 interestingly some of the variables that showed significant linear correlations with mib were not determined as significant causes by ccm while some of the others were identified as causal variables even though they showed no significant linear correlation with mib 4 2 prediction of mib production model generation and validation in each multivariate model besides the unlagged mib time series up to two additional coordinates were considered because the best e was three for both dataset a and dataset b as suggested by ccm five and nine causal variables were selected in dataset a and dataset b respectively consequently 153 unique multivariate models 17 2d and 136 3d models were generated from dataset a and 435 unique multivariate models 29 2d and 406 3d models were generated from dataset b summary in table 4 two 2d and one 3d models for each of dataset a and dataset b were selected as good models based on their forecasting skills on the library datasets observations up tp december 2014 appendix s2 fig s3 from dataset a the three models a1 mib t 1 mib t a2 green phormidium t mib t and a3 green phormidium t 2 mib t 1 mib t showed statistically significant prediction with forecasting skill around 0 50 r 0 45 0 44 and 0 52 respectively p 0 001 appendix s2 fig s3 a from dataset b the two 2d model b1 total phormidium t mib t and b2 mib t 1 mib t were found to yield the same forecasting skill r 0 57 p 0 001 and the best 3d model was total phormidium t 1 mib t 1 mib t r 0 60 p 0 001 showing fairly good performance appendix s2 fig s3 b generally these six models captured precisely most peaks appearing in the original mib time series though they overestimated the mib concentration during non outbreak periods and slightly underestimated the odor level during outbreak periods in both datasets appendix s2 fig s4 to demonstrate the validity i e generalization or out of sample prediction of those models we computed predictions for the prediction dataset observations of 2015 that was not used in the process of model construction and selection for dataset a the three models a1 a2 and a3 were found to yield statistically significant prediction with forecasting skill over 0 50 r 0 59 0 55 and 0 60 respectively p 0 05 fig 7 for dataset b model b1 showed fairly good performance r 0 56 p 0 05 while model b2 and b3 showed very strong forecasting skill on the validation data r 0 8 p 0 001 fig 7 in terms of rmse the 3d model a3 green phormidium t 2 mib t 1 mib t rmse 3 43 ng l was the best out of the three selected multivariate models from dataset a while the best for dataset b was b3 total phormidium t 1 mib t 1 mib t rmse 3 10 ng l note that the optimal embedding dimension for both datasets was e 3 as determined by simplex projection fig 4 despite the good performance evaluated by r and rmse we observed some obvious errors gaps between prediction and observation at some points e g 2015 03 by a2 and 2015 05 by b1 fig 8 overall mib prediction from the six models followed the trend of observed mib concentration in 2015 especially from those models having mib t 1 as one coordinate i e a1 a3 b2 and b3 fig 8 as an additional test we evaluated how well those models can identify mib outbreak occurred in 2015 by calculating recall specificity precision and accuracy appendix s2 fig s2 the overall binary prediction skill of the selected models varied from moderate a2 accuracy of 0 55 to good b2 and b3 accuracy of 0 82 table 5 models selected from dataset b made better outbreak prediction of 2015 showing higher values of recall and precision than those of a1 a2 and a3 while the identification of non outbreak indicated by specificity by the two sets of models made little difference table 5 5 discussion 5 1 causes of mib production there are two different processes that are responsible for the introduction of mib into water namely introduction while the producers are alive and introduction while the producers are decomposing after death e g natural death or death due to competition with other species attempts to reveal a relationship between mib and some environmental variables mainly temperature and irradiance have been made from considerations of the limited literature available but no consistent conclusion has been reached wang and li 2015 zimba et al 1999 chlorophyll a is commonly considered to be an important explanatory variable in prediction models for odor compounds e g kehoe et al 2015 thuan et al 2012 but chlorophyll a is actually an indicator of phytoplankton mass and not the mass of mib producers wang and li 2015 observed that a larger proportion of mib produced by pseudanabaena sp was released under growth inhibiting conditions light and temperature thus they speculated that an elevated level of mib may inhibit the growth of other species and keep the position of the mib producers dominant in contrast to this zimba et al 1999 reported a tendency for coincidence between mib production and photo pigment accumulation for variation of light irradiance consistent with the findings of wang and li 2015 it was clearly seen in the kamafusa reservoir that a high level of mib tended to occur during periods with low chlorophyll a concentration appendix s2 fig s5 and fig s6 apart from chlorophyll a the interactions between mib production and some environmental variables such as flow conditions were revealed by linear correlation analysis for the two study periods dataset a and dataset b similar to the response to change in chlorophyll a very high mib concentrations appeared only within certain ranges of nutrients total nitrogen total phosphorus and nitrogen phosphorus ratio bod and cod levels appendix s2 fig s5 and fig s6 nevertheless the insignificant cross map skills mib x i or absence of convergence as analyzed by edm suggested that these parameters were not the direct causes of mib production correlation does not always imply causality chang et al 2017 so it was not surprising that highly correlated variates were not identified as drivers for mib production overall for both study periods dataset a and dataset b water temperature transparency light intensity and green phormidium were found to have causal relationships for mib production in the kamafusa reservoir as green phormidium is a group of cyanobacteria that is capable of producing mib in the reservoir it was expected to be an important driver of mib production and this expectation was confirmed by it having the highest cross map skills among all variables mib green phormidium 0 54 for dataset a and 0 52 for dataset b p 0 05 and the occurrence of convergence with increasing library size figs 5 and 6 there would seem to be no clear relationship between mib production and water temperature transparency and light intensity at least no simple linear correlation was evident table 2 table 3 appendix s2 fig s5 and fig s6 in fact temperature and irradiation were demonstrated to affect mib synthesis in phormidium spp pseudanabaena sp and pseudanabaena galeata at the gene and molecular levels by laboratory scale experiments kakimoto et al 2014 wang and li 2015 consistent with their findings we identified nonlinear interactions between mib production and water temperature or light factors duration intensity using the nonlinear causality test i e ccm different causes of mib production were identified for dataset a and dataset b for the time series of mib concentrations across the whole period from 1996 to 2015 appendix s2 fig s4 the most severe t o events were observed before 2000 and these were included in dataset a but not in dataset b dakos et al 2017 pointed out that elevated nonlinearity is a useful signal for critical transitions in dynamic systems indeed our analysis revealed an elevated nonlinearity θ 1 5 for dataset a θ 3 for dataset b which is possibly related to the different results in causality 5 2 prediction of mib production the prediction of concentration of odorous compounds using various modeling approaches has attracted much research focus but predictions featuring a time lag have rarely been studied the value of forecasting models is to assist management of t o issue as it provides early warning to reservoir managers and even water utilities to the best of our knowledge this study is one of only two studies that have targeted the forecasting of the odor level in the present study for the first time edm was used to reveal mib dynamics in the two study periods also an independent study successfully built random forest models to predict threshold odor number with a lead time of two weeks r2 0 71 in a drinking water reservoir kehoe et al 2015 levin 1992 pointed out that ecosystems are complex nonlinear systems in which physical chemical and biological components interact with each other and ecosystems generally display characteristic variability at temporal and spatial scales our analysis of dataset a and dataset b by edm suggested the nonlinear nature of the systems emphasizing the necessity and suitability of nonlinear tools many nonlinear analytical methods for analysis of time series data have been developed over recent decades including edm sugihara and may 1990 the principles of the edm approach and the model results from this study have demonstrated that edm was able to unravel the dynamics of mib production and make precise predictions with only one or two predictors several factors were identified as key drivers for mib production table 4 abundance of phormidium spp especially green phormidium transparency and light factors intensity duration even if only one or two predictors were chosen by edm the approach yielded a high predictive capacity out of the six selected multivariate models for dataset a and dataset b four contained a coordinate of phormidium spp green phormidium or total phormidium with different time lags despite there being plenty of influential factors on mib production the importance of phormidium spp as a predictor for mib concentration was highlighted when we ranked all 3d models generated from the library set of dataset a and b by r among the top 20 3d models 27 of 136 for dataset a and 81 of 406 for dataset b 56 and 86 had phormidium spp as at least one predictor coordinate respectively for two datasets this finding could be attributed to the fact that other related variables also showed causal relationships with phormidium spp and thus phormidium spp dynamics contained recoverable information about these variables sugihara et al 2012 the performance of those selected six models in identifying outbreaks in 2015 varied recall 0 33 1 00 precision 0 25 0 60 meaning that 33 100 of observed outbreaks could be predicted and that 25 60 of predicted outbreaks actually occurred however five of the six models could identify 75 of observed non outbreaks specificity 0 75 and even the worst one reached specificity of 0 63 the moderate to high values of accuracy indicated that those models had fairly good performance in classifying outbreaks and non outbreaks occurred in 2015 in practice higher value of recall and specificity might be the target of reservoir managers as mib concentrations exceeding the critical threshold may incur public complaints and could signal the need for water treatment plants to apply additional treatment from such point of view this study highlighted the usefulness of edm in identifying odor outbreaks non outbreaks towards better reservoir management 5 3 empirical dynamic modeling for nonlinear analysis to date efforts on investigating odor events have mostly focused on laboratory scale experiments e g zimba et al 1999 kakimoto et al 2014 wang and li 2015 or machine learning approaches in combination with simple correlation analyses e g thuan et al 2012 kehoe et al 2015 typically those modeling based investigations have relied on linear correlation to search for influential variables on odor production and then considered these as key input parameters for the prediction models e g thuan et al 2012 in nonlinear systems however mirage correlations might appear or change significance and slope over time sugihara et al 2012 therefore these previous attempts have rarely succeeded when it comes to a nonlinear system in fact prior to data analysis by edm when separating the time series into two periods e g dataset a and dataset b apparent correlations mirage correlations changed appendix s2 fig s5 and fig s6 implying that mib production exhibited nonlinear dynamics and therefore nonlinear tools are needed to clarify the target process this is another reason why we applied edm which is generally robust in revealing causal relationships through the use of ccm even when the interaction is time varying bozorgmagham et al 2015 we also confirmed the reconstructed attractors throughout the period of 2008 2015 by projecting them onto 2d figures fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 although the attractors were not clearly seen on these 2d spaces we can still observe certain patterns which are the projected attractors in addition we confirmed the mirage correlations between mib and the most important predictors as shown in the smaller panels in figs 9 figs 10 and 11 the trajectories of mib t and mib t 1 in the period 2008 2015 were always in the shape of a circle fig 9 while the trajectories of mib t and total phormidium t 1 or green phormidium t 2 clearly shifted over this period figs 10 and 11 this was probably caused by the long term changes in the reservoir condition and management practices e g aeration system installed in 2004 interestingly the trajectory in fig 10 looks like a combination of two different attractors i e one for high mib and another for low mib the abundance of green phormidium decreased around 2012 after which it stayed under 20 filaments ml appendix s2 fig s4 and this shift in the phormidium community was reflected in the trajectory small panels in fig 10 it is not possible to visualize attractors of multivariate cases but edm helped us to detect such a temporal shift i e regime shift in the phytoplankton community despite the usefulness of edm in causality analysis and prediction of mib production there remains the potential to improve modeling performance first the variables included in this study were many but not complete several variables showed neither causal relationships nor linear correlation with mib while some other unavailable variables for example thermocline strength index and the population of predators of phormidium spp might potentially affect though green phormidium is a responsible variable for mib production the abundance of mib producing genes could be a better index than cyanobacterial abundance second we conducted the analysis without a differentiation between odor outbreak and non outbreak periods due to the limited observations the mechanistic dynamics in odor outbreak periods is possibly different from non outbreak periods and may even vary among outbreak periods e g differences in causality between dataset a and dataset b as discussed above therefore differentiation between outbreak and non outbreak periods could help improve model performance and provide other important insights into the production mechanisms when a longer and higher resolved time series data set is available the performance of edm achieved by simplex projection s map and ccm displayed in this work offered a new alternative for researchers to understand complex causality of odor problem and for reservoir managers or water treatment facilities to tackle with those t o compounds e g mib and geosmin to understand nonlinear systems edm uses time series data to reconstruct an attractor and proceeds analysis of causality and prediction through several neighboring forecasting algorithms based on the reconstructed attractor thus availability of time series is a critical issue prior to justifying the suitability of edm in our work we used monthly time series data throughout the investigation by edm and tested its performance on two datasets with different lengths and completeness the output interestingly revealed that edm analysis on the short but complete dataset i e dataset b with 93 sets of observation outperform that on the twice longer but incomplete dataset i e dataset a with 230 sets of observation in fact such result is reasonable while reconstructing system attractor through embedding edm ignores those vectors with missing data chang et al 2017 meaning that some sets of observation in dataset a were useless sugihara et al 2012 suggested that 35 40 sets of observation is the minimum requirement of edm but the required length of time series probably varies with the system complexity our investigation on the two time series lengths was not sufficient to suggest a threshold for the data requirement thus a careful investigation on how the performance of edm varies with data length is considered as a further step of the present work the length of time series is not the only concern with the available time series data though access to all related variables is not required by edm to proceed the analysis only attractors reconstructed from causally related variables can be one to one mapped chang et al 2017 meaning that causal variables could provide much more information than non causes for revealing the dynamics of target variable therefore dataset involving causally related variables could be a premise for prediction however we caution that the causality varies from site to site and can even change over time e g different causes identified from dataset a and b in this study thus the identified causes and constructed models in the present work may not be applicable in other lakes or reservoirs but the analytical steps under edm framework can be of great use to them where data is accessible 6 conclusions this study introduced edm to t o issue for the first time including an exploration of the nonlinear causal relationship and t o prediction by multivariate low dimensional models it revealed the nonlinear nature of the t o process and suggesting the changing mechanisms of mib production across the whole study period in the kamafusa reservoir particularly considering the complex t o as a nonlinear phenomenon our work demonstrated that edm method not only provides mechanistic insight into the t o occurrence by a unique nonlinear causality analysis but also makes reliable out of sample prediction of mib production with low dimensional models constructed from historical observations as a powerful tool for nonlinear causality analysis and forecasting edm identified phormidium spp green phormidium brown phormidium total phormidium as the most important cause and predictor of mib production implying the value of algal community data in demonstrating the production mechanisms as interactions among cyanobacteria can be revealed by algal taxonomic data despite the involvement of only one or two predictors edm was able to make out of sample prediction of mib production concentration and t o outbreaks thus the current monitoring scheme of phormidium spp and mib provides essential information and allow reliable predictions so as to aid in the reservoir management however we would recommend to add some more parameters to monitor which would not only potentially improve the predictive models but also allow further understanding of the t o mechanisms moreover the reservoir managers could utilize those predictive models as a tool of early earning to adopt countermeasures in time and to inform water utilities to prepare for extra treatment for mib removal the tests on two datasets confirmed that a shorter but complete time series could be better revealed than a longer but incomplete time series and therefore a continuous and regular monitoring plan is recommended if the cost of extensive monitoring cannot be justified for further studies in kamafusa reservoir modeling of phormidium spp would enhance our understanding of its habitat suitability and provide insightful information for proposing a specific strategy to control its excessive growth we have highlighted the advantages of edm in identifying causes and predicting the production of t o compounds in other lakes or reservoirs as it is inevitable and essential to have a basic understanding of the theoretical background and general algorithms of edm the description illustration and demonstration in the method section and those corresponding references can be instructive to edm users again we emphasize the necessity of time series data with more than 35 40 sets of observations and the importance of involving causal variables that could be hypothesized through field observation and tested by causality analysis moreover the combination of edm with high resolved data e g frequent monitoring on a weekly basis may extract much more information e g analysis at varying time scales and transitions of mib production mechanisms thus providing added value for reservoir management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18592,nanoplastics nps derived from degradation of macroplastics and microplastics possess potential threat to aquatic biota and human health their fate and transport in aquatic systems are mainly governed by aging processes and aggregation behavior in this study we simulated plastic aging process using uv irradiation and compared the aggregation kinetics of fresh versus aged polystyrene nps psnps under aqueous conditions the results showed that fresh psnps had strong negative surface charge and exhibited both reaction and diffusion limited aggregation regimes in agreement with classic derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory divalent electrolytes were 10 15 times more effective in inducing psnp aggregation than monovalent electrolytes the aging process inhibited psnp aggregation in nacl solutions by increasing the negative charge on psnp surface and the organic matter content in solution while promoted psnp aggregation in cacl2 solutions due to interactions between ca2 and carboxyl groups formed on aged psnp surface such distinct behaviors were consistent with characterizations by contact angle measurements potentiometric titration total organic carbon toc analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps hamaker constants obtained from dlvo fitting decreased from 3 5 10 21 j for fresh psnps to 1 5 10 21 j for aged psnps this study indicated that uv irradiation plays a vital role in governing the fate transport and potential hazards of psnps in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanoplastics colloidal stability dlvo theory uv irradiation hamaker constant aquatic environment 1 introduction plastics are widely used in all aspects of daily life song et al 2017 the estimated global production of plastics increased from 62 million tons in 1979 to 160 and 311 million tons in 1999 and 2014 pardos marketing 2006 plasticseurope 2015 respectively after use a large fraction of solid plastic wastes is not recycled instead they are released into the environment where they accumulate and persist due to their strong stability against chemical and biological degradations rillig 2012 plastics in the environment undergo various natural processes and are broken down at slow but persistent rates into particles of different sizes ter halle et al 2016 microplastics are plastic particles with diameters less than 5 mm cole et al 2011 recent reports of their occurrences in aquatic environments e g ocean thompson et al 2004 river wang et al 2017 and lake su et al 2016 systems as well as terrestrial environments rillig 2012 have raised public concerns microplastics found in the environment are either primary or secondary cole et al 2011 primary plastics are intentionally manufactured as industrial abrasives or as ingredients of cosmetic products and secondary plastics are derived from environmental degradation of large sized plastic debris prior studies have shown that microplatics can be mistakenly ingested by human picheta 2018 and aquatic organisms including zooplankton cole et al 2013 crustacean daphnia magna jemec et al 2016 fish wardrop et al 2016 and crab watts et al 2015 leading to potential adverse health effects microplastics can also affect the fate and transport of organic contaminants as well as heavy metals as they can release plastic additives such as plasticizers and flame retardants bakir et al 2012 brennecke et al 2016 mcdevitt et al 2017 the environmental degradation processes may further break down microplastics into smaller plastic particles such as nanoplastics nps several studies of microplastic samples collected from ocean surface indicated that nps are likely formed in aquatic environments due to degradation of plastics of all sizes cozar et al 2014 mattsson et al 2015 gigault et al 2016 in 2016 first showed the formation of nps by employing solar reactor to simulate the aging process of weathered microplastic samples collected from marine waters a later study in 2017 detected nps in natural water samples obtained from north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 nps may undergo aggregation process upon being released into aquatic systems which may affect their fate and transport as well as their potential risks to natural environments da costa et al 2016 besseling et al 2017 prior studies investigated the influence of water chemistry i e ph and ionic strength and natural organic matter on the aggregation kinetics of fresh nps in aqueous systems della torre et al 2014 found that fresh polystyrene nps psnps with size of 40 nm rapidly aggregated to millimeter spheres in natural seawater cai et al 2018 recently reported that the aggregation of psnps was influenced by solution electrolytes and dissolved natural organic matter nom long et al 2015 and galloway et al 2017 also observed that psnps tend to form aggregates in the presence of natural colloids and suspended solids it is known that plastics including nps undergo various aging processes that oxidize their surfaces and result in more abundant o containing functional groups e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups compared to fresh plastics singh et al 2002 bracco et al 2018 the aging process of nps in the environment may alter their colloidal stability and make them more dispersed or agminated in water which would consequently influence the environmental fate of other contaminants such as hydrophilic organic pollutants and heavy metals however the effects of such natural aging processes on the aggregation of nps are not well characterized in this study we hypothesized that such aging processes may change the surface charge density and even the hamaker constant of plastics which may influence their aggregation behavior in the environment the overall goal of this study was to investigate the effect of solar irradiation on the aggregation behavior of nps by characterizing the physicochemical properties of nps aged variously under laboratory conditions and quantifying the aggregation kinetics of the aged nps to make a pertinent comparison we used manufactured psnps as the model nps since ps is a typical plastic detected in the environment and commonly used in previous studies cai et al 2018 long et al 2015 galloway et al 2017 alimi et al 2018 uva was selected for inducing psnp aging process because it is the primary component of uv emission from solar irradiation reaching the earth surface and is the major wavelength range responsible for aging of engineered materials qu et al 2010 the physiochemical properties of psnps were characterized by transmission electron microscope tem dynamic light scattering dls potentiometric titration contact angle measurement total organic carbon toc analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to elucidate the aggregation mechanisms of fresh and aged psnps the aggregation kinetics of psnps before and after uv irradiation were measured under varying solution conditions of environmental relevance the aggregation data were used to calculate the critical coagulation concentrations cccs and to derive the hamaker constants for psnps at different aging states by model fitting based on the dlvo theory our results suggested that uv irradiation plays a vital role in the fate and transport of nps in natural aquatic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the psnp particles with diameter of 0 05 0 1 μm were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china according to the manufacturer the stock suspension contains 2 5 of psnps without surface modification 20 mg l of psnps working solution was prepared by diluting stock solution in 500 ml of ultrapure water monovalent i e nacl and kcl and divalent electrolytes i e cacl2 bacl2 and mgcl2 of analytical grade were obtained from shanghai titan scientific co ltd to prepare the electrolyte stock solutions salts were each dissolved in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter m2637 c0 22 μm membrane filters i quip with the desired final ph adjusted with hcl and naoh the concentrations of electrolyte stock solutions ranged from 0 02 to 2 and 0 002 0 2 m for monovalent and divalent salts respectively 2 2 aging experiment the aging experiments were conducted in a photochemical reactor nai ghy dsggy china equipped with a uv lamp ggz1000 λ 365 50 nm fig s1a the uv lamp used in our study could provide 2 34 mw cm2 1 71 mw cm2 after absorption by the sample quartz tube of light intensity as measured by a radiometer st 510 sentry optronics crop taipei taiwan of china which was comparable to the uva intensity measured at the ground surface on a sunny summer day in guangzhou city of guangdong province n 22 45 9496 e 113 56 3985 fig s1b separate batches containing 100 ml suspension of 100 mg l psnps were sealed with parafilm placed on the merry go round photoreactor surrounding the uv lamp and slowly stirred to ensure uniform exposure samples withdrawn on 1 3 5 9 12 and 24 h were stored in dark at 4 6 c before tests 2 3 characterization of psnps 2 3 1 size and zeta ζ potential measurements the size morphology and ζ potential of fresh and aged psnps were characterized with tem and dls for tem analysis the working suspension at ph 6 was dropped onto a 200 mesh carbon coated copper grid naturally dried at room temperature and then examined on a tem tecnai g20 fei crop usa operating at 200 kv the hydrodynamic size distributions of psnps were measured on a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk with the refractive and absorption indexes for psnps set at 1 59 and 0 01 respectively the particle electrophoretic mobilities epm over a range of electrolyte concentrations and ph were determined by phase analysis light scattering pals using the zetasizer nano zs90 instrument triplicate samples of each psnp were measured 10 times for epm which were converted to ζ potentials using the smoluchowski approximation smoluchowski 1903 2 3 2 contact angle measurement the fresh and aged psnp solution were filtered through an ultrafiltration membrane 3 kda sepro corporation using ultrafiltration cell yl 50 shanghai yuling filter equipment co ltd to form a psnp layer on the membrane the top layer was dried under nitrogen gas under room temperature static contact angles of probe liquids including water on the surface of psnp layer were measured at least three times at different locations by an optical contact angle measuring device oca15 dataphysics instruments gmbh germany 2 3 3 potentiometric titration 100 ml suspension containing 0 5 g l of fresh or aged psnps was prepared following the same procedure for working solution nitrogen gas was introduced to remove any dissolved co2 before hcl was added to lower solution ph to 3 the suspension was then kept in a nitrogen atmosphere while being titrated with 0 1 m naoh to ph 10 with an automatic potentiometric titrator zdj 4b shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china the volume of naoh required to raise the psnp suspension to ph 10 was compared to that for raising the ph of psnp free blank solutions to identify the presence of titratable functional groups on psnps 2 3 4 ftir analysis 50 ml of 500 mg l irradiated psnp suspension was withdrawn from the photochemical reactor at pre determined time and filtered through an ultrafiltration membrane 3 kda sepro corporation the psnp particles on the membrane surface were dried with nitrogen gas at room temperature and then mixed with kbr powder 1 before ftir thermo nicolet 6700 us spectra analysis 2 4 aggregation kinetics of fresh and aged psnps time resolved dynamic light scattering trdls was used to measure the increase in intensity weighted average hydrodynamic diameter d h of both fresh and irradiated psnps at 25 c under different solution chemistries as a function of time the zetasizer nano zs90 was employed for this experiment which uses a he ne laser operating at a wavelength of 633 nm and scattering angle of 90 for each aggregation experiment every separate aliquot including psnp suspension ultrapure water and electrolyte solution was adjusted to the same ph condition before test for the sake of environmental significance the concentration of psnps was set as 10 mg l such a level was used in several previous studies oncsik et al 2014 cai et al 2018 and might occur in contaminated natural aquatic systems enders et al 2015 horton et al 2017 gigault et al 2016 to initiate the aggregation experiment 1 ml of 20 mg l psnp suspension was first introduced into a pre cleaned new polystyrene cuvette dts0012 germany followed by addition of varying volumes of ultrapure water and electrolyte solution to form a total solution volume of 2 ml with predesigned electrolyte concentration this procedure ensured a constant initial psnp concentration n 0 at 10 mg l in each aggregation experiment the cuvette was vortexed for 1 s vortex genie fisher scientific and was immediately inserted into the dls instrument to start the measurement the change in d h of psnps was recorded with the autocorrelation function accumulated for a period of 15 s each aggregation experiment lasted between 20 and 100 min and all measurements were conducted in triplicates to ensure data quality the initial aggregation rate constant k is proportional to the initial rate of linear increase in d h and the inverse of n 0 holthoff et al 1996 1 k 1 n 0 d d n t d t t 0 where k was determined from the slope up to the point where d h increased to 1 5d h0 d h0 represents the initial d h the slope of the linear regime was still determined in cases where the linear regime ended before reaching 1 5d h0 the attachment efficiency α ranging from 0 to 1 was a key parameter to quantify the aggregation kinetics of psnps under different solution conditions since n 0 was maintained as constant at 10 mg l for each aggregation experiment α was calculated by normalizing k of aggregation in different solution chemistries by the slope obtained under diffusion limited k fast aggregation conditions saleh et al 2008 2

figs 1a and s2a show the size and morphology of fresh psnps examined under tem indicating that psnps assembled into regular microspheres with diameter of 100 nm figs 1c and s3 reveal the size distribution of psnps measured with dls with an average d h of 120 1 5 nm and a polydispersity index pdi of 0 085 0 05 the fresh psnps had strong negative surface charge with a ζ potential of 43 03 1 1 mv as measured at 1 mm nacl and ph 6 fig 2a which is a probable indicator for a stable suspension larsson et al 2012 in addition table s1 and fig s8a show the contact angle of 108 2 for water dropped on the surface containing fresh psnps which was indicative of their hydrophobic surface the representativeness of fresh psnps for ps materials was confirmed by ftir analyses in fig s4a showing comparable results with those obtained for ps standard typical adsorption peaks were identified at 1600 and 2920 cm 1 that corresponded to c c stretch of aromatic ring and aliphatic c h deformation respectively benzene ring vibration contributed to the adsorption peaks at 700 750 and 3020 cm 1 whereas the adsorption peaks at 1450 and 1490 cm 1 were attributed to aromatic c h deformation sertchook and avnir 2003 zhu et al 2001 jin et al 2015 our results showed that uv irradiation had strong aging effects on the properties of psnps after uva irradiation over 24 h the particle size of psnps decreased from 120 1 to 80 2 nm for d h as detected by dls fig 1 c and s3a c and from 100 to 50 nm as revealed by tem fig 1b and s2b f in addition after 24 h uv irradiation the toc concentration in solutions of the irradiated psnp samples increased from 4 88 to 44 01 mg l fig s3d and the psnp surface charge became more negative as ζ potentials decreased from 34 5 to 44 1 mv fig 3 d as shown in fig s8 and table s1 the contact angle decreased from 108 2 to 90 7 and 73 7 after 12 and 24 h uv irradiation respectively the decrease in particle size with prolonged irradiation could be related to the change in psnps surface structure likely due to chain scission by attacks from free radicals such as peroxyl roo alkoxyl ro and hydroxyl oh radicals bracco et al 2018 guo et al 2013 which may result in the increased toc content the more negative ζ potentials might be attributed to the induced o containing functional groups such as carboxyl group after irradiation as reflected by a new infrared adsorption peak at 1725 cm 1 fig s4b meanwhile the o containing functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl formed on surfaces of irradiated psnps could bind with water molecules via h bonding thus reducing their hydrophobicity as observed in fig s8 3 2 aggregation kinetics of fresh psnps the electrokinetic properties and aggregation kinetics of fresh psnps are presented in fig 2 in the presence of 100 1000 mm monovalent cations nacl and kcl or 10 100 mm divalent cations bacl2 cacl2 and mgcl2 at ph 6 which are representative of typical solution chemistries in surface water environments the ζ potentials of fresh psnps became less negative as electrolyte concentrations increased fig 2a the divalent cations ca2 ba2 and mg2 were more effective in screening the surface charge of psnps than monovalent cations na and k as expected fig 2b presents the representative aggregation profiles showing the increase in d h over time at different nacl concentrations d h remained unchanged at 100 mm nacl above which psnps aggregation started to occur with the rate increasing with nacl concentration e g 300 350 400 and 550 mm at higher nacl concentrations however the aggregation rate did not further increase due to the completely eliminated energy barrier between psnp particles chen et al 2006 such aggregation behavior of psnps was dominated by the interplay between van der waals attractive force and electrical double layer edl repulsive force as depicted by the classic dlvo theory mylon et al 2004 meng et al 2013 chen and huang 2017a by normalizing the initial slope of the aggregation rate using eq 2 the attachment efficiencies α of fresh psnps in the presence of different electrolytes were obtained to construct the stability profile in fig 2c fresh psnps exhibited both distinct reaction limited α 1 and diffusion limited α 1 aggregation regimes in all studied electrolytes at low electrolyte concentrations the aggregation process was reaction limited since increased salt concentrations led to charge screening on psnps and lowered the energy barrier to be overcome for aggregation to occur however when electrolyte concentrations reached the ccc which is the minimum electrolyte concentration to induce diffusion limited fast aggregation the energy barrier was completely screened and van der waals attractive force dominated the particle interactions li et al 2018 the ccc value for each electrolyte was calculated by fitting the stability profile with eq 3 grolimund et al 2001 3 α 1 1 c c c c s β where c s is the molar concentration of electrolyte and β is the slope of d log α d log c s all stability curves could be well fitted by eq 3 yielding the respective ccc values of 29 33 44 440 and 450 mm for bacl2 cacl2 mgcl2 kcl and nacl for fresh psnps the colloidal stability of nanoparticles against aggregation generally increases with the ccc value fig 2c such trend of inducing psnp aggregation by these cations is consistent with the ζ potential results in fig 2a that divalent cations had greater effects on destabilizing psnps than monovalent cations and that they followed the order of ba2 ca2 mg2 k na the ccc values for divalent electrolytes were approximately 10 15 times higher than those for monovalent electrolytes with the ratio between ca2 and na being proportional to z 3 78 where z 2 is the counterion valence this is reasonable since the proportionality of colloidal particles could range from z 2 to z 6 schulze hardy rule elimelech et al 1995 the ccc values of 450 mm for monovalent salts and 33 mm for divalent salts for fresh psnps were significantly higher than those reported for micro ps in the literature for instance the ccc values were reported as 14 9 mm nacl and 2 95 mm cacl2 for micro ps with an average diameter of 17 9 μm and ζ potentials of 22 mv in 1 mm nacl and 0 2 mm cacl2 li et al 2018 our reported ccc values for fresh psnps were also higher than other nanomaterials such as carbonaceous nanoparticles e g fullerene chen and elimelech 2006 activated carbon chen and huang 2017a and soot chen and huang 2017b and metal oxide nanoparticles e g tio2 liu et al 2011 similar results were observed for nano ps by zhang zhang 1987 who reported ccc values of 300 mm monovalent electrolytes and 34 mm divalent electrolytes for nano ps with an average diameter of 48 4 nm and ζ potential of 23 mv at ccc this should be related to the nanoscale construction and the more negative surface charge of fresh psnps it should be noted that the determined ccc values for fresh psnps are well above the salt concentrations found in typical freshwater environments yang et al 2017 but below those in seawater hem 1985 hence considering only the effects of solution chemistries herein fresh psnps should remain relatively stable against homo aggregation under typical freshwater and estuary conditions but may aggregate in seawater environments 3 3 effects of aging on colloidal stability of psnps the colloid stability of psnps is strongly dependent upon their physiochemical properties including surface functional groups and hydrophobicity xu et al 2017 it is expected that sunlight exposure especially in the uva range would modify the physiochemical properties of psnps and thus influence their aggregation behavior fig 3a and b compared the attachment efficiencies for psnps before and after different durations of uva exposure in nacl and cacl2 solutions respectively these stability profiles were fitted with eq 3 to determine their ccc values at different exposure time which were plotted in fig 3c it could be seen that the ccc values increased linearly with uva irradiation time in the presence of nacl while the opposite was observed in cacl2 solutions this indicated that uv irradiation enhanced the colloidal stability of psnps in nacl solutions while destabilized psnps in cacl2 such trends are similar to a previous study on uv irradiated fullerene nanoparticles qu et al 2010 in general the ζ potential of psnps became more negative with longer exposure to uv irradiation with an exception that after the first hour it became less negative fig 3d the elevated negative surface charge could be attributed to the formation of o containing functional groups e g carboxyl groups as shown in fig s4 after 1 h irradiation however loss of sulfate group from psnp surface may occur that resulted in the less negative ζ potential fig s7d which was then shielded by the formation of more o containing functional groups on psnps with extended irradiation time distinct aggregation behaviors were observed for uv irradiated psnps in nacl and cacl2 solutions because na encompasses a compact water shell and acts as an indifferent counterion it solely affects the thickness of electrical double layer of psnps in aqueous solution therefore the colloid stability of psnps increased with irradiation time in nacl solution due to enhanced negative surface charge in addition irradiated psnps may release organic matter into suspension as evident from the increased toc content with irradiation time resulting in stabilization of psnps due to steric hindering effect fig s3d on the other hand o containing functional groups can bridge with ca2 that consequently promoted the aggregation of uv irradiated psnps in cacl2 solutions 3 4 hamaker constants of psnps derived from dlvo theory the experimentally determined attachment efficiencies α for fresh and uv irradiated psnps in nacl solutions were simulated with the classic dlvo theory using eq 4 for identical sphere sphere interactions chen and elimelech 2006 zhu et al 2014 xu et al 2015 from which the hamaker constants for psnps at different aging status could be derived 4 α 0 β h exp v a h k b t d h 2 r h 2 0 β h exp v t h k b t d h 2 r h 2 where h is the separation distance between the surface of two approaching particles r is hydrodynamic radius of the particles k b is the boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature the dimensionless function β h was employed to correct for the hydrodynamic resistance according to honig et al 1971 the total interactions energy v t is calculated as the sum of van der waals attraction v a and the edl repulsion v r assuming sphere sphere interactions between two identical psnps the constant potential approximation cpa expression was employed to calculate for v r and the expression proposed by gregory gregory 1981 for retarded van der waals interactions was used to calculate for v a see detailed calculations in the supporting information the data of dlvo predication was calculated by matlab r2016b software mathworks natick ma the hamaker constant for psnps which affects the position of ccc in the dlvo prediction was the sole fitting parameter during the fitting process chen and huang 2017b the hamaker constants for psnps in water a pwp at different irradiation time were optimized by matching the corresponding theoretical ccc values with the ones obtained experimentally in nacl solutions note that to calculate for the attachment efficiencies of psnps at different irradiation times their respective d h values were employed in the calculations fig 4 a compares the experimentally derived attachment efficiencies of fresh psnps with dlvo predications in the presence of nacl at ph 6 good agreement was found between dlvo predictions and the experimental data both in the reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes this indicated that the aggregation behavior of fresh psnps follows the dlvo theory and is similar to typical spherical colloids the hamaker constant as a key parameter for evaluating the van der waals attraction between interacting particles was related to their material properties and the interacting medium elimelech et al 1995 in this study the value of hamaker constant a pwp for fresh psnps in aqueous medium was determined by colloidal chemistry method as 3 5 10 21 j this value falls between the theoretical values reported for nano ps materials 1 03 11 00 10 21 j ottewill and shaw 1966 with the range depending upon the irregular space configuration and anchored functional group of ps polymer formed in the polymerization process our reported hamaker constant for psnps is smaller than those reported for other nanomaterials such as fullerene 6 7 8 5 10 21 j chen and elimelech 2006 2009 activated carbon 2 1 2 7 10 20 j chen and huang 2017a and anatase tio2 6 5 10 20 j liu et al 2011 indicating the weaker van der waal attraction and thus the stronger colloidal stability for psnps compared to other nanomaterials as discussed above the hamaker constant for fresh psnps interacting in vacuum a pp can be calculated via the following equation israelachvili 2011 5 a p w p a p p a w w 2 where a ww is the hamaker constant for water interacting in a vacuum and is assumed to be 3 7 10 20 j israelachvili 2011 a pp was determined as 6 33 10 20 j for fresh psnps in vacuum using the colloidal chemistry approach which is slightly smaller than the value reported for ps materials in the literature 7 9 10 20 j israelachvili 2011 this derived value of hamaker constant for psnps in vacuum media could be an addition to the data archive for ps materials furthermore it is likely that different types of plastics possessing various polymeric structures may have different hamaker constant values e g 7 5 10 20 j for polyvinyl chloride pvc and 3 8 10 20 j for polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe israelachvili 2011 it is known that the van der waals attraction is positively correlated with both the hamaker constant and the particle size eq s 4 in the supplementary data having a hamaker constant greater than ptfe nps but smaller than pvc nps psnps should possess van der waals attraction stronger than ptfe nps but smaller than pvc nps as a result their aggregation rates may follow the same order when other conditions remain constant the derived hamaker constant can be used to predict the stability of fresh psnps under aqueous conditions at various nacl concentrations for instance figs 4b and s5 present the total interaction energy profiles for two approaching psnps as a function of separation distance in different nacl concentration the energy barrier decreased with increasing nacl concentration due to charge screening that resulted in a higher tendency for psnps to aggregate as the electrolyte concentration exceeded the ccc the energy barrier was completely eliminated to zero where the van der waals attraction dominated the particle interactions the hamaker constant is an intrinsic parameter for ps materials and is vital for predicating their colloid stability in aquatic environments in this study we found that exposure to uv irradiation could alter the inherent structure of psnps and thus change their hamaker constant values as presented in fig 4c good consistency was still observed between the dlvo prediction and experimental data for psnps irradiated for different time the hamaker constants for psnps decreased from 3 5 to 1 5 10 21 j as the irradiation time increased from 0 to 24 h as the hamaker constant is only relevant to material properties it may imply a structural change for aged psnps after uv exposure within only 1 day such reduced hamaker constant for uv irradiated psnps may lower their van der waals attraction and thus enhance their colloid stability compared to fresh psnps indicating a more dispersed and mobile nature of aged psnps present in aquatic environments as nanomaterials 3 5 solution ph effects the solution ph may alter the surface charge of psnps and thus affect their aggregation behavior li et al 2018 lu et al 2018 the aggregation rates k of fresh psnps in the presence of 400 mm nacl were investigated at ph 3 6 and 10 which decreased from 1 35 to 0 43 and 0 19 nm s as ph increased figs s6a and s6b the attachment efficiencies were further investigated at ph 3 4 6 8 and 10 in nacl solutions to construct the psnp stability curves by normalizing the initial slopes of the aggregation profiles fig 5 a it is evident that the stability of psnps increased with ph which agrees with their more negative ζ potentials at higher ph fig s6c the surface charge of fresh psnps remained strongly negative over a wide ph range from 3 to 10 at low nacl concentrations which might be attributed to the sulfate groups attached to ps surface during polymerization lu et al 2018 dong 2005 ou et al 2001 as well as the hydroxyl groups adsorbed to ps surface from solution an elevated ph may promote the adsorption of hydroxyl groups onto psnp surfaces resulting in more negative ζ potentials in suspension this prevented psnps from aggregation as indicated by the increase in cccs from 300 to 500 mm nacl when ph increased from 3 to 10 inset of fig s6c after uv irradiation more o containing functional groups were detected in aged psnps which contained more negatively charged particle surface that prevented them from self aggregation the effects of ph on stability of psnps irradiated for 24 h were quantified at ph 3 4 6 8 and 10 fig 5b similar trends were observed for fresh and uv irradiated psnps that their stability both increased with ph and the stability of aged psnps was enhanced compared with fresh psnps in the same nacl solutions to elucidate the origin of negative surface charge on psnps in aqueous solutions potentiometric titration was conducted for fresh and aged 24 h uv irradiated psnp suspensions fig 5c results showed that suspensions with fresh or aged psnps both required more naoh for titration compared to the blank suspensions without the presence of psnps it indicates that both fresh and aged psnps contained acidic functional groups that may dissociate at solution ph above 5 this phenomenon was consistent with the ftir results fig s4 which identified the existence of o containing functional groups such as hydroxyl groups meanwhile aged psnps contained more acidic functional groups than fresh psnps which agrees with previous discussions that uv irradiation enhanced psnps stability in nacl solutions 3 6 aggregation mechanisms for uv irradiated psnps uva is the primary component of uv light in solar radiation that can reach the earth surface possessing high energy capacity to penetrate materials and be absorbed therefore exposure to uva in natural environments likely results in material aging ps is a representative plastic material sensitive to uv irradiation in wavelength of 318 nm tang and tuo 2016 previous studies singh et al 2002 bottino et al 2004 zhang et al 2010 have reported changes in physiochemical properties of ps after exposure to natural sunlight or uv irradiation identification of o containing functional groups such as carbonyl c o and carboxyl cooh groups after the aging process have been reported singh et al 2002 vicente et al 2009 similar phenomenon was also observed in our study as depicted by fig s4b psnps after uv irradiation exhibited a new adsorption peak at 1725 cm 1 which could be assigned to c o stretch of carboxyl group in addition this peak intensity increased with irradiation time from 12 to 24 h indicating the correlation between uv irradiation and formation of o containing functional groups on psnps this phenomenon was further verified by the right shift of titration curve fig 5c increased oxygen content as shown by xps fig s7b and the decreased hydrophobicity contact angle fig s8 after uv irradiation of psnps free radical reactions should play a vital role in formation of o containing functional groups on uv irradiated psnps singh et al 2002 bracco et al 2018 the detailed proposed reactions are given in the supporting information in brief uv irradiation breaks up psnps into h and r radicals which combine with oxygen to form peroxy radicals roo that sequentially react with ps and produce hydroperoxy rooh and alkyl radicals r rooh could be further broken down to alkoxy ro and hydroxyl oh radicals the products are formed when radicals combine with oxygen molecules added to aged psnps under uv irradiation overall we observed that after uv irradiation the colloidal stability of psnps was enhanced in nacl solution while reduced in cacl2 solution in the presence of na the enhanced stability of psnps was likely attributed to a ternary effect from uv irradiation i weakened van der waals attraction between aged psnps due to their reduced hamaker constants ii enhanced edl repulsion due to deprotonation of o containing functional groups formed on aged psnps iii steric hindrance between irradiated psnps arising from released organic matter in cacl2 solutions however the aggregation of uv irradiated psnps was enhanced because ca2 could specially bridge with o containing functional groups such as carboxyl formed due to uv irradiation qu et al 2010 masayuki et al 1996 4 conclusions results from this study suggested that fresh psnps with negative surface charge could remain stable against self aggregation in typical freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers but may aggregate in highly salty or acidic environments such as oceans however exposure to uv irradiation strongly affects the aggregation behavior of psnps as shown in this study uv irradiation induces o containing functional groups on aged psnps and enhances their colloid stability in nacl solution but facilitates their aggregation in the presence of cacl2 the aggregation behaviors of both fresh and uv irradiated psnps follow the classic dlvo theory and their fate and transport in aquatic systems may be predicated using their hamaker constants derived in this study it should be noted that natural organic matter nom as well as other suspended solids including clays and minerals are ubiquitous in aquatic environments these natural materials could interact with psnps and variously influence the aggregation state of psnps furthermore the oxygen containing functional groups formed on plastic particles due to uv irradiation may react with contaminants such as heavy metals or organic chemicals in the environment and affect their transport in aquatic systems although ps is widely found in natural environments other plastic materials should be considered in future studies to better evaluate the environmental fate and ecological risks of the

18592,nanoplastics nps derived from degradation of macroplastics and microplastics possess potential threat to aquatic biota and human health their fate and transport in aquatic systems are mainly governed by aging processes and aggregation behavior in this study we simulated plastic aging process using uv irradiation and compared the aggregation kinetics of fresh versus aged polystyrene nps psnps under aqueous conditions the results showed that fresh psnps had strong negative surface charge and exhibited both reaction and diffusion limited aggregation regimes in agreement with classic derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory divalent electrolytes were 10 15 times more effective in inducing psnp aggregation than monovalent electrolytes the aging process inhibited psnp aggregation in nacl solutions by increasing the negative charge on psnp surface and the organic matter content in solution while promoted psnp aggregation in cacl2 solutions due to interactions between ca2 and carboxyl groups formed on aged psnp surface such distinct behaviors were consistent with characterizations by contact angle measurements potentiometric titration total organic carbon toc analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps hamaker constants obtained from dlvo fitting decreased from 3 5 10 21 j for fresh psnps to 1 5 10 21 j for aged psnps this study indicated that uv irradiation plays a vital role in governing the fate transport and potential hazards of psnps in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords

global production of plastics increased from 62 million tons in 1979 to 160 and 311 million tons in 1999 and 2014 pardos marketing 2006 plasticseurope 2015 respectively after use a large fraction of solid plastic wastes is not recycled instead they are released into the environment where they accumulate and persist due to their strong stability against chemical and biological degradations rillig 2012 plastics in the environment undergo various natural processes and are broken down at slow but persistent rates into particles of different sizes ter halle et al 2016 microplastics are plastic particles with diameters less than 5 mm cole et al 2011 recent reports of their occurrences in aquatic environments e g ocean thompson et al 2004 river wang et al 2017 and lake su et al 2016 systems as well as terrestrial environments rillig 2012 have raised public concerns microplastics found in the environment are either primary or secondary cole et al 2011 primary plastics are intentionally manufactured as industrial abrasives or as ingredients of cosmetic products and secondary plastics are derived from environmental degradation of large sized plastic debris prior studies have shown

crab watts et al 2015 leading to potential adverse health effects microplastics can also affect the fate and transport of organic contaminants as well as heavy metals as they can release plastic additives such as plasticizers and flame retardants bakir et al 2012 brennecke et al 2016 mcdevitt et al 2017 the environmental degradation processes may further break down microplastics into smaller plastic particles such as nanoplastics nps several studies of microplastic samples collected from ocean surface indicated that nps are likely formed in aquatic environments due to degradation of plastics of all sizes cozar et al 2014 mattsson et al 2015 gigault et al 2016 in 2016 first showed the formation of nps by employing solar reactor to simulate the aging process of weathered microplastic samples collected from marine waters a later study in 2017 detected nps in natural water samples obtained from north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 nps may undergo aggregation process upon being released into aquatic systems which may affect their fate and transport as well as their potential risks to natural environments da costa et al 2016 besseling et al 2017 prior studies investigated the influence of water chemistry i e ph and ionic strength and natural organic matter on the aggregation kinetics of fresh nps in aqueous systems della torre et al 2014 found that fresh polystyrene nps psnps with size of 40 nm rapidly aggregated to millimeter spheres in natural seawater cai et al 2018 recently reported that the aggregation of psnps was influenced by solution electrolytes and dissolved natural organic matter nom long et al 2015 and galloway et al 2017 also observed that psnps tend to form aggregates in the presence of natural colloids and suspended solids it is known that plastics including nps undergo various aging processes that oxidize their surfaces and result in more abundant o containing functional groups e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups compared to fresh plastics singh et al 2002 bracco et al 2018 the aging process of nps in the environment may alter their colloidal stability and make them more dispersed or agminated in water which would consequently influence the environmental fate of other contaminants such as hydrophilic organic pollutants and heavy metals however the effects of such natural aging processes on the aggregation of nps are not well characterized in this study we hypothesized that such aging processes may change the surface charge density and even the hamaker constant of plastics which may influence their aggregation behavior in the environment the overall goal of this study was to investigate the effect of solar irradiation on the aggregation behavior of nps by characterizing the physicochemical properties of nps aged variously under laboratory conditions and quantifying the aggregation kinetics of the aged nps to make a pertinent comparison we used manufactured psnps as the model nps since ps is a typical plastic detected in the environment and commonly used in previous studies cai et al 2018 long et al 2015 galloway et al 2017 alimi et al 2018 uva was selected for inducing psnp aging process because it is the primary component of uv emission from solar irradiation reaching the earth surface and is the major wavelength range responsible for aging of engineered materials qu et al 2010 the physiochemical properties of psnps were characterized by transmission electron microscope tem dynamic light scattering dls potentiometric titration contact angle measurement total organic carbon toc analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to elucidate the aggregation mechanisms of fresh and aged psnps the aggregation kinetics of psnps before and after uv irradiation were measured under varying solution conditions of environmental relevance the aggregation data were used to calculate the critical coagulation concentrations cccs and to derive the hamaker constants for psnps at different aging states by model fitting based on the dlvo theory our results suggested that uv irradiation plays a vital role in the fate and transport of nps in natural aquatic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the psnp particles with diameter of 0 05 0 1 μm were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china according to the manufacturer the stock suspension contains 2 5 of psnps without surface modification 20 mg l of psnps working solution was prepared by diluting stock solution in 500 ml of ultrapure water monovalent i

solutions ranged from 0 02 to 2 and 0 002 0 2 m for monovalent and divalent salts respectively 2 2 aging experiment the aging experiments were conducted in a photochemical reactor nai ghy dsggy china equipped with a uv lamp ggz1000 λ 365 50 nm fig s1a the uv lamp used in our study could provide 2 34 mw cm2 1 71 mw cm2 after absorption by the sample quartz tube of light intensity as measured by a radiometer st 510 sentry optronics crop taipei taiwan of china which was comparable to the uva intensity measured at the ground surface on a sunny summer day in guangzhou city of guangdong province n 22 45 9496 e 113 56 3985 fig s1b separate batches containing 100 ml suspension of 100 mg l psnps were sealed with parafilm placed on the merry go round photoreactor surrounding the uv lamp and slowly stirred to ensure uniform exposure samples withdrawn on 1 3 5 9 12 and 24 h were stored in dark at 4 6 c before tests 2 3 characterization of psnps 2 3 1 size and zeta ζ potential measurements the size morphology and ζ potential of fresh and aged psnps were characterized with tem and dls for tem analysis the working suspension at ph 6 was dropped onto a 200 mesh carbon coated copper grid naturally dried at room temperature and then examined on a tem tecnai g20 fei crop usa operating at 200 kv the hydrodynamic size distributions of psnps were measured on a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk with the refractive and absorption indexes for psnps set at 1 59 and 0 01 respectively the particle electrophoretic mobilities epm over a range of electrolyte concentrations and ph were determined by phase analysis light scattering pals using the zetasizer nano zs90 instrument triplicate samples of each psnp were measured 10 times for epm which were converted to ζ potentials using the smoluchowski approximation smoluchowski 1903 2 3 2 contact angle measurement the fresh and aged psnp solution were filtered through an ultrafiltration membrane 3 kda sepro corporation using ultrafiltration cell yl 50 shanghai yuling filter equipment co ltd to form a psnp layer on the membrane the top layer was dried under nitrogen gas under room temperature static contact angles of probe liquids including water on the surface of psnp layer were measured at least three times at different locations by an optical contact angle measuring device oca15 dataphysics instruments gmbh germany 2 3 3 potentiometric titration 100 ml suspension containing 0 5 g l of fresh or aged psnps was prepared following the same procedure for working solution nitrogen gas was introduced to remove any dissolved co2 before hcl was added to lower solution ph to 3 the suspension was then kept in a nitrogen atmosphere while being titrated with 0 1 m naoh to ph 10 with an automatic potentiometric titrator zdj 4b shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china the volume of naoh required to raise the psnp suspension to ph 10 was compared to that for raising the ph of psnp free blank solutions to identify the presence of titratable functional groups on psnps 2 3 4 ftir analysis 50 ml of 500 mg l irradiated psnp suspension was withdrawn from the photochemical reactor at pre determined time and filtered through an ultrafiltration membrane 3 kda sepro corporation the psnp particles on the membrane surface were dried with nitrogen gas at room temperature and then mixed with kbr powder 1 before ftir thermo nicolet 6700 us spectra analysis 2 4 aggregation kinetics of fresh and aged psnps time resolved dynamic light scattering trdls was used to measure the increase in intensity weighted average hydrodynamic diameter d h of both fresh and irradiated psnps at 25 c under different solution chemistries as a function of time the zetasizer nano zs90 was employed for this experiment which uses a he ne laser operating at a wavelength of 633 nm and scattering angle of 90 for each aggregation experiment every separate aliquot including psnp suspension ultrapure water and electrolyte solution was adjusted to the same ph condition before test for the sake of environmental significance the concentration of psnps was set as 10 mg l such a level was used in several previous studies oncsik et al 2014 cai et al 2018 and might occur in contaminated natural aquatic systems enders et al 2015 horton et al 2017 gigault et al 2016 to initiate the aggregation experiment 1 ml of 20 mg l psnp suspension was first introduced into a pre cleaned new polystyrene cuvette dts0012 germany followed by addition of varying volumes of ultrapure water and electrolyte solution to form a total solution volume of 2 ml with predesigned electrolyte concentration this procedure ensured a constant initial psnp concentration n 0 at 10 mg l in each aggregation experiment the cuvette was vortexed for 1 s vortex genie fisher scientific and was immediately inserted into the dls instrument to start the measurement the change in d h of psnps was recorded with the autocorrelation function accumulated for a period of 15 s each aggregation experiment lasted between 20 and 100 min and all measurements were conducted in triplicates to ensure data quality the initial aggregation rate constant k is proportional to the initial rate of linear increase in d h and the inverse of n 0 holthoff et al 1996 1 k 1 n 0 d d n t d t t 0 where k was determined from the slope up to the point where d h increased to 1 5d h0 d h0 represents the initial d h the slope of the linear regime was still determined in cases where the linear regime ended before reaching 1 5d h0 the attachment efficiency α ranging from 0 to 1 was a key parameter to quantify the aggregation kinetics of psnps under different solution conditions since n 0 was maintained as constant at 10 mg l for each aggregation experiment α was calculated by normalizing k of aggregation in different solution chemistries by the slope obtained under diffusion limited k fast aggregation conditions saleh et al 2008 2

figs 1a and s2a show the size and morphology of fresh psnps examined under tem indicating that psnps assembled into regular microspheres with diameter of 100 nm figs 1c and s3 reveal the size distribution of psnps measured with dls with an average d h of 120 1 5 nm and a polydispersity index pdi of 0 085 0 05 the fresh psnps had strong negative surface charge with a ζ potential of 43 03 1 1 mv as measured at 1 mm nacl and ph 6 fig 2a which is a probable indicator for a stable suspension larsson et al 2012 in addition table s1 and fig s8a show the contact angle of 108 2 for water dropped on the surface containing fresh psnps which was indicative of their hydrophobic surface the representativeness of fresh psnps for ps materials was confirmed by ftir analyses in fig s4a showing comparable results with those obtained for ps standard typical adsorption peaks were identified at 1600 and 2920 cm 1 that corresponded to c c stretch of aromatic ring and aliphatic c h deformation respectively benzene ring vibration contributed to the adsorption peaks at 700 750 and 3020 cm 1 whereas the adsorption peaks at 1450 and 1490 cm 1 were attributed to aromatic c h deformation sertchook and avnir 2003 zhu et al 2001 jin et al 2015 our results showed that uv irradiation had strong aging effects on the properties of psnps after uva irradiation over 24 h the particle size of psnps decreased from 120 1 to 80 2 nm for d h as detected by dls fig 1 c and s3a c and from 100 to 50 nm as revealed by tem fig 1b and s2b f in addition after 24 h uv irradiation the toc concentration in solutions of the irradiated psnp samples increased from 4 88 to 44 01 mg l fig s3d and the psnp surface charge became more negative as ζ potentials decreased from 34 5 to 44 1 mv fig 3 d as shown in fig s8 and table s1 the contact angle decreased from 108 2 to 90 7 and 73 7 after 12 and 24 h uv irradiation respectively the decrease in particle size with prolonged irradiation could be related to the change in psnps surface structure likely due to chain scission by attacks from free radicals such as peroxyl roo alkoxyl ro and hydroxyl oh radicals bracco et al 2018 guo et al 2013 which may result in the increased toc content the more negative ζ potentials might be attributed to the induced o containing functional groups such as carboxyl group after irradiation as reflected by a new infrared adsorption peak at 1725 cm 1 fig s4b meanwhile the o containing functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl formed on surfaces of irradiated psnps could bind with water molecules via h bonding thus reducing their hydrophobicity as observed in fig s8 3 2 aggregation kinetics of fresh psnps the electrokinetic properties and aggregation kinetics of fresh psnps are presented in fig 2 in the presence of 100 1000 mm monovalent cations nacl and kcl or 10 100 mm divalent cations bacl2 cacl2 and mgcl2 at ph 6 which are representative of typical solution chemistries in surface water environments the ζ potentials of fresh psnps became less negative as electrolyte concentrations increased fig 2a the divalent cations ca2 ba2 and mg2 were more effective in screening the surface charge of psnps than monovalent cations na and k as expected fig 2b presents the representative aggregation profiles showing the increase in d h over time at different nacl concentrations d h remained unchanged at 100 mm nacl above which psnps aggregation started to occur with the rate increasing with nacl concentration e g 300 350 400 and 550 mm at higher nacl concentrations however the aggregation rate did not further increase due to the completely eliminated energy barrier between psnp particles chen et al 2006 such aggregation behavior of psnps was dominated by the interplay between van der waals attractive force and electrical double layer edl repulsive force as depicted by the classic dlvo theory mylon et al 2004 meng et al 2013 chen and huang 2017a by normalizing the initial slope of the aggregation rate using eq 2 the attachment efficiencies α of fresh psnps in the presence of different electrolytes were obtained to construct the stability profile in fig 2c fresh psnps exhibited both distinct reaction limited α 1 and diffusion limited α 1 aggregation regimes in all studied electrolytes at low electrolyte concentrations the aggregation process was reaction limited since increased salt concentrations led to charge screening on psnps and lowered the energy barrier to be overcome for aggregation to occur however when electrolyte concentrations reached the ccc which is the minimum electrolyte concentration to induce diffusion limited fast aggregation the energy barrier was completely screened and van der waals attractive force dominated the particle interactions li et al 2018 the ccc value for each electrolyte was calculated by fitting the stability profile with eq 3 grolimund et al 2001 3 α 1 1 c c c c s β where c s is the molar concentration of electrolyte and β is the slope of d log α d log c s all stability curves could be well fitted by eq 3 yielding the respective ccc values of 29 33 44 440 and 450 mm for bacl2 cacl2 mgcl2 kcl and nacl for fresh psnps the colloidal stability of nanoparticles against aggregation generally increases with the ccc value fig 2c such trend of inducing psnp aggregation by these cations is consistent with the ζ potential results in fig 2a that divalent cations had greater effects on destabilizing psnps than monovalent cations and that they followed the order of ba2 ca2 mg2 k na the ccc values for divalent electrolytes were approximately 10 15 times higher than those for monovalent electrolytes with the ratio between ca2 and na being proportional to z 3 78 where z 2 is the counterion valence this is reasonable since the proportionality of colloidal particles could range from z 2 to z 6 schulze hardy rule elimelech et al 1995 the ccc values of 450 mm for monovalent salts and 33 mm for divalent salts for fresh psnps were significantly higher than those reported for micro ps in the literature for instance the ccc values were reported as 14 9 mm nacl and 2 95 mm cacl2 for micro ps with an average diameter of 17 9 μm and ζ potentials of 22 mv in 1 mm nacl and 0 2 mm cacl2 li et al 2018 our reported ccc values for fresh psnps were also higher than other nanomaterials such as carbonaceous nanoparticles e g fullerene chen and elimelech 2006 activated carbon chen and huang 2017a and soot chen and huang 2017b and metal oxide nanoparticles e g tio2 liu et al 2011 similar results were observed for nano ps by zhang zhang 1987 who reported ccc values of 300 mm monovalent electrolytes and 34 mm divalent electrolytes for nano ps with an average diameter of 48 4 nm and ζ potential of 23 mv at ccc this should be related to the nanoscale construction and the more negative surface charge of fresh psnps it should be noted that the determined ccc values for fresh psnps are well above the salt concentrations found in typical freshwater environments yang et al 2017 but below those in seawater hem 1985 hence considering only the effects of solution chemistries herein fresh psnps should remain relatively stable against homo aggregation under typical freshwater and estuary conditions but may aggregate in seawater environments 3 3 effects of aging on colloidal stability of psnps the colloid stability of psnps is strongly dependent upon their physiochemical properties including surface functional groups and hydrophobicity xu et al 2017 it is expected that sunlight exposure especially in the uva range would modify the physiochemical properties of psnps and thus influence their aggregation behavior fig 3a and b compared the attachment efficiencies for psnps before and after different durations of uva exposure in nacl and cacl2 solutions respectively these stability profiles were fitted with eq 3 to determine their ccc values at different exposure time which were plotted in fig 3c it could be seen that the ccc values increased linearly with uva irradiation time in the presence of nacl while the opposite was observed in cacl2 solutions this indicated that uv irradiation enhanced the colloidal stability of psnps in nacl solutions while destabilized psnps in cacl2 such trends are similar to a previous study on uv irradiated fullerene nanoparticles qu et al 2010 in general the ζ potential of psnps became more negative with longer exposure to uv irradiation with an exception that after the first hour it became less negative fig 3d the elevated negative surface charge could be attributed to the formation of o containing functional groups e g carboxyl groups as shown in fig s4 after 1 h irradiation however loss of sulfate group from psnp surface may occur that resulted in the less negative ζ potential fig s7d which was then shielded by the formation of more o containing functional groups on psnps with extended irradiation time distinct aggregation behaviors were observed for uv irradiated psnps in nacl and cacl2 solutions because na encompasses a compact water shell and acts as an indifferent counterion it solely affects the thickness of electrical double layer of psnps in aqueous solution therefore the colloid stability of psnps increased with irradiation time in nacl solution due to enhanced negative surface charge in addition irradiated psnps may release organic matter into suspension as evident from the increased toc content with irradiation time resulting in stabilization of psnps due to steric hindering effect fig s3d on the other hand o containing functional groups can bridge with ca2 that consequently promoted the aggregation of uv irradiated psnps in cacl2 solutions 3 4 hamaker constants of psnps derived from dlvo theory the experimentally determined attachment efficiencies α for fresh and uv irradiated psnps in nacl solutions were simulated with the classic dlvo theory using eq 4 for identical sphere sphere interactions chen and elimelech 2006 zhu et al 2014 xu et al 2015 from which the hamaker constants for psnps at different aging status could be derived 4 α 0 β h exp v a h k b t d h 2 r h 2 0 β h exp v t h k b t d h 2 r h 2 where h is the separation distance between the surface of two approaching particles r is hydrodynamic radius of the particles k b is the boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature the dimensionless function β h was employed to correct for the hydrodynamic resistance according to honig et al 1971 the total interactions energy v t is calculated as the sum of van der waals attraction v a and the edl repulsion v r assuming sphere sphere interactions between two identical psnps the constant potential approximation cpa expression was employed to calculate for v r and the expression proposed by gregory gregory 1981 for retarded van der waals interactions was used to calculate for v a see detailed calculations in the supporting information the data of dlvo predication was calculated by matlab r2016b software mathworks natick ma the hamaker constant for psnps which affects the position of ccc in the dlvo prediction was the sole fitting parameter during the fitting process chen and huang 2017b the hamaker constants for psnps in water a pwp at different irradiation time were optimized by matching the corresponding theoretical ccc values with the ones obtained experimentally in nacl solutions note that to calculate for the attachment efficiencies of psnps at different irradiation times their respective d h values were employed in the calculations fig 4 a compares the experimentally derived attachment efficiencies of fresh psnps with dlvo predications in the presence of nacl at ph 6 good agreement was found between dlvo predictions and the experimental data both in the reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes this indicated that the aggregation behavior of fresh psnps follows the dlvo theory and is similar to typical spherical colloids the hamaker constant as a key parameter for evaluating the van der waals attraction between interacting particles was related to their material properties and the interacting medium elimelech et al 1995 in this study the value of hamaker constant a pwp for fresh psnps in aqueous medium was determined by colloidal chemistry method as 3 5 10 21 j this value falls between the theoretical values reported for nano ps materials 1 03 11 00 10 21 j ottewill and shaw 1966 with the range depending upon the irregular space configuration and anchored functional group of ps polymer formed in the polymerization process our reported hamaker constant for psnps is smaller than those reported for other nanomaterials such as fullerene 6 7 8 5 10 21 j chen and elimelech 2006 2009 activated carbon 2 1 2 7 10 20 j chen and huang 2017a and anatase tio2 6 5 10 20 j liu et al 2011 indicating the weaker van der waal attraction and thus the stronger colloidal stability for psnps compared to other nanomaterials as discussed above the hamaker constant for fresh psnps interacting in vacuum a pp can be calculated via the following equation israelachvili 2011 5 a p w p a p p a w w 2 where a ww is the hamaker constant for water interacting in a vacuum and is assumed to be 3 7 10 20 j israelachvili 2011 a pp was determined as 6 33 10 20 j for fresh psnps in vacuum using the colloidal chemistry approach which is slightly smaller than the value reported for ps materials in the literature 7 9 10 20 j israelachvili 2011 this derived value of hamaker constant for psnps in vacuum media could be an addition to the data archive for ps materials furthermore it is likely that different types of plastics possessing various polymeric structures may have different hamaker constant values e g 7 5 10 20 j for polyvinyl chloride pvc and 3 8 10 20 j for polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe israelachvili 2011 it is known that the van der waals attraction is positively correlated with both the hamaker constant and the particle size eq s 4 in the supplementary data having a hamaker constant greater than ptfe nps but smaller than pvc nps psnps should possess van der waals attraction stronger than ptfe nps but smaller than pvc nps as a result their aggregation rates may follow the same order when other conditions remain constant the derived hamaker constant can be used to predict the stability of fresh psnps under aqueous conditions at various nacl concentrations for instance figs 4b and s5 present the total interaction energy profiles for two approaching psnps as a function of separation distance in different nacl concentration the energy barrier decreased with increasing nacl concentration due to charge screening that resulted in a higher tendency for psnps to aggregate as the electrolyte concentration exceeded the ccc the energy barrier was completely eliminated to zero where the van der waals attraction dominated the particle interactions the hamaker constant is an intrinsic parameter for ps materials and is vital for predicating their colloid stability in aquatic environments in this study we found that exposure to uv irradiation could alter the inherent structure of psnps and thus change their hamaker constant values as presented in fig 4c good consistency was still observed between the dlvo prediction and experimental data for psnps irradiated for different time the hamaker constants for psnps decreased from 3 5 to 1 5 10 21 j as the irradiation time increased from 0 to 24 h as the hamaker constant is only relevant to material properties it may imply a structural change for aged psnps after uv exposure within only 1 day such reduced hamaker constant for uv irradiated psnps may lower their van der waals attraction and thus enhance their colloid stability compared to fresh psnps indicating a more dispersed and mobile nature of aged psnps present in aquatic environments as nanomaterials 3 5 solution ph effects the solution ph may alter the surface charge of psnps and thus affect their aggregation behavior li et al 2018 lu et al 2018 the aggregation rates k of fresh psnps in the presence of 400 mm nacl were investigated at ph 3 6 and 10 which decreased from 1 35 to 0 43 and 0 19 nm s as ph increased figs s6a and s6b the attachment efficiencies were further investigated at ph 3 4 6 8 and 10 in nacl solutions to construct the psnp stability curves by normalizing the initial slopes of the aggregation profiles fig 5 a it is evident that the stability of psnps increased with ph which agrees with their more negative ζ potentials at higher ph fig s6c the surface charge of fresh psnps remained strongly negative over a wide ph range from 3 to 10 at low nacl concentrations which might be attributed to the sulfate groups attached to ps surface during polymerization lu et al 2018 dong 2005 ou et al 2001 as well as the hydroxyl groups adsorbed to ps surface from solution an elevated ph may promote the adsorption of hydroxyl groups onto psnp surfaces resulting in more negative ζ potentials in suspension this prevented psnps from aggregation as indicated by the increase in cccs from 300 to 500 mm nacl when ph increased from 3 to 10 inset of fig s6c after uv irradiation more o containing functional groups were detected in aged psnps which contained more negatively charged particle surface that prevented them from self aggregation the effects of ph on stability of psnps irradiated for 24 h were quantified at ph 3 4 6 8 and 10 fig 5b similar trends were observed for fresh and uv irradiated psnps that their stability both increased with ph and the stability of aged psnps was enhanced compared with fresh psnps in the same nacl solutions to elucidate the origin of negative surface charge on psnps in aqueous solutions potentiometric titration was conducted for fresh and aged 24 h uv irradiated psnp suspensions fig 5c results showed that suspensions with fresh or aged psnps both required more naoh for titration compared to the blank suspensions without the presence of psnps it indicates that both fresh and aged psnps contained acidic functional groups that may dissociate at solution ph above 5 this phenomenon was consistent with the ftir results fig s4 which identified the existence of o containing functional groups such as hydroxyl groups meanwhile aged psnps contained more acidic functional groups than fresh psnps which agrees with previous discussions that uv irradiation enhanced psnps stability in nacl solutions 3 6 aggregation mechanisms for uv irradiated psnps uva is the primary component of uv light in solar radiation that can reach the earth surface possessing high energy capacity to penetrate materials and be absorbed therefore exposure to uva in natural environments likely results in material aging ps is a representative plastic material sensitive to uv irradiation in wavelength of 318 nm tang and tuo 2016 previous studies singh et al 2002 bottino et al 2004 zhang et al 2010 have reported changes in physiochemical properties of ps after exposure to natural sunlight or uv irradiation identification of o containing functional groups such as carbonyl c o and carboxyl cooh groups after the aging process have been reported singh et al 2002 vicente et al 2009 similar phenomenon was also observed in our study as depicted by fig s4b psnps after uv irradiation exhibited a new adsorption peak at 1725 cm 1 which could be assigned to c o stretch of carboxyl group in addition this peak intensity increased with irradiation time from 12 to 24 h indicating the correlation between uv irradiation and formation of o containing functional groups on psnps this phenomenon was further verified by the right shift of titration curve fig 5c increased oxygen content as shown by xps fig s7b and the decreased hydrophobicity contact angle fig s8 after uv irradiation of psnps free radical reactions should play a vital role in formation of o containing functional groups on uv irradiated psnps singh et al 2002 bracco et al 2018 the detailed proposed reactions are given in the supporting information in brief uv irradiation breaks up psnps into h and r radicals which combine with oxygen to form peroxy radicals roo that sequentially react with ps and produce hydroperoxy rooh and alkyl radicals r rooh could be further broken down to alkoxy ro and hydroxyl oh radicals the products are formed when radicals combine with oxygen molecules added to aged psnps under uv irradiation overall we observed that after uv irradiation the colloidal stability of psnps was enhanced in nacl solution while reduced in cacl2 solution in the presence of na the enhanced stability of psnps was likely attributed to a ternary effect from uv irradiation i weakened van der waals attraction between aged psnps due to their reduced hamaker constants ii enhanced edl repulsion due to deprotonation of o containing functional groups formed on aged psnps iii steric hindrance between irradiated psnps arising from released organic matter in cacl2 solutions however the aggregation of uv irradiated psnps was enhanced because ca2 could specially bridge with o containing functional groups such as carboxyl formed due to uv irradiation qu et al 2010 masayuki et al 1996 4 conclusions results from this study suggested that fresh psnps with negative surface charge could remain stable against self aggregation in typical freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers but may aggregate in highly salty or acidic environments such as oceans however exposure to uv irradiation strongly affects the aggregation behavior of psnps as shown in this study uv irradiation induces o containing functional groups on aged psnps and enhances their colloid stability in nacl solution but facilitates their aggregation in the presence of cacl2 the aggregation behaviors of both fresh and uv irradiated psnps follow the classic dlvo theory and their fate and transport in aquatic systems may be predicated using their hamaker constants derived in this study it should be noted that natural organic matter nom as well as other suspended solids including clays and minerals are ubiquitous in aquatic environments these natural materials could interact with psnps and variously influence the aggregation state of psnps furthermore the oxygen containing functional groups formed on plastic particles due to uv irradiation may react with contaminants such as heavy metals or organic chemicals in the environment and affect their transport in aquatic systems although ps is widely found in natural environments other plastic materials should be considered in future studies to better evaluate the environmental fate and ecological risks of the emerging plastic wastes in aquatic systems acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 41773107 and the science and technology

polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and nylon filters at pfas concentrations less than 100 μg l after the filtration of pfas solutions adsorption of long chain pfas on the filter media was significant and the losses were more pronounced for sulfonated pfass than carboxylic pfas thus filters were not used in this study and centrifugation was utilized for all samples blank experiments were run and no change in pfas concentration was observed due to using pp bottles further another set of blank samples were run with only dmapaa q polymer leaching of pfas from polymer were observed experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were reported as an average standard deviation effect of ph to evaluate the effect of ph on the pfas removal efficiency by dmapaa q polymer experiments were run

cl g a q dmapaa q g a q pfas geometries and energies were calculated with density functional theory dft in the gaussian09 package frisch et al 2008 using the cam b3lyp density functional yanai et al 2004 with the 6 31 g d p basis set we chose this hybrid functional due to its improved long range properties which should better capture the electronic effects of charged anionic and cationic species the addition of diffuse functions to the basis set for the non hydrogen atoms was done for the same reasoning additional dispersion corrections were added for these calculations using the d3 correction method of grimme et al with becke jonson bj damping grimme et al 2011 as implemented in the gaussian09 package further details for dft modeling are provided in section s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of poly dmapaa q hydrogel the surface area of the dmapaa q polymer was 5 7 m2 g as shown in fig 1 a the ftir spectra of the dmapaa q polymer showed its characteristic absorption peaks at 3349 cm 1 o h stretching 3225 cm 1 n h stretching 2945 cm 1 alkane group stretching 1652 cm 1 co and 1547 cm 1 c n he et al 2016 wang et al 2017a as shown in fig 1b the tga curves for the poly dmapaa q gels showed two stage decompositions the first 5 12 mass loss at 25 150 c was attributed to the evaporation of water molecules i e free water physically absorbed water and bound water the second stage accounted for 95 mass loss at 300 490 c and was attributed to the thermal decomposition of the polymeric structure before the formation of the final carbonaceous residues the poly dmapaa q hydrogel with its positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and imine groups had a measured ph of the point of zero charges phpzc of 11 8 fig 1c 3 2 pfas removal kinetics by poly dmapaa q hydrogel the removal kinetics of five sulfonic pfas five carboxylic pfas three replacement analogues and three pfas precursors are shown in fig 2 and fig s1 for the target 11 short chain c4 7 and 5 long chain c8 10 pfas the poly dmapaa q hydrogel exhibited fast removal of all compounds with equilibrium time of 2 h the removal of sulfonic pfas was higher than carboxylic pfas regardless of their chain lengths a recent study by wang et al 2019 has tested the removal of genx initial concentration 5 10 4 μg l by gac and ix resins and reported that the adsorption equilibrium time was 9 24 h and 40 60 h respectively to the best of our knowledge chemically cross linked poly dmapaa q hydrogel is the first adsorbent to effectively remove short chain pfas and other replacement analogues e g genx at low concentration conditions only one study by ji et al 2018 reported on the removal of genx and other pfas at low initial concentration of 1 μg l using new cofs however desorption of genx and short chain pfas by 20 100 was observed when the experimental time was extended from 1 h to 24 h the low removal of short chain pfas and genx on previously reported sorbents could be attributed to their hydrophilic character which results in 1 low adsorption affinity on the surface of adsorbents ji et al 2018 and 2 the displacement of genx and short chain pfas by long chain pfas and or other background components that are more hydrophobic mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2019 3 3 effect of ph on pfas removal by poly dmapaa q hydrogel the pfas removal by the poly dmapaa q hydrogel was further evaluated under a wide range of ph 4 10 as shown in fig 3 the polymer maintained high pfas removal at all tested ph values these observations indicate that no ph adjustment will be required when using this polymer which can be an added value for practical applications previous studies showed a decreasing trend in pfas adsorption on gac du et al 2014 kothawala et al 2017 ix resins mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2019 and other polymers ateia et al 2018a when increasing the solution s ph the reported reduction maybe attributed to the reduction in the number of positive active sites on the adsorbents at elevated ph values 3 4 effect of background water matrix on pfas removal dom is ubiquitous in natural waters and wastewaters with orders of magnitudes higher concentrations than pfas ateia et al 2017a shimizu et al 2018 rahman et al 2014 limited number of studies have investigated adsorption at environmentally relevant conditions i e pfas concentrations at ng l levels in a matrix with dom and other components yet current literature suggests that pfas removal by gac and ix resins dramatically decreases when tested in environmental water samples in both batch and column modes with higher desorption rates of short chain pfas kothawala et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 in our recent study dom did not affect pfas removal by pei f cmc however the removal of short chain pfas was generally lower than long chain pfas ateia et al 2018a we addressed that issue in the present study through testing poly dmapaa q hydrogel to remove pfas from two surface waters as well as one treated wastewater detailed water characteristics are listed in table s2 blank experiments showed that the background pfas in surface waters were below the detection limit of 5 ng l and only pfbs pfhxa and pfos were detected in the treated wastewater sample at concentrations of 51 8 35 3 and 25 2 ng l respectively as shown in fig 4 the polymer showed very high pfas removal selectivity in all waters although the dom concentration was 2 5 0 3 106 times higher than pfas in addition no difference in pfas removal was observed after 1 h and 24 h data not shown which confirmed that the polymer exhibited high adsorption kinetics regardless of the background water matrix it should be highlighted that the overall pfas removal from the treated wastewater was 10 20 lower than the removal from surface waters the organic carbon contents were comparable in all three waters however the treated wastewater had lower specific ultraviolet absorbance i e less aromatic and higher background anions table s2 to elucidate the effect of each component i e background organics and anions on pfas removal by poly dmapaa q hydrogel experiments were run at increasing dom concentrations in solutions co dosed with dom powder table 1 the doc removals by poly dmapaa q hydrogel were 86 3 and 77 4 at initial doc concentrations of 2 5 mg l and 5 0 mg l respectively yet the pfas removal efficiency was only decreased by 5 10 when the dom concentration was doubled from 2 5 mg c l to 5 mg c l fig s5 in addition the polymer removal of long chain pfas was marginally influenced by increasing background anions concentrations i e cl no3 and so4 2 fig s2 s4 however sorption of short chain pfas and particularly carboxylic pfas were significantly decreased by increasing anions concentrations apparently hydrophobic interaction is the main removal mechanism for long chain and sulfonic pfas while electrostatic interaction is responsible for the removal of other pfas that were influenced by the increased anions concentrations the impact of anions on pfas removal by poly dmapaa q hydrogel followed an order of so4 2 cl no3 figs s2 s4 it was hypothesized that background anions can potentially compete for the sorption sites and or salt out pfas i e decrease their water solubility du et al 2015 liu et al 2018 3 5 regeneration of poly dmapaa q hydrogel the regeneration of adsorbents is an important factor when considering the practical applications ateia et al 2017b 2018b in this study the poly dmapaa q hydrogel 25 mg was mixed with 50 ml of pfas solution 10 mg l for 6 h then the spent adsorbents were collected by centrifugation 10 000 rpm and the pfas desorption was performed in 50 ml of nacl methanol solution the performance of the polymer was maintained in six consecutive adsorption desorption cycles to remove genx pfba and pfoa fig 5 it must be highlighted that the adsorption reversibility was not affected by the lake water matrix fig 5a and b these results illustrate the facile and high regeneration capability of this hydrogel polymer as a promising adsorbent for different classes of pfas 3 6 density functional theory dft modeling dft calculations were conducted to provide insight into the preferred adsorption location and the strength of the binding interaction between dmapaa q and various pfas compounds utilizing a model pentamer of dmapaa q the electrostatic potential surface esp was calculated fig 6 a and showed that the entirety of the polymer is positively charged with higher positive regions near the quaternary ammonium groups compared to other regions of the polymer then five anionic forms of pfas adsorbates gen x pfba pfoa pfbs and pfos were positioned over the highly positively charged quaternary ammonium group to measure the adsorption strength overall the three carboxylic pfas fig 6b d showed favorable exergonic interaction energies ranging from 11 65 to 28 27 kj mol which suggest a comparable adsorption behavior between the tested compounds the two sulfonic pfas fig 6e f showed significantly stronger exergonic energies than carboxylic pfas that ranged from 79 95 to 82 59 kj mol these observations were consistent with the experimental results shown in fig 2 additional dft discussion is provided in section s2 4 conclusions overall a covalently cross linked poly dmapaa q hydrogel prepared and used in this work is the first material to demonstrate high adsorption of short and long chain legacy and emerging pfas under environmentally relevant concentrations the polymer hydrogels selectivity was tested in two surface water and a treated wastewater with varying background anions and dom compositions the removal was fast and stable and the polymer regeneration was feasible this study have also showed for the first time the binding mechanisms and energies using dft the findings from this study suggest that future studies should test the potential of applying poly dmapaa q hydrogel for continuous flow systems

zero charge phpzc was carefully determined following our previous study dastgheib et al 2004 2 3 adsorption experiments adsorption kinetics each data point of the kinetic experiments was determined by an individual batch experiment in polypropylene bottles at a ph value of 6 5 0 2 the adsorption kinetics was tested at initial pfas concentration of 1 μg l with adsorbent concentration of 70 mg l the mixtures were shaken at room temperature 25 1 c on an orbit shaker at 150 rpm after certain time intervals samples were collected centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 30 s and the supernatant was kept refrigerated until further measurements it must be mentioned that significant losses were observed when different filter s types were used for sample separation e g polyethersulfone pes polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and nylon filters at pfas concentrations less than 100 μg l after the filtration of pfas solutions adsorption of long chain pfas on the filter media was significant and the losses were more pronounced for sulfonated pfass than carboxylic pfas thus filters were not used in this study and centrifugation was utilized for all samples blank experiments were run and no change in pfas concentration was observed due to using pp bottles further another set of blank samples were run with only dmapaa q polymer leaching of pfas from polymer were observed experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were reported as an average standard deviation effect of ph to evaluate the effect of ph on the pfas removal efficiency by dmapaa q polymer experiments were run at ph values of 4 6 8 and 10 by adding certain amounts of 0 1 m naoh or hcl solutions experiments were performed in 50 ml pp bottles containing 70 mg l of the polymer and pfas concentration of 1 μg l bottles were shaken at room temperature 25 1 c on an orbit shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h to reach equilibrium an aliquot of all other samples was centrifuged at 13000 rpm and the supernatant was transferred to lc vials for lc ms control experiments were performed and no losses were observed experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were reported as an average standard deviation experiments in surface water and wastewater for evaluating the removal efficiencies of different pfass by dmapaa q polymer experiments were carried out with two different surface waters and one treated wastewater the water quality characteristics were summarized in table 1 all water samples were checked for background pfas concentrations each water solution was spiked with the 16 pfas mixture solution to achieve an initial concentration of 1 μg l of each compound the dmapaa q polymers was added at a concentration of 70 mg l the final ph of the three solutions after adding the polymer and pfass was 6 6 0 15 the experiments were performed in 250 ml pp bottles and the mixtures were shaken at room temperature 25 1 c on an orbit shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h after adsorption tests all samples were concentrated by spe and then transferred to lc vials for lc ms measurements control experiments were performed and no losses were observed experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were reported as an average standard deviation the same procedure was repeated to test the effect of dissolved organic carbon doc concentration on pfas removal in solutions co dosed with dissolved organic matter dom powder ch sample in table 1 effect of background anions to evaluate the effect of background anions on the pfas removal efficiency by dmapaa q polymer experiments were run at elevated concentrations of cl 25 150 mg l so4 2 25 150 mg l and no3 5 50 mg l experiments were performed in 50 ml pp bottles containing 100 mg l of the polymer and pfas concentration of 5 μg l after treatment samples were extracted as described above effect of ph at the same experimental conditions regeneration experiments adsorption desorption experiments were extended to six regeneration cycles in both distilled deionized water and lake water hr in table 1 adsorption experiments 25 mg of dmapaa q polymers was added to pp vials containing 50 ml of pfas solution with of 10 mg l of pfba pfoa and genx the vials were shaken at room temperature 25 1 c on an orbit shaker at 150 rpm for 6 h the resulting suspension centrifuged at 13 000 rpm and the supernatant was transferred to lc vials and the residual pfas concentration was measured by lc ms ms desorption experiments the spent dmapaa q polymer i e pfas loaded was regenerated by soaking in 50 ml regeneration solution containing 1 nacl methanol 30 70 v v and shaking 150 rpm for 12 h and recovered by centrifugation then the pfas concentration in 1 nacl methanol supernatant was measured by lc ms ms and the polymer particles were used for the next adsorption cycle 2 4 density functional theory dft modeling the adsorption energies for five anionic forms of pfas adsorbates gen x pfba pfoa pfbs and pfos were theoretically determined using the following reaction image 2 this binding energy for this reaction was calculated using the following equation δ g a d g a q dmapaa q pfas g g a s h δ g s o l h g g a s cl δ g s o l cl g a q dmapaa q g a q pfas geometries and energies were calculated with density functional theory dft in the gaussian09 package frisch et al 2008 using the cam b3lyp density functional yanai et al 2004 with the 6 31 g d p basis set we chose this hybrid functional due to its improved long range properties which should better capture the electronic effects of charged anionic and cationic species the addition of diffuse functions to the basis set for the non hydrogen atoms was done for the same reasoning additional dispersion corrections were added for these calculations using the d3 correction method of grimme et al with becke jonson bj damping grimme et al 2011 as implemented in the gaussian09 package further details for dft modeling are provided in section s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of poly dmapaa q hydrogel the surface area of the dmapaa q polymer was 5 7 m2 g as shown in fig 1 a the ftir spectra of the dmapaa q polymer showed its characteristic absorption peaks at 3349 cm 1 o h stretching 3225 cm 1 n h stretching 2945 cm 1 alkane group stretching 1652 cm 1 co and 1547 cm 1 c n he et al 2016 wang et al 2017a as shown in fig 1b the tga curves for the poly dmapaa q gels showed two stage decompositions the first 5 12 mass loss at 25 150 c was attributed to the evaporation of water molecules i e free water physically absorbed water and bound water the second stage accounted for 95 mass loss at 300 490 c and was attributed to the thermal decomposition of the polymeric structure before the formation of the final carbonaceous residues the poly dmapaa q hydrogel with its positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and imine groups had a measured ph of the point of zero charges phpzc of 11 8 fig 1c 3 2 pfas removal kinetics by poly dmapaa q hydrogel the removal kinetics of five sulfonic pfas five carboxylic pfas three replacement analogues and three pfas precursors are shown in fig 2 and fig s1 for the target 11 short chain c4 7 and 5 long chain c8 10 pfas the poly dmapaa q hydrogel exhibited fast removal of all compounds with equilibrium time of 2 h the removal of sulfonic pfas was higher than carboxylic pfas regardless of their chain lengths a recent study by wang et al 2019 has tested the removal of genx initial concentration 5 10 4 μg l by gac and ix resins and reported that the adsorption equilibrium time was 9 24 h and 40 60 h respectively to the best of our knowledge chemically cross linked poly dmapaa q hydrogel is the first adsorbent to effectively remove short chain pfas and other replacement analogues e g genx at low concentration conditions only one study by ji et al 2018 reported on the removal of genx and other pfas at low initial concentration of 1 μg l using new cofs however desorption of genx and short chain pfas by 20 100 was observed when the experimental time was extended from 1 h to 24 h the low removal of short chain pfas and genx on previously reported sorbents could be attributed to their hydrophilic character which results in 1 low adsorption affinity on the surface of adsorbents ji et al 2018 and 2 the displacement of genx and short chain pfas by long chain pfas and or other background components that are more hydrophobic mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2019 3 3 effect of ph on pfas removal by poly dmapaa q hydrogel the pfas removal by the poly dmapaa q hydrogel was further evaluated under a wide range of ph 4 10 as shown in fig 3 the polymer maintained high pfas removal at all tested ph values these observations indicate that no ph adjustment will be required when using this polymer which can be an added value for practical applications previous studies showed a decreasing trend in pfas adsorption on gac du et al 2014 kothawala et al 2017 ix resins mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2019 and other polymers ateia et al 2018a when increasing the solution s ph the reported reduction maybe attributed to the reduction in the number of positive active sites on the adsorbents at elevated ph values 3 4 effect of background water matrix on pfas removal dom is ubiquitous in natural waters and wastewaters with orders of magnitudes higher concentrations than pfas ateia et al 2017a shimizu et al 2018 rahman et al 2014 limited number of studies have investigated adsorption at environmentally relevant conditions i e pfas concentrations at ng l levels in a matrix with dom and other components yet current literature suggests that pfas removal by gac and ix resins dramatically decreases when tested in environmental water samples in both batch and column modes with higher desorption rates of short chain pfas kothawala et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 in our recent study dom did not affect pfas removal by pei f cmc however the removal of short chain pfas was generally lower than long chain pfas ateia et al 2018a we addressed that issue in the present study through testing poly dmapaa q hydrogel to remove pfas from two surface waters as well as one treated wastewater detailed water characteristics are listed in table s2 blank experiments showed that the background pfas in surface waters were below the detection limit of 5 ng l and only pfbs pfhxa and pfos were detected in the treated wastewater sample at concentrations of 51 8 35 3 and 25 2 ng l respectively as shown in fig 4 the polymer showed very high pfas removal selectivity in all waters although the dom concentration was 2 5 0 3 106 times higher than pfas in addition no difference in pfas removal was observed after 1 h and 24 h data not shown which confirmed that the polymer exhibited high adsorption kinetics regardless of the background water matrix it should be highlighted that the overall pfas removal from the treated wastewater was 10 20 lower than the removal from surface waters the organic carbon contents were comparable in all three waters however the treated wastewater had lower specific ultraviolet absorbance i e less aromatic and higher background anions table s2 to elucidate the effect of each component i e background organics and anions on pfas removal by poly dmapaa q hydrogel experiments were run at increasing dom concentrations in solutions co dosed with dom powder table 1 the doc removals by poly dmapaa q hydrogel were 86 3 and 77 4 at initial doc concentrations of 2 5 mg l and 5 0 mg l respectively yet the pfas removal efficiency was only decreased by 5 10 when the dom concentration was doubled from 2 5 mg c l to 5 mg c l fig s5 in addition the polymer removal of long chain pfas was marginally influenced by increasing background anions concentrations i e cl no3 and so4 2 fig s2 s4 however sorption of short chain pfas and particularly carboxylic pfas were significantly decreased by increasing anions concentrations apparently hydrophobic interaction is the main removal mechanism for long chain and sulfonic pfas while electrostatic interaction is responsible for the removal of other pfas that were influenced by the increased anions concentrations the impact of anions on pfas removal by poly dmapaa q hydrogel followed an order of so4 2 cl no3 figs s2 s4 it was hypothesized that background anions can potentially compete for the sorption sites and or salt out pfas i e decrease their water solubility du et al 2015 liu et al 2018 3 5 regeneration of poly dmapaa q hydrogel the regeneration of adsorbents is an important factor when considering the practical applications ateia et al 2017b 2018b in this study the poly dmapaa q hydrogel 25 mg was mixed with 50 ml of pfas solution 10 mg l for 6 h then the spent adsorbents were collected by centrifugation 10 000 rpm and the pfas desorption was performed in 50 ml of nacl methanol solution the performance of the polymer was maintained in six consecutive adsorption desorption cycles to remove genx pfba and pfoa fig 5 it must be highlighted that the adsorption reversibility was not affected by the lake water matrix fig 5a and b these results illustrate the facile and high regeneration capability of this hydrogel polymer as a promising adsorbent for different classes of pfas 3 6 density functional theory dft modeling dft calculations were conducted to provide insight into the preferred adsorption location and the strength of the binding interaction between dmapaa q and various pfas compounds utilizing a model pentamer of dmapaa q the electrostatic potential surface esp was calculated fig 6 a and showed that the entirety of the polymer is positively charged with higher positive regions near the quaternary ammonium groups compared to other regions of the polymer then five anionic forms of pfas adsorbates gen x pfba pfoa pfbs and pfos were positioned over the highly positively charged quaternary ammonium group to measure the adsorption strength overall the three carboxylic pfas fig 6b d showed favorable exergonic interaction energies ranging from 11 65 to 28 27 kj mol which suggest a comparable adsorption behavior between the tested compounds the two sulfonic pfas fig 6e f showed significantly stronger exergonic energies than carboxylic pfas that ranged from 79 95 to 82 59 kj mol these observations were consistent with the experimental results shown in fig 2 additional dft discussion is provided in section s2 4 conclusions overall a covalently cross linked poly dmapaa q hydrogel prepared and used in this work is the first material to demonstrate high adsorption of short and long chain legacy and emerging pfas under environmentally relevant concentrations the polymer hydrogels selectivity was tested in two surface water and a treated wastewater with varying background anions and dom compositions the removal was fast and stable and the polymer regeneration was feasible this study have also showed for the first time the binding mechanisms and energies using dft the findings from this study suggest that future studies should test the potential of applying poly dmapaa q hydrogel for continuous flow systems

18594,hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is used widely as fenton s reagent for organic wastewater treatment however the application range of the optimum fenton reaction is narrow needing to adjust ph before and after treatment besides the disproportionation of h2o2 and generated iron precipitation also confine the normal operation of fenton method to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional fenton process a fe ii catalyzed calcium peroxide cao2 fenton like process assisted by oxalic acid oa for aqueous organic pollutants degradation was proposed fe2 oa cao2 the methyl orange mo as a typical organic pollutant its removal performances by this fe2 oa cao2 system were evaluated in the optimized conditions 99 of mo was degraded within 15 min and 38 mineralized after 180 min when the molar ratio of fe2 oa cao2 was 1 2 2 fe2 1 5 mm radicals detection indicated that hydroxyl radical ho was the main reactive species for the mo elimination furthermore density functional theory calculation was in good agreement with the experimental results which proved that the fe2 oa cao2 could improve the circulation between fe2 and fe3 promoting the oxygen reactive species generation and pollutant removal the main intermediates were identified and the degradation pathways were proposed based on the results of the mass spectrum analysis and the attack of ho was suggested as the main function for the mo decomposition the matrix effects of water constituents on the performance of fe2 oa cao2 were investigated and the results showed that a certain amount of cl no3 hco3 and ha affected the elimination than so4 2 finally the attempt of actual wastewater disposal indicated the synergistic system possessed good potential for future practical application graphical abstract image 1 keywords calcium peroxide fenton like process oxalic acid complexation dft simulation 1 introduction the organic wastewaters generated from industry and living are complex in composition with high chroma and peculiar smell which can easily cause the deterioration of water quality liu et al 2018b dye wastewater as a representative of organic effluent which contains many refractory compounds making it difficult to be treated by conventional methods such as chemical and activated sludge processes tang et al 2019 to decontaminate dye polluted water advanced oxidation processes aops come into the researchers vision as a typical aops fenton oxidation technology is most widely applied for the dye wastewater treatment gągol et al 2018 in fenton reaction fe2 activates hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to generate various reactive oxygen species to decompose organics under acidic condition r1 r6 including hydroxyl radicals ho superoxide anion radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 hu et al 2018 kavitha and palanivelu 2004 r1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh 63 m 1s 1 liu et al 2012 r2 fe3 h2o2 fe2 h ho2 0 002 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2017 r3 fe2 ho2 fe3 hoo xue et al 2018 r4 fe3 ho2 fe2 h o2 xue et al 2018 r5 ho2 o2 h 1 58 105 s 1 xue et al 2018 r6 ho fe2 fe3 oh 3 4 108 m 1s 1 tang et al 2018 however the optimal ph range in the fenton reaction is narrow ph 2 5 3 5 rahim pouran et al 2015 in addition the disproportionation and decomposition of h2o2 would exhaust ho r7 r8 leading to the decrease of h2o2 utilization liu et al 2018a especially the ferric irons are easy to be converted into iron precipitation resulting in the difficult recovery of iron source and then decreasing the efficiency of fenton reaction bokare and choi 2014 costa et al 2019 these drawbacks limit the further application of fenton method in organic wastewater treatment r7 ho h2o2 h2o ho2 5 0 107 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2015 r8 ho ho h2o2 5 5 109 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2015 therefore the developed fenton like processes have attracted great attention by various means including adding complexing agents to mediate the state of iron ions and substituting h2o2 by other more suitable oxidizers jia et al 2018 vicente et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 on the one hand for the complexation system fe2 fe3 both contain empty electron orbitals which could combine with the coordinating sites of chelating agents to form ferric complexes ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta he et al 2019 citric acid ca jiang et al 2019 and oxalic acid oa are all the regular complexing agents which could prevent precipitation and broaden the application range of ph in fenton process zhang and zhou 2019 among them oa has a simple structure with bidentate ligand which contains two carboxyl groups and two pairs of electrons as shown in fig s1 of supplementary materials sm zhang and zhou 2019 it is demonstrated that oa is the most effective chelating agent for fe2 than ca and glutamic acid xue et al 2018 the ligands of oa could decline the standard redox potential of fe2 fe3 coupling wood 1988 affecting the activity of iron complexes fe2 fe3 0 77 v fe2 fe3 oa 0 002 v r9 r10 therefore the addition of oa is beneficial to promote the redox capacity of fe2 improving the reaction between iron complexes and oxidants in addition the reactivities of oa kho oa 1 107 m 1s 1 and its ionized species with ho are lower than those of ca zhang and zhou 2019 so it could not generate obvious competitive reactions with target organics and then avoid large consumption of active species r9 fe2 h2c2o4 fe2 c2o4 2 2 4 h ye et al 2019

the other hand for the alternative oxidants calcium peroxide cao2 is researched extensively recently which has been employed as an oxygen release agent in soil restoration for a long history northup and cassidy 2008 cao2 as a solid source of h2o2 can slowly produce h2o2 by controlling its dissolution with the increase of ph and temperature r14 r15 wang et al 2017 hence it could replace h2o2 to participate in fenton reaction xue et al 2018 accelerating the cycle of fe2 and fe3 and block the disproportionation of liquid h2o2 for instance fe3 is appropriate to catalyze cao2 due to the slower reaction rate of fe3 with h2o2 than that of fe2 in presence of complexing agents zhou et al 2017 and a direct electron transfer between fe3 edta and cao2 is found to improve the reduction of fe3 pan et al 2018 in addition the concomitant o2 produced by cao2 could also react with fe2 to produce o2 to further enhance organics degradation r11 ye et al 2019 r14 cao2 h2o 0 5o2 ca oh 2 zhang et al 2015 r15 cao2 h2o h2o2 ca oh 2 zhang et al 2015 though there have been numerous reports about the chelating agent oa and cao2 in fenton like process the fundamental understanding and chelating mechanism on the fe2 oa complexation using cao2 as the oxidant should be advanced further in this study we proposed an improved complexation fenton like process using cao2 as the oxidant and oa as the chelating agent fe2 oa cao2 respectively the methyl orange mo wastewater was chosen as the simulated dye effluent the systematical work was conducted to achieve the following targets 1 determine the optimal reaction parameters for the mo removal in the fe2 oa cao2 process 2 investigate the dominant reactive species and mo decomposition pathway in the synergistic system 3 study the function mechanism of the complexation in the fe2 oa cao2 especially for the roles of cao2 and oa in accelerating the circulation of fe2 fe3 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the cao2 feso4 7h2o h2c2o4 and other reagents used in this study were introduced in detail in s1 of sm all other reagents were of analytical grade deionized water di was used to prepare all solutions the actual wastewater was collected from inlet of the sewage treatment station in yanshan university and the detailed information about the station was also described in s1 of sm 2 2 experimental procedures all experiments were conducted in a beaker of 100 ml at room temperature on the magnetic stirrer the simulated wastewater of desired concentration was prepared by diluting the stock solution of mo synergistic reactions started after a certain proportion of ferrous sulfate oa and cao2 were orderly added into the mo solution when the reaction was terminated the precipitates were collected after centrifugation for the characterization in the free radical scavenging experiments a certain amount of tert butyl alcohol tba l histidine p benzoquinone bq and chloroform cf was added to the reaction system respectively the initial solution ph was regulated by h2so4 naoh and phosphate buffer other detailed description for the experimental procedures was introduced in s2 of sm 2 3 analysis the mo concentration was determined by spectrophotometric method the total organic carbon toc was determined by a shimadzu toc v analyzer the concentration of the available fe2 was analyzed with 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometry ammonium fluoride was added to cover the effect of fe3 in the experiment the amount of h2o2 was determined by the titanium potassium oxalate method the quantity of ho was detected by the fluorescence method the precipitates were analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffractometer xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer hplc ms was used for analyzing the degradation byproducts of mo the cod was determined by fast digestion spectrophotometry national standard method the detailed description and instruments of above methods were described in s3 of sm the optimized molecular structures and frontier molecular orbitals calculation based on density functional theory dft were conducted by applying dmol3 mode in materials studio 7 0 of accelrys a combination of general gradient corrected gga becke exchange and perdew wang correlation functions were used in the dft computation 3 results and discussion 3 1 fe2 oa cao2 effect verification fig 1 a shows the mo decoloration by the h2o2 and cao2 with mediation of fe2 and fe2 oa complexation respectively almost no removal of mo was observed in the single system of cao2 oa fe2 cao2 oa and fe2 oa respectively only 17 and 32 of mo were removed in the original fe2 h2o2 and fe2 oa h2o2 systems respectively about 33 of mo was removed in the fe2 cao2 however the mo degradation ratio reached 97 in the fe2 oa cao2 system within 5 min and those eliminations almost ceased in the following 10 min period in the fe2 oa cao2 the degradation process mainly consisted of two parts a rapid reaction phase within 1 min and a slow reaction phase after 1 min the first stage may be due to the h2o2 generation from the rapid decomposition of cao2 in the initial short time amina et al 2018 in the second stage the release of h2o2 became slow then the decoloration rate was stable over time amina et al 2018 besides fig 1b presents that the degradation rate of the fe2 oa cao2 was remarkably greater than that of the fe2 cao2 about results indicated that a synergistic effect for the mo removal was established by the complexation of fe2 fe3 and oa without the oa introduction the generated fe3 would react with hydroxide ions to form iron precipitation resulting in the blocked cyclic conversion between fe2 fe3 and decreasing the oxidation capability cui et al 2017 he et al 2017 however after adding the oa the complexation of fe2 fe3 and oa would reduce the redox potential of free fe2 fe3 and improve the reactivity of fe2 zhang and zhou 2019 it has been reported that the stability constant of formed ferric oxalate complexes would be increased with the raises of ligand pka value pk1 of oa 1 23 and pk2 of oa 4 19 faria et al 2008 and metal ion charge density logβ of fe2 oa 4 70 and logβ of fe3 oa 9 40 smith et al 1998 furthermore the higher stabilization of fe3 complexes could promote the reaction rate of fe2 complexes and h2o2 suggesting that the electron transfers between fe2 and fe3 could also be accelerated due to the coordination between fe2 fe3 and oa r12 kurimura 1968 meanwhile the formed ferric oxalate complexes could extend the existence time of dissolved ions in the solution and promote fe2 recycle by altering the redox conditions r13 li et al 2016 hence the oa mediated fe2 cao2 system could significantly increase the degradation of mo to illuminate the role of oa and cao2 in the synergistic system the soluble fe2 concentration was determined fig 2 a it had been pointed out that the fe2 detected by the phenanthroline molecules in solution included not only the uncomplexed free fe2 but also the partially complexed fe2 at the same complex ratio the fe2 amount decreased with time suggesting that fe2 oa complex was involved in the reaction continuously with the complexation ratio of fe2 and oa increasing from 1 1 to 1 6 the concentration of dissolved fe2 also enhanced this proved that the oa addition could prominently enhance the stability of fe2 by generating fe2 oa complexes zhou et al 2017 besides the residual soluble fe2 concentration with the ratio of 1 2 for fe2 and oa was the lowest compared to the others which could be considered as the optimized dosage for these reagents it is believed that under this optimal complexation ratio the electron transfer between fe2 and released h2o2 would be accelerated which could utilize more and more fe2 during the fenton like reaction keenan and sedlak 2008 wang et al 2011 2012 the detected concentrations of h2o2 in the systems of cao2 fe2 cao2 and fe2 oa cao2 are shown in fig 2b generally the change of h2o2 quantity in the three systems was similar and the order was cao2 fe2 cao2 fe2 oa cao2 in the cao2 alone system it can be seen that the h2o2 concentration reached the maximum quantity for 1 min and then the amount of h2o2 would decrease slowly with time in the fe2 cao2 system the concentration of h2o2 presented an obvious increase and decrease trend indicating that the addition of fe2 could react with the cao2 released h2o2 to form fenton process li et al 2015 however in the fe2 oa cao2 system the amount of h2o2 was quickly achieved the peak concentration and then a rapid decline was observed over time the falling rate of the complexation system was prominently faster than other two systems this is due to the fastest consumption of h2o2 in the fe2 oa cao2 within 1 min through the modified fenton s reaction zhang et al 2016 to sum up without the oa introduction free fe3 was easy to convert to iron precipitation leading to the termination of electron transfer and cycle of fe2 fe3 xiao et al 2018 nevertheless the addition of oa could significantly change the redox properties of free fe2 fe3 and improve the reduction capacity of fe2 promoting the decomposition of h2o2 dao and de laat 2011 zhang and zhou 2019 furthermore iron precipitation could be hindered after adding oa so that the conversion between fe2 oa and fe3 oa could be increased xue et al 2018 above h2o2 detection result was corresponded to the results of mo degradation in fig 1 proving that the complexation effect acted a vital role in the fe2 oa cao2 process 3 2 effect of reaction conditions 3 2 1 effect of fe2 oa and cao2 addition ratio in the fe2 oa cao2 system because fe2 and oa have different forms of complex relationship according to the chemical formula calculation the complexing ratio between fe2 and oa could be 1 2 or 1 3 in order to further explore the proportional relation between the two reagents different adding ratios were made for the mo removal as seen in fig 3 a it was obvious that the mo degradation was affected by different complexation ratios between fe2 and oa with the increase of oa the decomposition rate of mo declined the increasing complexation ratio of iron and oa would form a space protective effect on fe2 namely steric hindrance chevion 1988 zhang and zhou 2019 the formation of steric hindrance makes h2o2 not easy to get close to the complexation site of ferric complex which limits the number of complexation sites when complexing ratio was 1 2 bivalent iron complexation sites were more likely to contact with h2o2 leading to the fastest electron transfer however while complexing ratio was 1 9 although the complexing ability was enhanced with the increase of oa the formation of the space steric hindrance would slow down electrons movement which could not be conducive to the fenton reaction and organics degradation meanwhile ho would react with excess oa to compete with the target pollutant also reduce the elimination of mo georgi et al 2007 souza et al 2014 the influence of cao2 dosage on the mo degradation is illustrated in fig 3b the complexation ratio of fe2 and oa was fixed at 1 2 with the augment of cao2 amount from 0 75 to 1 5 and 3 mm the mo removal ratio increased from 69 to 94 and 99 respectively the more cao2 the more h2o2 would be liberated in the complexation system and then accelerate the generation of active species through a string of chain reactions xue et al 2018 leading to the better mo decontamination performances nevertheless increasing cao2 dosage to 4 5 and 6 mm indicated no remarkable promotion on the mo decoloration it could be due to the self decomposition of excess h2o2 and the quenching effect of h2o2 on reactive oxygen radicals r7 r8 zhang et al 2015 according to fig 3a the optimum complexation ratio of fe2 and oa was determined as 1 2 under this condition the effect of the amount of fe2 on the degradation of mo was explored as shown in fig 3c as the initiator of fenton reaction fe2 played an important role in this fenton like process with the amount of fe2 enhanced from 0 3 to 1 5 mm the mo decoloration ratio was augmented from 30 to 99 within 15 min however when the added amount of fe2 was 3 mm the degradation rate was not significantly increased this is because that the supply of h2o2 was insufficient when the catalyst of fe2 ions was overwhelming so the oxidation capability of complexation system could be fixed zhang et al 2015 the effect of different initial mo concentrations on the mo removal in the fe2 oa cao2 system was investigated and the results are displayed in fig 3d with the mo initial concentration raised from 0 15 to 0 5 mm the degradation rate was reduced obviously it is generally believed that more mo concentration would produce more degradation intermediates and consume more reactive species generated from the complex system then decreasing the dye removal efficiency 3 2 2 effect of ph as the fenton process is greatly affected by solution ph the performance of fe2 oa cao2 was evaluated under different initial ph values from fig 4 a it could be observed that the change of initial ph from 3 to 11 had little effect on the mo removal the ph of solution would be kept on acidic conditions due to the addition of oa which could facilitate the fenton reaction in addition to exclude the adsorption effect of cao2 alone at high ph an adsorption test was carried out at ph 11 and the result is shown in fig s2 of sm it can be seen that the mo was not removed by cao2 so the adsorption of cao2 could be ignored at this condition from fig 4b the solution ph was regulated to 6 7 and 8 through adding phosphate buffer reagent it showed that the elimination of mo was more effective at ph 6 84 mo was removed within 15 min while under neutral and alkaline conditions the degradation efficiency dropped sharply only reached 15 and 10 at ph 7 and 8 after 15 min treatment respectively the fact is that the yield of h2o2 would be enhanced with the increase of cao2 solubility as ph decreased wang et al 2016 conversely under neutral and alkaline conditions the concentration of h2o2 would be reduced leading to the reductions of active species generation and dye decomposition 3 3 mechanism of cao2 based fenton like process 3 3 1 characterizations of solid precipitation to further analyze the produced matters during the fe2 oa cao2 process the sem eds xrd and ftir analysis were used to investigate the solid precipitation samples after the reaction of the fe2 oa cao2 system the sem image revealed the morphological characteristic of the generated precipitation fig s3a and the eds spectra indicated the elements of ca c o and fe fig s3b suggesting that the possible presences of cac2o4 and ca oh 2 furthermore the xrd pattern clearly displayed two main peaks at 14 3 and 32 2 and other small peaks fig s3c which were consistent well with the standard pattern for ca2c2o4 2 375h2o jcpds 75 1314 respectively in addition the ftir analysis for the samples of precipitate ca oh 2 oa and cao2 was presented in fig s3d there were six peaks in the precipitated sample which contained all characteristic peaks of ca oh 2 indicating the existence of ca oh 2 but the absorption peaks at 1453 cm 1 and 877 cm 1 were not obvious because the amount of ca oh 2 might be relatively low compared with the oa sample the peaks at 1685 cm 1 and 1258 cm 1 was disappeared in the precipitated sample in addition to other common peaks at 3435 cm 1 and 730 cm 1 while in the precipitation sample two new higher peaks appeared between the peaks of 1685 cm 1 and 1258 cm 1 showing the presence of carboxylate because the carboxylate would average the original carbonyl co and c o fundamensky et al 2017 and then lead to the symmetric stretching vibration at a band of 1400 cm 1 and anti symmetric stretching vibration at a band of 1550 1650 cm 1 which resulted in the disappearance of original carboxylic acid peaks gao et al 2018 moreover the characteristic peak at 3643 cm 1 of cao2 could not be observed in the precipitated sample manifesting that there was no cao2 after the precipitation to sum up the precipitations of fe2 oa cao2 system could be cac2o4 and ca oh 2 zhou et al 2017 3 3 2 reactive oxygen species generation to further confirm the effect of reactive oxygen species in the fe2 oa cao2 system several control tests including free radical scavenging experiments and ho detection were carried out in the fe2 h2o2 fe2 oa h2o2 fe2 cao2 fe2 oa cao2 systems respectively tba and l histidine usually were employed as the quenching agent of ho and 1o2 kl histidine 1o2 3 2 107 m 1s 1 respectively bq and cf were used to suppress the effect of o2 respectively pan et al 2018 peng et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 with the increasing of addition amount of these masking agents the mo degradation efficiencies were all remarkably decreased this indicated that ho o2 and 1o2 may be produced and responsible for the dye decomposition in these system the experiments with different concentrations of scavenging agents are also presented in figs s4 s7 of sm for the fe2 oa cao2 system the addition of excessive tba still could not completely inhibit the mo degradation fig s7a indicating that other reactive oxygen radicals also played a role in the reaction in addition to ho from fig s7d it could be observed that the inhibition effect of dye removal was more obvious with the increase of l histidine compared to fig s7a l histidine could completely inhibit the removal of mo which proved that 1o2 play a vital role for the mo removal in the fe2 oa cao2 however it was reported that l histidine and ho also has a high reaction rate constant 5 109 m 1s 1 so the masking effect of l histidine could not be attributed to the 1o2 exclusively and the action of ho and o2 should not be ignored the existence of o2 could be caused by the decomposition of h2o2 xue et al 2018 furthermore the dissolved cao2 r14 and direct electron transfer of iron or iron complex with cao2 could also produce o2 pan et al 2018 1o2 could be produced by the reaction of o2 and h2o r16 and also generated through the ca ii catalyzed h2o2 reaction in the cao2 system r17 pan et al 2018 ho is produced by the fenton reactions r16 2o2 2h2o 2h2o2 1o2 2oh pan et al 2018 r17 2h2o2 ca ⅱ 2h2o α 1o2 1 α 3o2 pan et al 2018 from radical scavenging results ho was the core reactive radical in the fenton and fenton like processes to further confirm the role of ho the coumarin fluorescence method was applied to determine ho concentration in the systems of fe2 h2o2 fe2 oa h2o2 fe2 cao2 fe2 oa cao2 systems under the same conditions respectively as shown in fig s8 the fluorescence intensity was enhanced over time in the four processes the peak intensity of the fe2 oa cao2 system was highest than that the other three systems this is because that cao2 would slowly release h2o2 resulting in the continuous generation of ho besides the fe2 oa cao2 had a higher fluorescence peak than the fe2 cao2 which could be due to the complexation effect but for the systems of h2o2 addition it could rapidly produce large quantities of ho leading to the annihilation of ho so the fluorescence intensities were weaker than those of cao2 added systems 3 3 3 mo destruction uv visible spectroscopy and toc analysis were conducted for the mineralization of mo and the results are displayed in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6a in the first 15 min treatment the peak of mo at 465 nm gradually disappeared proving that the chromogenic group of n n band on the mo molecules were decomposed rapidly which was accorded with previous degradation test meanwhile the peaks less than 300 nm were enhanced indicating that some byproducts were formed during the mo degradation but those peaks were all weakened when the reaction time reached 120 min demonstrating that the mo molecules might be degraded and then mineralized the toc analysis confirmed above speculation fig 6b with the increase of treatment duration the toc removal augmented increasingly which achieved 38 after 180 min indicating that the mo could be mineralized to co2 and h2o partly during the fe2 oa cao2 process to investigate the destruction mechanism of mo in the fe2 oa cao2 system hplc ms were used to identify the decomposition byproducts the total ion chromatography of mo before and after treatment is shown in fig 6c obviously the peak strength of mo disappeared after 15 min proving that the mo molecules were degraded indeed furthermore fig 6d illustrates the mass spectrogram of mo degradation intermediates with the retention time at 1 442 min the mo m z 304 was detected before the reaction but not be detected in 15 min additionally other ms spectrums corresponding to different intermediates were located and provided in fig s9 for the benzenoid compounds benzene ring could be attacked by ho abstracting hydrogen atoms to form different intermediate by products zhang et al 2017 the methyl and ethyl groups of aromatic compounds could also be attacked by ho by disproportionation gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 cheng et al 2013 based on previous decomposition mechanism the five positions of possible broken bonds of mo were indicated with red line and seven numbered major intermediates are presented in fig 7 with the further redox reaction in this synergistic process those by products were decomposed to some micro molecular organics and even mineralized to h2o co2 finally 3 3 4 mechanism simulation to further understand the action mechanism of fe2 oa cao2 the simulation was employed to explore the special reaction process in this improved fenton like system dft calculation was used to analyze the frontier molecular orbitals of internal reactant molecules based on this the enhancement of reaction efficiency by the complexation of fe and oa was clarified through the electron transfer state fig 8 presents the molecular structures and frontier molecular orbitals of these reactants including the complexes of fe and oa fe ions cao2 oa o2 h2o2 and ca oh 2 table 1 shows the molecule symmetry irreducible representation eigenvalue and occupation of each molecules the orbits of o2 and fe3 were single occupied molecular orbital somo they both could be highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo the fe and oa complexation were detected based on hplc ms figs s10 s11 and the electron transfer of the complexes mainly occurred on the transition metals d orbitals besides the d electronic energy level of this transition metal complex was highly close so the homo and lumo were the high lying occupied orbitals and the low lying occupied orbitals respectively and their occupation data were non integer indicating that there existed multiple frontier orbitals as shown in the calculation results for the typical fenton process the electron of 3d orbit of fe2 ar 3d64s0 could transfer to the orbits of lumo for h2o2 and somo for o2 producing fe3 ho o2 and other radicals the electron of homo orbit for h2o2 could move to the 3d orbit of fe3 ar 3d54s0 to generate fe2 achieving the conversion between fe3 and fe2 after adding the oa in the traditional fenton system fe2 and fe3 could both form complex with oa respectively it is noted that the complexation of fe2 and oa could form fe21 which was the most form and its molecular symmetry belonged to d2h point group and the homo of fe21 was dxy orbital which could be matched with the somo of o2 and the energy gaps among their orbitals were very small δe 6 ev therefore the orbital electron of fe dxy of fe21 could easily be transferred to o2 to form more oxygen radicals o2 1o2 in addition fe21 was easier to react with o2 than fe2 ions on the other side the complexation of fe3 and oa could increase its frontier molecular orbitals and extend its energy range benefiting the electron receiving and fe3 reduction this can be regarded as the rate limiting step of the fenton like reaction pan et al 2018 the transformation of complexing structure makes electron easy to transfer generating more active radicals as displayed in the results of section 3 1 the addition of oa promoted the mo decontamination nevertheless the improvement was limited due to the lower redox potential of o2 and 1o2 compared to ho cao2 is stable and can tardily produce h2o2 by controlling its dissolution in the modified fenton like process r14 r15 wang et al 2016 from dft results the cao2 molecular symmetry belonged to c2v point group and the frontier molecular orbitals energy of cao2 was close to those of d orbitals of fe ions fe2 fe3 which could serve electron transfer besides the symmetry orbitals between the lumo and homo of cao2 were matched dz2 and dxy respectively that is the electron of fe2 dz2 orbit could transfer to lumo of cao2 and the electron of homo of cao2 could also transfer to fe3 dxy orbit achieving the circulation between fe2 and fe3 on the other side the h2o2 molecular symmetry belonged to c2 point group the symmetry orbitals of lumo and homo were matched with dyz and dxz respectively in the cao2 involved fenton like system the coexistence of cao2 and h2o2 could increase the electron transfer paths leading to the more transfer of d orbital electron and accelerating the cycle of fe2 and fe3 hence more and more active species ho o2 1o2 would be generated enhancing the organics removal in brief some alterations could be obtained after substituting h2o2 by cao2 and adding oa synchronously in this improved fenton like system on the one hand the complexation of oa and fe could change the molecular orbitals symmetry and broaden orbital energy facilitating the electron transfer on the other hand cao2 could provide more electron transfer pathways of different symmetry orbitals enhancing the electron transfer efficiency both sides could improve the circulation between fe2 and fe3 promoting the oxygen reactive species generation and pollutant elimination lastly ca oh 2 could react with oa to generate cac2o4 the solubility of cac2o4 is lower than fe oh 3 which could suppress the formation of fe oh 3 all above were positive factors for the improvement of fenton like process 3 4 feasible application of actual wastewater to better evaluate feasible application of actual wastewater during the fe2 oa cao2 process first of all the influence of water constituents on the mo removal were investigated in view of the possible interference of solution matrix a series of inorganic ions and natural organic matter cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and ha effect tests were executed and the results are shown in fig s12 the consequences show that large amounts of cl no3 hco3 and ha could inhibit the mo removal due to the competition between the constituents and active species zhang et al 2016 jin et al 2018 but the addition of so4 2 did not show any inhibition effect on the mo decomposition in the complexation process the detailed discussion about the matrix effect on the dye removal was supplied in s4 of sm the practical use for the proposed fenton like system was conducted the real wastewater was collected from the inlet of sewage treatment station in our university and diluted to the concentration equal to the prepared mo simulated wastewater using di water as seen in fig 9 about 77 of cod was removed within 180 min for the mo meanwhile 70 of cod was also eliminated in the actual wastewater which was decreased from 91 mg l to 27 mg l this consequence manifested that the established fe2 oa cao2 system also possessed a good processing capacity for the real sewage treatment 4 conclusions this work explored an improved fenton like process using cao2 as the h2o2 source and mediating reaction condition by fe2 oa complexation for the dye removal in water the following conclusions can be attained 1 the mo degradation in the fe2 oa cao2 modified fenton system achieved 99 within 15 min meanwhile the mineralization reached 38 after 180 min under the optimized addition of fe2 oa cao2 fe2 1 5 mm 1 2 2 2 ho o2 and 1o2 were confirmed as the dominant reactive species during the coupling process and the mo degradation pathways were suggested based on the hplc ms analysis 3 the dft calculation demonstrated that the fe2 oa cao2 could promote the circulation between fe2 and fe3 enhancing the active species formation 4 70 of cod was removed in the actual wastewater by this synergistic system manifesting a good potential for future practical application declarations of interest none acknowledgements we are thankful to the financial supports from the national natural

18594,hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is used widely as fenton s reagent for organic wastewater treatment however the application range of the optimum fenton reaction is narrow needing to adjust ph before and after treatment besides the disproportionation of h2o2 and generated iron precipitation also confine the normal operation of fenton method to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional fenton process a fe ii catalyzed calcium peroxide cao2 fenton like process assisted by oxalic acid oa for aqueous organic pollutants degradation was proposed fe2 oa cao2 the methyl orange mo as a typical organic pollutant its removal performances by this fe2 oa cao2 system were evaluated in the optimized conditions 99 of mo was degraded within 15 min and 38 mineralized after 180 min when the molar ratio of fe2 oa cao2 was 1 2 2 fe2 1 5 mm radicals detection indicated that hydroxyl radical ho was the main reactive species for the mo elimination furthermore density functional theory calculation was in good agreement with the experimental results which proved that the fe2 oa cao2 could improve the circulation between fe2 and fe3 promoting the oxygen reactive species generation and pollutant removal the main intermediates were identified and the degradation pathways were proposed based on the results of the mass spectrum analysis and the attack of ho was suggested as the main function for the mo decomposition the matrix effects of water constituents on the performance of fe2 oa cao2 were investigated and the results showed that a certain amount of cl no3 hco3 and ha affected the elimination than so4 2 finally the attempt of actual wastewater disposal indicated the synergistic system possessed good potential for future practical application graphical abstract image 1 keywords calcium

be treated by conventional methods such as chemical and activated sludge processes tang et al 2019 to decontaminate dye polluted water advanced oxidation processes aops come into the researchers vision as a typical aops fenton oxidation technology is most widely applied for the dye wastewater treatment gągol et al 2018 in fenton reaction fe2 activates hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to generate various reactive oxygen species to decompose organics under acidic condition r1 r6 including hydroxyl radicals ho superoxide anion radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 hu et al 2018 kavitha and

disproportionation and decomposition of h2o2 would exhaust ho r7 r8 leading to the decrease of h2o2 utilization liu et al 2018a especially the ferric irons are easy to be converted into iron precipitation resulting in the difficult recovery of iron source and then decreasing the efficiency of fenton reaction bokare and choi 2014 costa et al 2019 these drawbacks limit the further

processes have attracted great attention by various means including adding complexing agents to mediate the state of iron ions and substituting h2o2 by other more suitable oxidizers jia et al 2018 vicente et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 on the one hand for the complexation system fe2 fe3 both contain empty electron orbitals which could combine with the coordinating sites of chelating agents to form ferric complexes ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta he et al 2019 citric acid ca jiang et al 2019 and oxalic acid oa are all the regular complexing agents which could prevent precipitation and broaden the application range of ph in fenton process zhang and zhou 2019 among them oa has a simple structure with bidentate ligand which contains two carboxyl groups and two pairs of electrons as shown in fig s1 of supplementary materials sm zhang and zhou 2019 it is demonstrated that oa is the most effective chelating agent for fe2 than ca and glutamic acid xue et al 2018 the ligands of oa could decline the standard redox potential of fe2 fe3 coupling wood 1988 affecting the activity of iron complexes fe2 fe3 0 77 v fe2 fe3 oa 0 002 v r9 r10 therefore the addition of oa is beneficial to promote the redox capacity of fe2 improving the reaction between iron complexes and oxidants in addition the reactivities of oa kho oa 1 107 m 1s 1 and its ionized species with ho are lower than those of ca zhang and zhou 2019 so it could not generate obvious competitive reactions with target organics and then avoid large consumption of active species r9 fe2 h2c2o4 fe2 c2o4 2 2 4 h ye et al 2019

the other hand for the alternative oxidants calcium peroxide cao2 is researched extensively recently which has been employed as an oxygen release agent in soil restoration for a long history northup and cassidy 2008 cao2 as a solid source of h2o2 can slowly produce h2o2 by controlling its dissolution with the increase of ph and temperature r14 r15 wang et al 2017 hence it could replace h2o2 to participate in fenton reaction xue et al 2018 accelerating the cycle of fe2 and fe3 and block the disproportionation of liquid h2o2 for instance fe3 is appropriate to catalyze cao2 due to the slower reaction rate of fe3 with h2o2 than that of fe2 in presence of complexing agents zhou et al 2017 and a direct electron transfer between fe3 edta and cao2 is found to improve the reduction of fe3 pan et al 2018 in addition the concomitant o2 produced by cao2 could also react with fe2 to produce o2 to further enhance organics degradation r11 ye et al 2019 r14 cao2 h2o 0 5o2 ca oh 2 zhang et al 2015 r15 cao2 h2o h2o2 ca oh 2 zhang et al 2015 though there have been numerous reports about the chelating agent oa and cao2 in fenton like process the fundamental understanding and chelating mechanism on the fe2 oa complexation using cao2 as the oxidant should be advanced further in this study we proposed an improved complexation fenton like process using cao2 as the oxidant and oa as the chelating agent fe2 oa cao2 respectively the methyl orange mo wastewater was chosen as the simulated dye effluent the systematical work was conducted to achieve the following targets 1 determine the optimal reaction parameters for the mo removal in the fe2 oa cao2 process 2 investigate the dominant reactive species and mo decomposition pathway in the synergistic system 3 study the function mechanism of the complexation in the fe2 oa cao2 especially for the roles of cao2 and oa in accelerating the circulation of fe2 fe3 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the cao2 feso4 7h2o h2c2o4 and other reagents used in this study were introduced in detail in s1 of sm all other reagents were of analytical grade deionized water di was used to prepare all solutions the actual wastewater was collected from inlet of the sewage treatment station in yanshan university and the detailed information about the station was also described in s1 of sm 2 2 experimental procedures all experiments were conducted in a beaker of 100 ml at room temperature on the magnetic stirrer the simulated wastewater of desired concentration was prepared by diluting the stock solution of mo synergistic reactions started after a certain proportion of ferrous sulfate oa and cao2 were orderly added into the mo solution when the reaction was terminated the precipitates were collected after centrifugation for the characterization in the free radical scavenging experiments a certain amount of tert butyl alcohol tba l histidine p benzoquinone bq and chloroform cf was added to the reaction system respectively the initial solution ph was regulated by h2so4 naoh and phosphate buffer other detailed description for the experimental procedures was introduced in s2 of sm 2 3 analysis the mo concentration was determined by spectrophotometric method the total organic carbon toc was determined by a shimadzu toc v analyzer the concentration of the available fe2 was analyzed with 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometry ammonium fluoride was added to cover the effect of fe3 in the experiment the amount of h2o2 was determined by the titanium potassium oxalate method the quantity of ho was detected by the fluorescence method the precipitates were analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffractometer xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer hplc ms was used for analyzing the degradation byproducts of mo the cod was determined by fast digestion spectrophotometry national standard method the detailed description and instruments of above methods were described in s3 of sm the optimized molecular structures and frontier molecular orbitals calculation based on density functional theory dft were conducted by applying dmol3 mode in materials studio 7 0 of accelrys a combination of general gradient corrected gga becke exchange and perdew wang correlation functions were used in the dft computation 3 results and discussion 3 1 fe2 oa cao2 effect verification fig 1 a shows the mo decoloration by the h2o2 and cao2 with mediation of fe2 and fe2 oa complexation respectively almost no removal of mo was observed in the single system of cao2 oa fe2 cao2 oa and fe2 oa respectively only 17 and 32 of mo were removed in the original fe2 h2o2 and fe2 oa h2o2 systems respectively about 33 of mo was removed in the fe2 cao2 however the mo degradation ratio reached 97 in the fe2 oa cao2 system within 5 min and those eliminations almost ceased in the following 10 min period in the fe2 oa cao2 the degradation process mainly consisted of two parts a rapid reaction phase within 1 min and a slow reaction phase after 1 min the first stage may be due to the h2o2 generation from the rapid decomposition of cao2 in the initial short time amina et al 2018 in the second stage the release of h2o2 became slow then the decoloration rate was stable over time amina et al 2018 besides fig 1b presents that the degradation rate of the fe2 oa cao2 was remarkably greater than that of the fe2 cao2 about results indicated that a synergistic effect for the mo removal was established by the complexation of fe2 fe3 and oa without the oa introduction the generated fe3 would react with hydroxide ions to form iron precipitation resulting in the blocked cyclic conversion between fe2 fe3 and decreasing the oxidation capability cui et al 2017 he et al 2017 however after adding the oa the complexation of fe2 fe3 and oa would reduce the redox potential of free fe2 fe3 and improve the reactivity of fe2 zhang and zhou 2019 it has been reported that the stability constant of formed ferric oxalate complexes would be increased with the raises of ligand pka value pk1 of oa 1 23 and pk2 of oa 4 19 faria et al 2008 and metal ion charge density logβ of fe2 oa 4 70 and logβ of fe3 oa 9 40 smith et al 1998 furthermore the higher stabilization of fe3 complexes could promote the reaction rate of fe2 complexes and h2o2 suggesting that the electron transfers between fe2 and fe3 could also be accelerated due to the coordination between fe2 fe3 and oa r12 kurimura 1968 meanwhile the formed ferric oxalate complexes could extend the existence time of dissolved ions in the solution and promote fe2 recycle by altering the redox conditions r13 li et al 2016 hence the oa mediated fe2 cao2 system could significantly increase the degradation of mo to illuminate the role of oa and cao2 in the synergistic system the soluble fe2 concentration was determined fig 2 a it had been pointed out that the fe2 detected by the phenanthroline molecules in solution included not only the uncomplexed free fe2 but also the partially complexed fe2 at the same complex ratio the fe2 amount decreased with time suggesting that fe2 oa complex was involved in the reaction continuously with the complexation ratio of fe2 and oa increasing from 1 1 to 1 6 the concentration of dissolved fe2 also enhanced this proved that the oa addition could prominently enhance the stability of fe2 by generating fe2 oa complexes zhou et al 2017 besides the residual soluble fe2 concentration with the ratio of 1 2 for fe2 and oa was the lowest compared to the others which could be considered as the optimized dosage for these reagents it is believed that under this optimal complexation ratio the electron transfer between fe2 and released h2o2 would be accelerated which could utilize more and more fe2 during the fenton like reaction keenan and sedlak 2008 wang et al 2011 2012 the detected concentrations of h2o2 in the systems of cao2 fe2 cao2 and fe2 oa cao2 are shown in fig 2b generally the change of h2o2 quantity in the three systems was similar and the order was cao2 fe2 cao2 fe2 oa cao2 in the cao2 alone system it can be seen that the h2o2 concentration reached the maximum quantity for 1 min and then the amount of h2o2 would decrease slowly with time in the fe2 cao2 system the concentration of h2o2 presented an obvious increase and decrease trend indicating that the addition of fe2 could react with the cao2 released h2o2 to form fenton process li et al 2015 however in the fe2 oa cao2 system the amount of h2o2 was quickly achieved the peak concentration and then a rapid decline was observed over time the falling rate of the complexation system was prominently faster than other two systems this is due to the fastest consumption of h2o2 in the fe2 oa cao2 within 1 min through the modified fenton s reaction zhang et al 2016 to sum up without the oa introduction free fe3 was easy to convert to iron precipitation leading to the termination of electron transfer and cycle of fe2 fe3 xiao et al 2018 nevertheless the addition of oa could significantly change the redox properties of free fe2 fe3 and improve the reduction capacity of fe2 promoting the decomposition of h2o2 dao and de laat 2011 zhang and zhou 2019 furthermore iron precipitation could be hindered after adding oa so that the conversion between fe2 oa and fe3 oa could be increased xue et al 2018 above h2o2 detection result was corresponded to the results of mo degradation in fig 1 proving that the complexation effect acted a vital role in the fe2 oa cao2 process 3 2 effect of reaction conditions 3 2 1 effect of fe2 oa and cao2 addition ratio in the fe2 oa cao2 system because fe2 and oa have different forms of complex relationship according to the chemical formula calculation the complexing ratio between fe2 and oa could be 1 2 or 1 3 in order to further explore the proportional relation between the two reagents different adding ratios were made for the mo removal as seen in fig 3 a it was obvious that the mo degradation was affected by different complexation ratios between fe2 and oa with the increase of oa the decomposition rate of mo declined the increasing complexation ratio of iron and oa would form a space protective effect on fe2 namely steric hindrance chevion 1988 zhang and zhou 2019 the formation of steric hindrance makes h2o2 not easy to get close to the complexation site of ferric complex which limits the number of complexation sites when complexing ratio was 1 2 bivalent iron complexation sites were more likely to contact with h2o2 leading to the fastest electron transfer however while complexing ratio was 1 9 although the complexing ability was enhanced with the increase of oa the formation of the space steric hindrance would slow down electrons movement which could not be conducive to the fenton reaction and organics degradation meanwhile ho would react with excess oa to compete with the target pollutant also reduce the elimination of mo georgi et al 2007 souza et al 2014 the influence of cao2 dosage on the mo degradation is illustrated in fig 3b the complexation ratio of fe2 and oa was fixed at 1 2 with the augment of cao2 amount from 0 75 to 1 5 and 3 mm the mo removal ratio increased from 69 to 94 and 99 respectively the more cao2 the more h2o2 would be liberated in the complexation system and then accelerate the generation of active species through a string of chain reactions xue et al 2018 leading to the better mo decontamination performances nevertheless increasing cao2 dosage to 4 5 and 6 mm indicated no remarkable promotion on the mo decoloration it could be due to the self decomposition of excess h2o2 and the quenching effect of h2o2 on reactive oxygen radicals r7 r8 zhang et al 2015 according to fig 3a the optimum complexation ratio of fe2 and oa was determined as 1 2 under this condition the effect of the amount of fe2 on the degradation of mo was explored as shown in fig 3c as the initiator of fenton reaction fe2 played an important role in this fenton like process with the amount of fe2 enhanced from 0 3 to 1 5 mm the mo decoloration ratio was augmented from 30 to 99 within 15 min however when the added amount of fe2 was 3 mm the degradation rate was not significantly increased this is because that the supply of h2o2 was insufficient when the catalyst of fe2 ions was overwhelming so the oxidation capability of complexation system could be fixed zhang et al 2015 the effect of different initial mo concentrations on the mo removal in the fe2 oa cao2 system was investigated and the results are displayed in fig 3d with the mo initial concentration raised from 0 15 to 0 5 mm the degradation rate was reduced obviously it is generally believed that more mo concentration would produce more degradation intermediates and consume more reactive species generated from the complex system then decreasing the dye removal efficiency 3 2 2 effect of ph as the fenton process is greatly affected by solution ph the performance of fe2 oa cao2 was evaluated under different initial ph values from fig 4 a it could be observed that the change of initial ph from 3 to 11 had little effect on the mo removal the ph of solution would be kept on acidic conditions due to the addition of oa which could facilitate the fenton reaction in addition to exclude the adsorption effect of cao2 alone at high ph an adsorption test was carried out at ph 11 and the result is shown in fig s2 of sm it can be seen that the mo was not removed by cao2 so the adsorption of cao2 could be ignored at this condition from fig 4b the solution ph was regulated to 6 7 and 8 through adding phosphate buffer reagent it showed that the elimination of mo was more effective at ph 6 84 mo was removed within 15 min while under neutral and alkaline conditions the degradation efficiency dropped sharply only reached 15 and 10 at ph 7 and 8 after 15 min treatment respectively the fact is that the yield of h2o2 would be enhanced with the increase of cao2 solubility as ph decreased wang et al 2016 conversely under neutral and alkaline conditions the concentration of h2o2 would be reduced leading to the reductions of active species generation and dye decomposition 3 3 mechanism of cao2 based fenton like process 3 3 1 characterizations of solid precipitation to further analyze the produced matters during the fe2 oa cao2 process the sem eds xrd and ftir analysis were used to investigate the solid precipitation samples after the reaction of the fe2 oa cao2 system the sem image revealed the morphological characteristic of the generated precipitation fig s3a and the eds spectra indicated the elements of ca c o and fe fig s3b suggesting that the possible presences of cac2o4 and ca oh 2 furthermore the xrd pattern clearly displayed two main peaks at 14 3 and 32 2 and other small peaks fig s3c which were consistent well with the standard pattern for ca2c2o4 2 375h2o jcpds 75 1314 respectively in addition the ftir analysis for the samples of precipitate ca oh 2 oa and cao2 was presented in fig s3d there were six peaks in the precipitated sample which contained all characteristic peaks of ca oh 2 indicating the existence of ca oh 2 but the absorption peaks at 1453 cm 1 and 877 cm 1 were not obvious because the amount of ca oh 2 might be relatively low compared with the oa sample the peaks at 1685 cm 1 and 1258 cm 1 was disappeared in the precipitated sample in addition to other common peaks at 3435 cm 1 and 730 cm 1 while in the precipitation sample two new higher peaks appeared between the peaks of 1685 cm 1 and 1258 cm 1 showing the presence of carboxylate because the carboxylate would average the original carbonyl co and c o fundamensky et al 2017 and then lead to the symmetric stretching vibration at a band of 1400 cm 1 and anti symmetric stretching vibration at a band of 1550 1650 cm 1 which resulted in the disappearance of original carboxylic acid peaks gao et al 2018 moreover the characteristic peak at 3643 cm 1 of cao2 could not be observed in the precipitated sample manifesting that there was no cao2 after the precipitation to sum up the precipitations of fe2 oa cao2 system could be cac2o4 and ca oh 2 zhou et al 2017 3 3 2 reactive oxygen species generation to further confirm the effect of reactive oxygen species in the fe2 oa cao2 system several control tests including free radical scavenging experiments and ho detection were carried out in the fe2 h2o2 fe2 oa h2o2 fe2 cao2 fe2 oa cao2 systems respectively tba and l histidine usually were employed as the quenching agent of ho and 1o2 kl histidine 1o2 3 2 107 m 1s 1 respectively bq and cf were used to suppress the effect of o2 respectively pan et al 2018 peng et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 with the increasing of addition amount of these masking agents the mo degradation efficiencies were all remarkably decreased this indicated that ho o2 and 1o2 may be produced and responsible for the dye decomposition in these system the experiments with different concentrations of scavenging agents are also presented in figs s4 s7 of sm for the fe2 oa cao2 system the addition of excessive tba still could not completely inhibit the mo degradation fig s7a indicating that other reactive oxygen radicals also played a role in the reaction in addition to ho from fig s7d it could be observed that the inhibition effect of dye removal was more obvious with the increase of l histidine compared to fig s7a l histidine could completely inhibit the removal of mo which proved that 1o2 play a vital role for the mo removal in the fe2 oa cao2 however it was reported that l histidine and ho also has a high reaction rate constant 5 109 m 1s 1 so the masking effect of l histidine could not be attributed to the 1o2 exclusively and the action of ho and o2 should not be ignored the existence of o2 could be caused by the decomposition of h2o2 xue et al 2018 furthermore the dissolved cao2 r14 and direct electron transfer of iron or iron complex with cao2 could also produce o2 pan et al 2018 1o2 could be produced by the reaction of o2 and h2o r16 and also generated through the ca ii catalyzed h2o2 reaction in the cao2 system r17 pan et al 2018 ho is produced by the fenton reactions r16 2o2 2h2o 2h2o2 1o2 2oh pan et al 2018 r17 2h2o2 ca ⅱ 2h2o α 1o2 1 α 3o2 pan et al 2018 from radical scavenging results ho was the core reactive radical in the fenton and fenton like processes to further confirm the role of ho the coumarin fluorescence method was applied to determine ho concentration in the systems of fe2 h2o2 fe2 oa h2o2 fe2 cao2 fe2 oa cao2 systems under the same conditions respectively as shown in fig s8 the fluorescence intensity was enhanced over time in the four processes the peak intensity of the fe2 oa cao2 system was highest than that the other three systems this is because that cao2 would slowly release h2o2 resulting in the continuous generation of ho besides the fe2 oa cao2 had a higher fluorescence peak than the fe2 cao2 which could be due to the complexation effect but for the systems of h2o2 addition it could rapidly produce large quantities of ho leading to the annihilation of ho so the fluorescence intensities were weaker than those of cao2 added systems 3 3 3 mo destruction uv visible spectroscopy and toc analysis were conducted for the mineralization of mo and the results are displayed in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6a in the first 15 min treatment the peak of mo at 465 nm gradually disappeared proving that the chromogenic group of n n band on the mo molecules were decomposed rapidly which was accorded with previous degradation test meanwhile the peaks less than 300 nm were enhanced indicating that some byproducts were formed during the mo degradation but those peaks were all weakened when the reaction time reached 120 min demonstrating that the mo molecules might be degraded and then mineralized the toc analysis confirmed above speculation fig 6b with the increase of treatment duration the toc removal augmented increasingly which achieved 38 after 180 min indicating that the mo could be mineralized to co2 and h2o partly during the fe2 oa cao2 process to investigate the destruction mechanism of mo in the fe2 oa cao2 system hplc ms were used to identify the decomposition byproducts the total ion chromatography of mo before and after treatment is shown in fig 6c obviously the peak strength of mo disappeared after 15 min proving that the mo molecules were degraded indeed furthermore fig 6d illustrates the mass spectrogram of mo degradation intermediates with the retention time at 1 442 min the mo m z 304 was detected before the reaction but not be detected in 15 min additionally other ms spectrums corresponding to different intermediates were located and provided in fig s9 for the benzenoid compounds benzene ring could be attacked by ho abstracting hydrogen atoms to form different intermediate by products zhang et al 2017 the methyl and ethyl groups of aromatic compounds could also be attacked by ho by disproportionation gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 cheng et al 2013 based on previous decomposition mechanism the five positions of possible broken bonds of mo were indicated with red line and seven numbered major intermediates are presented in fig 7 with the further redox reaction in this synergistic process those by products were decomposed to some micro molecular organics and even mineralized to h2o co2 finally 3 3 4 mechanism simulation to further understand the action mechanism of fe2 oa cao2 the simulation was employed to explore the special reaction process in this improved fenton like system dft calculation was used to analyze the frontier molecular orbitals of internal reactant molecules based on this the enhancement of reaction efficiency by the complexation of fe and oa was clarified through the electron transfer state fig 8 presents the molecular structures and frontier molecular orbitals of these reactants including the complexes of fe and oa fe ions cao2 oa o2 h2o2 and ca oh 2 table 1 shows the molecule symmetry irreducible representation eigenvalue and occupation of each molecules the orbits of o2 and fe3 were single occupied molecular orbital somo they both could be highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo the fe and oa complexation were detected based on hplc ms figs s10 s11 and the electron transfer of the complexes mainly occurred on the transition metals d orbitals besides the d electronic energy level of this transition metal complex was highly close so the homo and lumo were the high lying occupied orbitals and the low lying occupied orbitals respectively and their occupation data were non integer indicating that there existed multiple frontier orbitals as shown in the calculation results for the typical fenton process the electron of 3d orbit of fe2 ar 3d64s0 could transfer to the orbits of lumo for h2o2 and somo for o2 producing fe3 ho o2 and other radicals the electron of homo orbit for h2o2 could move to the 3d orbit of fe3 ar 3d54s0 to generate fe2 achieving the conversion between fe3 and fe2 after adding the oa in the traditional fenton system fe2 and fe3 could both form complex with oa respectively it is noted that the complexation of fe2 and oa could form fe21 which was the most form and its molecular symmetry belonged to d2h point group and the homo of fe21 was dxy orbital which could be matched with the somo of o2 and the energy gaps among their orbitals were very small δe 6 ev therefore the orbital electron of fe dxy of fe21 could easily be transferred to o2 to form more oxygen radicals o2 1o2 in addition fe21 was easier to react with o2 than fe2 ions on the other side the complexation of fe3 and oa could increase its frontier molecular orbitals and extend its energy range benefiting the electron receiving and fe3 reduction this can be regarded as the rate limiting step of the fenton like reaction pan et al 2018 the transformation of complexing structure makes electron easy to transfer generating more active radicals as displayed in the results of section 3 1 the addition of oa promoted the mo decontamination nevertheless the improvement was limited due to the lower redox potential of o2 and 1o2 compared to ho cao2 is stable and can tardily produce h2o2 by controlling its dissolution in the modified fenton like process r14 r15 wang et al 2016 from dft results the cao2 molecular symmetry belonged to c2v point group and the frontier molecular orbitals energy of cao2 was close to those of d orbitals of fe ions fe2 fe3 which could serve electron transfer besides the symmetry orbitals between the lumo and homo of cao2 were matched dz2 and dxy respectively that is the electron of fe2 dz2 orbit could transfer to lumo of cao2 and the electron of homo of cao2 could also transfer to fe3 dxy orbit achieving the circulation between fe2 and fe3 on the other side the h2o2 molecular symmetry belonged to c2 point group the symmetry orbitals of lumo and homo were matched with dyz and dxz respectively in the cao2 involved fenton like system the coexistence of cao2 and h2o2 could increase the electron transfer paths leading to the more transfer of d orbital electron and accelerating the cycle of fe2 and fe3 hence more and more active species ho o2 1o2 would be generated enhancing the organics removal in brief some alterations could be obtained after substituting h2o2 by cao2 and adding oa synchronously in this improved fenton like system on the one hand the complexation of oa and fe could change the molecular orbitals symmetry and broaden orbital energy facilitating the electron transfer on the other hand cao2 could provide more electron transfer pathways of different symmetry orbitals enhancing the electron transfer efficiency both sides could improve the circulation between fe2 and fe3 promoting the oxygen reactive species generation and pollutant elimination lastly ca oh 2 could react with oa to generate cac2o4 the solubility of cac2o4 is lower than fe oh 3 which could suppress the formation of fe oh 3 all above were positive factors for the improvement of fenton like process 3 4 feasible application of actual wastewater to better evaluate feasible application of actual wastewater during the fe2 oa cao2 process first of all the influence of water constituents on the mo removal were investigated in view of the possible interference of solution matrix a series of inorganic ions and natural organic matter cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and ha effect tests were executed and the results are shown in fig s12 the consequences show that large amounts of cl no3 hco3 and ha could inhibit the mo removal due to the competition between the constituents and active species zhang et al 2016 jin et al 2018 but the addition of so4 2 did not show any inhibition effect on the mo decomposition in the complexation process the detailed discussion about the matrix effect on the dye removal was supplied in s4 of sm the practical use for the proposed fenton like system was conducted the real wastewater was collected from the inlet of sewage treatment station in our university and diluted to the concentration equal to the prepared mo simulated wastewater using di water as seen in fig 9 about 77 of cod was removed within 180 min for the mo meanwhile 70 of cod was also eliminated in the actual wastewater which was decreased from 91 mg l to 27 mg l this consequence manifested that the established fe2 oa cao2 system also possessed a good processing capacity for the real sewage treatment 4 conclusions this work explored an improved fenton like process using cao2 as the h2o2 source and mediating reaction condition by fe2 oa complexation for the dye removal in water the following conclusions can be attained 1 the mo degradation in the fe2 oa cao2 modified fenton system achieved 99 within 15 min meanwhile the mineralization reached 38 after 180 min under the optimized addition of fe2 oa cao2 fe2 1 5 mm 1 2 2 2 ho o2 and 1o2 were confirmed as the dominant reactive species during the coupling process and the mo degradation pathways were suggested based on the hplc ms analysis 3 the dft calculation demonstrated that the fe2 oa cao2 could promote the circulation between fe2 and fe3 enhancing the active species formation 4 70 of cod was removed in the actual wastewater by
