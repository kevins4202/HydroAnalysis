16590,with the deterioration of source water quality pre chlorination and pre addition of powdered activated carbon pac have been widely applied to improve water treatment efficiency which would lead to pac exposure to chlorine although previous studies reported that some emerging carbon materials e g graphene could potentially act as disinfection by product dbp precursors there were few studies paying attention to the interaction between chlorine and the most commonly used carbon material pac on the dbp formation in this study the dbps formed by chlorination with and without pac were investigated and the dbp toxicities in different systems were evaluated the results showed that the pac could react with chlorine and form trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas the amount of surface oxygen groups of the pac increased during the chlorination with these oxygen groups especially the meta positioned oh groups facilitating the formation of thms and haas in the presence of nom lower concentrations of thms and haas were observed in the systems with pac than in those without pac demonstrating the critical role of pac adsorption towards dbp control the cytotoxicity evaluation indicated that more toxic reaction products between pac and chlorine were formed besides conventional dbps moreover the pac with higher bet surface area and more lactonic function groups formed less toxic dbps during chlorination which might reduce health risk for treatment processes with pre chlorination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords powered activated carbon chlorine disinfection by products toxicity 1 introduction pre chlorination has become a commonly used drinking water treatment technology to enhance algae control ma et al 2012 as well as remove iron and manganese khadse et al 2015 due to its low cost and persistent oxidizing ability daly et al 2007 however many groups of disinfection by products dbps were produced due to the chlorination of the organic matter including halogenated salicylic acid halogenated phenol halogenated nitrophenol dong et al 2021 yang et al 2019 of which some are highly toxic golea et al 2017 goslan et al 2017 among them trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas have already been regulated in many countries such as the u s and china dong et al 2021 in addition powdered activated carbon pac has been extensively applied to control the micro pollutants such as taste odor t o compounds pharmaceutical compounds and pesticides etc lucas et al 2021 srinivasan and sorial 2011 for example to solve the t o problem at least 39 55 mg l 1 pac was required at four water treatment plants in adelaide south australia cook et al 2001 due to the negative influence of the coagulants on the pac adsorption seckler et al 2013 pac can be added at the intake of the source water before coagulation srinivasan and sorial 2011 yu et al 2007 thus in cases of prechlorination pac could potentially form dbps till now most of the dbp formation studies were focused on the chlorination of the natural organic matter and micro pollutants golea et al 2017 hebert et al 2018 the chlorination of pac itself and the effects of the pac on the formation of dbps during chlorination still require further investigation some other carbon materials except pac such as nc60 and graphene oxide go which may release into the drinking water sources can act like the organic matters as dbp precursors during the chlorination alpatova et al 2013 du et al 2017 2016 wang et al 2012 du et al 2016 investigated the formation of thms by five types of carbon nanotubes go and reduced go and found that all these carbon materials could act as the precursors of thms in aqueous phase they also suggested that the carbon atoms at the middle of two meta positioned oh groups on the benzene ring were more active and might prefer to form thms with chlorine oxidation however limited studies pay attention to the dbp formation with the presence of the carbon materials that commonly used activated carbon ac only voudrias et al 1987 reported that additional products were formed when free chlorine reacted with phenols adsorbed on granular ac gac including chlorohydroxybiphenyls hydroxylated pcbs rather than producing the mono di or tri chloro derivatives which were supposed to be formed by chlorine with phenol in solution they speculated that surface free radicals were produced from the oxidation of gac with aqueous hocl our previous study also suggested that the pac could catalyze chlorine to generate free radicals huang et al 2021 in addition the ac has also been widely used to control the dbp precursors and dbps utku et al 2020 revealed that the adsorption of halogenated dbp precursors mostly occurred in the mesoporous region babi et al 2007 also proved that the gac post filter contributed lot to the adsorption of already formed thms and haas therefore the effects of pac could be rather complicated on the dbp formation because it could act as the dbp precursors adsorb the dbps precursors and the formed dbps and may also produce other by products by the free radical chain reaction however to date little is known about the regulated dbps such as the thms and haas formed by the pac during chlorination and the effects of pac on the nom reaction with chlorine and the toxicity of the products need further understanding therefore this study was designed to investigate the impacts of pac on the dbp formation during chlorination with and without nom the cytotoxicity of their products was comparatively observed using the normal rat kidney nrk cell finally the effects of pac properties including surface area pore size pore volume and surface functional groups on the products toxicity were evaluated 2

of all solutions was adjusted to 7 5 by using a 10 mm phosphate buffer solution before the chlorination the concentration of pac used in the experiments was 10 mg l 1 to amplify the possible reactions during water treatment based on previous studies on dbp formation potential doederer et al 2014 sanchís et al 2020 relatively high chlorine dose of 7 5 mg l 1 as cl2 was selected to maintain a sufficient chlorine residual to investigate dbp formation from pac under practical conditions three pacs pac2 pac5 and pac initial with similar iodine value were also evaluated using lower doses of chlorine 1 mg l 1 and 3 mg l 1 as cl2 the chlorine was first mixed with 10 mg l 1 pac alone which was denoted as paccl to distinguish the dbps formed only by the pac the effect of pac on the dbp formation with the nom was compared by the reaction between chlorine 7 5 mg l 1 and ha 10 mg l 1 with and without 10 mg l 1 pac denoted as nom cl and pacnom cl respectively water samples were collected and filtered by the 0 45 μm membrane to remove pac at determined intervals for the dbp detection and other measurements na2so4 6 0 g and na2s2o3 1 1 2 were added to 30 ml water sample followed by rapid extraction with mtbe u s epa 1995 2003 2 4 analytical methods four dbps namely tcm tcaa dcaa and caa were measured in this study according to epa 551 1 method using gas

waters milford massachusetts usa was applied to further investigate dbp formation capturing other dbps than the target compounds 2 5 cytotoxicity evaluation the cytotoxicity test was selected to assess the overall toxic effect from the products the nrk 52e cell line derived from rat proximal tubule epithelium was obtained from the cell bank of the chinese academy of sciences shanghai china nrk 52e cells were grown in 25 cm2 petri dish nunc denmark in dulbecco s modified eagle medium containing 5 v v fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 c in a 5 co2 air incubator the colorimetric mtt assay has been used to evaluate the dbps chronic cytotoxicity in nrk 52e cells respectively muellner et al 2008 yang et al 2014 the culture medium was removed after 24 h and 48 h a 0 5 mg ml 1 mtt solution 200 μl was added to each well after incubation the medium was removed and the formazan crystal was solubilized by a 10 min treatment with 150 μl of isopropanol in the incubator the absorbance of each well was measured on a microplate reader epoch2t biotek at 570 nm the relative cell viability was calculated by conducting 3 duplicate experiments and taking the mean value 3 results and discussion 3 1 the reaction between chlorine and pac 3 1 1 the dbps formed by pac with chlorine as illustrated in fig 1 a the chlorine reacted with pac alone and formed the common dbps such as thms and haas as for thms only tcm without bromine was determined in this study the total concentration of dbps first increased and then decreased after 48 h particularly the concentrations of dcaa and tcaa increased persistently in 72 h while the concentrations of tcm and caa first increased and then decreased which might be due to the pac adsorption the reduction for the dbp concentrations after 48 h might result from the exhaustion of chlorine the residual chlorine at 48 h was only 0 2 mg l 1 as shown in fig 1b when the chlorine completely reacted with carbon the concentration of dbps reached the maximum in the solution in addition the dbp concentrations formed by pacs under relatively lower concentration of chlorine 1 mg l 1 and 3 mg l 1 as cl2 which might be more approached to actual application are shown in fig s1 different from the results at 7 5 mg l 1 chlorine the dbp concentrations all decreased with time which might be due to the relatively lower chlorine concentration as shown in fig s2 pac5 with the highest chlorine decay rate formed the maximum amount of dbps at the 0 5 h but the pac initial with medium chlorine decay rate exhibited the least dbp concentration which might be due to its superior adsorption capacity resulting from the abundant micropore volume the adsorption ability for thms and haas with small mw based on the micropore volume could also explain the lower dbp concentration of pac5 compared with pac2 after 2 h babi et al 2007 proved that the thms and haas could be removed by the gac adsorption therefore due to the excellent adsorption capacity of pac the total concentration of dbps formed by the reaction between chlorine and pac should be higher than the detected amount in the solution the collected pac was re dispersed into 1 l pure water under ultrasound after 2 h ultrasound the dbp concentrations in the solution were measured and the results are shown in fig s3 left bar it could be noted that an approximate total concentration of 20 μg l 1 thms and haas was detected in the solution therefore it suggested that the dbps formed by the pac and chlorine was more than the examined concentration as shown in fig 1 some of which were trapped by the pac adsorption and did not released to the solution the doc concentration and the mw of the released organics were measured as shown in fig 1b and c which could also prove that the chlorine surely reacted with the pac it could be noted that the doc concentration significantly increased with time especially within the first 12 h after that the doc concentration almost remained stable which might be due to the low residual chlorine concentration the mw of the released organics was relatively large ranged from 100 to 100 000 da while after 12 h the mw of the organics decreased to 100 4000 da and most was mainly distributed below 1000 da previous study has reported that the average mw of high mw dbps formed by chlorination of ha was around 2000 da zhang and minear 2002 which was similar with the product mw after 72 h in addition the released organics also indicated that the chlorine would result in the destruction of the carbon structure previous studies by vinke et al 1994 and yang et al yang et al 2010 also demonstrated the chlorine could change the carbon surface thus it could be inferred that the chlorine destructed the structure of the carbon and released some large mw compounds into the solution and then leading to transformations into smaller molecules and dbps therefore it required further understanding of the usage of pac and the pre chlorine at the same time 3 1 2 characterization of pac after chlorination as shown in fig 2 and 3 the surface functional groups of pac after chlorination paccl were more abundant than those of pac initial the principal band and their corresponding functional groups obtained from ftir spectrum are compared in table 2 the xps also indicated that the surface oxygen content was increased after chlorination as shown in table 1 the surface chlorine content slightly increased from the 0 16 to 0 60 which also proved that the chlorine might react with the carbon the cl2s peak was too small to be deconvoluted and therefore only the c1s and o1s peaks of these pacs and their deconvolution are presented in fig 3 after reaction with chlorine the proportions of c ii c iii group and o ii o iii group increased especially c ii and o ii groups which was in agreement with the ftir results thus it could be inferred that on the carbon surface the phenolic alcohol and ether group which contained the coh and co c bond increased after chlorination though the precise structure of the pac is still unknow the functional groups at the edges could be deduced through different analytical method previous studies have proved pac was comprised of carbon platelets and several functional groups on the surface bhatnagar et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the surface functional groups were similar with the nom mainly contained oxygen and hydrogen thus the formation of thms and haas with pac and nom might be analogous the meta positioned oh groups could play significant roles in the production of thms and haas dynamics 2008 johannes and rook 1977 the proposed degradation pathways of pac and formation of tcm and haas are shown in fig 4 in addition it could be noted that after the chlorination the oh might bind with the carbon surface which was consistent with the ftir and xps results 3 2 dbps formed by nom with and without pac the dbp formation with and without pac in ha water was compared as shown in fig 5 it could be noted that for the chlorine decay rate with the presence of pac was more rapid than that without pac however though the consumption of chlorine was more rapid and pac itself could act as the dbp precursors the dbps concentration in the solution with the presence of pac was lower one possible reason might be that the formed dbps were adsorbed by the pac as shown in fig s3 after ultrasound the adsorbed dbps were released from pac and the concentrations of tcm and haas on pac were calculated to be approximately 12 and 4 μg g 1 however even after combining the amount of dbps on the pac surface the total amount of dbps with pac was still less than that without pac therefore it could be inferred that the consumption of chlorine might lead to other products rather than the commonly known dbps such as tcm and haas which also had been proved by the previous studies voudrias et al 1987 1985 and they found that with the presence of pac a series of free radical chain reactions were occurred this phenomenon had also been proved by the electron spin resonance spectroscopy results as shown in fig s4 it could be noted that with the presence of pac the free radical was much stronger than chlorine with nom alone in addition as shown in fig s5 the chromatograms corresponding to the two systems were obviously different which could confirm that different by products were formed by the chlorination of pac the doc concentration without the pac was kept almost stable around 6 mg l 1 while the ha was adsorbed by the pac in the pacnom cl system with a reduction of doc concentration as for the mw of the organics in the solution at the first 15 min the mw was almost the same for nom cl and pacnom cl at 12 h the mw of the organics was slightly different the compounds in the nom cl exhibited smaller mw compared with those in the pacnom cl which might be because the smaller organics were more easily adsorbed by the pac or different products were formed in these two different situations 3 3 toxicity of dbps with and without pac though the generation of known dbps including thms andhaas was fewer other unknown products could be generated with the presence of pac and their toxicity should be more concerned by the public therefore the mtt assay was used to measure the toxicity of different substances produced by the pac alone with chlorine and the nom chlorination with and without pac as shown in fig 6 for the acute toxicity in 24 h and 48 h the products formed by pac alone with chlorine demonstrate the highest cytotoxicity with a cell viability reduction of 30 followed by pacnom cl and the nom cl it could also be deduced that the new products formed by the pac alone and chlorine was more toxic than the common dbps formed by chlorine and nom thus the pac alone with chlorine presented the highest toxicity and pacnom cl also contained certain amount of such new substance formed by the pac and chlorine exhibiting the median toxicity in addition another study by cuthbertson et al 2019 has proved that the combination of pre chlorination and gac filtration was effective in dbps and toxicity control in that study the pre added chlorine should already be depleted by coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration process and when reaching the gac filter the residual chlorine concentration was negligible they found that the gac was more effective in removing chlorinated nom rather than the original nom and less toxic dbps were formed after gac adsorbed the dbp precursor in our study the chlorine was directly contacted and reacted with pac and more toxic products were formed by the free radical reaction catalyzed by pac huang et al 2021 as suggested by mccreary et al 1982 the activated carbon promoted the reaction of free chlorine with phenolic acids to produce a variety of oxidized products such as polyphenols and quinones which were not produced by simple aqueous phase reaction between chlorine and phenolic acids in the absence of carbon voudrias et al 1987 1985 also reported that free chlorine reacted with phenols adsorbed on gac many additional products including chlorohydroxybiphenyls hydroxylated pcbs were formed which were not detected in the direct reaction between chlorine and dilute phenols solution as indicated by the toxicity test the additional by products formed through the free radical reaction between pac and chlorine were more toxic thus it is better to apply pre chlorination before pac adsorption for the sake of toxic dbp control 3 4 the effect of pac properties on the by products toxicity as mentioned above the chlorine reaction with pac was somewhat different from its reaction with nom because there were free radical chain reactions between the pac and chlorine the toxicity effects of by products in the presence of various pacs and the correlations between pac properties and the toxicity were evaluated as shown in fig 7 the chlorine decay rates with the presence of various pacs were also compared as shown in fig s6 it could be noted that the physical properties such as the pore size and pore volume did not exhibit any significant correlations with the relative cell viability and only the bet surface area was positively correlated with the relative cell viability with significance at the p 0 05 level as for the different surface functional groups there was only positive correlation between lactones and the relative cell viability p 0 10 other pac surface functional groups including basic groups acidic groups phenolic hydroxyl group and carboxyl group do not show any significant correlations with relative cell viability the toxicity of the dbps formed by pac chlorination might be influenced by two factors one was the dbp adsorption capacity of pac which might impede the releasing of dbps the other one was the pac surface functional groups which might impact the formation of dbps therefore the carbon with higher bet surface area might adsorb the products more easily and resulted in releasing less toxic products the carbon with more lactonic group might be less active to the chlorine than that with more phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore it could be deduced that the carbon with higher surface area and more lactonic group released less toxic by products 4 conclusion this study investigated the dbp formation and toxicity by the reaction between pac and chlorine the pac itself could act as dbp precursor and react with chlorine to form dbps including thms and haas and other variants the released thms and haas were also reduced by the pac adsorption and thus when nom reacted with chlorine the detected thms and haas in the solution with pac were less than those without pac however though pac could adsorb dbps and control their release in the solution the different reaction products resulted from free radical reaction with the presence of pac were more toxic than those without pac in addition the products formed by pac with higher surface area and more lactonic groups were less toxic above all this study can provide guidance for selecting appropriate pac type to

of each well was measured on a microplate reader epoch2t biotek at 570 nm the relative cell viability was calculated by conducting 3 duplicate experiments and taking the mean value 3 results and discussion 3 1 the reaction between chlorine and pac 3 1 1 the dbps formed by pac with chlorine as illustrated in fig 1 a the chlorine reacted with pac alone and formed the common dbps such as thms and haas as for thms only tcm without bromine was determined in this study the total concentration of dbps first increased and then decreased after 48 h particularly the concentrations of dcaa and tcaa increased persistently in 72 h while the concentrations of tcm and caa first increased and then decreased which might be due to the pac adsorption the reduction for the dbp concentrations after 48 h might result from the exhaustion of chlorine the residual chlorine at 48 h was only 0 2 mg l 1 as shown in fig 1b when the chlorine completely reacted with carbon the concentration of dbps reached the maximum in the solution in addition the dbp concentrations formed by pacs under relatively lower concentration of chlorine 1 mg l 1 and 3 mg l 1 as cl2 which might be more approached to actual application are shown in fig s1 different from the results at 7 5 mg l 1 chlorine the dbp concentrations all decreased with time which might be due to the relatively lower chlorine concentration as shown in fig s2 pac5 with the highest chlorine decay rate formed the maximum amount of dbps at the 0 5 h but the pac initial with medium chlorine decay rate exhibited the least dbp concentration which might be due to its superior adsorption capacity resulting from the abundant micropore volume the adsorption ability for thms and haas with small mw based on the micropore volume could also explain the lower dbp concentration of pac5 compared with pac2 after 2 h babi et al 2007 proved that the thms and haas could be removed by the gac adsorption therefore due to the excellent adsorption capacity of pac the total concentration of dbps formed by the reaction between chlorine and pac should be higher than the detected amount in the solution the collected pac was re dispersed into 1 l pure water under ultrasound after 2 h ultrasound the dbp concentrations in the solution were measured and the results are shown in fig s3 left bar it could be noted that an approximate total concentration of 20 μg l 1 thms and haas was detected in the solution therefore it suggested that the dbps formed by the pac and chlorine was more than the examined concentration as shown in fig 1 some of which were trapped by the pac adsorption and did not released to the solution the doc concentration and the mw of the released organics were measured as shown in fig 1b and c which could also prove that the chlorine surely reacted with the pac it could be noted that the doc concentration significantly increased with time especially within the first 12 h after that the doc concentration almost remained stable which might be due to the low residual chlorine concentration the mw of the released organics was relatively large ranged from 100 to 100 000 da while after 12 h the mw of the organics decreased to 100 4000 da and most was mainly distributed below 1000 da previous study has reported that the average mw of high mw dbps formed by chlorination of ha was around 2000 da zhang and minear 2002 which was similar with the product mw after 72 h in addition the released organics also indicated that the chlorine would result in the destruction of the carbon structure previous studies by vinke et al 1994 and yang et al yang et al 2010 also demonstrated the chlorine could change the carbon surface thus it could be inferred that the chlorine destructed the structure of the carbon and released some large mw compounds into the solution and then leading to transformations into smaller molecules and dbps therefore it required further understanding of the usage of pac and the pre chlorine at the same time 3 1 2 characterization of pac after chlorination as shown in fig 2 and 3 the surface functional groups of pac after chlorination paccl were more abundant than those of pac initial the principal band and their corresponding functional groups obtained from ftir spectrum are compared in table 2 the xps also indicated that the surface oxygen content was increased after chlorination as shown in table 1 the surface chlorine content slightly increased from the 0 16 to 0 60 which also proved that the chlorine might react with the carbon the cl2s peak was too small to be deconvoluted and therefore only the c1s and o1s peaks of these pacs and their deconvolution are presented in fig 3 after reaction with chlorine the proportions of c ii c iii group and o ii o iii group increased especially c ii and o ii groups which was in agreement with the ftir results thus it could be inferred that on the carbon surface the phenolic alcohol and ether group which contained the coh and co c bond increased after chlorination though the precise structure of the pac is still unknow the functional groups at the edges could be deduced through different analytical method previous studies have proved pac was comprised of carbon platelets and several functional groups on the surface bhatnagar et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the surface functional groups were similar with the nom mainly contained oxygen and hydrogen thus the formation of thms and haas with pac and nom might be analogous the meta positioned oh groups could play significant roles in the production of thms and haas dynamics 2008 johannes and rook 1977 the proposed degradation pathways of pac and formation of tcm and haas are shown in fig 4 in addition it could be noted that after the chlorination the oh might bind with the carbon surface which was consistent with the ftir and xps results 3 2 dbps formed by nom with and without pac the dbp formation with and without pac in ha water was compared as shown in fig 5 it could be noted that for the chlorine decay rate with the presence of pac was more rapid than that without pac however though the consumption of chlorine was more rapid and pac itself could act as the dbp precursors the dbps concentration in the solution with the presence of pac was lower one possible reason might be that the formed dbps were adsorbed by the pac as shown in fig s3 after ultrasound the adsorbed dbps were released from pac and the concentrations of tcm and haas on pac were calculated to be approximately 12 and 4 μg g 1 however even after combining the amount of dbps on the pac surface the total amount of dbps with pac was still less than that without pac therefore it could be inferred that the consumption of chlorine might lead to other products rather than the commonly known dbps such as tcm and haas which also had been proved by the previous studies voudrias et al 1987 1985 and they found that with the presence of pac a series of free radical chain reactions were occurred this phenomenon had also been proved by the electron spin resonance spectroscopy results as shown in fig s4 it could be noted that with the presence of pac the free radical was much stronger than chlorine with nom alone in addition as shown in fig s5 the chromatograms corresponding to the two systems were obviously different which could confirm that different by products were formed by the chlorination of pac the doc concentration without the pac was kept almost stable around 6 mg l 1 while the ha was adsorbed by the pac in the pacnom cl system with a reduction of doc concentration as for the mw of the organics in the solution at the first 15 min the mw was almost the same for nom cl and pacnom cl at 12 h the mw of the organics was slightly different the compounds in the nom cl exhibited smaller mw compared with those in the pacnom cl which might be because the smaller organics were more easily adsorbed by the pac or different products were formed in these two different situations 3 3 toxicity of dbps with and without pac though the generation of known dbps including thms andhaas was fewer other unknown products could be generated with the presence of pac and their toxicity should be more concerned by the public therefore the mtt assay was used to measure the toxicity of different substances produced by the pac alone with chlorine and the nom chlorination with and without pac as shown in fig 6 for the acute toxicity in 24 h and 48 h the products formed by pac alone with chlorine demonstrate the highest cytotoxicity with a cell viability reduction of 30 followed by pacnom cl and the nom cl it could also be deduced that the new products formed by the pac alone and chlorine was more toxic than the common dbps formed by chlorine and nom thus the pac alone with chlorine presented the highest toxicity and pacnom cl also contained certain amount of such new substance formed by the pac and chlorine exhibiting the median toxicity in addition another study by cuthbertson et al 2019 has proved that the combination of pre chlorination and gac filtration was effective in dbps and toxicity control in that study the pre added chlorine should already be depleted by coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration process and when reaching the gac filter the residual chlorine concentration was negligible they found that the gac was more effective in removing chlorinated nom rather than the original nom and less toxic dbps were formed after gac adsorbed the dbp precursor in our study the chlorine was directly contacted and reacted with pac and more toxic products were formed by the free radical reaction catalyzed by pac huang et al 2021 as suggested by mccreary et al 1982 the activated carbon promoted the reaction of free chlorine with phenolic acids to produce a variety of oxidized products such as polyphenols and quinones which were not produced by simple aqueous phase reaction between chlorine and phenolic acids in the absence of carbon voudrias et al 1987 1985 also reported that free chlorine reacted with phenols adsorbed on gac many additional products including chlorohydroxybiphenyls hydroxylated pcbs were formed which were not detected in the direct reaction between chlorine and dilute phenols solution as indicated by the toxicity test the additional by products formed through the free radical reaction between pac and chlorine were more toxic thus it is better to apply pre chlorination before pac adsorption for the sake of toxic dbp control 3 4 the effect of pac properties on the by products toxicity as mentioned above the chlorine reaction with pac was somewhat different from its reaction with nom because there were free radical chain reactions between the pac and chlorine the toxicity effects of by products in the presence of various pacs and the correlations between pac properties and the toxicity were evaluated as shown in fig 7 the chlorine decay rates with the presence of various pacs were also compared as shown in fig s6 it could be noted that the physical properties such as the pore size and pore volume did not exhibit any significant correlations with the relative cell viability and only the bet surface area was positively correlated with the relative cell viability with significance at the p 0 05 level as for the different surface functional groups there was only positive correlation between lactones and the relative cell viability p 0 10 other pac surface functional groups including basic groups acidic groups phenolic hydroxyl group and carboxyl group do not show any significant correlations with relative cell viability the toxicity of the dbps formed by pac chlorination might be influenced by two factors one was the dbp adsorption capacity of pac which might impede the releasing of dbps the other one was the pac surface functional groups which might impact the formation of dbps therefore the carbon with higher bet surface area might adsorb the products more easily and resulted in releasing less toxic products the carbon with more lactonic group might be less active to the chlorine than that with more phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore it could be deduced that the carbon with higher surface area and more lactonic group released less toxic by products 4 conclusion this study investigated the dbp formation and toxicity by the reaction between pac and chlorine the pac itself could act as dbp precursor and react with chlorine to form dbps including thms and haas and other variants the released thms and haas were also reduced by the pac adsorption and thus when nom reacted with chlorine the detected thms and haas in the solution with pac were less than those without pac however though pac could adsorb dbps and control their release in the solution the different reaction products resulted from free radical reaction with the presence of pac were more toxic than those without pac in addition the products formed by pac with higher surface area and more lactonic groups were less toxic above all this study can provide guidance for selecting appropriate pac type to

16591,phytotoxins toxins produced by plants are contaminants with the potential to impair drinking water quality they encompass a large group of toxic partially persistent compounds that have been detected in seepage waters and in shallow wells used for drinking water production if phytotoxins enter wells used for drinking water production it is essential to know if the drinking water treatment processes will remove them from the water phase however it is currently unknown whether phytotoxins remain stable during traditional groundwater treatment using sand filters as the main treatment process the objective of this study is to investigate removal potential of phytotoxins in biological sand filters and to asses if the removal potential is similar at different waterworks microcosms were set up with filter sand and drinking water collected at different groundwater based waterworks to be able to monitor phytotoxin removal ptaquiloside caudatoside gramine sparteine jacobine n oxide senecionine n oxide and caffeine were applied at initial concentrations of 300 µg l 1 which is approx two orders of magnitude higher than currently detected in environment but expected to cover extreme environmental conditions removal was monitored over a period of 14 days despite the high initial concentration all filter sands removed ptaquiloside and caudatoside completely from the water phase and at waterworks where pellet softening was implemented ph 8 4 prior to rapid sand filtration complete removal occurred within the first 30 min all filter sands removed gramine and sparteine primarily by a biological process while jacobine n oxide senecionine n oxide and caffeine were recalcitrant in the filter sands during degradation of ptaquiloside and caudatoside we observed formation and subsequent removal of degradation products pterosin b and a filter sands with the highest removal potential were characterised by high contents of deposited iron and manganese oxides and hence large specific surface areas difference between bacterial communities investigated by 16s rrna gene analyses did not explain different removal in the filter sands all five investigated filter sands showed similar degradation patterns regardless of water chemistry and waterworks of origin in drinking water treatment systems biological sand filters might therefore remove phytotoxin contaminants

used as a drinking water source worldwide iwa 2014 in denmark groundwater is the primary source of drinking water with 1 coming from other sources while in europe on average 70 of the drinking water supply is based on groundwater iwa 2014 navarrete et al 2008 groundwater pollutants encompass a wide range of anthropogenic chemicals such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and household care products thomaidis et al 2012 which have already attracted much attention due to their wide occurrence however hazardous compounds can also have a natural origin phytotoxins are unexplored contaminants originating from plants and are polar mobile organic compounds pmocs which are neither monitored treated nor regulated in silico analyses suggest that a large number of phytotoxins are mobile and persistent in the environment and should be included in environmental monitoring and risk assessment günthardt et al 2018 recently the presence of a broader variety of phytotoxins has been confirmed in surface and seepage water clauson kaas et al 2016 günthardt et al 2020 hama 2020 nanusha et al 2020 kisielius et al 2020a skrbic et al 2021 in many cases concentrations of these compounds exceeded the threshold of toxicological concern for drinking water nanusha et al 2020 moreover presence of phytotoxins in water bodies might contribute to complex mixture toxicities bucheli 2014 that could jeopardize water quality while natural toxins such as cyanotoxins are well known drinking water contaminants guideline maximum value of 1 µg l 1 in drinking water for microcystin lr who 2003 knowledge on phytotoxins occurrence in drinking water is very limited a group of well studied phytotoxins are norsesquiterpene glycosides produced by bracken ferns which are known for their carcinogenic properties and toxin production in large quantities iarc 2018 kisielius 2020 the bracken toxins ptaquiloside and caudatoside are highly water soluble and mobile in the environment table 1 ptaquiloside can undergo acid as well as alkaline hydrolysis and the rate of hydrolysis is strongly ph dependant ayala luis et al 2006 wu et al 2021 ptaquiloside as well as the main product of hydrolysis pterosin b can be microbially degraded under environmental conditions in soils skourti stathaki et al 2016 ptaquiloside is found in surface water with reported concentrations up to 2 2 µg l 1 clauson kaas et al 2016 and in seepage water up to 0 35 µg l 1 skrbic et al 2020 caudatoside is more polar than ptaquiloside and has recently been detected in surface waters in denmark kisielius 2020 and shallow water wells 0 75 µg l 1 skrbic et al 2021 the detected concentrations exceed the maximum estimated tolerable concentration of ptaquiloside estimated to 0 002 µg l 1 rasmussen 2003 in drinking water alkaloids is the most abundant class of phytotoxins which encompass more than 12 000 compounds bucheli 2014 crozier et al 2008 pyrrolizidine alkaloids are considered defence chemicals used by plants against insects and herbivores van egmond 2004 the pyrrolizidine alkaloids jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide table 1 have been measured in a surface water ponds at concentrations up to 47 and 17 µg l 1 respectively while about 10 times lower concentrations have been detected in stream water kisielius et al 2020a the n oxide forms of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids have been more frequently detected than pyrrolizidine alkaloids free base forms in the environment günthardt et al 2020 hama and strobel 2020a sparteine is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid while gramine is a bicyclic alkaloid including an indole moiety table 1 both are abundant in fabaceae leguminosae plant family boschin and resta 2013 sparteine and gramine were detected in soil pore water at concentrations exceeding 0 1 µg l 1 in areas cropped with lupins lupinus spp hama and strobel 2020b caffeine has been detected in groundwater e g up to a concentration of 0 68 µg l 1 in italy castiglioni et al 2018 even though the origin of caffeine in groundwater is probably of anthropogenic origin it indicates that structurally similar natural alkaloids such as pyrrolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids may be sufficiently persistent to reach groundwater reservoirs there is a paucity of ecotoxicity data on selected phytotoxins bucheli 2014 however the measured concentrations of selected phytotoxins in water resources may exceed the threshold of toxicological concern level for drinking water mons et al 2013 the world health organisation who and the international agency for research on cancer classifies bracken fern as possible carcinogenic to humans group 2b while ptaquiloside is considered not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans group 3 due to lack of experimental data there are no environmental guidelines for pyrrolizidine alkaloids in water resources but e g who recommends minimum exposure and efsa recommends a maximum daily exposure of 23 7 ng kg 1 body weight kisielius et al 2020a most phytotoxins are polar with low kow and high water solubility and some exist as cations günthardt et al 2018 hence they are mobile in the environment and may contaminate groundwater table 1 groundwater based drinking water treatment is usually a simple process and in denmark it consists of aeration of anaerobic groundwater followed by rapid biological sand filtration during aeration the water reaches an oxygen concentration of 8 10 mg l 1 while volatile compounds such as methane and hydrogen sulphide are stripped off oxygen is needed for oxidation of ammonium fe ii and mn ii taking place in rapid sand filters mouchet 1992 rapid sand filters typically have a retention time between 7 and 10 min winter et al 2003 but can be up to 1 hour during filtration mn iv and fe iii form metal hydroxides and oxides from now on called metal oxides teunissen et al 2008 which deposit in the filter material yielding metal oxide coatings on filter sand quartz mature sand filter material is therefore rich in fe and mn oxides and has higher specific surface areas than uncoated sand sharma et al 2002 the biological rapid sand filters also harbour microbiological processes such as ammonium oxidation the microbiological community in the filter sand is affected by the inlet water chemistry and varies between different waterworks albers et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 micropollutants can be removed from drinking water by processes such as ozonation followed by biological activated carbon filtration van der hoek et al 1999 or granular activated carbon heijman et al 2002 however if micropollutants can be handled in simple biological rapid sand filters it would be of large practical and commercial interest since biological rapid sand filters are inexpensive and sustainable godskesen et al 2011 thus benner et al 2013 suggested to utilize sand filters as treatment technology for removal of micropollutants even though rapid sand filters are not designed to eliminate organic micropollutants their potential to remove pesticides has been demonstrated hedegaard and albrechtsen 2014 and full scale rapid sand filters at a groundwater based waterworks removed 46 of the herbicide mecoprop initial concentration 0 046 µg l 1 within a contact time of 8 min hedegaard et al 2014 lab scale investigations with filter sand have shown that microbiological degradation of pesticides such as bentazone led to complete mineralization hedegaard et al 2019 however pesticide degradation can depend on certain groups of bacteria such as methanotrophs hedegaard et al 2020 since the microbial communities of rapid sand filters depends on inlet water chemistry and age albers et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 the removal potential of micropollutants might differ between waterworks it is unknown whether phytotoxins would remain stable during traditional groundwater treatment using sand filters as the main treatment process and thus potentially impair drinking water quality to our knowledge phytotoxin removal potential in the existing drinking water treatment has still not been investigated the objective of this study is to investigate the removal potential and mechanism of terpenoid and alkaloid phytotoxins in filter sand from biological rapid sand filters and to assess if the removal rates are similar at different waterworks here we focus on three different phytotoxin classes which are toxic mobile and recently detected in water resources norsesquiterpene glycosides ptaquiloside and caudatoside quinolizidine alkaloids sparteine and gramine and pyrrolizidine alkaloids jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide in addition we include the methylxanthine alkaloid caffeine a persistent compound commonly found in groundwater that also serves as a tracer compound in this study to be able to screen several different sand filters and compounds we performed these investigations as batch experiments in order to ensure reliable monitoring of the removal and to test a worst case scenario phytotoxins were applied at initial concentrations of 300 µg l 1 to better understand the mechanisms behind phytotoxin removal processes we performed physicochemical and dna analyses of the filter sand 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and analytical standards methanol meoh ms grade formic acid fa ms grade and ptfe membrane filter 0 2 μm were purchased from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany cellulose acetate filters 0 22 µm were purchased from frisenette knebel denmark analytical standards of ptaquiloside and caudatoside were prepared from bracken plant material by the method described by kisielius et al 2020b analytical standards of gramine sparteine and caffeine were purchased from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany and jacobine jacobine n oxide senecionine

purification system from elga veolia labwater high wycombe uk 2 2 analytical procedures two different analytical methods were used for the sample analyses quantification of ptaquiloside and caudatoside were performed by agilent 1260 infinity hplc system equipped with agilent 6130 single quadrupole mass spectrometer by the method described by kisielius et al 2020b for quantification of alkaloids samples were analysed on a waters acquity uplc i class module equipped with acquity uplc hss c18 column by the method described by hama and strobel 2019 2020b more details about the analytical procedures and ms settings is provided in supplementary material sm table s1 and table s2 2 3 collection of filter sand and water the investigation included filter sand collected at four waterworks in denmark including five biological rapid sand filters at these waterworks the treatment processes consist of aeration of anaerobic groundwater followed by filtration in primary and in two cases secondary rapid sand filters table 2 after filtration the treated water is led to clean water tanks and distributed to consumers filter sand was collected from the primary sand filters at the waterworks except at regnemark waterworks where the filter sand originated from a secondary filter since the primary filters contains gravel and stones table 2 regnemark is the largest of the investigated waterworks production of 11 1 million m3 per year and the filter sand has been undisturbed for approximately 50 years hvidovre waterworks treats approximately 200 000 m3 per year and has the longest empty bed contact time 72 min of the investigated rapid sand filters table 2 slangerup waterworks is the only investigated waterworks that receives water containing methane table 3 at brøndby waterworks the water is softened in pellet reactors by addition of naoh and subsequent precipitation of caco3 prior to aeration and rapid sand filtration hence the inlet water to the filters is characterized by elevated ph ph 8 4 and less water hardness table 3 two different sand filters were sampled at brøndby waterworks an old filter established before the softening process was implemented and hence the sand had a similar metal oxide coating as traditional sand filters while the other a new filter was implemented along with the softening process thus having less metal oxide coating filter sand was collected from the top 20 cm of the filter bed with a plastic bottle on an extendable shaft which was previously disinfected with 1 hypochlorite and rinsed with water the filter sand was transported to the laboratory in a disinfected plastic bucket covered by water from the sand filters on the top water was collected before inlet water and after outlet water biological rapid sand filtration table 3 in cleaned bottles rinsed with deionized water and transported to the laboratory while kept at 4 c 2 4 experimental set up microcosms and sampling within three hours of collecting water and filter sand at the waterworks 50 g of wet filter material was transferred with a sterilized spoon to 250 ml amber glass bottles which had previously been acid washed and heated to 555 c for 12 h 50 ml outlet water was added to each bottle and hence microcosms were set up abiotic controls were prepared with filter sand that was autoclaved three times 20 min 1 bar and 121 c and cooled down before the water was added to investigate phytotoxin removal microcosms were spiked with ptaquiloside caudatoside sparteine gramine jacobine n oxide senecionine n oxide and caffeine to an initial concentration of 300 µg l 1 we investigate pyrrolizidine alkaloids n oxide forms rather than their free base forms due to the more frequent occurrence of the n oxide forms in the environment günthardt et al 2020 hama and strobel 2020a microcosms were prepared in duplicates for each compound while abiotic controls were single batches microcosms and abiotic controls were kept standing at 8 10 c in the dark for the study period of 14 days microcosms from slangerup waterworks were only followed for 7 days and only in biotic samples after spiking microcosms with phytotoxins sampling started and were collected at time 0 min c0 and after 30 min 1 h 3 h 1 day 3 days 7 days 10 and 14 days before sampling the microcosms were gently mixed the lids were removed and samples were collected with sterile syringes and needles filtered using 0 2 μm filters and 0 5 ml was transferred to lcms vials final samples were diluted by a factor 2 using 100 meoh and kept at 20 c until analysis no later than 10 days after the samples were collected c0 samples were used for recovery calculations of biotic and abiotic microcosms in order to evaluate degradation of phytotoxins concentration in samples divided by the initial concentration c0 in the microcosm degradation data were fitted using a first order model one phase exponential decay equation in graphpad prism version 7 0 graphpad software san diego california usa we calculated total removal and biological removal after 7 days total removal was calculated as a residual between the initial concentration 100 and the measured recovery of phytotoxins biological removal was determined as the difference between recovery in biotic and abiotic samples 2 5 characterisation of filter sand material filter sand samples were kept at 20 c until physicochemical analyses we determined particle size distribution specific surface areas and content of fe mn c and n in five investigated sand filters table 4 more details about the analyses is provided in supplementary material filter sand from hvidovre waterworks contained a high fraction 57 of large grains 2 mm table 4 in contrast the youngest filter sand at brøndby waterworks new filter only contained 0 5 of large particles 2 mm filter sand from hvidovre and regnemark waterworks had the largest surface areas and the highest content of fe and mn table 4 filter sand from brøndby waterworks was different between new and old filters where old filter material had significantly larger surface area and metal oxide content the old filter at brøndby waterworks had been in use prior to implementation of pellet softening and had thus established a metal coating similar to the other waterworks in contrast a new filter was implemented along with pellet softening and since pellet softening is removing fe ii and mn ii along with other metals the filter metal oxide coating on the new filter was substantially less developed the highest c content was measured at regnemark and slangerup waterworks 2 6 filter sand dna analyses filter sand for dna analyses was immediately stored at 20 c upon arrival to the laboratory for two waterworks regnemark and brøndby dna analyses of filter sand were performed on sand both before and after the microcosm experiment dna extractions dna analysis and data analysis were performed at statens serum institut dna from filter sand material was extracted by a modified version of the previously described methods andersen et al 2013 using 500 µl wet filter sand material and 1 4 mm ziconium beads dna was amplified using four set of primers targeting nuclear ribosomal genes 16s 18s as described in krogsgaard et al 2018 sequences were mapped using a k mer based mapping software bion previously described by ring et al 2017 the dna sequencing data generated in this study are publicly available in the european nucleotide archive ena and more details about samples and accession numbers are provided in sm table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation and kinetics of investigated phytotoxins at regnemark waterworks we investigated degradation patterns and kinetics of phytotoxins in filter sand illustrated by results from regnemark waterworks fig 1 similar degradation curves for all other waterworks are available in sm the filter sand removed ptaquiloside and caudatoside to below the lod within 24 h fig 1 a and b removal was governed by an abiotic process since removal was either similar in biologically active microcosms and abiotic controls caudatoside or higher in abiotic controls fig 1 a and b the calculated half life of ptaquiloside is 291 h ayala luis et al 2006 but in contact with filter sand from regnemark ph 7 3 we observed the that half life was 3 4 h showing that the filter sand accelerated hydrolysis probably due to the presence of acid metal oxide coatings on the filter sand biologically active microcosms removed gramine and sparteine substantially faster than abiotic controls fig 1 c and d table 5 and removal was thus primarily caused by biological processes after seven days we could not detect any gramine and sparteine in biotic samples while in the abiotic samples they were present even after 14 days in high concentrations 56 and 82 respectively the pyrrolizidine alkaloids jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide were stable in biological microcosms fig 1 e and f with 60 87 recovery after 14 days interestingly filter sand transformed jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide to jacobine and senecionine free base form in abiotic samples after 10 days free base form of pyrrolizidine alkaloids are more toxic than the corresponding n oxide forms chou et al 2003 wang et al 2005 we observed a decrease from 60 to 0 for both n oxide forms while we measured a corresponding increase in free base form this transformation was also noted in soil degradation experiments and in rat liver and animals gut chou et al 2003 under oxidative conditions reduction of the n oxide to pyrrolizidine alkaloid free base form is inhibited wang et al 2005 the observed transformation in abiotic samples could be due to production of reductive materials during the autoclaving process that reduce n oxide forms while the non autoclaved oxic conditions were maintained in biotic samples and hence n oxides remained preserved however since the biologically active microcosms did not remove jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide removal and or transformation is not relevant for the full scale system where rapid sand filters are always biologically active no significant degradation of caffeine occurred in biotic and abiotic microcosms fig 1 g and 90 of the initial caffeine was still present after 14 days the filter sand removed a substantial fraction of ptaquiloside caudatoside gramine and sparteine from the water phase during the first hour of the experiment fig 1 therefore we find the removal relevant compared to the contact time in the filters 13 72 min table 2 3 2 degradation and kinetics for all waterworks the inlet water chemistry varies between different waterworks table 3 and this can influence removal of the investigated compounds for instance by affecting the composition of the microbiological community in the filter sand albers et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 it was therefore investigated how removal of phytotoxins varied between five different sand filters table 5 figure s1 figure s4 by determining the total removal tr and biological removal br in the filter sand all sand filters removed between 84 and 100 of the initial ptaquiloside and caudatoside within 7 days this removal occurred due to an abiotic process since removal rates were similar in biological active microcosms and abiotic controls in filter sand from brøndby waterworks complete ptaquiloside and caudatoside removal was obtained within the first half hour probably due to the elevated ph 8 4 caused by the prior softening process the filter sand from all investigated waterworks only removed a minor fraction 8 31 after 7 days of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide and no biological removal was observed all the investigated filter sands removed a substantial amount of quinolizidine alkaloids sparteine and gramine between 40 and 100 and biological processes significantly contributed to the removal in particular for filter sand from regnemark 86 for sparteine and partly hvidovre 50 for sparteine the biological processes were governing the removal no substantial removal of caffeine was observed 5 17 after 7 days for any of the investigated filter sands a first order degradation model was applied for fitting the kinetics of phytotoxin removal for ptaquiloside caudatoside gramine and sparteine in all investigated waterworks and degradation rate constants k1 were determined for biologically active microcosms in most cases the model fitted the data well r2 0 90 except for ptaquiloside and caudatoside at regnemark waterworks 0 85 removal rate constants for ptaquiloside and caudatoside varied between 1 2 and 32 10 3 h 1 g 1 except brøndby waterworks where due to the high water ph 8 4 degradation happened immediately removal rate constants 14000 10 3 h 1 g 1 removal constants of gramine and sparteine varied between 0 1 and 0 6 10 3 h 1 g 1 thus the observed degradation constants for ptaquiloside and caudatoside were up to two orders of magnitude higher than for gramine and sparteine table 6 filter sand from regnemark waterworks showed the lowest removal rate constant for ptaquiloside 2 8 10 3 h 1 g 1 and was also the waterworks with the lowest water ph 7 3 table 3 these variations of the rate constants with changing ph 6 9 are in line with other studies which found that degradation of ptaquiloside followed first order kinetics according to the ayala luis et al 2006 model of ptaquiloside degradation the rate constants of ptaquiloside at 10 c can be estimated to 2 1 10 2 h 1 to 2 4 10 3 h 1 for the investigated waterworks the observed rate constants are faster than the predicted rates by about two orders of magnitude our results suggest that the existing model wu et al 2021 based on ph and temperature and relevant for hydrolysis in groundwater does not capture all relevant dynamics in rapid sand filters at waterworks that also contain solids 3 3 degradation products we observed fast degradation of ptaquiloside and caudatoside in filter sand from all waterworks included in this study in particular at brøndby waterworks these compounds were completely hydrolysed within the first half hour probably due to the high water ph ph 8 4 table 3 ptaquiloside and caudatoside hydrolyse to form much more hydrophobic pterosins pterosin b and pterosin a respectively kisielius 2020 yamada et al 2007 therefore we investigated the presence of pterosin b and pterosin a in samples from brøndby waterworks new and old filter fig 2 the dissipation of both pterosins were similar in both filters however with a faster removal of pterosin b compared to pterosin a furthermore the removal in old filter sand was faster than removal in new filter sand in all cases the biologically active microcosms removed pterosins faster than autoclaved controls and removal could therefore partially be ascribed to a biological process it has previously been established that microorganisms rapidly degrade pterosin b skourti stathaki et al 2016 observed degradation of pterosins was much slower in comparison to ptaquiloside and caudatoside additionally the degradation intermediate dienone was detected during degradation of ptaquiloside and was present in the microcosms until the end of the study but not quantified a dienone is an unstable degradation compound and is assumed to be the ultimate agent responsible for carcinogenicity with the cyclopropyl group reacting with amino acids and dna and causing mutations da costa et al 2012 degradation of dienone subsequently leads to formation of non carcinogenic pterosin b figure s7 thus even though carcinogenic ptaquiloside was rapidly degraded in filter sands toxic degradation products were still present we did not screen for degradation products of alkaloids in all experiments but the transformation of jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide to corresponding free base form was observed and quantified at regnemark waterworks fig 1 e and f observed free base forms of jacobine and senecionine are the primary degradation products of pyrrolizidine alkaloids n oxide chou et al 2003 hama 2020 whereas the transformation of jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide to retronecine second degradation product figure s6 was not detected which could be due to short half life of retronecine hama 2020 for gramine and sparteine it was not possible to detect formation of any degradation products although the samples were screened for possible products table s2 4 variations of filter sand from all waterworks 4 1 physicochemical properties to characterize filter sand material we determined particle size distribution specific surface areas and content of fe mn c and n and the results showed that specific surface areas correlated highly with the content of metal oxides as well as c and n content in all filters table 4 filter sand from regnemark had the largest surface area and the highest carbon and metal oxide contents 71 mg fe g 1 and 65 mg mn g 1 this filter sand also showed the fastest degradation of phytotoxins table 5 among the investigated filters at brøndby waterworks better removal of pterosins was observed for the old filter fig 2 with higher metal oxide content and larger surface area in comparison to the new filter in addition only in the new filter sand from brøndby transformation of jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide to free base forms was observed in lower extent in abiotic samples 60 present after 14 days figure s3 where very little metal oxides coating were present presence of metal oxides could increase sorption processes and manganese oxides are one of the most active metal oxide catalysts which are shown to be excellent agents in the oxidation of various compounds e g toxic volatile organic compounds liao et al 2017 furthermore removal of other organic contaminants in filter sand e g the herbicide glyphosate was mainly attributed to adsorption in relation to the presence of metal oxides hedegaard et al 2014 metal oxides coatings on filter sand surfaces can also positively affect the colonization and activity of microbiological communities gülay et al 2014 and hence enhance biological removal 4 2 dna analyses of filter sand dna was extracted from all investigated sand filters in order to characterize bacteria communities the new filter at brøndby waterworks contained the highest number of gene copies 84 885 while the lowest number was detected at the old filter fig 3 we characterized 18 dominating bacteria genera which each constituted more than four percent of the total bacterial dna dominating genera in the filter sand material was crenothrix and nordella followed by nitrospira hyphomicrobium and sphingorhabdus the group labelled other bacteria in this study represents all bacteria that constituted below four percent of the total bacterial dna but still above the cut off value of 500 number of sequences at hvidovre waterworks other bacteria make a significant proportion of 34 overall bacteria present in the investigated sand filters differed between waterworks but could not apparently explain the observed differences in removal efficiencies of the sand filters the majority of eukaryotic sequences in each investigated sand filter belongs to phyla of amoebozoa cercozoa and ciliophora for total numbers of bacterial and eukaryotic gene copies see figure s5 the bacterial community in filters may be connected to its main functions oxidation of iron manganese ammonium and methane albers et al 2015 crenothrix belongs to the family methylococcaceae which are type i methanotrophs that obtain their carbon and energy from methane oxidation albers et al 2015 nitrospira is a well known nitrite oxidizing bacteria in groundwater fowler et al 2018 while a recent study correlated the genus nordella with mn ii oxidation in rapid sand filters zhao et al 2020 the genus hyphomicrobium was proposed as a key mn ii oxidizer albers et al 2015 organic trace contaminants can be degraded either by primary metabolism where microorganisms utilize them as sources of carbon and possibly also nitrogen phosphorus or sulphur alexander 1999 or by co metabolism where contaminants are transformed by enzymes without being used as an energy source vickers 2017 other studies have shown that co metabolism by methane oxidizing bacteria in rapid sand filters are relevant for degradation of the pesticide bentazone hedegaard et al 2020 biological removal was only observed for gramine and sparteine and was primarily of importance at regnemark waterworks at slangerup waterworks which receives the water with highest concentrations of methane table 3 no biological removal occurred table 5 and thus there were no indications that methanotrophs governed the removal of phytotoxins further studies are needed to determine which biological process removed the phytotoxins dna from microcosms with filter sands from brøndby and regnemark waterworks was analysed before and after the experiments during the experiments the bacteria community changed similarly in all three sand filters fig 4 hence the most abundant genera decreased e g crenothrix and nordella while the fraction of heterotrophic bacteria genera increased e g pseudomonas hence for the filter sand from regnemark waterworks which showed the highest biological removal table 5 the fraction of heterotrophs increased from 7 to 36 during the experiment however the increase in heterotrophic bacteria may merely be due to regrowth in the stagnant water yi et al 2019 since the increase was observed in all three investigated microcosms to be able to make stronger link between the microbial community members and phytotoxin degradation it would be essential to perform more rigorous replication as well as other analyses targeting activity and or functionality such as stable isotope probing sip and mrna 4 3 perspective to our knowledge this is the first investigation on phytotoxin degradation in filter sand from rapid sand filters we found that ptaquiloside and caudatoside were removed in filter sand with first order rate constants of 1 2 10 3 h 1 g 1 while rate constants for removal of gramine and sparteine varied between 0 1 and 0 6 10 3 h 1 g 1 showing a substantial removal potential of phytotoxins in filter sand however to be able to quantify degradation we applied phytotoxins at initial concentrations of 300 µg l 1 which is higher than concentrations found in the environment günthardt et al 2020 hama 2020 kisielius et al 2020a nanusha et al 2020 skrbic et al 2021 but is expected to cover extreme environmental conditions removal kinetics of the investigated compounds could be different at lower concentrations in real rapid sand filters which are flow through systems however other studies have found similar removal rates of pesticides in batch experiments with filter sand from waterworks as we found for phytotoxins e g herbicide mecoprop mcpp 1 6 10 3 h 1 g 1 even though the initial pesticide concentration was 0 2 µg l 1 hedegaard et al 2014 papadopoulou et al 2018 the norsesquiterpene glycosides are unique structures and their instability mainly derives from their ready hydrolysis by which the compounds transform to aromatic products which are much more stable than the parent compounds the alkaloids share the aromatic backbone with the pesticides mentioned but with the n substitutions stabilizing the structures instead of halogens for the pesticides since the contact time of the investigated sand filters was up to 72 min and a substantial removal of the investigated phytotoxins occurred within the first hour of the experiments fig 1 fig 2 there is a potential for phytotoxins to be removed in a full scale system however this needs to be further investigated in flow through systems at environmentally relevant concentrations pellet softening of drinking water was recently implemented for the first time in denmark hofor 2017 and results in an increased ph 8 4 of the water degradation kinetics of bracken toxins increases at ph 7 ayala luis et al 2006 and since pellet softening and hence elevated ph is already implemented before the sand filters at brøndby waterworks this explains why degradation of bracken toxins occurred immediately in filter sand from this waterworks the presence of the carcinogenic dienone intermediate was detected at the high water ph suggesting that drinking water quality might remain compromised in addition pellet softening limits formation of new coatings on the filter sand since it removes metals upstream of the filters this could decrease the removal potential for various micropollutants since it reduces coatings of manganese oxides which stimulate degradation of various organic compounds liao et al 2017 mineral coating might affect jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide transformation to free base forms since transformation in autoclaved controls with new filter sand from brøndby waterworks was substantially lower compared to other filter sands the microcosms set up used in this study proved to be a robust and fast approach to test removal of phytotoxins in drinking water systems and could be applied to a broader group of phytotoxins this study also found that the suggested predictive models by some studies on phytotoxins stability ayala luis et al 2006 are not directly applicable to actual waterworks as predicted removal rates were orders of magnitudes lower than observed in this study 5 conclusions we have demonstrated a removal potential of phytotoxins in filter sand obtained from biological rapid sand filters for the first time to screen the removal potential of several different phytotoxins in different filter sands the investigations were carried out as batch experiments phytotoxins were applied at initial concentrations of 300 µg l 1 to test worst case scenario we found that filter sand from five different rapid sand filters showed similar removal potential of the investigated phytotoxins all filter sands removed ptaquiloside and caudatoside completely from the water phase by an abiotic process this removal depended on ph and occurred immediately at a waterworks where pellet softening was implemented prior to rapid sand filtration and ph thus reached 8 4 during degradation of ptaquiloside and caudatoside we observed formation and subsequent removal of their hydrolysis products pterosin b and pterosin a while toxic intermediates dienones were also formed and maintain the water toxicity in contrast biological degradation governed the removal of the quinolizidine alkaloids sparteine and gramine differences between bacterial communities could not immediately explain different removal in the filter sands however along with biological degradation we observed an increase in the presence of heterotrophic bacteria in filter sands waterworks with the highest removal potential were characterized by high contents of iron and manganese oxide coatings and large sand filter specific surface areas the investigated filter sand removed certain phytotoxins namely bracken toxins and quinolizidine alkaloids hence if these phytotoxins enter wells used for drinking water production they might be removed in the already existing groundwater treatment however other groups of phytotoxins e g pyrrolizidine alkaloids are stable in filter sand which calls for further investigations involving more advanced treatment processes that could remove these compounds authors

16591,phytotoxins toxins produced by plants are contaminants with the potential to impair drinking water quality they encompass a large group of toxic partially persistent compounds that have been detected in seepage waters and in shallow wells used for drinking water production if phytotoxins enter wells used for drinking water production it is essential to know if the drinking water treatment processes will remove them from the water phase however it is currently unknown whether phytotoxins remain stable during traditional groundwater treatment using sand filters as the main treatment process the objective of this study is to investigate removal potential of phytotoxins in biological sand filters and to asses if the removal potential is similar at different waterworks microcosms were set up with filter sand and drinking water collected at different groundwater based waterworks to be able to monitor phytotoxin removal ptaquiloside caudatoside gramine sparteine jacobine n oxide senecionine n oxide and caffeine were applied at initial concentrations of 300 µg l 1 which is approx two orders of magnitude higher than currently detected in environment but expected to cover extreme environmental conditions removal was monitored over a period of 14 days despite the high initial concentration all filter sands removed ptaquiloside and caudatoside completely from the water phase and at waterworks where pellet softening was implemented ph 8 4 prior to rapid sand filtration complete removal occurred within the first 30 min all filter sands removed gramine and sparteine primarily by a biological process while jacobine n oxide senecionine n oxide and caffeine were recalcitrant in the filter sands during degradation of ptaquiloside and caudatoside we observed formation and subsequent removal of degradation products pterosin b and a filter sands with the highest removal potential were characterised by high contents of deposited iron and manganese oxides and hence large specific surface areas difference between bacterial communities investigated by 16s rrna gene analyses did not explain different removal in the filter sands all five investigated filter sands showed similar degradation patterns regardless of water chemistry and waterworks of origin in drinking water treatment systems biological sand filters might therefore remove phytotoxin contaminants such as ptaquiloside caudatoside gramine sparteine while for other compounds e g jacobine n oxide senecionine n oxide further investigations involving more advanced treatment options are needed

used as a drinking water source worldwide iwa 2014 in denmark groundwater is the primary source of drinking water with 1 coming from other sources while in europe on average 70 of the drinking water supply is based on groundwater iwa 2014 navarrete et al 2008 groundwater pollutants encompass a wide range of anthropogenic chemicals such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and household care products thomaidis et al 2012 which have already attracted much attention due to their wide occurrence however hazardous compounds can also have a natural origin phytotoxins are unexplored contaminants originating from plants and are polar mobile organic compounds pmocs which are neither monitored treated nor regulated in silico analyses suggest that a large number of phytotoxins are mobile and persistent in the environment and should be included in environmental monitoring and risk assessment günthardt et al 2018 recently the presence of a broader variety of phytotoxins has been confirmed in surface and seepage water clauson kaas et al 2016 günthardt et al 2020 hama 2020 nanusha et al 2020 kisielius et al 2020a skrbic et al 2021 in many cases concentrations of these compounds exceeded the threshold of toxicological concern for drinking water nanusha et al 2020 moreover presence of phytotoxins in water bodies might contribute to complex mixture toxicities bucheli 2014 that could jeopardize water quality while natural toxins such as cyanotoxins are well known drinking water contaminants guideline maximum value of 1 µg l 1 in drinking water for microcystin lr who 2003 knowledge on phytotoxins occurrence in drinking water is very limited a group of well studied phytotoxins are norsesquiterpene glycosides produced by bracken ferns which are known for their carcinogenic properties and toxin production in large quantities iarc 2018 kisielius 2020 the bracken toxins ptaquiloside and caudatoside are highly water soluble and mobile in the environment table 1 ptaquiloside can undergo acid as well as alkaline hydrolysis and the rate of hydrolysis is strongly ph dependant ayala luis et al 2006 wu et al 2021 ptaquiloside as well as the main product of hydrolysis pterosin b can be microbially degraded under environmental conditions in soils skourti stathaki et al 2016 ptaquiloside is found in surface water with reported concentrations up to 2 2 µg l 1 clauson kaas et al 2016 and in seepage water up to 0 35 µg l 1 skrbic et al 2020 caudatoside is more polar than ptaquiloside and has recently been detected in surface waters in denmark kisielius 2020 and shallow water wells 0 75 µg l 1 skrbic et al 2021 the detected concentrations exceed the maximum estimated tolerable concentration of ptaquiloside estimated to 0 002 µg l 1 rasmussen 2003 in drinking water alkaloids is the most abundant class of phytotoxins which encompass more than 12 000 compounds bucheli 2014 crozier et al 2008 pyrrolizidine alkaloids are considered defence chemicals used by plants against insects and herbivores van egmond 2004 the pyrrolizidine alkaloids jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide table 1 have been measured in a surface water ponds at concentrations up to 47 and 17 µg l 1 respectively while about 10 times lower concentrations have been detected in stream water kisielius et al 2020a the n oxide forms of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids have been more frequently detected than pyrrolizidine alkaloids free base forms in the environment günthardt et al 2020 hama and strobel 2020a sparteine is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid while gramine is a bicyclic alkaloid including an indole moiety table 1 both are abundant in fabaceae leguminosae plant family boschin and resta 2013 sparteine and gramine were detected in soil pore water at concentrations exceeding 0 1 µg l 1 in areas cropped with lupins lupinus spp hama and strobel 2020b caffeine has been detected in groundwater e g up to a concentration of 0 68 µg l 1 in italy castiglioni et al 2018 even though the origin of caffeine in groundwater is probably of anthropogenic origin it indicates that structurally similar natural alkaloids such as pyrrolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids may be sufficiently persistent to reach groundwater reservoirs there is a paucity of ecotoxicity data on selected phytotoxins bucheli 2014 however the measured concentrations of selected phytotoxins in water resources may exceed the threshold of toxicological concern level for drinking water mons et al 2013 the world health organisation who and the international agency for research on cancer classifies bracken fern as possible carcinogenic to humans group 2b while ptaquiloside is considered not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans group 3 due to lack of experimental data there are no environmental guidelines for pyrrolizidine alkaloids in water resources but e g who recommends minimum exposure and efsa recommends a maximum daily exposure of 23 7 ng kg 1 body weight kisielius et al 2020a most phytotoxins are polar with low kow and high water solubility and some exist as cations günthardt et al 2018 hence they are mobile in the environment and may contaminate groundwater table 1 groundwater based drinking water treatment is usually a simple process and in denmark it consists of aeration of anaerobic groundwater followed by rapid biological sand filtration during aeration the water reaches an oxygen concentration of 8 10 mg l 1 while volatile compounds such as methane and hydrogen sulphide are stripped off oxygen is needed for oxidation of ammonium fe ii and mn ii taking place in rapid sand filters mouchet 1992 rapid sand filters typically have a retention time between 7 and 10 min winter et al 2003 but can be up to 1 hour during filtration mn iv and fe iii form metal hydroxides and oxides from now on called metal oxides teunissen et al 2008 which deposit in the filter material yielding metal oxide coatings on filter sand quartz mature sand filter material is therefore rich in fe and mn oxides and has higher specific surface areas than uncoated sand sharma et al 2002 the biological rapid sand filters also harbour microbiological processes such as ammonium oxidation the microbiological community in the filter sand is affected by the inlet water chemistry and varies between different waterworks albers et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 micropollutants can be removed from drinking water by processes such as ozonation followed by biological activated carbon filtration van der hoek et al 1999 or granular activated carbon heijman et al 2002 however if micropollutants can be handled in simple biological rapid sand filters it would be of large practical and commercial interest since biological rapid sand filters are inexpensive and sustainable godskesen et al 2011 thus benner et al 2013 suggested to utilize sand filters as treatment technology for removal of micropollutants even though rapid sand filters are not designed to eliminate organic micropollutants their potential to remove pesticides has been demonstrated hedegaard and albrechtsen 2014 and full scale rapid sand filters at a groundwater based waterworks removed 46 of the herbicide mecoprop initial concentration 0 046 µg l 1 within a contact time of 8 min hedegaard et al 2014 lab scale investigations with filter sand have shown that microbiological degradation of pesticides such as bentazone led to complete mineralization hedegaard et al 2019 however pesticide degradation can depend on certain groups of bacteria such as methanotrophs hedegaard et al 2020 since the microbial communities of rapid sand filters depends on inlet water chemistry and age albers et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 the removal potential of micropollutants might differ between waterworks it is unknown whether phytotoxins would remain stable during traditional groundwater treatment using sand filters as the main treatment process and thus potentially impair drinking water quality to our knowledge phytotoxin removal potential in the existing drinking water treatment has still not been investigated the objective of this study is to investigate the removal potential and mechanism of terpenoid and alkaloid phytotoxins in filter sand from biological rapid sand filters and to assess if the removal rates are similar at different waterworks here we focus on three different phytotoxin classes which are toxic mobile and recently detected in water resources norsesquiterpene glycosides ptaquiloside and caudatoside quinolizidine alkaloids sparteine and gramine and pyrrolizidine alkaloids jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide in addition we include the methylxanthine alkaloid caffeine a persistent compound commonly found in groundwater that also serves as a tracer compound in this study to be able to screen several different sand filters and compounds we performed these investigations as batch experiments in order to ensure reliable monitoring of the removal and to test a worst case scenario phytotoxins were applied at initial concentrations of 300 µg l 1 to better understand the mechanisms behind phytotoxin removal processes we performed physicochemical and dna analyses of the filter sand 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and analytical standards methanol meoh ms grade formic acid fa ms grade and ptfe membrane filter 0 2 μm were purchased from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany cellulose acetate filters 0 22 µm were purchased from frisenette knebel denmark analytical standards of ptaquiloside and caudatoside were prepared from bracken plant material

analytical procedures and ms settings is provided in supplementary material sm table s1 and table s2 2 3 collection of filter sand and water the investigation included filter sand collected at four waterworks in denmark including five biological rapid sand filters at these waterworks the treatment processes consist of aeration of anaerobic groundwater followed by filtration in primary and in two cases secondary rapid sand filters table 2 after filtration the treated water is led to clean water tanks and distributed to consumers filter sand was collected from the primary sand filters at the waterworks except at regnemark waterworks where the filter sand originated from a secondary filter since the primary filters contains gravel and stones table 2 regnemark is the largest of the investigated waterworks production of 11 1 million m3 per year and the filter sand has been undisturbed for approximately 50 years hvidovre waterworks treats approximately 200 000 m3 per year and has the longest empty bed contact time 72 min of the investigated rapid sand filters table 2 slangerup waterworks is the only investigated waterworks that receives water containing methane table 3 at brøndby waterworks the water is softened in pellet reactors by addition of naoh and subsequent precipitation of caco3 prior to aeration and rapid sand filtration hence the inlet water to the filters is characterized by elevated ph ph 8 4 and less water hardness table 3 two different sand filters were sampled at brøndby waterworks an old filter established before the softening process was implemented and hence the sand had a similar metal oxide coating as traditional sand filters while the other a new filter was implemented along with the softening process thus having less metal oxide coating filter sand was collected from the top 20 cm of the filter bed with a plastic bottle on an extendable shaft which was previously disinfected with 1 hypochlorite and rinsed with water the filter sand was transported to the laboratory in a disinfected plastic bucket covered by water from the sand filters on the top water was collected before inlet water and after outlet water biological rapid sand filtration table 3 in cleaned bottles rinsed with deionized water and transported to the laboratory while kept at 4 c 2 4 experimental set up microcosms and sampling within three hours of collecting water and filter sand at the waterworks 50 g of wet filter material was transferred with a sterilized spoon to 250 ml amber glass bottles which had previously been acid washed and heated to 555 c for 12 h 50 ml outlet water was added to each bottle and hence microcosms were set up abiotic controls were prepared with filter sand that was autoclaved three times 20 min 1 bar and 121 c and cooled down before the water was added to investigate phytotoxin removal microcosms were spiked with ptaquiloside caudatoside sparteine gramine jacobine n oxide senecionine n oxide and caffeine to an initial concentration of 300 µg l 1 we investigate pyrrolizidine alkaloids n oxide forms rather than their free base forms due to the more frequent occurrence of the n oxide forms in the environment günthardt et al 2020 hama and strobel 2020a microcosms were prepared in duplicates for each compound while abiotic controls were single batches microcosms and abiotic controls were kept standing at 8 10 c in the dark for the study period of 14 days microcosms from slangerup waterworks were only followed for 7 days and only in biotic samples after spiking microcosms with phytotoxins sampling started and were collected at time 0 min c0 and after 30 min 1 h 3 h 1 day 3 days 7 days 10 and 14 days before sampling the microcosms were gently mixed the lids were removed and samples were collected with sterile syringes and needles filtered using 0 2 μm filters and 0 5 ml was transferred to lcms vials final samples were diluted by a factor 2 using 100 meoh and kept at 20 c until analysis no later than 10 days after the samples were collected c0 samples were used for recovery calculations of biotic and abiotic microcosms in order to evaluate degradation of phytotoxins concentration in samples divided by the initial concentration c0 in the microcosm degradation data were fitted using a first order model one phase exponential decay equation in graphpad prism version 7 0 graphpad software san diego california usa we calculated total removal and biological removal after 7 days total removal was calculated as a residual between the initial concentration 100 and the measured recovery of phytotoxins biological removal was determined as the difference between recovery in biotic and abiotic samples 2 5 characterisation of filter sand material filter sand samples were kept at 20 c until physicochemical analyses we determined particle size distribution specific surface areas and content of fe mn c and n in five investigated sand filters table 4 more details about the analyses is provided in supplementary material filter sand from hvidovre waterworks contained a high fraction 57 of large grains 2 mm table 4 in contrast the youngest filter sand at brøndby waterworks new filter only contained 0 5 of large particles 2 mm filter sand from hvidovre and regnemark waterworks had the largest surface areas and the highest content of fe and mn table 4 filter sand from brøndby waterworks was different between new and old filters where old filter material had significantly larger surface area and metal oxide content the old filter at brøndby waterworks had been in use prior to implementation of pellet softening and had thus established a metal coating similar to the other waterworks in contrast a new filter was implemented along with pellet softening and since pellet softening is removing fe ii and mn ii along with other metals the filter metal oxide coating on the new filter was substantially less developed the highest c content was measured at regnemark and slangerup waterworks 2 6 filter sand dna analyses filter sand for dna analyses was immediately stored at 20 c upon arrival to the laboratory for two waterworks regnemark and brøndby dna analyses of filter sand were performed on sand both before and after the microcosm experiment dna extractions dna analysis and data analysis were performed at statens serum institut dna from filter sand material was extracted by a modified version of the previously described methods andersen et al 2013 using 500 µl wet filter sand material and 1 4 mm ziconium beads dna was amplified using four set of primers targeting nuclear ribosomal genes 16s 18s as described in krogsgaard et al 2018 sequences were mapped using a k mer based mapping software bion previously described by ring et al 2017 the dna sequencing data generated in this study are publicly available in the european nucleotide archive ena and more details about samples and accession numbers are provided in sm table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation and kinetics of investigated phytotoxins at regnemark waterworks we investigated degradation patterns and kinetics of phytotoxins in filter sand illustrated by results from regnemark waterworks fig 1 similar degradation curves for all other waterworks are available in sm the filter sand removed ptaquiloside and caudatoside to below the lod within 24 h fig 1 a and b removal was governed by an abiotic process since removal was either similar in biologically active microcosms and abiotic controls caudatoside or higher in abiotic controls fig 1 a and b the calculated half life of ptaquiloside is 291 h ayala luis et al 2006 but in contact with filter sand from regnemark ph 7 3 we observed the that half life was 3 4 h showing that the filter sand accelerated hydrolysis probably due to the presence of acid metal oxide coatings on the filter sand biologically active microcosms removed gramine and sparteine substantially faster than abiotic controls fig 1 c and d table 5 and removal was thus primarily caused by biological processes after seven days we could not detect any gramine and sparteine in biotic samples while in the abiotic samples they were present even after 14 days in high concentrations 56 and 82 respectively the pyrrolizidine alkaloids jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide were stable in biological microcosms fig 1 e and f with 60 87 recovery after 14 days interestingly filter sand transformed jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide to jacobine and senecionine free base form in abiotic samples after 10 days free base form of pyrrolizidine alkaloids are more toxic than the corresponding n oxide forms chou et al 2003 wang et al 2005 we observed a decrease from 60 to 0 for both n oxide forms while we measured a corresponding increase in free base form this transformation was also noted in soil degradation experiments and in rat liver and animals gut chou et al 2003 under oxidative conditions reduction of the n oxide to pyrrolizidine alkaloid free base form is inhibited wang et al 2005 the observed transformation in abiotic samples could be due to production of reductive materials during the autoclaving process that reduce n oxide forms while the non autoclaved oxic conditions were maintained in biotic samples and hence n oxides remained preserved however since the biologically active microcosms did not remove jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide removal and or transformation is not relevant for the full scale system where rapid sand filters are always biologically active no significant degradation of caffeine occurred in biotic and abiotic microcosms fig 1 g and 90 of the initial caffeine was still present after 14 days the filter sand removed a substantial fraction of ptaquiloside caudatoside gramine and sparteine from the water phase during the first hour of the experiment fig 1 therefore we find the removal relevant compared to the contact time in the filters 13 72 min table 2 3 2 degradation and kinetics for all waterworks the inlet water chemistry varies between different waterworks table 3 and this can influence removal of the investigated compounds for instance by affecting the composition of the microbiological community in the filter sand albers et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 it was therefore investigated how removal of phytotoxins varied between five different sand filters table 5 figure s1 figure s4 by determining the total removal tr and biological removal br in the filter sand all sand filters removed between 84 and 100 of the initial ptaquiloside and caudatoside within 7 days this removal occurred due to an abiotic process since removal rates were similar in biological active microcosms and abiotic controls in filter sand from brøndby waterworks complete ptaquiloside and caudatoside removal was obtained within the first half hour probably due to the elevated ph 8 4 caused by the prior softening process the filter sand from all investigated waterworks only removed a minor fraction 8 31 after 7 days of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide and no biological removal was observed all the investigated filter sands removed a substantial amount of quinolizidine alkaloids sparteine and gramine between 40 and 100 and biological processes significantly contributed to the removal in particular for filter sand from regnemark 86 for sparteine and partly hvidovre 50 for sparteine the biological processes were governing the removal no substantial removal of caffeine was observed 5 17 after 7 days for any of the investigated filter sands a first order degradation model was applied for fitting the kinetics of phytotoxin removal for ptaquiloside caudatoside gramine and sparteine in all investigated waterworks and degradation rate constants k1 were determined for biologically active microcosms in most cases the model fitted the data well r2 0 90 except for ptaquiloside and caudatoside at regnemark waterworks 0 85 removal rate constants for ptaquiloside and caudatoside varied between 1 2 and 32 10 3 h 1 g 1 except brøndby waterworks where due to the high water ph 8 4 degradation happened immediately removal rate constants 14000 10 3 h 1 g 1 removal constants of gramine and sparteine varied between 0 1 and 0 6 10 3 h 1 g 1 thus the observed degradation constants for ptaquiloside and caudatoside were up to two orders of magnitude higher than for gramine and sparteine table 6 filter sand from regnemark waterworks showed the lowest removal rate constant for ptaquiloside 2 8 10 3 h 1 g 1 and was also the waterworks with the lowest water ph 7 3 table 3 these variations of the rate constants with changing ph 6 9 are in line with other studies which found that degradation of ptaquiloside followed first order kinetics according to the ayala luis et al 2006 model of ptaquiloside degradation the rate constants of ptaquiloside at 10 c can be estimated to 2 1 10 2 h 1 to 2 4 10 3 h 1 for the investigated waterworks the observed rate constants are faster than the predicted rates by about two orders of magnitude our results suggest that the existing model wu et al 2021 based on ph and temperature and relevant for hydrolysis in groundwater does not capture all relevant dynamics in rapid sand filters at waterworks that also contain solids 3 3 degradation products we observed fast degradation of ptaquiloside and caudatoside in filter sand from all waterworks included in this study in particular at brøndby waterworks these compounds were completely hydrolysed within the first half hour probably due to the high water ph ph 8 4 table 3 ptaquiloside and caudatoside hydrolyse to form much more hydrophobic pterosins pterosin b and pterosin a respectively kisielius 2020 yamada et al 2007 therefore we investigated the presence of pterosin b and pterosin a in samples from brøndby waterworks new and old filter fig 2 the dissipation of both pterosins were similar in both filters however with a faster removal of pterosin b compared to pterosin a furthermore the removal in old filter sand was faster than removal in new filter sand in all cases the biologically active microcosms removed pterosins faster than autoclaved controls and removal could therefore partially be ascribed to a biological process it has previously been established that microorganisms rapidly degrade pterosin b skourti stathaki et al 2016 observed degradation of pterosins was much slower in comparison to ptaquiloside and caudatoside additionally the degradation intermediate dienone was detected during degradation of ptaquiloside and was present in the microcosms until the end of the study but not quantified a dienone is an unstable degradation compound and is assumed to be the ultimate agent responsible for carcinogenicity with the cyclopropyl group reacting with amino acids and dna and causing mutations da costa et al 2012 degradation of dienone subsequently leads to formation of non carcinogenic pterosin b figure s7 thus even though carcinogenic ptaquiloside was rapidly degraded in filter sands toxic degradation products were still present we did not screen for degradation products of alkaloids in all experiments but the transformation of jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide to corresponding free base form was observed and quantified at regnemark waterworks fig 1 e and f observed free base forms of jacobine and senecionine are the primary degradation products of pyrrolizidine alkaloids n oxide chou et al 2003 hama 2020 whereas the transformation of jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide to retronecine second degradation product figure s6 was not detected which could be due to short half life of retronecine hama 2020 for gramine and sparteine it was not possible to detect formation of any degradation products although the samples were screened for possible products table s2 4 variations of filter sand from all waterworks 4 1 physicochemical properties to characterize filter sand material we determined particle size distribution specific surface areas and content of fe mn c and n and the results showed that specific surface areas correlated highly with the content of metal oxides as well as c and n content in all filters table 4 filter sand from regnemark had the largest surface area and the highest carbon and metal oxide contents 71 mg fe g 1 and 65 mg mn g 1 this filter sand also showed the fastest degradation of phytotoxins table 5 among the investigated filters at brøndby waterworks better removal of pterosins was observed for the old filter fig 2 with higher metal oxide content and larger surface area in comparison to the new filter in addition only in the new filter sand from brøndby transformation of jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide to free base forms was observed in lower extent in abiotic samples 60 present after 14 days figure s3 where very little metal oxides coating were present presence of metal oxides could increase sorption processes and manganese oxides are one of the most active metal oxide catalysts which are shown to be excellent agents in the oxidation of various compounds e g toxic volatile organic compounds liao et al 2017 furthermore removal of other organic contaminants in filter sand e g the herbicide glyphosate was mainly attributed to adsorption in relation to the presence of metal oxides hedegaard et al 2014 metal oxides coatings on filter sand surfaces can also positively affect the colonization and activity of microbiological communities gülay et al 2014 and hence enhance biological removal 4 2 dna analyses of filter sand dna was extracted from all investigated sand filters in order to characterize bacteria communities the new filter at brøndby waterworks contained the highest number of gene copies 84 885 while the lowest number was detected at the old filter fig 3 we characterized 18 dominating bacteria genera which each constituted more than four percent of the total bacterial dna dominating genera in the filter sand material was crenothrix and nordella followed by nitrospira hyphomicrobium and sphingorhabdus the group labelled other bacteria in this study represents all bacteria that constituted below four percent of the total bacterial dna but still above the cut off value of 500 number of sequences at hvidovre waterworks other bacteria make a significant proportion of 34 overall bacteria present in the investigated sand filters differed between waterworks but could not apparently explain the observed differences in removal efficiencies of the sand filters the majority of eukaryotic sequences in each investigated sand filter belongs to phyla of amoebozoa cercozoa and ciliophora for total numbers of bacterial and eukaryotic gene copies see figure s5 the bacterial community in filters may be connected to its main functions oxidation of iron manganese ammonium and methane albers et al 2015 crenothrix belongs to the family methylococcaceae which are type i methanotrophs that obtain their carbon and energy from methane oxidation albers et al 2015 nitrospira is a well known nitrite oxidizing bacteria in groundwater fowler et al 2018 while a recent study correlated the genus nordella with mn ii oxidation in rapid sand filters zhao et al 2020 the genus hyphomicrobium was proposed as a key mn ii oxidizer albers et al 2015 organic trace contaminants can be degraded either by primary metabolism where microorganisms utilize them as sources of carbon and possibly also nitrogen phosphorus or sulphur alexander 1999 or by co metabolism where contaminants are transformed by enzymes without being used as an energy source vickers 2017 other studies have shown that co metabolism by methane oxidizing bacteria in rapid sand filters are relevant for degradation of the pesticide bentazone hedegaard et al 2020 biological removal was only observed for gramine and sparteine and was primarily of importance at regnemark waterworks at slangerup waterworks which receives the water with highest concentrations of methane table 3 no biological removal occurred table 5 and thus there were no indications that methanotrophs governed the removal of phytotoxins further studies are needed to determine which biological process removed the phytotoxins dna from microcosms with filter sands from brøndby and regnemark waterworks was analysed before and after the experiments during the experiments the bacteria community changed similarly in all three sand filters fig 4 hence the most abundant genera decreased e g crenothrix and nordella while the fraction of heterotrophic bacteria genera increased e g pseudomonas hence for the filter sand from regnemark waterworks which showed the highest biological removal table 5 the fraction of heterotrophs increased from 7 to 36 during the experiment however the increase in heterotrophic bacteria may merely be due to regrowth in the stagnant water yi et al 2019 since the increase was observed in all three investigated microcosms to be able to make stronger link between the microbial community members and phytotoxin degradation it would be essential to perform more rigorous replication as well as other analyses targeting activity and or functionality such as stable isotope probing sip and mrna 4 3 perspective to our knowledge this is the first investigation on phytotoxin degradation in filter sand from rapid sand filters we found that ptaquiloside and caudatoside were removed in filter sand with first order rate constants of 1 2 10 3 h 1 g 1 while rate constants for removal of gramine and sparteine varied between 0 1 and 0 6 10 3 h 1 g 1 showing a substantial removal potential of phytotoxins in filter sand however to be able to quantify degradation we applied phytotoxins at initial concentrations of 300 µg l 1 which is higher than concentrations found in the environment günthardt et al 2020 hama 2020 kisielius et al 2020a nanusha et al 2020 skrbic et al 2021 but is expected to cover extreme environmental conditions removal kinetics of the investigated compounds could be different at lower concentrations in real rapid sand filters which are flow through systems however other studies have found similar removal rates of pesticides in batch experiments with filter sand from waterworks as we found for phytotoxins e g herbicide mecoprop mcpp 1 6 10 3 h 1 g 1 even though the initial pesticide concentration was 0 2 µg l 1 hedegaard et al 2014 papadopoulou et al 2018 the norsesquiterpene glycosides are unique structures and their instability mainly derives from their ready hydrolysis by which the compounds transform to aromatic products which are much more stable than the parent compounds the alkaloids share the aromatic backbone with the pesticides mentioned but with the n substitutions stabilizing the structures instead of halogens for the pesticides since the contact time of the investigated sand filters was up to 72 min and a substantial removal of the investigated phytotoxins occurred within the first hour of the experiments fig 1 fig 2 there is a potential for phytotoxins to be removed in a full scale system however this needs to be further investigated in flow through systems at environmentally relevant concentrations pellet softening of drinking water was recently implemented for the first time in denmark hofor 2017 and results in an increased ph 8 4 of the water degradation kinetics of bracken toxins increases at ph 7 ayala luis et al 2006 and since pellet softening and hence elevated ph is already implemented before the sand filters at brøndby waterworks this explains why degradation of bracken toxins occurred immediately in filter sand from this waterworks the presence of the carcinogenic dienone intermediate was detected at the high water ph suggesting that drinking water quality might remain compromised in addition pellet softening limits formation of new coatings on the filter sand since it removes metals upstream of the filters this could decrease the removal potential for various micropollutants since it reduces coatings of manganese oxides which stimulate degradation of various organic compounds liao et al 2017 mineral coating might affect jacobine n oxide and senecionine n oxide transformation to free base forms since transformation in autoclaved controls with new filter sand from brøndby waterworks was substantially lower compared to other filter sands the microcosms set up used in this study proved to be a robust and fast approach to test removal of phytotoxins in drinking water systems and could be applied to a broader group of phytotoxins this study also found that the suggested predictive models by some studies on phytotoxins stability ayala luis et al 2006 are not directly applicable to actual waterworks as predicted removal rates were orders of magnitudes lower than observed in this study 5 conclusions we have demonstrated a removal potential of phytotoxins in filter sand obtained from biological rapid sand filters for the first time to screen the removal potential of several different phytotoxins in different filter sands the investigations were carried out as batch experiments phytotoxins were applied at initial concentrations of 300 µg l 1 to test worst case scenario we found that filter sand from five different rapid sand filters showed similar removal potential of the investigated phytotoxins all filter sands removed ptaquiloside and caudatoside completely from the water phase by an abiotic process this removal depended on ph and occurred immediately at a waterworks where pellet softening was implemented prior to rapid sand filtration and ph thus reached 8 4 during degradation of ptaquiloside and caudatoside we observed formation and subsequent removal of their hydrolysis products pterosin b and pterosin a while toxic intermediates dienones were also formed and maintain the water toxicity in contrast biological degradation governed the removal of the quinolizidine alkaloids sparteine and gramine differences between bacterial communities could not immediately explain different removal in the filter sands however along with biological degradation we observed an increase in the presence of heterotrophic bacteria in filter sands waterworks with the highest removal potential were characterized by high contents of iron and manganese oxide coatings and large sand filter specific surface areas the investigated filter sand removed certain phytotoxins namely bracken toxins and quinolizidine alkaloids hence if these phytotoxins enter wells used for drinking water production they might be removed in the already existing groundwater treatment however other groups of phytotoxins e g pyrrolizidine alkaloids are stable in filter sand which calls for further investigations involving more advanced treatment processes that could remove these compounds authors

16592,our screening data revealed the threat macrolide antibiotics especially azithromycin azn posed to human health with its increasing occurrence in water environment the electrochemical sensor based on molecularly imprinted polymer mip is a promising platform that caters for the next generation of intelligent wastewater treatment plants wwtps by virtue of its wide tolerance to water from all sources and in situ monitoring however low initiation potentials of cross linking monomers contributed by the electron rich circumstance allowed them to usurp sites designed for functional monomers when electrically stimulated leading to an unsatisfactory binding capacity another uncertainty is that multiple reaction sites of cross linking monomers granted them complex polymerization routes and made it difficult to ensure the consistency of preparation serval monomers had been investigated with electrochemical tools and the performance of sensors constructed with these monomers were compared in this study based on the results we proposed a protocol in which a novel functional monomer possessing a stronger electron donating group phenyl was adopted to compete for the dominance in electropolymerization beyond that the cross linking monomer was modified with electron withdrawing groups to raise its initiation potential a monothiophene with a moderate initiation potential was also recruited as the linker to address the steric hindrance in this way polymerization proceeded in a specific order it is worth mentioning that the marangoni flow is an ideal tool to deal with the coffee ring deposition while drop casting the resulting sensor showed good performance with a limitation of detection lod of 0 120 μm for azn and a satisfactory selectivity and the design can be applied to constructing sensors for a variety of macrolide antibiotics graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords in situ monitoring molecularly imprinted

2019 vazquez laslop and mankin 2018 due to its excellent clinical performance macrolides entered human society in large quantities and some of them were excreted into nature consequently macrolide antibiotics frequently appeared in the research reports of water pollutants around the world alygizakis et al 2019 oberoi et al 2019 senta et al 2019 according to our own screening data in 2019 fig 1 macrolide antibiotics like azn and roxithromycin rox exhibited worrying health risks worse still the clinical usage of macrolides has risen sharply in the face of raging covid 19 including the exploration of some new treatment methods liu et al 2020 nishiga et al 2020 sheridan 2020 takahashi et al 2020 the situation forces us to be more alert to the rapid establishment of macrolide resistance two terrible outcomes are approaching that is a sharp increase in the mortality of drug resistant diseases and the shortened lifespan of such antibiotics chakaya et al 2021 rossiter et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 only accurate concentration of macrolide antibiotics in the environment can properly guide the prescription and drug production and make it possible to allocate the optimal resources for targeted removal thus long term monitoring of macrolide antibiotics should be on the agenda while the drawbacks of traditional high accuracy equipment are burdens to township wwtps when considering upgrading to the next generation of intelligent wastewater treatment plants at present the most widely used analysis method for macrolides is lc ms patel et al 2019 senta et al 2019 terzic et al 2018 voigt et al 2020 choosing this strategy means to endure its costly equipment massive manual labor huge consumption of toxic reagents and extremely poor mobility patel et al 2019 an alternative strategy is to resort to electrochemical methods the electrochemical approaches do not require excessive reagents and manpower and the equipment depreciation cost power consumption and working period are much lower than large scale analytical instruments so they are always cost effective clifford et al 2021 manjunatha 2020 tigari and manjunatha 2020 equipped with these qualities electrochemical sensor is a platform who meets the requirements of portability sustainability and sensitivity manjunatha et al 2012 wongkaew et al 2019 there have been some related reports but most of these sensors were only used to determine the concentration of a certain macrolide without interfering substances vajdle et al 2016 2017 2020 also traditional biosensors are heavily dependent on biological recognition elements that possessing shortcomings like fragile structure poor long term stability reproducibility and high cost romanholo et al 2021 in order to deal with the complex sewage the selectivity and robustness of the sensor has to reach more stringent standards mip is an ideal identification element as it selectively binds to the target through a specific spatial structure and matched covalent non covalent bonds belbruno 2019 electropolymerization accurately produces homogeneous mip on the electrode with adequate energy rebelo et al 2021 in that the thickness of film depends on the charge as for the unit used to seize macrolides non covalent interactions like hydrogen bonds are not supposed to be the only forces we rely on since there are varieties of small polar molecules competing for binding sites in complex sewage kolkman et al 2021 taking all these factors into account we chose thiophenes with boronic acid groups as functional monomers which specifically form borate ester with the cis diol moieties of macrolides aeridou et al 2020 although there have been reports on the preparation of mip with boronic thiophene dabrowski et al 2016 sharma et al 2016 stoian et al 2020 there has been no detailed description of considerations from selecting to configurating monomers and finally producing reliable sensors that can be adjusted to detecting some other contaminants by merely replacing templates so far in our laboratory serval monomers had been investigated with electrochemical approaches and the performance of constructed sensors were compared based on the results we discovered an adequate initiation sequence by which monomers could work together effectively interestingly the high electron density of cross linking monomer made it always oxidized first when the voltage increases and their multiple oxidizable sites tend to attack each other when activated thus these cross linking monomers occupied most of the positions on the electrode surface specific monomers were selected to ensure the predominant role of functional monomers in polymerization the monomers here performed their own duties like initiating others passing through radicals or uniting clusters after optimizing parameters selectivity and linear range of reproducible sensors were studied this work is dedicated to provide a comprehensive guidance on the selection and organization of monomers and to explore a useful prototype for later workers who want to prepare mip sensors with thiophene monomers 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials azn rox

that the stock solution here was free of electrolyte moreover time for extraction and rebinding as well as the stirring rate were improved by comparing the response of resulted sensor to 50 µm azn

vs non aqueous ag electrode or 1 675 v vs nhe for 30 s the electrode was taken out of the solution exactly when the polymerization ended and been rinsed with acetonitrile then it was sent to template extraction rebinding of the target was carried out with the electrode immersed in the stirred azn tap water solution ph 7 6 0 22 rsd 0 29 n 9 for 20 min swv was performed to indicate the binding of the target on the mife surface when the polymerization ended extraction completed and rebinding ended evaluation of reproducibility repeatability stability and selectivity were performed according to the methods described in supplementary file other mifes for sensing of macrolide antibiotics like ery rox and cla were completed in a similar way but template replaced 3 results 3 1 concentration and risk quotients rq of 27 ppcps in effluents of 5 wwtps in jiangsu the concentration and provisional no effect concentrations pnec of 27 ppcps were plotted in fig 1 basic water quality indicators of collected samples were determined and shown in table s1 abbreviations and major physicochemical properties of target contaminants were listed in table s2 among them azn and rox showed high risk with rqs of 1 75 and 1 00 respectively rq referred to a work of ben et al 2018 is calculated by dividing the monitoring concentration by the predicted no effect concentration where rq 1 suggests a high risk and 0 1 rq 1 shows a medium risk it cannot be ignored that the rq of cla had also reached 0 253 and even if the effluents were ultra filtered these high risk substances could not be effectively reduced let alone the traditional water treatment processes oberoi et al 2019 full records of rqs are available in table s3 3 2 selection of compatible monomers polythiophene pth polypyrrole ppy and polyaniline pani are the most widely used conducting polymers in recent years liu et al 2018 in our trail experiment pth exhibited a better stability than ppy and pani in the working potential window 0 0 5 v vs sce figure s4 hence thiophenes were the preferred monomers for us the initiation potentials of 13 thiophene monomers were determined with square wave voltammetry and the results were integrated in fig 2 the 4 monomers in window a were candidates for functional monomers which were characterized by boronic acid groups monomers in window b competed for the role of cross linking monomers which were all consisted of two connected thiophene rings the 5 monothiophenes with unmodified positions 2 and 5 in window c served as linkers the initiation potentials of ph 3 tba 4 me 3 tba 3 tba and 4 br 3 tba were 1 60 1 81 1 91 and 1 97 v vs non aqueous ag electrode respectively the oxidation peaks of the crosslinking monomer stretched far but what mattered was the position where the polymerization started namely 1 32 v for 2 2 bth 1 58 v for 3 3 br 2 2 bth 1 37 v for 3 3 bth and 1 90 v for 4 4 br 3 3 bth vs non aqueous ag electrode the initiation potentials of edot 3 me th th 3 br th and 3 4 br th were 1 48 1 82 2 00 2 06 and 2 16 v vs non aqueous ag electrode respectively to screen the most compatible monomers and also to verify the inference we will mention later 4 combinations of monomers as listed in table s4 were used to fabricate mifes square wave voltammograms of the resulting electrodes were exhibited in fig 3 a solid line among them iii is the only combination whose cross linking monomer possessed a lower initiation potential than its functional monomer more detailed information was tucked into supplementary file the signals of the three mifes other than iii ascended a lot after removing the template dotted line for comparison the square wave voltammograms of nifes before and after extraction were presented in fig 3b a surge in signals was also observed on nip i and nip ii after extraction yet nip iii and nip iv did not change significantly the results denote that the rise in signals of mife i and ii were mainly attributed to the weak structure of nip as a result mife iv actually possessed the largest binding capacity next we proceeded to the configuration of linkers as far as we know not all systems need linkers as shown in fig 4 d the introduction of azn amplified the peak current of the swv scan and there was no obvious change in the position and shape of the peak in other words azn could hardly hinder the polymerization of monomer like 4 me 3 tba because of the relatively low steric hindrance however the presence of azn evidently reduced the polymerization current of ph 3 tba and the sharp peak at around 1 55 v split into two consecutive broad peaks as shown in fig 4e the polymerization turned out to be more difficult in systems with huge steric hindrance and a higher overpotential was required in view of this we chose 3 me th with an initiation potential at 1 8 v as the linker of combination iv 3 3 optimization of operating parameters in this section we tried to polish the preparation to get a more well performed and stable sensor in further experiments we found that the properties of the sensors prepared under the same conditions in the solution varied a lot then the polymerization behavior of monomers was studied separately as displayed in fig 2 monothiophenes had only one oxidation peak while two or more oxidation peaks of bithiophene monomers were observed in the potential window time for monomers to reach 1mc at different concentrations in solution under a constant potential revealed the different polymerization behaviors of monothiophene monomer and bithiophene monomer some data not shown for monothiophenes like 3 tba the higher the concentration the faster the polymerization fig 4a while for 4 4 br 3 3 bth who had 2 thiophene rings the polymerization was spurred by the concentration in dilute solution and was inhibited at high concentrations fig 4b the bithiophene monomer seemed to be responsible for the variability drop casting was adopted to the preparation to get an orderly arranged molecularly imprinted film to ensure reproducibility also we took advantage of an auxiliary solvent to avoid the coffee ring deposition on the surface of electrodes photographs of the electrodes coated with stock solution mixed with different proportions of auxiliary solvent were displayed in fig 4f it can be easily found that the surface morphology of the electrodes varied with the ratio of dmf when the solvent is composed of 5 dmf and 95 acetonitrile a flat and uniform surface was obtained 3 4 characterization of materials attenuated total reflection fourier transformation infrared atr ftir spectroscopy further confirmed the effectiveness of the sensor as displayed in fig 4d the intense band around 1720 cm 1 was identified as the c o of azithromycin liao et al 2015 robaina et al 2013 it is confirmed that there were a large number of azithromycin molecules on the surface of the electrodes after polymerization and rebinding while few on the nip electrode and the mife whose templates were extracted figure s5 indicated that sensors for other macrolide antibiotics such as ery rox and cla can be prepared in a similar way and worked properly when the template molecule is replaced as shown in pictures of sem the thickness of mip film dropped from 153 4 53 2 nm figure s6 a to 88 8 49 5 nm figure s6 b after extraction as well as the flatness for comparison nip film was thicker 244 3 85 3 nm figure s6 c eis data was fitted with the model shown in figure s7c and fitting parameters were listed in table s5 the difference in rct rfilm and n suggested the changes in the properties of films in different steps the decline of n after extraction suggested an increase in roughness chowdhury et al 2019 of mip films 3 5 performance of the resulting sensor we prepared mifes using the monomers selected in 3 2 with the procedure described in 3 3 scheme 1 scratched the reversible recognition of azn on the sensor when combined with azn the cavities on the mip films were turned off and the reversible redox of electrochemical probes is hindered so a drop in electrochemical signal would be observed a series of swv signals of the sensor in the presence of azithromycin ranging from 0 to 1000 µm was recorded as exhibited in fig 5 a the trend was that the higher the concentration of azn in the solution the more the signal diminished the signal change after rebinding was used to plot a linear curve with the logarithm of the azn concentration in the solution fig 5b a correlation coefficient of 0 998 is observed in the range of 0 4 100 µm lod was estimated to be 0 120 µm s n 3 and loq 0 34 µm s n 10 according to the widely adopted methods manjunatha 2018 nightingale et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 where the standard deviation of blank samples was considered to be the noise σ 0 212 µa n 7 other important analytical parameters like stability reproducibility repeatability optimal ph range and analysis buffer were also listed in table 1 fig 5c showed the selectivity of the mife for azn over rox ery cla cbz otc and cip mife had only weak responses to antibiotics other than azn and ery that is to say the antibiotics investigated in the experiment did not significantly interfere with the detection apart from ery whose structure was highly similar to azn as for ery it s an analog of azn and some works even use ery as a template for azn molecularly imprinted sensors hu et al 2018a zhou et al 2016 so that neither the borate bond nor the molecular cavity can distinguish them applications of the sensor in detecting azn in real samples were conducted and the performance was included in table 2 4 discussion 4 1 the designed electropolymerization pathway the first thing we had to figure out was where on the reaction map it was better to start polymerizing fig 3a iii suggested that the binding capacity of mife whose polymerization was initiated by cross linking monomers was lower than mifes whose polymerization started with the initiation of functional monomers fig 3a i ii iv it is speculated that the cross linking monomers tended to self assemble into clusters and consequently occupied the position of functional monomers perceptually we can take that the cross linking monomers have stronger interconnection ability than functional monomers and it is more appropriate to initiate polymerization with functional monomers consistent with our judgement dabrowski et al chose the functional monomer as initiator instead of cross linking monomer in their work dabrowski et al 2016 w1hile the electron rich nature of bithiophene made it easy to dominate in polymerization only if the reaction was triggered by a functional monomer with an initiation potential not available for the oxidation of bithiophenes in order to properly configure monomers so as to ensure the reaction follow the path indicated in scheme s1 one protocol for searching monomers with suitable initiation potentials had to be explored fortunately we can manipulate the initiation potentials of monomers by introducing groups that do not participate in polymerization to thiophene rings it may be explained by the alternation of charge density on heterocyclic aromatic rings guidi et al 2005 like benzene thiophene is an electron rich system and the essence of its polymerization is the oxidation at the positions 2 and 5 which is a process of losing electrons istif et al attributed the decrease of oxidation potential to the larger conjugation length istif et al 2020 while we claim that the increase of charge density actually played a role if that holds then the electron withdrawing groups on the thiophene ring such as br and no2 would postpone the initiation while the electron donating groups such as r and ph should bring the initiation potential prior to that of the thiophene monomer the evidence manifested in fig 2 supported the conjecture above phenyl and methyl typical electron donating groups caused the initiation potential of thiophene to advance while the electron withdrawing group bromo led to the delay of the initiation typically we recommend designating a boric acid based thiophene as functional monomer first then a bithiophene with a higher initiation potential than function monomer being selected from the pool and a linker whose initiation potential is between the former two was also included if necessary based on this principle we selected ph 3 tba who possesses a strong electron donating group as the functional monomer and the 2 br modified on the cross linking monomer 4 4 br 3 3 bth effectively increased its initiation potential the efforts we made provided convenience for predicting the initiation potentials of monomers with modification 4 2 why drop casting solution polymerization was adopted we found accidentally that the electrodes obtained by electropolymerization in the same batch varied a lot after troubleshooting bithiophene was identified as the culprit as shown in fig 4a b polymerization of functional monomers with single thiophene ring was controlled by mass transfer indicating that monomers would not interfere with each other s polymerization and the electricity consumed suggested the progress of polymerization druy et al 1984 when it came to bithiophene the polymerization seemed to be hybrid controlled and its rate fluctuated a lot at high concentrations fig 4c demonstrated the mechanism we proposed for the behavior of cross linking monomers when co polymerizing we supposed that the four oxidizable sites of bithiophenes granted them relatively high priority in the polymerization and they are more likely to attack other bithiophenes in solution rather than adjacent functional monomers the idea that struck us was to pre arrange monomers on the surface of the electrode in advance which allows us in absolute charge of the proportion of monomer participating in polymerization on the electrode surface to achieve this drop casting is an ideal method krueger et al 2011 what is worth noting is that the marangoni effect was applied to encounter coffee ring deposition for a smooth and uniform surface he and derby 2017 hu and larson 2006 larson 2012 scriven and sternling 1960 4 3 the role of cross linking monomers like bithiophene since the cross linking monomers like bithiophene tend to seize the priority in polymerization and also cause entanglement can it be excluded from the system in order to clarify the essential role of bithiophene as a cross linking monomer we tried to use monothiophene as an alternative according to the results in fig 3a i ii mife prepared with 3 4 br th as the cross linking monomer seemed to function normally however the comparative experiments of non imprinted polymers had exposed its flaws the boost in signal of nip i ii in fig 3b after extraction suggested that the signal proliferation of mip i ii in fig 3a may be attributed to the decomposition of molecularly imprinted films for comparison nip iii iv with bithiophene did not show obvious difference after extraction the results revealed the difference in the ability of monothiophenes and bithiophenes to stabilize the polymer structure the cross linking monomer seemed to be the backbone of the polymer and monomers with multiple connection sites are required to play this role this may be the reason why many researchers admitted bithiophene into their works dabrowski et al 2017 2016 gliga et al 2020 stoian et al 2020 4 4 mechanism of electron transfer and validation of the analytical method with reference to the work of manjunatha et al potassium ferricyanide was used as a redox probe manjunatha et al 2013 to proportion the amount of azn bound indirectly the more azn bound the more the electrode surface was sealed which led to the decline of the accessibility of the probe and thus a weaker current response scheme 1 table s6 listed features of reports on detection methods of azn methods involving biological elements were fragile and not suitable for sewage applications electrochemiluminescence ecl exhibited extremely high sensitivity while additional equipment was required and the response caused by tertiary amine groups of other macrolides hu et al 2018b vazquez laslop and mankin 2018 hindered further application electrochemical methods with good performance almost worked under physiological conditions with strict ph requirement as shown in table 2 our sensor performed well in the secondary effluents and the simulated sewage the response was severely disturbed by the extremely high concentrations of cod and nitrate in simulated industrial water which was unlikely to occur in urban sewage after treating with a pbr reactor the matrix in the sample hardly affected the determination in short this design was suitable for monitoring azn in actual sewage 5 conclusions this work focused on figuring out things matter in the electropolymerization of thiophene based mip and a protocol was explored for organizing monomers first to lower the initiation potential of functional monomers as far as possible by introducing electron donating groups second raising the oxidation potential of cross linking monomers by attaching electron withdrawing groups to thiophene rings third using a monothiophene to both handle with steric hinderance and mediate two types of monomers with varied initiation potentials last but not least applying drop casting to avoid the phenomenon that the mass transfer of cross linking monomers in solution strongly affected the repeatability of sensor as far as we learn our prototype is stable and cost effective for sensing azn and 3 other macrolide antibiotics it may serve as a guide for subsequent works on the electrochemical synthesis of other mip sensors for substances with high risks different from those for biological use sensors in wwtps are not limited by quantity of samples and requirements of miniaturization it is believed that a larger electrode surface with far more reachable water flow than laboratory scale would contribute to a lower lod with the help of advanced signal amplification strategy direct monitoring of effluent from secondary sedimentation tank of domestic sewage treatment plant can be realized soon what needs to be aware is that although this strategy is expected to be applied to detecting any targets with hydroxyl templates other than macrolides themselves may act as electron withdrawing or electron donating groups that disturbs the initiation potentials of functional monomers the shortcoming to be dealt with is the poor performance in distinguishing structural analogs such as azn and ery we plan to promote the cooperation of antibodies and mip to further identify the target that is the sandwich structure of ab target mip who exerts both chemical and biological recognition in addition indirect electrochemical detection is not the only readout strategy we concern quality luminescence and optical signals would provide mife with more diverse detection applications and a wider detection range the exploration in generally applicable designing strategies for mip based electrochemical sensor will pave the way for the thrive of cutting edge technologies like continuous online sensing devices it is conceivable that sensors other than glucometers would also usher in large scale commercial applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16592,our screening data revealed the threat macrolide antibiotics especially azithromycin azn posed to human health with its increasing occurrence in water environment the electrochemical sensor based on molecularly imprinted polymer mip is a promising platform that caters for the next generation of intelligent wastewater treatment plants wwtps by virtue of its wide tolerance to water from all sources and in situ monitoring however low initiation potentials of cross linking monomers contributed by the electron rich circumstance allowed them to usurp sites designed for functional monomers when electrically stimulated leading to an unsatisfactory binding capacity another uncertainty is that multiple reaction sites of cross linking monomers granted them complex polymerization routes and made it difficult to ensure the consistency of preparation serval monomers had been investigated with electrochemical tools and the performance of sensors constructed with these monomers were compared in this study based on the results we proposed a protocol in which a novel functional monomer possessing a stronger electron donating group phenyl was adopted to compete for the dominance in electropolymerization beyond that the cross linking monomer was modified with electron withdrawing groups to raise its initiation potential a monothiophene with a moderate initiation potential was also recruited as the linker to address the steric hindrance in this way polymerization proceeded in a specific order it is worth mentioning that the marangoni flow is an ideal tool to deal with the coffee ring deposition while drop casting the resulting sensor showed good performance with a limitation of detection lod of 0 120 μm for azn and a satisfactory selectivity and the design can be applied to constructing sensors for a variety of macrolide antibiotics graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords in situ monitoring molecularly imprinted polymer mip macrolides electrochemical sensor boronothiophene 1 introduction the proliferation of new chemicals like pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps is challenging the alarm system of traditional wwtps for ecological risks macrolide antibiotics figure s1 especially azn are emerging antibiotics for the treatment of respiratory infections gamerdinger and deuerling 2012 hubble et al 2019 vazquez laslop and mankin 2018 due to its excellent clinical performance macrolides entered human society in large quantities and some of them were excreted into nature consequently macrolide antibiotics frequently appeared in the research reports of water pollutants around the world alygizakis et al 2019 oberoi et al 2019 senta et al 2019 according to our own screening data in 2019 fig 1 macrolide antibiotics like azn and roxithromycin rox exhibited worrying health risks worse still the clinical usage of macrolides has risen sharply in the face of raging covid 19 including the exploration of some new treatment methods liu et al 2020 nishiga et al 2020 sheridan 2020 takahashi et al 2020 the situation forces us to be more alert to the rapid establishment of macrolide resistance two terrible outcomes are approaching that is a sharp increase in the mortality of drug resistant diseases and the shortened lifespan of such antibiotics chakaya et al 2021 rossiter et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 only accurate concentration of macrolide antibiotics in the environment can properly guide the prescription and drug production and make it possible to allocate the optimal resources for targeted removal thus long term monitoring of macrolide antibiotics should be on the agenda while the drawbacks of traditional high accuracy equipment are burdens to township wwtps when considering upgrading to the next generation of intelligent wastewater treatment plants at present the most widely used analysis method for macrolides is lc ms patel et al 2019 senta et al 2019 terzic et al 2018 voigt et al 2020 choosing this strategy means to endure its costly equipment massive manual labor huge consumption of toxic reagents and extremely poor mobility patel et al 2019 an alternative strategy is to resort to electrochemical methods the electrochemical approaches do not require excessive reagents and manpower and the equipment depreciation cost power consumption and working period are much lower than large scale analytical instruments so they are always cost effective clifford et al 2021 manjunatha 2020 tigari and manjunatha 2020 equipped with these qualities electrochemical sensor is a platform who meets the requirements of portability sustainability and sensitivity manjunatha et al 2012 wongkaew et al 2019 there have been some related reports but most of these sensors were only used to determine the concentration of a certain macrolide without interfering substances vajdle et al 2016 2017 2020 also traditional biosensors are heavily dependent on biological recognition elements that possessing shortcomings like fragile structure poor long term stability reproducibility and high cost romanholo et al 2021 in order to deal with the complex sewage the selectivity and robustness of the sensor has to reach more stringent standards mip is an ideal identification element as it selectively binds to the target through a specific spatial structure and matched covalent non covalent bonds belbruno 2019 electropolymerization accurately produces homogeneous mip on the electrode with adequate energy rebelo et al 2021 in that the thickness of film depends on the charge as for the unit used to seize macrolides non covalent interactions like hydrogen bonds are not supposed to be the only forces we rely on since there are varieties of small polar molecules competing for binding sites in complex sewage kolkman et al 2021 taking all these factors into account we chose thiophenes with boronic acid groups as functional monomers which specifically form borate ester with the cis diol moieties of macrolides aeridou et al 2020 although there have been reports on the preparation of mip with boronic thiophene dabrowski et al 2016 sharma et al 2016 stoian et al 2020 there has been no detailed description of considerations from selecting to configurating monomers and finally producing reliable sensors that can be adjusted to detecting some other contaminants by merely replacing templates so far in our laboratory serval monomers had been investigated with electrochemical approaches and the performance of constructed sensors were compared based on the results we discovered an adequate initiation sequence by which monomers could work together effectively interestingly the high electron density of cross linking monomer made it always oxidized first when the voltage increases and their multiple oxidizable sites tend to attack each other when activated thus these cross linking monomers occupied most of the positions on the electrode surface specific monomers were selected to ensure the predominant role of functional monomers in polymerization the monomers here performed their own duties like initiating others passing through radicals or uniting clusters after optimizing parameters selectivity and linear range of reproducible sensors were studied this work is dedicated to provide a comprehensive guidance on the selection and organization of monomers and to explore a useful prototype for later workers who want to prepare mip sensors with thiophene monomers 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials azn rox

care products detailed information of the pre treatment and uplc ms ms detection can be found in ben s work ben et al 2018 2 4 investigation into the initiation potentials of serval thiophene monomers dpv experiment was applied to 4 boronic acid based thiophenes 4 bithiophenes and 5 thiophene derivatives to find out their initiation potentials the step size was set to 2 mv the amplitude was 25 mv and the potential range was 0 5 2 5 v vs non aqueous ag electrode 2 5 fabrication of molecularly imprinted film electrodes mifes and non imprinted film electrodes nifes with 4 combinations of thiophene monomers 4 stock solutions listed in table s4 were prepared with 0 1 m tbap in acetonitrile in advance in order to obtain a molecularly imprinted film on the electrode the polished gce was immersed in the stock solution to perform electropolymerization by cyclic voltammetry and the program was set to circulating 3 times in the range of 0 5 v to 2 3 v vs non aqueous ag electrode at a scan rate of 100 mv s 1 based on previous experience the scan range was adjusted to 0 5 v 1 85 v and 0 5 v 1 75 v during the construction of mife iii and iv respectively the nifes were fabricated in the same way but in the absence of azn 2 6 extraction of templates and determination of swv signals the constructed electrode was immersed in 10 ml solution of glacial acetic acid acetonitrile 1 9 v v and been exposed to 320 w ultrasonic wave for 20 min then the electrode was rinsed with ultrapure water and inserted into a 10 pbs solution with 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 for swv scanning the potential range was 0 25 v to 0 75 v vs sce step size 2 mv and the amplitude was 50 mv the frequency was set at 25 hz the scan rate was calculated to be 50 mv s 1 2 7 optimization of parameters we employed a drop casting method prior to applying potential instead of direct polymerization in solution to encounter the coffee ring effect dmf was added to the stock solution and its optimal ratio was obtained by experiment in addition to overcome the excessive steric hindrance between the selected functional monomer and the template we introduced the linker 3 me th to the stock solution it is worth noting that the stock solution here was free of electrolyte moreover time for extraction and rebinding as well as the stirring rate were improved by comparing the response of resulted sensor to 50 µm azn related results and discussion can be found in supplementary file 2 8 construction of the optimized mife and the sensing of macrolide antibiotics 1 mm ph 3 tba 1 mm azn 2 mm 4 4 br 3 3 bth and 2 mm 3 me th were dissolved in acetonitrile containing 5 dmf to form a stock solution 20 µl of the stock solution was drawn by a pipette and dripped onto the surface of gce then the electrode was incubated at 65 c and 0 1 mpa for 10 min in a vacuum oven then the electrode was quickly immersed into 10 ml of 0 1 m tbap in acetonitrile solution to start electropolymerization the potential was set to 1 65 v vs non aqueous ag electrode or 1 675 v vs nhe for 30 s the electrode was taken out of the solution exactly when the polymerization ended and been rinsed with acetonitrile then it was sent to template extraction rebinding of the target was carried out with the electrode immersed in the stirred azn tap water solution ph 7 6 0 22 rsd 0 29 n 9 for 20 min swv was performed to indicate the binding of the target on the mife surface when the polymerization ended extraction completed and rebinding ended evaluation of reproducibility repeatability stability and selectivity were performed according to the methods described in supplementary file other mifes for sensing of macrolide antibiotics like ery rox and cla were completed in a similar way but template replaced 3 results 3 1 concentration and risk quotients rq of 27 ppcps in effluents of 5 wwtps in jiangsu the concentration and provisional no effect concentrations pnec of 27 ppcps were plotted in fig 1 basic water quality indicators of collected samples were determined and shown in table s1 abbreviations and major physicochemical properties of target contaminants were listed in table s2 among them azn and rox showed high risk with rqs of 1 75 and 1 00 respectively rq referred to a work of ben et al 2018 is calculated by dividing the monitoring concentration by the predicted no effect concentration where rq 1 suggests a high risk and 0 1 rq 1 shows a medium risk it cannot be ignored that the rq of cla had also reached 0 253 and even if the effluents were ultra filtered these high risk substances could not be effectively reduced let alone the traditional water treatment processes oberoi et al 2019 full records of rqs are available in table s3 3 2 selection of compatible monomers polythiophene pth polypyrrole ppy and polyaniline pani are the most widely used conducting polymers in recent years liu et al 2018 in our trail experiment pth exhibited a better stability than ppy and pani in the working potential window 0 0 5 v vs sce figure s4 hence thiophenes were the preferred monomers for us the initiation potentials of 13 thiophene monomers were determined with square wave voltammetry and the results were integrated in fig 2 the 4 monomers in window a were candidates for functional monomers which were characterized by boronic acid groups monomers in window b competed for the role of cross linking monomers which were all consisted of two connected thiophene rings the 5 monothiophenes with unmodified positions 2 and 5 in window c served as linkers the initiation potentials of ph 3 tba 4 me 3 tba 3 tba and 4 br 3 tba were 1 60 1 81 1 91 and 1 97 v vs non aqueous ag electrode respectively the oxidation peaks of the crosslinking monomer stretched far but what mattered was the position where the polymerization started namely 1 32 v for 2 2 bth 1 58 v for 3 3 br 2 2 bth 1 37 v for 3 3 bth and 1 90 v for 4 4 br 3 3 bth vs non aqueous ag electrode the initiation potentials of edot 3 me th th 3 br th and 3 4 br th were 1 48 1 82 2 00 2 06 and 2 16 v vs non aqueous ag electrode respectively to screen the most compatible monomers and also to verify the inference we will mention later 4 combinations of monomers as listed in table s4 were used to fabricate mifes square wave voltammograms of the resulting electrodes were exhibited in fig 3 a solid line among them iii is the only combination whose cross linking monomer possessed a lower initiation potential than its functional monomer more detailed information was tucked into supplementary file the signals of the three mifes other than iii ascended a lot after removing the template dotted line for comparison the square wave voltammograms of nifes before and after extraction were presented in fig 3b a surge in signals was also observed on nip i and nip ii after extraction yet nip iii and nip iv did not change significantly the results denote that the rise in signals of mife i and ii were mainly attributed to the weak structure of nip as a result mife iv actually possessed the largest binding capacity next we proceeded to the configuration of linkers as far as we know not all systems need linkers as shown in fig 4 d the introduction of azn amplified the peak current of the swv scan and there was no obvious change in the position and shape of the peak in other words azn could hardly hinder the polymerization of monomer like 4 me 3 tba because of the relatively low steric hindrance however the presence of azn evidently reduced the polymerization current of ph 3 tba and the sharp peak at around 1 55 v split into two consecutive broad peaks as shown in fig 4e the polymerization turned out to be more difficult in systems with huge steric hindrance and a higher overpotential was required in view of this we chose 3 me th with an initiation potential at 1 8 v as the linker of combination iv 3 3 optimization of operating parameters in this section we tried to polish the preparation to get a more well performed and stable sensor in further experiments we found that the properties of the sensors prepared under the same conditions in the solution varied a lot then the polymerization behavior of monomers was studied separately as displayed in fig 2 monothiophenes had only one oxidation peak while two or more oxidation peaks of bithiophene monomers were observed in the potential window time for monomers to reach 1mc at different concentrations in solution under a constant potential revealed the different polymerization behaviors of monothiophene monomer and bithiophene monomer some data not shown for monothiophenes like 3 tba the higher the concentration the faster the polymerization fig 4a while for 4 4 br 3 3 bth who had 2 thiophene rings the polymerization was spurred by the concentration in dilute solution and was inhibited at high concentrations fig 4b the bithiophene monomer seemed to be responsible for the variability drop casting was adopted to the preparation to get an orderly arranged molecularly imprinted film to ensure reproducibility also we took advantage of an auxiliary solvent to avoid the coffee ring deposition on the surface of electrodes photographs of the electrodes coated with stock solution mixed with different proportions of auxiliary solvent were displayed in fig 4f it can be easily found that the surface morphology of the electrodes varied with the ratio of dmf when the solvent is composed of 5 dmf and 95 acetonitrile a flat and uniform surface was obtained 3 4 characterization of materials attenuated total reflection fourier transformation infrared atr ftir spectroscopy further confirmed the effectiveness of the sensor as displayed in fig 4d the intense band around 1720 cm 1 was identified as the c o of azithromycin liao et al 2015 robaina et al 2013 it is confirmed that there were a large number of azithromycin molecules on the surface of the electrodes after polymerization and rebinding while few on the nip electrode and the mife whose templates were extracted figure s5 indicated that sensors for other macrolide antibiotics such as ery rox and cla can be prepared in a similar way and worked properly when the template molecule is replaced as shown in pictures of sem the thickness of mip film dropped from 153 4 53 2 nm figure s6 a to 88 8 49 5 nm figure s6 b after extraction as well as the flatness for comparison nip film was thicker 244 3 85 3 nm figure s6 c eis data was fitted with the model shown in figure s7c and fitting parameters were listed in table s5 the difference in rct rfilm and n suggested the changes in the properties of films in different steps the decline of n after extraction suggested an increase in roughness chowdhury et al 2019 of mip films 3 5 performance of the resulting sensor we prepared mifes using the monomers selected in 3 2 with the procedure described in 3 3 scheme 1 scratched the reversible recognition of azn on the sensor when combined with azn the cavities on the mip films were turned off and the reversible redox of electrochemical probes is hindered so a drop in electrochemical signal would be observed a series of swv signals of the sensor in the presence of azithromycin ranging from 0 to 1000 µm was recorded as exhibited in fig 5 a the trend was that the higher the concentration of azn in the solution the more the signal diminished the signal change after rebinding was used to plot a linear curve with the logarithm of the azn concentration in the solution fig 5b a correlation coefficient of 0 998 is observed in the range of 0 4 100 µm lod was estimated to be 0 120 µm s n 3 and loq 0 34 µm s n 10 according to the widely adopted methods manjunatha 2018 nightingale et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 where the standard deviation of blank samples was considered to be the noise σ 0 212 µa n 7 other important analytical parameters like stability reproducibility repeatability optimal ph range and analysis buffer were also listed in table 1 fig 5c showed the selectivity of the mife for azn over rox ery cla cbz otc and cip mife had only weak responses to antibiotics other than azn and ery that is to say the antibiotics investigated in the experiment did not significantly interfere with the detection apart from ery whose structure was highly similar to azn as for ery it s an analog of azn and some works even use ery as a template for azn molecularly imprinted sensors hu et al 2018a zhou et al 2016 so that neither the borate bond nor the molecular cavity can distinguish them applications of the sensor in detecting azn in real samples were conducted and the performance was included in table 2 4 discussion 4 1 the designed electropolymerization pathway the first thing we had to figure out was where on the reaction map it was better to start polymerizing fig 3a iii suggested that the binding capacity of mife whose polymerization was initiated by cross linking monomers was lower than mifes whose polymerization started with the initiation of functional monomers fig 3a i ii iv it is speculated that the cross linking monomers tended to self assemble into clusters and consequently occupied the position of functional monomers perceptually we can take that the cross linking monomers have stronger interconnection ability than functional monomers and it is more appropriate to initiate polymerization with functional monomers consistent with our judgement dabrowski et al chose the functional monomer as initiator instead of cross linking monomer in their work dabrowski et al 2016 w1hile the electron rich nature of bithiophene made it easy to dominate in polymerization only if the reaction was triggered by a functional monomer with an initiation potential not available for the oxidation of bithiophenes in order to properly configure monomers so as to ensure the reaction follow the path indicated in scheme s1 one protocol for searching monomers with suitable initiation potentials had to be explored fortunately we can manipulate the initiation potentials of monomers by introducing groups that do not participate in polymerization to thiophene rings it may be explained by the alternation of charge density on heterocyclic aromatic rings guidi et al 2005 like benzene thiophene is an electron rich system and the essence of its polymerization is the oxidation at the positions 2 and 5 which is a process of losing electrons istif et al attributed the decrease of oxidation potential to the larger conjugation length istif et al 2020 while we claim that the increase of charge density actually played a role if that holds then the electron withdrawing groups on the thiophene ring such as br and no2 would postpone the initiation while the electron donating groups such as r and ph should bring the initiation potential prior to that of the thiophene monomer the evidence manifested in fig 2 supported the conjecture above phenyl and methyl typical electron donating groups caused the initiation potential of thiophene to advance while the electron withdrawing group bromo led to the delay of the initiation typically we recommend designating a boric acid based thiophene as functional monomer first then a bithiophene with a higher initiation potential than function monomer being selected from the pool and a linker whose initiation potential is between the former two was also included if necessary based on this principle we selected ph 3 tba who possesses a strong electron donating group as the functional monomer and the 2 br modified on the cross linking monomer 4 4 br 3 3 bth effectively increased its initiation potential the efforts we made provided convenience for predicting the initiation potentials of monomers with modification 4 2 why drop casting solution polymerization was adopted we found accidentally that the electrodes obtained by electropolymerization in the same batch varied a lot after troubleshooting bithiophene was identified as the culprit as shown in fig 4a b polymerization of functional monomers with single thiophene ring was controlled by mass transfer indicating that monomers would not interfere with each other s polymerization and the electricity consumed suggested the progress of polymerization druy et al 1984 when it came to bithiophene the polymerization seemed to be hybrid controlled and its rate fluctuated a lot at high concentrations fig 4c demonstrated the mechanism we proposed for the behavior of cross linking monomers when co polymerizing we supposed that the four oxidizable sites of bithiophenes granted them relatively high priority in the polymerization and they are more likely to attack other bithiophenes in solution rather than adjacent functional monomers the idea that struck us was to pre arrange monomers on the surface of the electrode in advance which allows us in absolute charge of the proportion of monomer participating in polymerization on the electrode surface to achieve this drop casting is an ideal method krueger et al 2011 what is worth noting is that the marangoni effect was applied to encounter coffee ring deposition for a smooth and uniform surface he and derby 2017 hu and larson 2006 larson 2012 scriven and sternling 1960 4 3 the role of cross linking monomers like bithiophene since the cross linking monomers like bithiophene tend to seize the priority in polymerization and also cause entanglement can it be excluded from the system in order to clarify the essential role of bithiophene as a cross linking monomer we tried to use monothiophene as an alternative according to the results in fig 3a i ii mife prepared with 3 4 br th as the cross linking monomer seemed to function normally however the comparative experiments of non imprinted polymers had exposed its flaws the boost in signal of nip i ii in fig 3b after extraction suggested that the signal proliferation of mip i ii in fig 3a may be attributed to the decomposition of molecularly imprinted films for comparison nip iii iv with bithiophene did not show obvious difference after extraction the results revealed the difference in the ability of monothiophenes and bithiophenes to stabilize the polymer structure the cross linking monomer seemed to be the backbone of the polymer and monomers with multiple connection sites are required to play this role this may be the reason why many researchers admitted bithiophene into their works dabrowski et al 2017 2016 gliga et al 2020 stoian et al 2020 4 4 mechanism of electron transfer and validation of the analytical method with reference to the work of manjunatha et al potassium ferricyanide was used as a redox probe manjunatha et al 2013 to proportion the amount of azn bound indirectly the more azn bound the more the electrode surface was sealed which led to the decline of the accessibility of the probe and thus a weaker current response scheme 1 table s6 listed features of reports on detection methods of azn methods involving biological elements were fragile and not suitable for sewage applications electrochemiluminescence ecl exhibited extremely high sensitivity while additional equipment was required and the response caused by tertiary amine groups of other macrolides hu et al 2018b vazquez laslop and mankin 2018 hindered further application electrochemical methods with good performance almost worked under physiological conditions with strict ph requirement as shown in table 2 our sensor performed well in the secondary effluents and the simulated sewage the response was severely disturbed by the extremely high concentrations of cod and nitrate in simulated industrial water which was unlikely to occur in urban sewage after treating with a pbr reactor the matrix in the sample hardly affected the determination in short this design was suitable for monitoring azn in actual sewage 5 conclusions this work focused on figuring out things matter in the electropolymerization of thiophene based mip and a protocol was explored for organizing monomers first to lower the initiation potential of functional monomers as far as possible by introducing electron donating groups second raising the oxidation potential of cross linking monomers by attaching electron withdrawing groups to thiophene rings third using a monothiophene to both handle with steric hinderance and mediate two types of monomers with varied initiation potentials last but not least applying drop casting to avoid the phenomenon that the mass transfer of cross linking monomers in solution strongly affected the repeatability of sensor as far as we learn our prototype is stable and cost effective for sensing azn and 3 other macrolide antibiotics it may serve as a guide for subsequent works on the electrochemical synthesis of other mip sensors for substances with high risks different from those for biological use sensors in wwtps are not limited by quantity of samples and requirements of miniaturization it is believed that a larger electrode surface with far more reachable water flow than laboratory scale would contribute to a lower lod with the help of advanced signal amplification strategy direct monitoring of effluent from secondary sedimentation tank of domestic sewage treatment plant can be realized soon what needs to be aware is that although this strategy is expected to be applied to detecting any targets with hydroxyl templates other than macrolides themselves may act as electron withdrawing or electron donating groups that disturbs the initiation potentials of functional monomers the shortcoming to be dealt with is the poor performance in distinguishing structural analogs such as azn and ery we plan to promote the cooperation of antibodies and mip to further identify the target that is the sandwich structure of ab target mip who exerts both chemical and biological recognition in addition indirect electrochemical detection is not the only readout strategy we concern quality luminescence and optical signals would provide mife with more diverse detection applications and a wider detection range the exploration in generally applicable designing strategies for mip based electrochemical sensor will pave the way for the thrive of cutting edge technologies like continuous online sensing devices it is conceivable that sensors other than glucometers would also usher in large scale commercial applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16593,trace levels of sulfonamide antibiotics are ubiquitous in reclaimed water yet environmental pathways to completely remove those chemicals are not well understood when such water is used to restore flows in dried rivers this study investigated sulfonamide sorption desorption biodegradation and mineralization processes with seven sediments from a reclaimed water dominant river batch experiments were conducted under oxic and anoxic nitrate reducing conditions and each removal process of sulfamethazine sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole smx was evaluated individually at environmentally relevant concentrations 10 μg l over 28 days 44 32 of sulfonamides were biodegraded while the full mineralization to carbon dioxide was 1 around 5 of sulfonamides were removed via sediment sorption with a positive correlation with sediment organic contents detailed investigation of smx biodegradation revealed that although its transformation appeared to be faster in anoxic than oxic tests by day 2 it reversed over 28 days with a longer apparent half life in anoxic tests 69 25 days than that in oxic tests 12 11 days this is attributed to the formation of reversible metabolites at denitrifying conditions such as desamino smx of which the production was affected by nitrite concentrations despite measurements of three frequently reported metabolites 70 biotransformation products remained unknown in this study the findings highlight the persistency of sulfonamides and their derivatives with research needed to further elucidate degradation mechanisms

both degradation mechanisms and the potential metabolites before the full mineralization to co2 are elusive for sulfonamide antibiotics garcía galán et al 2008 rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016

table s2 they are typical of alluvial plain deposits of the north china plain liu et al 2016 with a low to moderate degree of weathering to clay minerals cia 59 65 icv 1 3 1 5 however sediment toc was

the more reducing conditions of riverbed sites compared to riverbank sites suggesting that the sewage sourced organic matters likely remain bioavailable and not entirely bound to fine clay minerals despite ppb levels of organic micropollutants in the beiyun river water only low concentrations of sulfonamides were extracted from the seven sediments by either tap water or nan3 dosed tap water as supernatant samples taken from all sediment controls during biodegradation and sorption tests contained only 0 04 0 04 μg l of the three sulfonamides and 0 02 0 02 μg l of the three metabolites 3 2

a higher logkow displayed the lowest kd as to the examined sediment properties kd was correlated only with the sediment organic content with loi r 0 6 with toc r 0 4 table 1 due to the low amounts of sorbed sulfonamides and metabolites it is a challenge to quantify the desorption percentages overall metabolites desorbed less 13 21 than parent sulfonamides 32 50 which reflects stronger sorption

sorption removal to the best of our knowledge this set of sorption desorption experiments is the first to validate the sorption and desorption behaviors of sulfonamide metabolites 3 3 negligible sulfonamide mineralization under oxic and anoxic no3 reducing conditions during the 28 day mineralization tests the percentages of 14c labeled smx smz and sdz mineralized to 14co2 were negligible in all seven sediments under both oxic and anoxic conditions 0 5 0 4 fig 1 this is expected as sulfonamides have been shown to be resistant to microbial mineralization in activated sludge or soils alvarino et al 2016 höltge and kreuzig 2007 although several strains isolated from activated sludge or membrane bioreactors were capable of smx mineralization bouju et al 2012 reis et al 2014 while the trapped 14co2 remained low the non mineralized 14c in the aqueous phase gradually decreased and recovered only 20 90 of the initially added 14c by day 28 figs s4 and s5 the 14c loss was likely due to the higher sorption of the produced metabolites than parent sulfonamides table 1 the formation of non extractable residues similarly as observed for xenobiotics biodegradation in soils kästner et al 2014 or the production of volatile metabolites which could not be captured by the base trap lastly less 14c labeled sulfonamides and metabolites remained in the aqueous phase by 28 days in oxic tests 21 87 fig s4 than those in anoxic tests 68 91 fig s5 3 4 redox dependent sulfonamide biotransformation microbial degradation to intermediate metabolites i e biotransformation was the principal removal mechanism as mass balance calculation showed that sorption removed only 5 of sulfonamides and mineralization was negligible by both day 2 and day 28 fig 1 sulfonamide removal attributed exclusively to biotransformation was estimated with the deduction of sorption removal from the total removal during degradation experiments eq 3 although the removal of sulfonamides under no3 reducing conditions 72 11 was significantly higher than that under oxic conditions by day 2 37 21 it reversed by day 28 when the oxic removal progressed to 72 28 and the anoxic removal decreased to 29 20 figs 1 and s6 specifically smx was taken as an example to delve into sulfonamide biotransformation processes under oxic and anoxic conditions and their variations between river sediments fig 2 during oxic tests four sediments with high toc 0 87 1 56 fig 2a displayed high removal of smx by day 70 with apparent half lives of smx estimated as 5 36 days table s10 in comparison the other three sediments with low to medium toc 0 16 0 49 fig 2a displayed low smx removal by day 70 due to concentration increases during the tests which corresponded to its longer half lives reaching up to 85 days table s10 although a positive correlation was observed between the removal of smx via biotransformation smxbiotransformed and sediment toc it was not statistically significant p 0 05 fig s11b of the three measured metabolites dea smx was prominently detected with significant accumulation of ammet at day 70 and barely detectable nit smx in all seven sediments fig 2a the production of dea smx was positively correlated with smxbiotransformed at day 2 fig s11c under anoxic conditions smx rapidly decreased in the first 2 days of all tests 50 removal fig 2b however the five sediments with medium to high toc showed significant smx increases after day 2 corresponding to continuing no3 consumption in contrast the other two sediments with low toc maintained relatively constant smx concentrations accompanied by minor no3 removal between day 2 and day 28 the apparent half lives of smx assessed over 28 days in all seven sediments were 52 29 days table s10 while they extended to 69 25 days n 5 without the consideration of low toc sediments dea smx was the main metabolite with a positive correlation to smxbiotransformed fig 3 c both ammet and nit smx were barely detected fig 2b smx increases in the five anoxic tests was unexpected rendering our attempt to estimate the apparent kinetic parameters with fewer data points than desired fig s10 moreover biotransformation correlations were separately examined at day 2 and day 28 due to the reversal in smx degradation fig 3 a positive correlation was observed between smxbiotransformed and the consumption of no3 via denitrification at day 2 but not day 28 fig 3b while smxbiotransformed was negatively correlated to sediment toc at day 28 but not day 2 fig 3a the production of dea smx was correlated to the aqueous no2 concentrations at day 2 but not day 28 fig 3d 4 discussion 4 1 low but variable sorption affinities of sulfonamides and metabolites this study shows that sorption of sulfonamide antibiotics to the beiyun river sediments is weak consistent with results of other aquifer sediments bertelkamp et al 2014 although higher sorption of smx metabolites has been predicted based on their kow values nödler et al 2012 our experiments demonstrate clearly that they sorb more and desorb less than the parent sulfonamides a positive correlation between logkow and kd has been widely adopted to estimate kd xia et al 2005 yang et al 2011 while our study provides additional support that pka can possibly affect micropollutant sorption via electrostatic forces oberoi et al 2019 for instance due to the sulfonamide dissociation the order of sulfonamide kd i e kd smz kd sdz kd smx follows the order of their pka values table s3 i e pkasmz 7 89 pkasdz 6 81 pkasmx 5 81 a lower pka of the amphoteric sulfonamides leads to a more anionic form which is sorbed less onto the negatively charged surface of river sediments additionally sorption of sulfonamides at oxic conditions is slightly higher than that at anoxic conditions it is likely due to the redox driven changes in sediment properties such as the reduction of ferric oxides to ferrous minerals and changes in sediment polymeric substances wang et al 2017 the sediment organic content is also a factor in sulfonamide sorption removal indicating a higher sorption removal at downstream sites high sediment toc than at upstream sites of the beiyun river low sediment toc this has been similarly observed in soil systems drillia et al 2005 where a soil with a high toc of 7 1 displayed a much higher kf smx 36 2 l kg than a soil with a low toc of 0 4 0 3 l kg it might also explain why activated sludge generally presents strong sorption for sulfonamide antibiotics e g 20 l kg sludge in jia et al 2017 and yang et al 2011 as their organic contents loi 70 are much higher than those of natural sediments loi 1 7 6 3 table 1 it is supported by our finding that sulfonamide sorption affinities to organic matter are comparable between river sediments and activate sludge as kd smx normalized to organic carbon was 25 9 l kg table 1 vs 38 3 l kg in activated sludge yang et al 2011 4 2 undetected metabolites in the mass balance of smx biodegradation process sulfonamide biodegradation has been studied under oxic müller et al 2013 anoxic jia et al 2017 schaffer et al 2015 and anaerobic conditions mohatt et al 2011 some studies included metabolites müller et al 2013 rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 but few have performed a quantitative analysis of metabolite production and dissipation kassotaki et al 2016 nödler et al 2012 or a full comparison between different redox conditions alvarino et al 2016 in our tests mass balance of smx biodegradation was evaluated based on the measurements of smx and three metabolites the sorbed fraction was estimated with kd values table s9 it reveals that the three measured metabolites accounted for 30 of the total biotransformation products and that around 40 of smx was converted to undetected metabolites the dominant metabolite dea smx was always below 2 μg l fig s6 the proportion of undetected metabolites in the oxic tests gradually increased up to 90 by 28 days much higher than that in anoxic no3 reducing tests 64 suggesting different biodegradation pathways section 4 3 further the mass of metabolites sorbed onto the sediments can be comparable to that dissolved in the aqueous phase fig s8 implying smx especially in oxic conditions is degraded to more hydrophobic metabolites unmeasured metabolites of smx biotransformation might be n4 acetyl smx which was detected in oxic incubations of soils or sediments xu et al 2011 nitroso smx which was a main metabolite in soil under denitrifying conditions brienza et al 2017 or pterin smx which represent a major biotransformation route in activated sludge achermann et al 2018 the high accumulation of undetected metabolic products has also been observed in other studies e g at denitrifying conditions up to 50 smx was transformed to nit smx and dea smx in aquifer sediments and the other metabolites remained undetected barbieri et al 2012 nödler et al 2012 in an enriched nitrifier culture only 40 aerobic biodegradation products were measured as nit smx dea smx and n4 acetyl smx kassotaki et al 2016 and in oxic tests of activated sludge 40 of smx metabolites were unknown besides the main product ammet müller et al 2013 although the evaluation of biodegradation removal is not affected the understanding of sulfonamide biotransformation mechanisms requires identification and quantification of these unmeasured and redox dependent metabolites 4 3 aerobic and anoxic no3 reducing biodegradation pathways for sulfonamides several lines of evidence especially the occurrence of various metabolites across a range of redox conditions in activated sludge aquifer and river sediments garcía galán et al 2008 suggest that the pathways for smx biodegradation differ under oxic and anoxic conditions the discussion below focuses on smx with its three frequently reported metabolites kassotaki et al 2016 rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 the presence of ammet in oxic tests and its absence in anoxic tests suggest that aerobic biodegradation by river sediments involves the cleavage of smx at the n s bond producing ammet and 4 aminobenzolsulfonate fig 4 this irreversible breakage of sulfonamide radical has been the most frequently reported pathway of aerobic biodegradation similarly observed in activated sludge and in enriched bacterial cultures müller et al 2013 reis et al 2014 it is interpreted as a more complete biodegradation process due to the much smaller molecule of ammet compared to dea smx or nit smx and that the aerobic biodegradation leads to a more extensive breakdown of smx than the anoxic biodegradation this cleavage reaction may happen via either a metabolic reis et al 2014 or a co metabolic müller et al 2013 pathway in our oxic tests ammet production did not correspond with smxbiotransformed fig s11d or sediment toc moreover its accumulation was relatively low these observations in beiyun sediments are different from those in activated sludge of müller et al 2013 where ammet increased gradually as the main metabolite during aerobic smx biodegradation 60 smx biodegraded to ammet and further to 3 amino isoxazole the reason for the contrasting behavior in organic rich sludge and organic poor sediments needs further investigation it could be due to different microbial communities leading to the limited vs extensive breakage of smx dea smx accumulation in oxic tests was significant in this study suggesting another pathway of aerobic biotransformation with the substitution of the aromatic amine of smx fig 4 or an anoxic pathway as discussed below due to likely microscale anoxic conditions in oxic tests little nit smx was detected differing from the study of kassotaki et al 2016 where it was the main metabolite during aerobic smx biodegradation by nitrifiers as nit smx tends to accumulate in no2 rich environments 2 mmol l barbieri et al 2012 kassotaki et al 2016 nödler et al 2012 the low no2 in our oxic and anoxic tests 0 13 mmol l might have limited its production when dea sulfonamide or nit sulfonamide emerges as the main metabolite still requires further investigation as dea smx and nit smx are structurally similar to smx with the nitrosation or deamination reaction of the primary amine it might allow for reversible transformations back to smx as proposed for anoxic conditions although the retrosynthesis does not follow the thermodynamically reversible reaction pathway rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 here smx appeared to increase with decreasing dea smx in oxic sediment tests with low and medium toc fig 2a implying that smx retrosynthesis is likely associated with dea smx it is still uncertain whether such apparent reversible pathways proposed for anoxic conditions fig 4 will apply for oxic conditions as well besides the reversibility of oxic smx degradation has been demonstrated with several other metabolites including n4 acetyl smx and smx glucuronide in water sediment tests radke et al 2009 and nitroso smx in photolysis tests bonvin et al 2013 under anoxic denitrifying conditions studies have revealed that reaction of the primary amine is the main pathway of smx biodegradation in both aquifer materials and activated sludge forming dea smx this study nödler et al 2012 osorio et al 2016 nit smx barbieri et al 2012 nödler et al 2012 or sometimes nitroso smx brienza et al 2017 as an intermediate product in nitrification or denitrification no2 not only affected the formation of dea smx or nit smx in oxic tests as discussed above but also positively correlated to the production of dea smx at day 2 in anoxic tests fig 3d the role of no2 in driving anoxic biotransformation has also been highlighted by rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 that no2 was conjugated with h and the product hno2 reacted with smx to further yield metabolites studies also show that these anoxic metabolites are unstable and can reverse to the parent compound under reducing conditions with a proposed mechanism of sulfonamide retrosynthesis via nit smx reduction to nitroso smx and then to smx rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 here a revised mechanism is postulated in our anoxic tests smx increases followed dea smx decreases after 2 days while no nit smx was detected the reversible metabolite as a precursor of smx retrosynthesis is therefore most likely dea smx or nitroso smx but not nit smx fig 4 it is possible that a nitrogen functional group is introduced to the aromatic ring of dea smx forming n nitroso derivatives e g nitroso smx through reactions with a strong nitrosating compound n2o3 which is speciated from the denitrification by product no at acidic conditions ph in our anoxic tests 6 3 0 1 chiron and duwig 2016 jewell et al 2014 afterwards nitroso smx is reduced to smx moreover anoxic smx biotransformation was positively correlated to denitrifying activities at day 2 p 0 05 fig 3b and negatively correlated to sediment toc at day 28 p 0 05 fig 3a suggesting that denitrification likely supports smx transformation to metabolites and that smx retrosynthesis is probably related to the reduction reactions of sedimentary organics these redox dependent pathways are responsible for the wide range of apparent half lives of smx biodegradation the half life of oxic biodegradation is 5 36 days table s10 consistent with the reported range of 3 22 days for smx biodegradation at ppb levels in soils and polluted river sediments chen and xie 2018 lin and gan 2011 vila costa et al 2017 however the value of λspecific 0 01 0 14 l gsediment 1 day 1 oxic conditions of beiyun river sediments is higher than those of other river sediments baumgarten et al 2011 and even comparable to activated sludge 0 05 0 3 l gsludge 1 day 1 in abegglen et al 2009 and li and zhang 2010 probably due to the sediments long term exposure and acclimation to antibiotic residuals in reclaimed water at denitrifying conditions the higher reversibility of smx biotransformation resulted in its slower removal than that at oxic conditions more data points would have been preferable for an improved estimation of anoxic degradation kinetics fig s10 but it will not change the conclusion that smx retrosynthesis leads to prolonged half lives of anoxic smx degradation similarly in soil incubations smx biodegradation rates were also faster at oxic than anoxic lin and gan 2011 or no3 reducing conditions mohatt et al 2011 entirely different pathways for smx biodegradation have been invoked for fe reducing and sulfate reducing conditions jia et al 2017 mohatt et al 2011 most metabolites are produced with the isoxazole ring altered e g mohatt et al 2011 suggested that the n o bond cleavage was the critical reaction facilitated by dissimilatory fe iii reducing soil microorganisms however this pathway is likely to be limited to the isoxazole containing chemicals such as smx and not applicable for non isoxazole containing sulfonamides such as sdz and smz in this study we can only speculate on the biodegradation pathways of sdz and smz based on the overall experimental progression figs s6 and s7 for each sediment under both redox conditions the three sulfonamides displayed nearly identical biodegradation tendencies it suggests that the first functional group in the catabolic reactions is likely located at the common sulfanilamide region rather than the specific isoxazole ring in smx or the pyrimidine ring in smz and sdz for instance sdz cleavage can happen at the n s bond to produce 2 aminopyrimidine and 4 aminobenzolsulfonate by several bacterial strains deng et al 2016 4 4 persistent sulfonamides and derivatives imply prolonged antimicrobial impacts of reclaimed water the world health organization has declared antimicrobial resistance amr as a global threat understanding the development of amr requires a systematic assessment of the attenuation of antibiotics and other anti microbial compounds by documenting the extremely low mineralization and the low sorption of three sulfonamides plus the complex biodegradation with reversible and unknown metabolites under oxic and anoxic conditions this study demonstrates that sulfonamide antibiotics and their biodegradation derivatives can be more persistent than previously recognized in reclaimed water reuse to date most studies measure the decreases of targeted sulfonamides to assess the apparent removal baumgarten et al 2011 hai et al 2011 ma et al 2019 without consideration of biotransformation products this is concerning because the products although possibly less mobile can possess similar or even higher antimicrobial properties majewsky et al 2014 osorio et al 2016 there exist uncertain risks of sulfonamide related amr in surface and sub surface environments during the large scale reuse of reclaimed water for environmental flow in the north china plain the first warning sign is the highly variable removal performance of sulfonamides by the traditional wastewater treatment technologies e g 52 70 removal by activated sludge or 7 100 removal by aerobic membrane biofilms oberoi et al 2019 due to either the highly dynamic biodegradation or the lower sorption affinity of sulfonamides compared to other antibiotics in wwtps li and zhang 2010 second reclaimed water likely contains inorganic nitrogen and residual organics this promotes denitrifying conditions for a prolonged persistency of sulfonamides and their metabolites the relatively low and highly fluctuating removal of sulfonamides at full scale riverbank filtration sites might not be simply caused by a one way slow biodegradation regnery et al 2015 but could also be due to the anoxic denitrifying retransformation future studies should strive to identify and quantify metabolites not only to establish biodegradation pathways clearly but also to conduct risk assessments with far reaching consequences to the ecological system it is necessary for prudent reuse of reclaimed water guided by the precautionary principle 5 conclusions oxic and anoxic no3 reducing batch experiments with sediments from a reclaimed water receiving river show that the attenuation of sulfonamide antibiotics is complex and usually incomplete in natural environments posing a great challenge to reclaimed water utilization the three studied sulfonamides sdz smz and smx are barely mineralized to carbon dioxide and present low sorption to river sediments sulfonamide biodegradation is redox dependent and associated with sediment organic contents with a prolonged apparent half life at anoxic denitrifying conditions compared to oxic conditions this difference in biodegradation rates is attributed to the formation of more reversible biotransformation products such as dea smx during smx anoxic degradation than oxic degradation and the formation of non reversible biotransformation products such as ammet solely at oxic conditions all findings point to that biotransformation is the dominant process for sulfonamide removal in aquatic systems while the persistency of sulfonamides and the unknown nature of biotransformation metabolites can prolong the antimicrobial impacts

16593,trace levels of sulfonamide antibiotics are ubiquitous in reclaimed water yet environmental pathways to completely remove those chemicals are not well understood when such water is used to restore flows in dried rivers this study investigated sulfonamide sorption desorption biodegradation and mineralization processes with seven sediments from a reclaimed water dominant river batch experiments were conducted under oxic and anoxic nitrate reducing conditions and each removal process of sulfamethazine sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole smx was evaluated individually at environmentally relevant concentrations 10 μg l over 28 days 44 32 of sulfonamides were biodegraded while the full mineralization to carbon dioxide was 1 around 5 of sulfonamides were removed via sediment sorption with a positive correlation with sediment organic contents detailed investigation of smx biodegradation revealed that although its transformation appeared to be faster in anoxic than oxic tests by day 2 it reversed over 28 days with a longer apparent half life in anoxic tests 69 25 days than that in oxic tests 12 11 days this is attributed to the formation of reversible metabolites at denitrifying conditions such as desamino smx of which the production was affected by nitrite concentrations despite measurements of three frequently reported metabolites 70 biotransformation products remained unknown in this study the findings highlight the persistency of sulfonamides and their derivatives with research needed to further elucidate degradation mechanisms

both degradation mechanisms and the potential metabolites before the full mineralization to co2 are elusive for sulfonamide antibiotics garcía galán et al 2008 rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016

was assumed to follow the 1st order kinetics allowing for estimating the apparent kinetic parameters and for comparing with prior studies table s8 3 c t a q u e o u s c t s o r b e d c t c 0 e λ t 4 t

are the sulfonamide concentration in the aqueous phase at time t assuming no sorption happened and the initial concentration at time 0 λ is the apparent biodegradation constant day 1 and t1 2 is the half life day to simplify the biodegradation calculation the dynamic sorption desorption process was considered instantaneous to reach equilibrium state at each sampling time and ct sorbed was calculated with kd using eq 1 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 14c scintillation counting for the mineralized and non mineralized sulfonamide aqueous samples 1 ml were transferred from the mineralization bottle into a glass scintillation vial with acid solution 100 µl 0 05m h2so4 while a glass tube containing 1 ml 1m naoh was inserted into the vial to trap 14co2 after overnight incubation in the dark samples of the acidified solution or the base trap were mixed with 10 ml optiphase hisafe 3 scintillation cocktail and counted in a liquid scintillation counter tricarb 5110tr perkin elmer the measured radioactivity in the base trap and the acidified solution represent the mineralized 14c fraction as 14co2 and the non mineralized 14c fraction in the aqueous phase respectively mass conservation of 14c in this protocol was validated with the 14c ibuprofen tests as the total recovery of 14c in the acidified solution and the base trap during mineralization was 94 4 13 9 of the initially spiked amount data not shown 14c sdz samples from the sorption isotherm tests were added directly with the scintillation cocktail and radioactivity was measured 2 4 2 ultra performance

s correlation coefficient r was calculated between the dependent variable kd and the independent variables other properties of sediments or chemicals linear regression was used to assess the relationship between sulfonamide biodegradation performance and other potential influencing factors with f test at the 5 significance level statistical analysis was conducted using microsoft office excel 2019 with the add in solver 3 results 3 1 sediment characteristics inorganic elemental compositions of the seven sediments were similar indicating that they share common geologic provenance table s2 they are typical of alluvial plain deposits of the north china plain liu et al 2016 with a low to moderate degree of weathering to clay minerals cia 59 65 icv 1 3 1 5 however sediment toc was significantly higher at downstream sites 1 1 0 2 n 4 table 1 than that at upstream sites 0 4 0 2 n 3 table 1 toc was neither correlated to the fine sediment fractions as indicated by ssa values nor to the more reducing conditions of riverbed sites compared to riverbank sites suggesting that the sewage sourced organic matters likely remain bioavailable and not entirely bound to fine clay minerals despite ppb levels of organic micropollutants in the beiyun river water only low concentrations of sulfonamides were extracted from the seven sediments by either tap water or nan3 dosed tap water as supernatant samples taken from all sediment controls during biodegradation and sorption tests contained only 0 04 0 04 μg l of the three sulfonamides and 0 02 0 02 μg l of the three metabolites 3 2 weak sorption of sulfonamides and smx metabolites for all sediments incubated under oxic conditions sorption of the sulfonamides and the smx metabolites is weak with sorption affinities of metabolites slightly higher than those of sulfonamides kd sulfonamides 0 9 2 2 l kg kd metabolites 5 4 15 6 l kg table 1 chemical properties are found to affect the sorption affinity e g there is a strong positive correlation between kd and the chemical hydrophobicity logkow r 0 6 table s3 accordingly nit smx and dea smx with higher logkow showed higher kd values among the metabolites ammet has a low logkow value and a low molecular weight but an intermediate kd value table s3 indicating that hydrophobicity does not fully explain the sorption affinity likewise in comparison to sdz and smz smx with a higher logkow displayed the lowest kd as to the examined sediment properties kd was correlated only with the sediment organic content with loi r 0 6 with toc r 0 4 table 1 due to the low amounts of sorbed sulfonamides and metabolites it is a challenge to quantify the desorption percentages overall metabolites desorbed less 13 21 than parent sulfonamides 32 50 which reflects stronger sorption affinities of the former as indicated by their higher kd values sorption isotherm experiments using riverbed h sediments yielded the similarly weak sorption affinity of smz kf oxic 0 95 l kg kf anoxic 0 80 l kg table s7 as in the batch tests kd oxic smz 1 02 0 77 l kg for riverbed h table 1 nevertheless kf oxic was 15 higher than kf anoxic implying the potential effects of redox conditions on sorption removal to the best of our knowledge this set of sorption desorption experiments is the first to validate the sorption and desorption behaviors of sulfonamide metabolites 3 3 negligible sulfonamide mineralization under oxic and anoxic no3 reducing conditions during the 28 day mineralization tests the percentages of 14c labeled smx smz and sdz mineralized to 14co2 were negligible in all seven sediments under both oxic and anoxic conditions 0 5 0 4 fig 1 this is expected as sulfonamides have been shown to be resistant to microbial mineralization in activated sludge or soils alvarino et al 2016 höltge and kreuzig 2007 although several strains isolated from activated sludge or membrane bioreactors were capable of smx mineralization bouju et al 2012 reis et al 2014 while the trapped 14co2 remained low the non mineralized 14c in the aqueous phase gradually decreased and recovered only 20 90 of the initially added 14c by day 28 figs s4 and s5 the 14c loss was likely due to the higher sorption of the produced metabolites than parent sulfonamides table 1 the formation of non extractable residues similarly as observed for xenobiotics biodegradation in soils kästner et al 2014 or the production of volatile metabolites which could not be captured by the base trap lastly less 14c labeled sulfonamides and metabolites remained in the aqueous phase by 28 days in oxic tests 21 87 fig s4 than those in anoxic tests 68 91 fig s5 3 4 redox dependent sulfonamide biotransformation microbial degradation to intermediate metabolites i e biotransformation was the principal removal mechanism as mass balance calculation showed that sorption removed only 5 of sulfonamides and mineralization was negligible by both day 2 and day 28 fig 1 sulfonamide removal attributed exclusively to biotransformation was estimated with the deduction of sorption removal from the total removal during degradation experiments eq 3 although the removal of sulfonamides under no3 reducing conditions 72 11 was significantly higher than that under oxic conditions by day 2 37 21 it reversed by day 28 when the oxic removal progressed to 72 28 and the anoxic removal decreased to 29 20 figs 1 and s6 specifically smx was taken as an example to delve into sulfonamide biotransformation processes under oxic and anoxic conditions and their variations between river sediments fig 2 during oxic tests four sediments with high toc 0 87 1 56 fig 2a displayed high removal of smx by day 70 with apparent half lives of smx estimated as 5 36 days table s10 in comparison the other three sediments with low to medium toc 0 16 0 49 fig 2a displayed low smx removal by day 70 due to concentration increases during the tests which corresponded to its longer half lives reaching up to 85 days table s10 although a positive correlation was observed between the removal of smx via biotransformation smxbiotransformed and sediment toc it was not statistically significant p 0 05 fig s11b of the three measured metabolites dea smx was prominently detected with significant accumulation of ammet at day 70 and barely detectable nit smx in all seven sediments fig 2a the production of dea smx was positively correlated with smxbiotransformed at day 2 fig s11c under anoxic conditions smx rapidly decreased in the first 2 days of all tests 50 removal fig 2b however the five sediments with medium to high toc showed significant smx increases after day 2 corresponding to continuing no3 consumption in contrast the other two sediments with low toc maintained relatively constant smx concentrations accompanied by minor no3 removal between day 2 and day 28 the apparent half lives of smx assessed over 28 days in all seven sediments were 52 29 days table s10 while they extended to 69 25 days n 5 without the consideration of low toc sediments dea smx was the main metabolite with a positive correlation to smxbiotransformed fig 3 c both ammet and nit smx were barely detected fig 2b smx increases in the five anoxic tests was unexpected rendering our attempt to estimate the apparent kinetic parameters with fewer data points than desired fig s10 moreover biotransformation correlations were separately examined at day 2 and day 28 due to the reversal in smx degradation fig 3 a positive correlation was observed between smxbiotransformed and the consumption of no3 via denitrification at day 2 but not day 28 fig 3b while smxbiotransformed was negatively correlated to sediment toc at day 28 but not day 2 fig 3a the production of dea smx was correlated to the aqueous no2 concentrations at day 2 but not day 28 fig 3d 4 discussion 4 1 low but variable sorption affinities of sulfonamides and metabolites this study shows that sorption of sulfonamide antibiotics to the beiyun river sediments is weak consistent with results of other aquifer sediments bertelkamp et al 2014 although higher sorption of smx metabolites has been predicted based on their kow values nödler et al 2012 our experiments demonstrate clearly that they sorb more and desorb less than the parent sulfonamides a positive correlation between logkow and kd has been widely adopted to estimate kd xia et al 2005 yang et al 2011 while our study provides additional support that pka can possibly affect micropollutant sorption via electrostatic forces oberoi et al 2019 for instance due to the sulfonamide dissociation the order of sulfonamide kd i e kd smz kd sdz kd smx follows the order of their pka values table s3 i e pkasmz 7 89 pkasdz 6 81 pkasmx 5 81 a lower pka of the amphoteric sulfonamides leads to a more anionic form which is sorbed less onto the negatively charged surface of river sediments additionally sorption of sulfonamides at oxic conditions is slightly higher than that at anoxic conditions it is likely due to the redox driven changes in sediment properties such as the reduction of ferric oxides to ferrous minerals and changes in sediment polymeric substances wang et al 2017 the sediment organic content is also a factor in sulfonamide sorption removal indicating a higher sorption removal at downstream sites high sediment toc than at upstream sites of the beiyun river low sediment toc this has been similarly observed in soil systems drillia et al 2005 where a soil with a high toc of 7 1 displayed a much higher kf smx 36 2 l kg than a soil with a low toc of 0 4 0 3 l kg it might also explain why activated sludge generally presents strong sorption for sulfonamide antibiotics e g 20 l kg sludge in jia et al 2017 and yang et al 2011 as their organic contents loi 70 are much higher than those of natural sediments loi 1 7 6 3 table 1 it is supported by our finding that sulfonamide sorption affinities to organic matter are comparable between river sediments and activate sludge as kd smx normalized to organic carbon was 25 9 l kg table 1 vs 38 3 l kg in activated sludge yang et al 2011 4 2 undetected metabolites in the mass balance of smx biodegradation process sulfonamide biodegradation has been studied under oxic müller et al 2013 anoxic jia et al 2017 schaffer et al 2015 and anaerobic conditions mohatt et al 2011 some studies included metabolites müller et al 2013 rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 but few have performed a quantitative analysis of metabolite production and dissipation kassotaki et al 2016 nödler et al 2012 or a full comparison between different redox conditions alvarino et al 2016 in our tests mass balance of smx biodegradation was evaluated based on the measurements of smx and three metabolites the sorbed fraction was estimated with kd values table s9 it reveals that the three measured metabolites accounted for 30 of the total biotransformation products and that around 40 of smx was converted to undetected metabolites the dominant metabolite dea smx was always below 2 μg l fig s6 the proportion of undetected metabolites in the oxic tests gradually increased up to 90 by 28 days much higher than that in anoxic no3 reducing tests 64 suggesting different biodegradation pathways section 4 3 further the mass of metabolites sorbed onto the sediments can be comparable to that dissolved in the aqueous phase fig s8 implying smx especially in oxic conditions is degraded to more hydrophobic metabolites unmeasured metabolites of smx biotransformation might be n4 acetyl smx which was detected in oxic incubations of soils or sediments xu et al 2011 nitroso smx which was a main metabolite in soil under denitrifying conditions brienza et al 2017 or pterin smx which represent a major biotransformation route in activated sludge achermann et al 2018 the high accumulation of undetected metabolic products has also been observed in other studies e g at denitrifying conditions up to 50 smx was transformed to nit smx and dea smx in aquifer sediments and the other metabolites remained undetected barbieri et al 2012 nödler et al 2012 in an enriched nitrifier culture only 40 aerobic biodegradation products were measured as nit smx dea smx and n4 acetyl smx kassotaki et al 2016 and in oxic tests of activated sludge 40 of smx metabolites were unknown besides the main product ammet müller et al 2013 although the evaluation of biodegradation removal is not affected the understanding of sulfonamide biotransformation mechanisms requires identification and quantification of these unmeasured and redox dependent metabolites 4 3 aerobic and anoxic no3 reducing biodegradation pathways for sulfonamides several lines of evidence especially the occurrence of various metabolites across a range of redox conditions in activated sludge aquifer and river sediments garcía galán et al 2008 suggest that the pathways for smx biodegradation differ under oxic and anoxic conditions the discussion below focuses on smx with its three frequently reported metabolites kassotaki et al 2016 rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 the presence of ammet in oxic tests and its absence in anoxic tests suggest that aerobic biodegradation by river sediments involves the cleavage of smx at the n s bond producing ammet and 4 aminobenzolsulfonate fig 4 this irreversible breakage of sulfonamide radical has been the most frequently reported pathway of aerobic biodegradation similarly observed in activated sludge and in enriched bacterial cultures müller et al 2013 reis et al 2014 it is interpreted as a more complete biodegradation process due to the much smaller molecule of ammet compared to dea smx or nit smx and that the aerobic biodegradation leads to a more extensive breakdown of smx than the anoxic biodegradation this cleavage reaction may happen via either a metabolic reis et al 2014 or a co metabolic müller et al 2013 pathway in our oxic tests ammet production did not correspond with smxbiotransformed fig s11d or sediment toc moreover its accumulation was relatively low these observations in beiyun sediments are different from those in activated sludge of müller et al 2013 where ammet increased gradually as the main metabolite during aerobic smx biodegradation 60 smx biodegraded to ammet and further to 3 amino isoxazole the reason for the contrasting behavior in organic rich sludge and organic poor sediments needs further investigation it could be due to different microbial communities leading to the limited vs extensive breakage of smx dea smx accumulation in oxic tests was significant in this study suggesting another pathway of aerobic biotransformation with the substitution of the aromatic amine of smx fig 4 or an anoxic pathway as discussed below due to likely microscale anoxic conditions in oxic tests little nit smx was detected differing from the study of kassotaki et al 2016 where it was the main metabolite during aerobic smx biodegradation by nitrifiers as nit smx tends to accumulate in no2 rich environments 2 mmol l barbieri et al 2012 kassotaki et al 2016 nödler et al 2012 the low no2 in our oxic and anoxic tests 0 13 mmol l might have limited its production when dea sulfonamide or nit sulfonamide emerges as the main metabolite still requires further investigation as dea smx and nit smx are structurally similar to smx with the nitrosation or deamination reaction of the primary amine it might allow for reversible transformations back to smx as proposed for anoxic conditions although the retrosynthesis does not follow the thermodynamically reversible reaction pathway rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 here smx appeared to increase with decreasing dea smx in oxic sediment tests with low and medium toc fig 2a implying that smx retrosynthesis is likely associated with dea smx it is still uncertain whether such apparent reversible pathways proposed for anoxic conditions fig 4 will apply for oxic conditions as well besides the reversibility of oxic smx degradation has been demonstrated with several other metabolites including n4 acetyl smx and smx glucuronide in water sediment tests radke et al 2009 and nitroso smx in photolysis tests bonvin et al 2013 under anoxic denitrifying conditions studies have revealed that reaction of the primary amine is the main pathway of smx biodegradation in both aquifer materials and activated sludge forming dea smx this study nödler et al 2012 osorio et al 2016 nit smx barbieri et al 2012 nödler et al 2012 or sometimes nitroso smx brienza et al 2017 as an intermediate product in nitrification or denitrification no2 not only affected the formation of dea smx or nit smx in oxic tests as discussed above but also positively correlated to the production of dea smx at day 2 in anoxic tests fig 3d the role of no2 in driving anoxic biotransformation has also been highlighted by rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 that no2 was conjugated with h and the product hno2 reacted with smx to further yield metabolites studies also show that these anoxic metabolites are unstable and can reverse to the parent compound under reducing conditions with a proposed mechanism of sulfonamide retrosynthesis via nit smx reduction to nitroso smx and then to smx rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 here a revised mechanism is postulated in our anoxic tests smx increases followed dea smx decreases after 2 days while no nit smx was detected the reversible metabolite as a precursor of smx retrosynthesis is therefore most likely dea smx or nitroso smx but not nit smx fig 4 it is possible that a nitrogen functional group is introduced to the aromatic ring of dea smx forming n nitroso derivatives e g nitroso smx through reactions with a strong nitrosating compound n2o3 which is speciated from the denitrification by product no at acidic conditions ph in our anoxic tests 6 3 0 1 chiron and duwig 2016 jewell et al 2014 afterwards nitroso smx is reduced to smx moreover anoxic smx biotransformation was positively correlated to denitrifying activities at day 2 p 0 05 fig 3b and negatively correlated to sediment toc at day 28 p 0 05 fig 3a suggesting that denitrification likely supports smx transformation to metabolites and that smx retrosynthesis is probably related to the reduction reactions of sedimentary organics these redox dependent pathways are responsible for the wide range of apparent half lives of smx biodegradation the half life of oxic biodegradation is 5 36 days table s10 consistent with the reported range of 3 22 days for smx biodegradation at ppb levels in soils and polluted river sediments chen and xie 2018 lin and gan 2011 vila costa et al 2017 however the value of λspecific 0 01 0 14 l gsediment 1 day 1 oxic conditions of beiyun river sediments is higher than those of other river sediments baumgarten et al 2011 and even comparable to activated sludge 0 05 0 3 l gsludge 1 day 1 in abegglen et al 2009 and li and zhang 2010 probably due to the sediments long term exposure and acclimation to antibiotic residuals in reclaimed water at denitrifying conditions the higher reversibility of smx biotransformation resulted in its slower removal than that at oxic conditions more data points would have been preferable for an improved estimation of anoxic degradation kinetics fig s10 but it will not change the conclusion that smx retrosynthesis leads to prolonged half lives of anoxic smx degradation similarly in soil incubations smx biodegradation rates were also faster at oxic than anoxic lin and gan 2011 or no3 reducing conditions mohatt et al 2011 entirely different pathways for smx biodegradation have been invoked for fe reducing and sulfate reducing conditions jia et al 2017 mohatt et al 2011 most metabolites are produced with the isoxazole ring altered e g mohatt et al 2011 suggested that the n o bond cleavage was the critical reaction facilitated by dissimilatory fe iii reducing soil microorganisms however this pathway is likely to be limited to the isoxazole containing chemicals such as smx and not applicable for non isoxazole containing sulfonamides such as sdz and smz in this study we can only speculate on the biodegradation pathways of sdz and smz based on the overall experimental progression figs s6 and s7 for each sediment under both redox conditions the three sulfonamides displayed nearly identical biodegradation tendencies it suggests that the first functional group in the catabolic reactions is likely located at the common sulfanilamide region rather than the specific isoxazole ring in smx or the pyrimidine ring in smz and sdz for instance sdz cleavage can happen at the n s bond to produce 2 aminopyrimidine and 4 aminobenzolsulfonate by several bacterial strains deng et al 2016 4 4 persistent sulfonamides and derivatives imply prolonged antimicrobial impacts of reclaimed water the world health organization has declared antimicrobial resistance amr as a global threat understanding the development of amr requires a systematic assessment of the attenuation of antibiotics and other anti microbial compounds by documenting the extremely low mineralization and the low sorption of three sulfonamides plus the complex biodegradation with reversible and unknown metabolites under oxic and anoxic conditions this study demonstrates that sulfonamide antibiotics and their biodegradation derivatives can be more persistent than previously recognized in reclaimed water reuse to date most studies measure the decreases of targeted sulfonamides to assess the apparent removal baumgarten et al 2011 hai et al 2011 ma et al 2019 without consideration of biotransformation products this is concerning because the products although possibly less mobile can possess similar or even higher antimicrobial properties majewsky et al 2014 osorio et al 2016 there exist uncertain risks of sulfonamide related amr in surface and sub surface environments during the large scale reuse of reclaimed water for environmental flow in the north china plain the first warning sign is the highly variable removal performance of sulfonamides by the traditional wastewater treatment technologies e g 52 70 removal by activated sludge or 7 100 removal by aerobic membrane biofilms oberoi et al 2019 due to either the highly dynamic biodegradation or the lower sorption affinity of sulfonamides compared to other antibiotics in wwtps li and zhang 2010 second reclaimed water likely contains inorganic nitrogen and residual organics this promotes denitrifying conditions for a prolonged persistency of sulfonamides and their metabolites the relatively low and highly fluctuating removal of sulfonamides at full scale riverbank filtration sites might not be simply caused by a one way slow biodegradation regnery et al 2015 but could also be due to the anoxic denitrifying retransformation future studies should strive to identify and quantify metabolites not only to establish biodegradation pathways clearly but also to conduct risk assessments with far reaching consequences to the ecological system it is necessary for prudent reuse of reclaimed water guided by the precautionary principle 5 conclusions oxic and anoxic no3 reducing batch experiments with sediments from a reclaimed water receiving river show that the attenuation of sulfonamide antibiotics is complex and usually incomplete in natural environments posing a great challenge to reclaimed water utilization the three studied sulfonamides sdz smz and smx are barely mineralized to carbon dioxide and present low sorption to river sediments sulfonamide biodegradation is redox dependent and associated with sediment organic contents with a prolonged apparent half life at anoxic denitrifying conditions compared to oxic conditions this difference in biodegradation rates is attributed to the formation of more reversible biotransformation products such as dea smx during smx anoxic degradation than oxic degradation and the formation of non reversible biotransformation products such as ammet solely at oxic conditions all findings point to that biotransformation is the dominant process for sulfonamide removal in aquatic systems while the persistency of sulfonamides and the unknown nature of biotransformation metabolites can prolong the antimicrobial impacts

16594,fulvic acids fas are known to regulate the fate of mercury hg in sediments but the key effects of their properties are still unclear in this study field investigations and simulation experiments were conducted in a heavy metal polluted wetland to identify fa characteristics and their association with the production and bioaccumulation of methylmercury mehg compared to permanently inundated areas pia seasonally inundated areas sias had lower total hg levels in sediments whereas higher mehg levels in sediments 0 20 0 09 ng g 1 vs 0 55 0 31 ng g 1 and benthos 0 25 0 22 ng g 1 vs 1 62 1 78 ng g 1 meanwhile the thg and mehg concentrations in the same macrophyte species between pia and sia also followed a similar rule with benthos fa bound hg in the sediment was significantly correlated with mehg in the sediment p 0 01 as well as thg and mehg in benthos p 0 05 indicating that fas have the capacity to promote mehg production and bioaccumulation moreover the fas in the sediments of the sia had lower fractions and alkyl c o alkyl c ratios but higher molecular weights and thg mehg concentrations than those in the pia indicating that fas in sia have increased bioavailability and enhanced competition for hg favoring significantly elevated fa bound hg levels biological exposure testing further demonstrated that fas extracted from sia had a greater ability to increase the production and bioaccumulation of mehg than those extracted from pia overall these results highlight that the molecular composition and sources of fas excluding their concentrations are one of important factors responsible for the obvious spatial heterogeneity of mehg in sediments and aquatic organisms in the wetland keywords plateau wetland fulvic acid properties mercury bioavailability 1 introduction methylmercury mehg the methylated product of mercury hg with a high accumulation capacity in food webs tends to be synthesized by microbes in aquatic sediments such as wetlands ullrich et al 2001 lehnherr et al 2012 mehg production largely depends on microbial activities and hg bioavailability which are synchronously affected by many environmental factors such as eh ph organic matter om sulfide and mineral activity ma et al 2019 in particular om especially its dissolved form seems to play more important roles by fueling hg methylating bacteria while also binding hg to regulate its bioavailability moreau et al 2015 however om consisted of a series of high to low molecular weight components frequently exhibits the heterogeneous geochemical and or biochemical behaviors related to hg methylation in sediments he et al 2019 liu et al 2011 previous studies reported that apart from om contents its sources and compositions were more important in determining the fate of hg in the environment bravo et al 2017 graham et al 2013 fulvic acids fas are one of the main om components with relatively low molecular weight high solubility and high activity zhang et al 2009 chiasson gould et al 2014 lu et al 2020 and may play a key role in regulating the fate of hg however to our knowledge there are limited studies providing insightful understandings about the effects of fas on the environmental behavior of hg in these studies fas were observed to promote the methylation and bioaccumulation of hg in soil yu et al 2004 xu et al 2017 chang et al 2021 and fa bound hg could be an important source of hg in water and fish lindqvist et al 1991 li et al 2019 nevertheless a study also showed that the addition of fas could inhibit the absorption of hg in lettuce lactuca sativa var angustana irish li 2001 we speculated that the interaction between fas and hg may be determined by multiple factors such as fa sources or structures however the effects of fas derived from different sources or having different structural characteristics on the hg methylation and bioaccumulation of hg are still unclear in recent years elevated mehg production in the water level fluctuating zone of reservoirs has drawn much attention eckley et al 2017 eckley et al 2015 yin et al 2020a this was partially ascribed to the enhanced hg bioavailability and microbial activity related to om breakdown driven by water level pulses eckley et al 2017 xiang et al 2018 yin et al 2018 however to date the key roles of fas in mehg production in this special area have not been well explored by achieving this we may update our understandings of the elevated production and biological exposure risk of mehg observed in the water level fluctuating zone the caohai ch wetland is located within a national nature protection area in the yunnan guizhou plateau china and is famous for its great abundance of aquatic plants this was found to favor the high om levels yang et al 2017 in recent years the ch wetland has been widely concerned mostly due to its serious heavy metal pollution by artisanal zinc smelting activities bi et al 2007 feng et al 2004 deposited heavy metals including hg accumulate up to a high level in sediments for example pb 235 40 mg kg 1 cd 68 98 mg kg 1 and hg 0 51 mg kg 1 can reach up to 6 69 104 52 and 4 64 times higher than the soil background values in guizhou province respectively wei et al 1991 thus these elevated toxic metals may pose a substantial threat to aquatic organisms sun et al 2020 yin et al 2020b other worthy of concerns is that the ch wetland forms an obvious water level fluctuating zone 40 of the highest water area with significantly lower om concentrations and humification levels than permanently inundated zones yin et al 2020a we then speculate that variations in om components such as fas may largely affect the production and bioaccumulation of mehg however until now little information can be available from previous studies the main objectives of this study are to associate the relationships between fa properties and mehg production as well as its bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms to achieve this field investigations were first conducted to build the relationship between fas and mehg production bioaccumulation by 1 measuring the total hg and mehg concentrations in sediments and aquatic organisms 2 evaluating the geochemical speciation of hg in sediments and 3 describing fa properties in sediments such as their uv vis absorption fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance 13c nmr spectra after that fa amended biological exposure experiments were performed to further confirm the potential roles of fas in the production and bioaccumulation of mehg 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in a national nature reserve in weining county guizhou province 26 45 27 00 n 104 10 104 25 e fig 1 the ch wetland is a typical plateau wetland ecosystem with an altitude of 2170 m above sea level and covers an area of 46 5 km2 it is the largest natural plateau freshwater lake in guizhou province and famous as the migratory birds habitat in southwest china the ch watershed features a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of approximately 951 mm and an annual mean temperature of 10 6 c bi et al 2007 it hosts a wide variety of aquatic plant and animal species it should be noted that the watershed of this wetland includes a historical zinc smelting site hezhang county approximately 15 km away which operated from the 17th century to 2004 fig 1 a large amount of slag and waste gas released from mining and smelting has the potential to become the pollution source of heavy metals in the ch wetland through atmospheric deposition and surface runoff feng et al 2004 2 2 field samplings in this study nine and eight sampling sites were selected in permanently inundated areas pia and seasonally inundated areas sia with water levels in wet season of 2 3 m and 0 5 m respectively in august 2014 at each site four sediment cores were collected using a gravity sediment corer featuring a polymethylmethacrylate tube 5 0 cm inner diameter id 60 cm length l surficial sediments 0 5 cm were respectively sliced from these cores with plastic blade in a bio bag filled with nitrogen afterwards the surficial sediment samples sliced from three cores were mixed in a centrifuge tube to form one sample and the fourth surficial sediment sample was transferred into other centrifuge tube which were then transported to laboratory at 4 c in the laboratory mixed sediment samples were freeze dried at 60 c and ground through a 0 15 mm mesh prior to determining the concentrations and geochemical fractions of hg the other sediment sample was centrifuged to collect pore water because of the spatial heterogeneity of plants benthos some of them can distribute in multiple sampling sites while others can only be found in few sites in each sediment sampling site dominant macrophytes in august 2014 and benthos represented by mudsnails cipangopaludina cathayensis in august 2014 january 2015 and may 2015 wherever they existed were manually collected with the sample size of 3 8 respectively a cleaning procedure was followed in these sampling events the detailed sample information can be accessed in the tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information si the aboveground parts of same macrophytes collected from each site were mixed into one sample and it was then washed with ultrapure water the mudsnails were collected from cages fixed at the sediment water interface in pia while in sia they were sampled from shallow water by hand they were firstly washed with ultrapure water and muscle tissues were collected by an anatomical method the muscle samples of mudsnails from each sampling site were then mixed into one sample after that all those biological samples were freeze dried at 60 c and ground into powder prior to determination of the thg and mehg concentrations 2 3 extraction and purification of fulvic acids in sediments the extraction and purification of sediment fas were performed using a method developed by the international humic substances society ihss calderoni and schnitzer 1984 gu et al 2001 and a detailed description can be found in the si 2 4 biological mercury exposure experiment amended with fas to understand the effects of extracted fas on hg bioavailability in the study area artificial sediments amended with fas were used to perform biological hg exposure experiment the method used to prepare artificial sediments including quartz sand calcium carbonate kaolinite iron oxide and manganese oxides with a mass ratio of 53 30 10 4 1 has been reported by many studies chen et al 1989 zhong and wang 2008 yin et al 2020b here 5 kg of prepared artificial sediments dry weight were respectively weighed into two aquariums 45 cm 30 cm 28 cm the hg ⅱ solutions hgcl2 2 mg l 1 were respectively added to form a total hg concentration of 2 0 mg kg 1 in the artificial sediments which were then aged for 15 days the thg concentrations in the hg amended artificial sediments were re measured after aged for 15 days to find the similar values 2 25 mg kg 1 vs 2 34 mg kg 1 after that fas extracted from the permanently and seasonally inundated sediments were respectively added in hg amended artificial sediments with a proportion of 2 w w each treatment was conducted in triplicate mudsnails and water spinach ipomoea aquatica used in the simulation experiments were purchased from a market with lower hg concentrations 30 and 20 ng g 1 dry weight respectively then the mudsnails n 20 and water spinach plants no leaves n 3 with similar appearances and weights were placed or cultivated on the surficial sediment in every aquarium and irrigated with hg free water then the aquariums were placed in a greenhouse at a temperature of 20 26 c and kept the overlying water at 5 cm throughout the incubation period the mudsnails were fed twice a week with swamp morning glory 10 of the mudsnail s weight which had hg concentrations lower than 20 ng g 1 after one month the mudsnails n 8 10 and new leaves of the water spinach n 16 20 were collected from each aquarium and a preprocessed method similar with field work was conducted prior to analysis of hg concentrations at the same time three subsamples were collected from the surficial sediment 0 5 cm by a plastic spoon and mixed into one sample which was then divided into two parts 1 one was freeze dried 60 c and ground for measuring hg concentrations 2 the other was used to collect pore water via centrifugation and filtration with a 0 45 μm pvdf membrane and stored at 4 c with 0 5 hcl 2 5 chemical and spectral analysis total hg concentrations in pore water were determined using a method reported by yan et al 2003 briefly all hg forms in the water samples were oxidized with brcl reduced by sncl2 purged by nitrogen collected onto a gold trap and then quantified by cold vapor atomic fluorescence cvafs model iii brooksrand usa the mehg concentrations in the water samples were measured following the pre distillation ethylation nitrogen purging and tenax capture combined with gas chromatography gc cvafs as reported by jiang et al 2018 for sediment thg analysis approximately 0 2 g of sample was digested with freshly prepared aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 v v in a water bath at 95 c li et al 2005 an aliquot of the digested solution was then pretreated following the method similar to that of pore water to measure the thg concentrations the mehg concentrations in sediment were measured following a procedure with hno3 cuso4 leaching ch2cl2 extraction ethylation tenax capture isothermal gc separation and cvafs detection he et al 2004 the thg and mehg concentrations in the organisms were determined using methods previously described by yan et al 2005 and liang et al 1996 respectively briefly biological samples were pretreated by acid digestion hno3 h2so4 7 3 v v brcl oxidation sncl2 reduction and gold trap collection and their thg concentrations were quantified by cvafs for mehg analysis the biological samples were subjected to koh methanol 25 v v digestion ch2cl2 extraction aqueous ethylation tenax trap collection and gc cvafs detection the hg concentrations in all aquatic organisms are expressed by dry weight unless otherwise stated geochemical fractions of hg in the sediment were obtained with a tessier sequential chemical extraction procedure with slight modification bloom et al 2003 that is om bound hg is divided into fulvic acid and humic acid bound fractions preston et al 1994 xu et al 2019 then we separated six geochemical forms i e the water soluble fraction hg w gastric acid soluble fraction hg g fulvic acid bound fraction hg f humic acid bound fraction hg h strongly complex fraction hg c and sulfide bound fraction hg s detailed information can be found in the tables s3 in the si cross polarization and magic angle spinning techniques cpmas were used to obtain the solid state 13c nmr spectra of fas the nmr was an agilent 600 m spectrometer agilent magnetic field strength of 14 1 t usa and approximately 200 mg of sample was filled into a 4 mm zirconium rotor with a kel fcap the spectral frequency was 75 47 mhz the spinning rate was 4 khz the pulse width was 2 60 μs and the data acquisition time was 0 3 s the elemental compositions of sediments were measured using x ray fluorescence spectroscopy zsx primus iv rigaku corporation japan for spectral analysis of fas uv vis and fluorescence spectra were obtained in a 10 mm quartz cuvette using an aqualog horiba japan absorption fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp at 20 c detailed information can be found in the tables s4 in the si 2 6 quality assurance and quality control quality assurance and quality control for the thg and mehg measurements were conducted using duplicates matrix spikes and or standard reference materials srms for thg gsb 26 celery gss 5 soil and tort 3 lobster hepatopancreas were used as srms for mehg erm cc580 estuarine sediment and tort 3 lobster hepatopancreas were used as srms the thg and mehg recoveries for the srms and matrix spikes were 85 115 n 20 in the measurement of hg speciation in sediments the sum of all hg speciation accounted for 83 114 n 12 of the directly measured thg concentrations the duplicates were taken regularly throughout the sample analysis 10 of samples and the relative standard deviations rsds of thg and mehg concentrations in all duplicate samples were 15 3 results 3 1 elevated mehg levels in sediments and aquatic organisms in seasonally inundated areas the thg and mehg concentrations of the ch sediments ranged from 48 60 236 70 ng g 1 and 0 06 1 10 ng g 1 respectively according to the threshold effect level tel smith et al 1996 24 of the sediment samples which were mainly from the pia exceeded the tel values of thg tables s5 si this result indicated that a potential ecological risk in the ch ecosystem may occur the thg concentrations in the seasonally inundated sediments 91 29 48 61 ng g 1 were significantly lower than those in the permanently inundated sediments 154 42 54 91 ng g 1 p 0 05 fig 2 a however the mehg concentrations and the percentage of thg as mehg mehg in the sia 0 55 ng g 1 and 0 73 respectively were approximately 3 and 5 fold higher than those in the pia 0 20 ng g 1 and 0 14 respectively p 0 05 fig 2 b c which was exactly inverse with the law that thg followed the thg and mehg concentrations in the collected macrophytes were 11 11 3 92 ng g 1 and 0 36 0 53 ng g 1 respectively in comparison lower thg 9 68 11 19 ng g 1 but elevated mehg levels 0 66 0 87 ng g 1 were found in the mudsnails this indicated that the benthic animals had a relatively higher accumulation potential of mehg than the macrophytes both thg and mehg concentrations in the muscles of mudsnails collected from sia 15 48 13 33 ng g 1 and 1 62 1 78 ng g 1 were significantly higher than those in the pia 3 87 3 31 ng g 1 and 0 25 0 22 ng g 1 p 0 05 fig 3 a b moreover the thg and mehg concentrations in the same macrophyte between the sia and pia were compared and the similar results were still observed fig 3 a b and table s1 these results were in line with the elevated mehg levels in the sediments of the sia suggesting that a higher hg exposure risk occurs in the ecosystems experiencing seasonal inundation 3 2 elevated fulvic acid bound hg levels in seasonally inundated areas the geochemical fractions of hg in sediment samples collected from the sia and pia were quantified the results showed that the water soluble hg w gastric acid soluble hg g fulvic acid bound hg f humic acid bound hg h strongly complexing hg c and sulfide bound hg s fractions contributed 1 68 1 85 0 81 0 41 33 44 25 35 16 83 7 04 39 51 29 04 and 7 73 6 89 of the measured thg respectively this indicated that hg in sediments in the ch wetland was mostly in organic i e fulvic acid and humic acid and strongly complexing phases i e hg0 hg bound to amorphous organo sulfur hg ag amalgams or crystalline fe mn oxide phases with respect to different flooding conditions the geochemical fractions of hg showed great spatial heterogeneity fig 4 a it should be highlighted that the fractions of fa bound hg in seasonally inundated sediments could account for 51 90 14 80 of the measured thg which was significantly higher than that in permanently inundated sediments 7 59 2 63 p 0 01 indicating that seasonally inundated sediment tends to accumulate more hg in an fa bound state in contrast permanently inundated sediments had a significantly higher p 0 01 strongly complexing hg fraction than seasonally inundated sediments 69 67 6 61 vs 17 96 14 74 indicating that the permanently inundated sediment tends to accumulate more inert hg speciation similar to the distribution of fa bound hg speciation in the sediments the thg and mehg concentrations in the fas extracted from seasonally inundated sediments were also significantly higher than those from permanently inundated areas fig 4 b correlation analysis was performed to show that thg mehg in the extracted fas had a significant positive relationship with mehg concentrations in the sediments fig 4 c moreover fa bound hg was significantly correlated with mehg concentrations in the sediments as well as thg and mehg in the mudsnails fig 4 d whereas the bioavailable fractions such as hg w and hg g did not show any significant correlation with mehg concentrations in the sediments p 0 05 3 3 effect of fa amendment on the bioaccumulation of mercury the correlations between fa related hg and hg concentrations in aquatic organisms and mehg in sediments indicated that fas may play an important role in the methylation and bioavailability of hg in the ch wetland to support this hypothesis a biological exposure experiment was carried out by adding with fas extracted from seasonally inundated sediments sia fas and permanently inundated sediments pia fas as shown in fig 5 the artificial sediments amended with sia fas resulted in significantly higher mehg concentrations 5 37 1 83 ng g 1 than those amended with pia fas 1 23 0 53 ng g 1 in addition the thg and mehg concentrations in the sediment pore water amended with sia fas 437 39 126 35 ng l 1 and 37 47 28 86 ng l 1 greatly increased compared to those amended with pia fas 117 08 41 40 ng l 1 and 16 66 7 04 ng l 1 these results indicated that fas extracted from sia can not only promote mehg production but also enhance the release of sediment bound hg mehg into pore water this induced a subsequent bioaccumulation effect as we found that in the cultivated water spinach leaf the thg and mehg concentrations 865 86 81 84 ng g 1 and 547 64 24 55 ng g 1 respectively with the addition of sia fas were 3 13 and 3 87 times higher than those with pia fas moreover the thg and mehg concentrations in the mudsnail muscles were 440 03 23 70 ng g 1 and 340 12 53 92 ng g 1 with the addition of sia fas which were 1 67 and 2 42 times higher than those amended with pia fas respectively these results suggested that fas derived from sia can more efficiently enhance the bioaccumulation of thg and mehg by macrophytes and zoobenthos 3 4 elevated fa activity in sediments in seasonally inundated areas the physical and chemical properties of the ch sediments are shown in table 1 the sediment ph values were close to neutrality and no significant difference was observed between sia and pia interestingly the oxidation reduction potential at sediment water interface in the pia 131 00 28 66 mv was lower than that in the sia 175 58 37 48 mv while sulfate concentration of sediment pore water in the pia 30 1 4 8 mg l 1 was higher than that in the sia 6 1 6 7 mg l 1 additionally the sediment organic matter som in the pia 33 94 7 43 was significantly higher than that in the sia 9 95 9 56 and the element compositions showed that the o c and h c values in the pia were approximately 3 and 6 times lower than those in the sia respectively which indicated an increasing humification level of sediments in the pia further analysis revealed that the dissolved om dom concentrations and the fa contents were obviously higher in sediments in the pia 299 85 128 66 mg l 1 and 10 26 3 02 than those in sediments in the sia 86 82 52 18 mg l 1 and 5 26 0 74 moreover we found from fig 6 a that the uv vis and fluorescence spectra of fas exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity with respect to the flooding conditions compared to sia fas in the sediments of the pia had more chromophoric groups and greater aromaticity as indicated by the higher chromophoric dom cdom 56 90 27 43 m 1 vs 29 63 11 02 m 1 fluorescent dom fdom 49 60 12 14 a u vs 28 32 8 21 a u and suva254 values 2 90 1 10 l mg c 1 m 1 vs 2 21 0 59 l mg c 1 m 1 additionally the significantly lower spectral slope ratio sr values of fas in the sia revealed more high molecular weight components than those in the pia 0 51 0 03 vs 0 69 0 15 table s4 moreover solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy showed that fas in the sia had obviously lower alkyl c fractions and alkyl c o alkyl c ratios than those in the pia whereas seasonally inundated fas had higher carboxyl c fractions than permanently inundated fas fig 6 b 4 discussion 4 1 effect of fulvic acids on mehg distributions in the caohai wetland in this study we found that the areas with water level fluctuations alternating water land ecosystem had high mehg production and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms this finding has also been obtained in some reservoirs or rivers such as the three gorges reservoir chongqing china and the cottage grove reservoir oregon america eckley et al 2017 yin et al 2020b our research in the ch wetland illustrated that an elevated ecological risk of hg in this special ecosystem is a widespread phenomenon some possible factors responsible for the elevated mehg levels in this area are that the annual water level fluctuation probably 1 increases the sulfate concentrations in sediments eckley et al 2017 eckley et al 2015 wang et al 2019 xiang et al 2018 2 enhances the release of sediment bound hg and increases the dom concentrations in pore water eckley et al 2017 3 increases the low molecular weight om levels wang et al 2019 and 4 elevates the microbial abundance and diversity including the potential hg methylators xiang et al 2018 in this study the permanent flooding of sediments provided many favorable conditions for hg methylation such as higher som and doc concentrations lower oxidation reduction potentials and moderate sulfate concentrations table 1 but we found a lower mehg concentrations in the pia than that in the sia this indicated that these factors are not the main factors controlling the mehg distribution in the ch sediments among all the hg forms in sediments only fa bound hg was significantly correlated with thg and mehg in the benthos fig 4 d moreover we further found that fa bound hg was the primary geochemical species in the sediments of the sia 50 while it only accounted for a small fraction in the pia 8 fig 4 a although the other bioavailable forms such as water soluble hg were more readily to be bioaccumulated and were higher in the sediment in the sia 3 54 2 26 than in the pia 1 03 0 39 they were in a low proportion and had no significant relationship with mehg levels in the sediments p 0 05 in addition we found that fas extracted from seasonally inundated sediments had significantly higher thg and mehg concentrations than those from permanently inundated sediments fig 4 b and had significantly positive relationships with mehg in the sediments fig 4 c these results indicated that fas may greatly contribute to mehg production and differentiate the mehg distribution spatially this finding was also supported by our further biological exposure experiments fig 5 then we provided a new explanation that elevated mehg production in the alternating water land ecosystem may be dependent on the presence of fas fas are relatively low molecular weight organic components with many functional ligands such as carboxylic and reduced sulfur groups that can effectively compete for sediment bound hg thereby enhancing the mobility and bioavailability of hg da silva and oliveira 2002 deonarine and hsu kim 2009 li et al 2019 yu et al 2004 researchers have found that fa bound hg is an important active hg source and can increase hg bioaccumulation in plants and aquatic organisms french et al 2014 yu et al 2004 xu et al 2017 additionally fas are rich in available carbon forms which can increase mehg synthesis by fueling hg methylating microbes or facilitating transmembrane transportation of hg chiasson gould et al 2014 4 2 fulvic acid properties determine the production and bioaccumulation of mehg our abovementioned results showed that fas played an important role in hg methylation and bioaccumulation in the ch wetland to understand how fas affect the methylation and bioaccumulation of hg we obtained the content and structural information of fas in the ch sediments table 1 fig 6 our results showed that the fractions of extracted fas in the sediments of the pia were significantly higher than those in the sia table 1 which was contradictory with the distribution of mehg fig 2 and fa bound hg fig 4 in sediments this implied that there are other factors such as the molecular compositions of fas mediating the migration and transformation of hg in sediments which were verified as follows first the hg concentrations of fas extracted from the sediments in the sia were obviously higher than those extracted from pia fig 4 b which indicated that sia fas have an elevated capacity to bind more hg second sediment fas in the pia exhibited higher aromaticity than sia fas as indicated by the spectral properties of fas fig 6 a in fact as revealed by a previous study microorganisms hardly access aromatic components due to their possible toxicity or hydrophobicity park et al 2011 which may lead to these formed fa hg complexes being less available by hg methylating microbes additionally as revealed by the significantly lower sr values fig 6 a fas in the sia have relatively higher molecular weight components than those in the pia the increase in the molecular weight of fas tends to compete for more sediment bound hg to form liable fa hg complexes which are readily to be available by hg methylating microbes or aquatic organisms aiken et al 2011 chiasson gould et al 2014 french et al 2014 li et al 2019 third solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy showed that the fas extracted from two typical sediments had discrepant abundances of functional groups fig 6 b the sediment fas in the sia had obviously lower alkyl c fractions and alkyl c o alkyl c ratios than those in the pia indicating that sediment fas in the sia have less alkylation levels with higher bioavailability for hg methylating microbes li et al 2019 yi et al 2019 moreover sediment fas in the sia may chelate more hg to increase the hg mobility as indicated by their higher carboxyl c groups zhang et al 2009 chai et al 2013 fig 6 b which is consistent with the result of higher hg concentrations in the extracted fas from sia fig 4 b overall our chemical and spectral analyze revealed that fas in seasonally inundated sediments have elevated bioavailability increased liable ligands and higher molecular weights which greatly increase mehg production in sediments and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms in other words owing to the continual accumulation of plant derived organic matter and increase in the humification levels fas in the permanently inundated sediments tended to have relatively stable characters this partially favored the retention of hg but did not increase its bioavailability then we can speculate that environmental factors such as flooding conditions and terrestrial disturbances largely shape the sources and properties of fas to surprisingly elevate mehg production in the sia which enhances the health risk of aquatic organisms interestingly a potential protective effect may occur in the permanently inundated areas but the mechanisms of stabilizing fas affecting the fate of hg need to be further investigated in future work 5 conclusions our field and simulated results in a heavy metal polluted plateau wetland highlight that fulvic acid is an important organic component regulating the fate of hg in sediment organism systems the increase in the fulvic acid activities such as the bioavailability and competing capacity for hg in the seasonally inundated areas greatly elevate the mehg production in sediments and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms however the relatively inert fulvic acid in the permanently inundated sediments tends to favor hg retention but not its bioavailability and form a potential protective effect for aquatic organisms overall our results presented here provide an updated understanding that high mehg exposure risks in some water level fluctuating areas are more related to the fulvic acid properties in sediments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16594,fulvic acids fas are known to regulate the fate of mercury hg in sediments but the key effects of their properties are still unclear in this study field investigations and simulation experiments were conducted in a heavy metal polluted wetland to identify fa characteristics and their association with the production and bioaccumulation of methylmercury mehg compared to permanently inundated areas pia seasonally inundated areas sias had lower total hg levels in sediments whereas higher mehg levels in sediments 0 20 0 09 ng g 1 vs 0 55 0 31 ng g 1 and benthos 0 25 0 22 ng g 1 vs 1 62 1 78 ng g 1 meanwhile the thg and mehg concentrations in the same macrophyte species between pia and sia also followed a similar rule with benthos fa bound hg in the sediment was significantly correlated with mehg in the sediment p 0 01 as well as thg and mehg in benthos p 0 05 indicating that fas have the capacity to promote mehg production and bioaccumulation moreover the fas in the sediments of the sia had lower fractions and alkyl c o alkyl c ratios but higher molecular weights and thg mehg concentrations than those in the pia indicating that fas in sia have increased bioavailability and enhanced competition for hg favoring significantly elevated fa bound hg levels biological exposure testing further demonstrated that fas extracted from sia had a greater ability to increase the production and bioaccumulation of mehg than those extracted from pia overall these results highlight that the molecular composition and sources of fas excluding their concentrations are one of important factors responsible for the obvious spatial heterogeneity of mehg in sediments and aquatic organisms in the wetland keywords plateau wetland fulvic acid properties mercury bioavailability 1 introduction methylmercury mehg the methylated product of mercury hg with a high accumulation capacity in food webs tends to be synthesized by microbes in aquatic sediments such as wetlands ullrich et al 2001 lehnherr et al 2012 mehg production largely depends on microbial activities and hg bioavailability which are synchronously affected by many environmental factors such as eh ph organic matter om sulfide and mineral activity ma et al 2019 in particular om especially its dissolved form seems to play more important roles by fueling hg methylating bacteria while also binding hg to regulate its bioavailability moreau et al 2015 however om consisted of a series of high to low molecular weight components frequently exhibits the heterogeneous geochemical and or biochemical behaviors related to hg methylation in sediments he et al 2019 liu et al 2011 previous studies reported that apart from om contents its sources and compositions were more important in determining the fate of hg in the environment bravo et al 2017 graham et al 2013 fulvic acids fas are one of the main om components with relatively low molecular weight high solubility and high activity zhang et al 2009 chiasson gould et al 2014 lu et al 2020 and may play a key role in regulating the fate of hg however to our knowledge there are limited studies providing insightful understandings about the effects of fas on the environmental behavior of hg in these studies fas were observed to promote the methylation and bioaccumulation of hg in soil yu et al 2004 xu et al 2017 chang et al 2021 and fa bound hg could be an important source of hg in water and fish lindqvist et al 1991 li et al 2019 nevertheless a study also showed that the addition of fas could inhibit the absorption of hg in lettuce lactuca sativa var angustana irish li 2001 we speculated that the interaction between fas and hg may be determined by multiple factors such as fa sources or structures however the effects of fas derived from different sources or having different structural characteristics on the hg methylation and bioaccumulation of hg are still unclear in recent years elevated mehg production in the water level fluctuating zone of reservoirs has drawn much attention eckley et al 2017 eckley et al 2015 yin et al 2020a this was partially ascribed to the enhanced hg bioavailability and microbial activity related to om breakdown driven by water level pulses eckley et al 2017 xiang et al 2018 yin et al 2018 however to date the key roles of fas in mehg production in this special area have not been well explored by achieving this we may update our understandings of the elevated production and biological exposure risk of mehg observed in the water level fluctuating zone the caohai ch wetland is located within a national nature protection area in the yunnan guizhou plateau china and is famous for its great abundance of aquatic plants this was found to favor the high om levels yang et al 2017 in recent years the ch wetland has been widely concerned mostly due to its serious heavy metal pollution by artisanal zinc smelting activities bi et al 2007 feng et al 2004 deposited heavy metals including hg accumulate up to a high level in sediments for example pb 235 40 mg kg 1 cd 68 98 mg kg 1 and hg 0 51 mg kg 1 can reach up to 6 69 104 52 and 4 64 times higher than the soil background values in guizhou province respectively wei et al 1991 thus these elevated toxic metals may pose a substantial threat to aquatic organisms sun et al 2020 yin et al 2020b other worthy of concerns is that the ch wetland forms an obvious water level fluctuating zone 40 of the highest water area with significantly lower om concentrations and humification levels than permanently inundated zones yin et al 2020a we then speculate that variations in om components such as fas may largely affect the production and bioaccumulation of mehg however until now little information can be available from previous studies the main objectives of this study are to associate the relationships between fa properties and mehg production as well as its bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms to achieve this field investigations were first conducted to build the relationship between fas and mehg production bioaccumulation by 1 measuring the total hg and mehg concentrations in sediments and aquatic organisms 2 evaluating the geochemical speciation of hg in sediments and 3 describing fa properties in sediments such as their uv vis absorption fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance 13c nmr spectra after that fa amended biological exposure experiments were performed to further confirm the potential roles of fas in the production and bioaccumulation of mehg 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in a national nature reserve in weining county guizhou province 26 45 27 00 n 104 10 104 25 e fig 1 the ch wetland is a typical plateau wetland ecosystem with an altitude of 2170 m above sea level and covers an area of 46 5 km2 it is the largest natural plateau freshwater lake in guizhou province and famous as the migratory birds habitat in southwest china the ch watershed features a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of approximately 951 mm and an annual mean temperature of 10 6 c bi et al 2007 it hosts a wide variety of aquatic plant and animal species it should be noted that the watershed of this wetland includes a historical zinc smelting site hezhang county approximately 15 km away which operated from the 17th century to 2004 fig 1 a large amount of slag and waste gas released from mining and smelting has the potential to become the pollution source of heavy metals in the ch wetland through atmospheric deposition and surface runoff feng et al 2004 2 2 field samplings in this study nine and eight sampling sites were selected in permanently inundated areas pia and seasonally inundated areas sia with water levels in wet season of 2 3 m and 0 5 m respectively in august 2014 at each site four sediment cores were collected using a gravity sediment corer featuring a polymethylmethacrylate tube 5 0 cm inner diameter id 60 cm length l surficial sediments 0 5 cm were respectively sliced from these cores with plastic blade in a bio bag filled with nitrogen afterwards the surficial sediment samples sliced from three cores were mixed in a centrifuge tube to form one sample and the fourth surficial sediment sample was transferred into other centrifuge tube which were then transported to laboratory at 4 c in the laboratory mixed sediment samples were freeze dried at 60 c and ground through a 0 15 mm mesh prior to determining the concentrations and geochemical fractions of hg the other sediment sample was centrifuged to collect pore water because of the spatial heterogeneity of plants benthos some of them can distribute in multiple sampling sites while others can only be found in few sites in each sediment sampling site dominant macrophytes in august 2014 and benthos represented by mudsnails cipangopaludina cathayensis in august 2014 january 2015 and may 2015 wherever they existed were manually collected with the sample size of 3 8 respectively a cleaning procedure was followed in these sampling events the detailed sample information can be accessed in the tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information si the aboveground parts of same macrophytes collected from each site were mixed into one sample and it was then washed with ultrapure water the mudsnails were collected from cages fixed at the sediment water interface in pia while in sia they were sampled from shallow water by hand they were firstly washed with ultrapure water and muscle tissues were collected by an anatomical method the muscle samples of mudsnails from each sampling site were then mixed into one sample after that all those biological samples were freeze dried at 60 c and ground into powder prior to determination of the thg and mehg concentrations 2 3 extraction and purification of fulvic acids in sediments the extraction and purification of sediment fas were performed using a method developed by the international humic substances society ihss calderoni and schnitzer 1984 gu et al 2001 and a detailed description can be found in the si 2 4 biological mercury exposure experiment amended with fas to understand the effects of extracted fas on hg bioavailability in the study area artificial sediments amended with fas were used to perform biological hg exposure experiment the method used to prepare artificial sediments including quartz sand calcium carbonate kaolinite iron oxide and manganese oxides with a mass ratio of 53 30 10 4 1 has been reported by many studies chen et al 1989 zhong and wang 2008 yin et al 2020b here 5 kg of prepared artificial sediments dry weight were respectively weighed into two aquariums 45 cm 30 cm 28 cm the hg ⅱ solutions hgcl2 2 mg l 1 were respectively added to form a total hg concentration of 2 0 mg kg 1 in the artificial sediments which were then aged for 15 days the thg concentrations in the hg amended artificial sediments were re measured after aged for 15 days to find the similar values 2 25 mg kg 1 vs 2 34 mg kg 1 after that fas extracted from the permanently and seasonally inundated sediments were respectively added in hg amended artificial sediments with a proportion of 2 w w each treatment was conducted in triplicate mudsnails and water spinach ipomoea aquatica used in the simulation experiments were purchased from a market with lower hg concentrations 30 and 20 ng g 1 dry weight respectively then the mudsnails n 20 and water spinach plants no leaves n 3 with similar appearances and weights were placed or cultivated on the surficial sediment in every aquarium and irrigated with hg free water then the aquariums were placed in a greenhouse at a temperature of 20 26 c and kept the overlying water at 5 cm throughout the incubation period the mudsnails were fed twice a week with swamp morning glory 10 of the mudsnail s weight which had hg concentrations lower than 20 ng g 1 after one month the mudsnails n 8 10 and new leaves of the water spinach n 16 20 were collected from each aquarium and a preprocessed method similar with field work was conducted prior to analysis of hg concentrations at the same time three subsamples were collected from the surficial sediment 0 5 cm by a plastic spoon and mixed into one sample which was then divided into two parts 1 one was freeze dried 60 c and ground for measuring hg concentrations 2 the other was used to collect pore water via centrifugation and filtration with a 0 45 μm pvdf membrane and stored at 4 c with 0 5 hcl 2 5 chemical and spectral analysis total hg concentrations in pore water were determined using a method reported by yan et al 2003 briefly all hg forms in the water samples were oxidized with brcl reduced by sncl2 purged by nitrogen collected onto a gold trap and then quantified by cold vapor atomic fluorescence cvafs model iii brooksrand usa the mehg concentrations in the water samples were measured following the pre distillation ethylation nitrogen purging and tenax capture combined with gas chromatography gc cvafs as reported by jiang et al 2018 for sediment thg analysis approximately 0 2 g of sample was digested with freshly prepared aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 v v in a water bath at 95 c li et al 2005 an aliquot of the digested solution was then pretreated following the method similar to that of pore water to measure the thg concentrations the mehg concentrations in sediment were measured following a procedure with hno3 cuso4 leaching ch2cl2 extraction ethylation tenax capture isothermal gc separation and cvafs detection he et al 2004 the thg and mehg concentrations in the organisms were determined using methods previously described by yan et al 2005 and liang et al 1996 respectively briefly biological samples were pretreated by acid digestion hno3 h2so4 7 3 v v brcl oxidation sncl2 reduction and gold trap collection and their thg concentrations were quantified by cvafs for mehg analysis the biological samples were subjected to koh methanol 25 v v digestion ch2cl2 extraction aqueous ethylation tenax trap collection and gc cvafs detection the hg concentrations in all aquatic organisms are expressed by dry weight unless otherwise stated geochemical fractions of hg in the sediment were obtained with a tessier sequential chemical extraction procedure with slight modification bloom et al 2003 that is om bound hg is divided into fulvic acid and humic acid bound fractions preston et al 1994 xu et al 2019 then we separated six geochemical forms i e the water soluble fraction hg w gastric acid soluble fraction hg g fulvic acid bound fraction hg f humic acid bound fraction hg h strongly complex fraction hg c and sulfide bound fraction hg s detailed information can be found in the tables s3 in the si cross polarization and magic angle spinning techniques cpmas were used to obtain the solid state 13c nmr spectra of fas the nmr was an agilent 600 m spectrometer agilent magnetic field strength of 14 1 t usa and approximately 200 mg of sample was filled into a 4 mm zirconium rotor with a kel fcap the spectral frequency was 75 47 mhz the spinning rate was 4 khz the pulse width was 2 60 μs and the data acquisition time was 0 3 s the elemental compositions of sediments were measured using x ray fluorescence spectroscopy zsx primus iv rigaku corporation japan for spectral analysis of fas uv vis and fluorescence spectra were obtained in a 10 mm quartz cuvette using an aqualog horiba japan absorption fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp at 20 c detailed information can be found in the tables s4 in the si 2 6 quality assurance and quality control quality assurance and quality control for the thg and mehg measurements were conducted using duplicates matrix spikes and or standard reference materials srms for thg gsb 26 celery gss 5 soil and tort 3 lobster hepatopancreas were used as srms for mehg erm cc580 estuarine sediment and tort 3 lobster hepatopancreas were used as srms the thg and mehg recoveries for the srms and matrix spikes were 85 115 n 20 in the measurement of hg speciation in sediments the sum of all hg speciation accounted for 83 114 n 12 of the directly measured thg concentrations the duplicates were taken regularly throughout the sample analysis 10 of samples and the relative standard deviations rsds of thg and mehg concentrations in all duplicate samples were 15 3 results 3 1 elevated mehg levels in sediments and aquatic organisms in seasonally inundated areas the thg and mehg concentrations of the ch sediments ranged from 48 60 236 70 ng g 1 and 0 06 1 10 ng g 1 respectively according to the threshold effect level tel smith et al 1996 24 of the sediment samples which were mainly from the pia exceeded the tel values of thg tables s5 si this result indicated that a potential ecological risk in the ch ecosystem may occur the thg concentrations in the seasonally inundated sediments 91 29 48 61 ng g 1 were significantly lower than those in the permanently inundated sediments 154 42 54 91 ng g 1 p 0 05 fig 2 a however the mehg concentrations and the percentage of thg as mehg mehg in the sia 0 55 ng g 1 and 0 73 respectively were approximately 3 and 5 fold higher than those in the pia 0 20 ng g 1 and 0 14 respectively p 0 05 fig 2 b c which was exactly inverse with the law that thg followed the thg and mehg concentrations in the collected macrophytes were 11 11 3 92 ng g 1 and 0 36 0 53 ng g 1 respectively in comparison lower thg 9 68 11 19 ng g 1 but elevated mehg levels 0 66 0 87 ng g 1 were found in the mudsnails this indicated that the benthic animals had a relatively higher accumulation potential of mehg than the macrophytes both thg and mehg concentrations in the muscles of mudsnails collected from sia 15 48 13 33 ng g 1 and 1 62 1 78 ng g 1 were significantly higher than those in the pia 3 87 3 31 ng g 1 and 0 25 0 22 ng g 1 p 0 05 fig 3 a b moreover the thg and mehg concentrations in the same macrophyte between the sia and pia were compared and the similar results were still observed fig 3 a b and table s1 these results were in line with the elevated mehg levels in the sediments of the sia suggesting that a higher hg exposure risk occurs in the ecosystems experiencing seasonal inundation 3 2 elevated fulvic acid bound hg levels in seasonally inundated areas the geochemical fractions of hg in sediment samples collected from the sia and pia were quantified the results showed that the water soluble hg w gastric acid soluble hg g fulvic acid bound hg f humic acid bound hg h strongly complexing hg c and sulfide bound hg s fractions contributed 1 68 1 85 0 81 0 41 33 44 25 35 16 83 7 04 39 51 29 04 and 7 73 6 89 of the measured thg respectively this indicated that hg in sediments in the ch wetland was mostly in organic i e fulvic acid and humic acid and strongly complexing phases i e hg0 hg bound to amorphous organo sulfur hg ag amalgams or crystalline fe mn oxide phases with respect to different flooding conditions the geochemical fractions of hg showed great spatial heterogeneity fig 4 a it should be highlighted that the fractions of fa bound hg in seasonally inundated sediments could account for 51 90 14 80 of the measured thg which was significantly higher than that in permanently inundated sediments 7 59 2 63 p 0 01 indicating that seasonally inundated sediment tends to accumulate more hg in an fa bound state in contrast permanently inundated sediments had a significantly higher p 0 01 strongly complexing hg fraction than seasonally inundated sediments 69 67 6 61 vs 17 96 14 74 indicating that the permanently inundated sediment tends to accumulate more inert hg speciation similar to the distribution of fa bound hg speciation in the sediments the thg and mehg concentrations in the fas extracted from seasonally inundated sediments were also significantly higher than those from permanently inundated areas fig 4 b correlation analysis was performed to show that thg mehg in the extracted fas had a significant positive relationship with mehg concentrations in the sediments fig 4 c moreover fa bound hg was significantly correlated with mehg concentrations in the sediments as well as thg and mehg in the mudsnails fig 4 d whereas the bioavailable fractions such as hg w and hg g did not show any significant correlation with mehg concentrations in the sediments p 0 05 3 3 effect of fa amendment on the bioaccumulation of mercury the correlations between fa related hg and hg concentrations in aquatic organisms and mehg in sediments indicated that fas may play an important role in the methylation and bioavailability of hg in the ch wetland to support this hypothesis a biological exposure experiment was carried out by adding with fas extracted from seasonally inundated sediments sia fas and permanently inundated sediments pia fas as shown in fig 5 the artificial sediments amended with sia fas resulted in significantly higher mehg concentrations 5 37 1 83 ng g 1 than those amended with pia fas 1 23 0 53 ng g 1 in addition the thg and mehg concentrations in the sediment pore water amended with sia fas 437 39 126 35 ng l 1 and 37 47 28 86 ng l 1 greatly increased compared to those amended with pia fas 117 08 41 40 ng l 1 and 16 66 7 04 ng l 1 these results indicated that fas extracted from sia can not only promote mehg production but also enhance the release of sediment bound hg mehg into pore water this induced a subsequent bioaccumulation effect as we found that in the cultivated water spinach leaf the thg and mehg concentrations 865 86 81 84 ng g 1 and 547 64 24 55 ng g 1 respectively with the addition of sia fas were 3 13 and 3 87 times higher than those with pia fas moreover the thg and mehg concentrations in the mudsnail muscles were 440 03 23 70 ng g 1 and 340 12 53 92 ng g 1 with the addition of sia fas which were 1 67 and 2 42 times higher than those amended with pia fas respectively these results suggested that fas derived from sia can more efficiently enhance the bioaccumulation of thg and mehg by macrophytes and zoobenthos 3 4 elevated fa activity in sediments in seasonally inundated areas the physical and chemical properties of the ch sediments are shown in table 1 the sediment ph values were close to neutrality and no significant difference was observed between sia and pia interestingly the oxidation reduction potential at sediment water interface in the pia 131 00 28 66 mv was lower than that in the sia 175 58 37 48 mv while sulfate concentration of sediment pore water in the pia 30 1 4 8 mg l 1 was higher than that in the sia 6 1 6 7 mg l 1 additionally the sediment organic matter som in the pia 33 94 7 43 was significantly higher than that in the sia 9 95 9 56 and the element compositions showed that the o c and h c values in the pia were approximately 3 and 6 times lower than those in the sia respectively which indicated an increasing humification level of sediments in the pia further analysis revealed that the dissolved om dom concentrations and the fa contents were obviously higher in sediments in the pia 299 85 128 66 mg l 1 and 10 26 3 02 than those in sediments in the sia 86 82 52 18 mg l 1 and 5 26 0 74 moreover we found from fig 6 a that the uv vis and fluorescence spectra of fas exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity with respect to the flooding conditions compared to sia fas in the sediments of the pia had more chromophoric groups and greater aromaticity as indicated by the higher chromophoric dom cdom 56 90 27 43 m 1 vs 29 63 11 02 m 1 fluorescent dom fdom 49 60 12 14 a u vs 28 32 8 21 a u and suva254 values 2 90 1 10 l mg c 1 m 1 vs 2 21 0 59 l mg c 1 m 1 additionally the significantly lower spectral slope ratio sr values of fas in the sia revealed more high molecular weight components than those in the pia 0 51 0 03 vs 0 69 0 15 table s4 moreover solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy showed that fas in the sia had obviously lower alkyl c fractions and alkyl c o alkyl c ratios than those in the pia whereas seasonally inundated fas had higher carboxyl c fractions than permanently inundated fas fig 6 b 4 discussion 4 1 effect of fulvic acids on mehg distributions in the caohai wetland in this study we found that the areas with water level fluctuations alternating water land ecosystem had high mehg production and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms this finding has also been obtained in some reservoirs or rivers such as the three gorges reservoir chongqing china and the cottage grove reservoir oregon america eckley et al 2017 yin et al 2020b our research in the ch wetland illustrated that an elevated ecological risk of hg in this special ecosystem is a widespread phenomenon some possible factors responsible for the elevated mehg levels in this area are that the annual water level fluctuation probably 1 increases the sulfate concentrations in sediments eckley et al 2017 eckley et al 2015 wang et al 2019 xiang et al 2018 2 enhances the release of sediment bound hg and increases the dom concentrations in pore water eckley et al 2017 3 increases the low molecular weight om levels wang et al 2019 and 4 elevates the microbial abundance and diversity including the potential hg methylators xiang et al 2018 in this study the permanent flooding of sediments provided many favorable conditions for hg methylation such as higher som and doc concentrations lower oxidation reduction potentials and moderate sulfate concentrations table 1 but we found a lower mehg concentrations in the pia than that in the sia this indicated that these factors are not the main factors controlling the mehg distribution in the ch sediments among all the hg forms in sediments only fa bound hg was significantly correlated with thg and mehg in the benthos fig 4 d moreover we further found that fa bound hg was the primary geochemical species in the sediments of the sia 50 while it only accounted for a small fraction in the pia 8 fig 4 a although the other bioavailable forms such as water soluble hg were more readily to be bioaccumulated and were higher in the sediment in the sia 3 54 2 26 than in the pia 1 03 0 39 they were in a low proportion and had no significant relationship with mehg levels in the sediments p 0 05 in addition we found that fas extracted from seasonally inundated sediments had significantly higher thg and mehg concentrations than those from permanently inundated sediments fig 4 b and had significantly positive relationships with mehg in the sediments fig 4 c these results indicated that fas may greatly contribute to mehg production and differentiate the mehg distribution spatially this finding was also supported by our further biological exposure experiments fig 5 then we provided a new explanation that elevated mehg production in the alternating water land ecosystem may be dependent on the presence of fas fas are relatively low molecular weight organic components with many functional ligands such as carboxylic and reduced sulfur groups that can effectively compete for sediment bound hg thereby enhancing the mobility and bioavailability of hg da silva and oliveira 2002 deonarine and hsu kim 2009 li et al 2019 yu et al 2004 researchers have found that fa bound hg is an important active hg source and can increase hg bioaccumulation in plants and aquatic organisms french et al 2014 yu et al 2004 xu et al 2017 additionally fas are rich in available carbon forms which can increase mehg synthesis by fueling hg methylating microbes or facilitating transmembrane transportation of hg chiasson gould et al 2014 4 2 fulvic acid properties determine the production and bioaccumulation of mehg our abovementioned results showed that fas played an important role in hg methylation and bioaccumulation in the ch wetland to understand how fas affect the methylation and bioaccumulation of hg we obtained the content and structural information of fas in the ch sediments table 1 fig 6 our results showed that the fractions of extracted fas in the sediments of the pia were significantly higher than those in the sia table 1 which was contradictory with the distribution of mehg fig 2 and fa bound hg fig 4 in sediments this implied that there are other factors such as the molecular compositions of fas mediating the migration and transformation of hg in sediments which were verified as follows first the hg concentrations of fas extracted from the sediments in the sia were obviously higher than those extracted from pia fig 4 b which indicated that sia fas have an elevated capacity to bind more hg second sediment fas in the pia exhibited higher aromaticity than sia fas as indicated by the spectral properties of fas fig 6 a in fact as revealed by a previous study microorganisms hardly access aromatic components due to their possible toxicity or hydrophobicity park et al 2011 which may lead to these formed fa hg complexes being less available by hg methylating microbes additionally as revealed by the significantly lower sr values fig 6 a fas in the sia have relatively higher molecular weight components than those in the pia the increase in the molecular weight of fas tends to compete for more sediment bound hg to form liable fa hg complexes which are readily to be available by hg methylating microbes or aquatic organisms aiken et al 2011 chiasson gould et al 2014 french et al 2014 li et al 2019 third solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy showed that the fas extracted from two typical sediments had discrepant abundances of functional groups fig 6 b the sediment fas in the sia had obviously lower alkyl c fractions and alkyl c o alkyl c ratios than those in the pia indicating that sediment fas in the sia have less alkylation levels with higher bioavailability for hg methylating microbes li et al 2019 yi et al 2019 moreover sediment fas in the sia may chelate more hg to increase the hg mobility as indicated by their higher carboxyl c groups zhang et al 2009 chai et al 2013 fig 6 b which is consistent with the result of higher hg concentrations in the extracted fas from sia fig 4 b overall our chemical and spectral analyze revealed that fas in seasonally inundated sediments have elevated bioavailability increased liable ligands and higher molecular weights which greatly increase mehg production in sediments and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms in other words owing to the continual accumulation of plant derived organic matter and increase in the humification levels fas in the permanently inundated sediments tended to have relatively stable characters this partially favored the retention of hg but did not increase its bioavailability then we can speculate that environmental factors such as flooding conditions and terrestrial disturbances largely shape the sources and properties of fas to surprisingly elevate mehg production in the sia which enhances the health risk of aquatic organisms interestingly a potential protective effect may occur in the permanently inundated areas but the mechanisms of stabilizing fas affecting the fate of hg need to be further investigated in future work 5 conclusions our field and simulated results in a heavy metal polluted plateau wetland highlight that fulvic acid is an important organic component regulating the fate of hg in sediment organism systems the increase in the fulvic acid activities such as the bioavailability and competing capacity for hg in the seasonally inundated areas greatly elevate the mehg production in sediments and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms however the relatively inert fulvic acid in the permanently inundated sediments tends to favor hg retention but not its bioavailability and form a potential protective effect for aquatic organisms overall our results presented here provide an updated understanding that high mehg exposure risks in some water level fluctuating areas are more related to the fulvic acid properties in sediments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
