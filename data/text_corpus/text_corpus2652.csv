13260,this study investigates the suitability of a sequencing batch reactor sbr for treating the liquor htcl derived from hydrothermal carbonization htc of sewage sludge in addition to the influent municipal wastewater the sbr was fed for 80 days with an increasing mixing ratio htcl municipal wastewater htcl was used as external carbon source to enhance the denitrification process in the water line of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp the feeding of the htcl caused an overloading in the cod and tkn concentration of the biological treatment equal to respectively 25 and 8 period ii 50 and 16 period iii and 100 and 32 period iv results revealed that good efficiencies of cod removal were obtained during the entire experimental test accounting up to 91 in period iv moreover the removal of tn was improved increasing from 28 in the reference period period i where no htcl was fed to 33 47 and 64 respectively in period ii iii and iv thus an improvement in the denitrification process was obtained when htcl was fed to the biological reactor in addition to the influent wastewater the implementation of the sbr system was supported by nitrate uptake rate nur tests and respirometric assays to evaluate the nitrate removal after the addition of htcl and the fraction of readily biodegradable cod rbcod and soluble biodegradable cod scodbio on the total cod of the htcl graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment hydrothermal carbonization htc liquor denitrification process carbon source 1 introduction biological denitrification a process where heterotrophic bacteria reduce nitrites and nitrates to nitrogen in anoxic conditions is widely applied in nitrogen removal for municipal and industrial wastewater 22 30 this process is economically convenient as compared to physicochemical treatment processes nevertheless the rate and extension of the denitrification depend mainly on the final carbon to nitrogen ratio in the biological reactor 7 this means that biological denitrification needs organic carbon source to support heterotrophic denitrifiers bacteria activities 6 wastewaters often lack in organic matter and this carbon shortage can block the denitrification process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps therefore in many wwtps carbon sources such as ethanol methanol and acetate are added as external carbon supply in order to achieve an efficient denitrification performance and meet the regulatory limits for the discharge 21 32 39 supplementing carbon guarantees excellent nitrogen removal but increases the operating cost of wastewater treatment waste activated sludge produced in wwtps has a great amount of organic substances that can be used as inexpensive carbon source for enhancing biological denitrification 36 however sludge needs a solubilization step prior to its possible use as a carbon source in the view of a resource recovery from waste recently many researchers have studied sludge pre treatment methods for carbon source recovery such as wet oxidation 31 thermal hydrolysis 4 17 36 fermentation 39 alkali fermentation 20 and mechanical disintegration 19 as far as we know there are no studies reporting the application of hydrothermal carbonization liquor htcl as external carbon supplements to improve biological denitrification hydrothermal carbonization htc is a process occurring in liquid water without any oxygen addition by which under temperatures in the range 180 280 c for a duration from few minutes up to several hours wet biomasses are converted to a solid carbonaceous fraction called hydrochar a liquid fraction called htcl and a minor gas fraction 13 in wastewater treatment htc has been recognized as a promising post treatment of the anaerobic digestion that can strongly increase sludge dewaterability thus reducing the amount of sludge to be disposed of 25 in addition htc can also improve biogas production by cycling back to the anaerobic digester the htcl and possibly a portion of the hydrochar moreover the derived hydrochar can be used as soil improver adsorbent for wastewater remediation resource for phosphorous recovery or if allowed fuel for thermal energy production in addition the derived htcl contains a high load of organic compounds from 10 to 64 g cod l 1 that solubilize during the htc process 25 wirth et al 35 reported that htcl could contain up to 15 of the initial carbon present in the sewage sludge mainly as acetic acid that can be used as a readily biodegradable substrate by heterotrophic denitrifiers bacteria moreover nyktari et al 29 reported that volatile fatty acids vfas in the htcl represent from 9 8 up to 30 of the total organic carbon depending on the htc operating conditions and among them the highest contribution is given by acetic acid due to this high organic content several research groups have investigated the valorization of the htcl through the anaerobic digestion ad process 1 13 28 35 however a portion of the htcl can be also cycled back to the main biological reactor of a wwtp supplementing external carbon source and thus contributing to enhance the biological denitrification process in this view the htc process can be used both to i enhance the biogas production in the anaerobic digester by cycling back to it the hydrochar and a portion of the htcl 13 and ii to enhance the biological denitrification process by cycling back a portion or in some cases the whole htcl in the mainstream reactor of the wwtp water line this scenario reported in fig 1 promotes the containments of wwtp operating costs because no external carbon substrate is needed to guarantee a high performance denitrification process thus the present study focuses on the htcl treatment in the biological compartment of a wwtp water line the main aim is to provide a potential new approach of htcl treatment and its possible use recovery as carbon source in this study htcl derived from htc of a mixture of digested sludges a portion taken upstream of the centrifuge a portion downstream thereof was used as carbon source in a sequencing batch reactor sbr the denitrification performance at different loading rate was investigated furthermore a detailed characterization of the htcl was performed using respirometric assay to evaluate the readily biodegradable cod rbcod and the soluble biodegradable cod scodbio 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrothermal carbonization sludge exiting the anaerobic digester digestate dry matter content 1 9 0 1 and the same digestate after the addition of polyelectrolyte and the passage in centrifuge dewatered sludge dry matter content 23 3 0 4 from the local municipal wwtp of trento italy were used in this study based on the solid content of each digestate and dewatered sludges were mixed to obtain a mixed feedstock with a dry biomass to water ratio b w equal to 0 1 and a dry matter content of about 10 this value was chosen to simulate the implementation in full scale applications where a mixed sludge with a dry matter content equal to 10 can be easily pumped to the htc reactor 11 an htc experimental system designed and constructed at the university of trento was used for this study details about the experimental setup are reported in merzari et al 26 the mixed sludge was treated in the htc reactor at an operating temperature of 190 c for 1 h reaction time after that period and after cooling the reactor the hydrothermally treated sludge was filtered with a qualitative paper filter to separate the htc liquor from the hydrochar the recovered htc liquor was collected and then kept at 24 c for further usage the yield of hydrochar was calculated using the following equation 1 y hydrochar w 1 w 0 100 where w0 is the dry weight of the mixed feedstock before the htc treatment and w1 is the dry weight of the derived hydrochar the gas yield was computed following eq 2 through the ideal gas law assuming only co2 as the gaseous product using a water displacement cylinder 14 2 y gas w co 2 w 0 100 where wco2 is the weight of co2 the liquid yield was calculated as the complement to 100 of the solid and gas yields eqs 1 and 2 were used to compute the amount of htcl produced and recycled back to the biological denitrification compartment the basic idea was to make a quantitative simulation of what could be the flows involved at the real plant level when adopting the innovative process scheme proposed in this research 2 2 nitrate uptake rate nur tests the nitrate uptake rate nur test was performed to evaluate the microbial activity of the biomass after the addition of the htc liquor that can be used by bacteria as external carbon source for the denitrification process batch tests were performed using a 2 l reactor where 1 2 l of activated sludge tank of trento wwtp tss 4 1 1 5 g tss l 1 italy was used as inoculum and put in anoxic conditions a solution of 1 g l 1 of nitrate was used to obtain a no3 n concentration inside the batch reactor at least equal to 30 mg no3 n l 1 at the beginning of the test a solution of known concentration of cod as htcl or sodium acetate was injected mixing conditions were ensured by using a magnetic stirrer samples were taken every 20 min filtered with a 0 45 μm paper filter and then used for further analysis the nur test allowed to evaluate the denitrification rate vn expressed as mg n g 1 tss h 1 as the slope of the linear regression of the nitrate concentration versus time 2 3 sbr lab scale system given the results of the nur test a laboratory scale system consisting of an alternate aerobic and anoxic sbr was designed and implemented to simulate the water line of trento wwtp the sbr was a cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 2 l diameter and height were 12 0 and 21 0 cm respectively having a hydraulic retention time hrt equal to 0 75 day disc diffusers were placed for the aeration at the bottom of the sbr a mechanical stirrer was used to mix the activated sludge the sbr had eight cycles a day and each cycle 3 h consisted of anoxic feeding 44 min aeration 27 min anoxic feeding 44 min aeration 27 min settling 23 min and supernatant extraction 15 min once a day at the end of the supernatant extraction phase excess sludge was manually extracted to keep constant the tss concentration in the sbr concentrations of dissolved oxygen do during the aeration phases were monitored by using a do probe oxi 340i and maintained between 1 and 3 mg l 1 the lab system was equipped with two peristaltic pumps to allow the feeding and the discharge of the wastewater the experimental plant was monitored with chemical analysis twice a week using ph do and temperature as online parameters ph and temperature were left free to vary and their average values were respectively 7 5 0 2 and 20 3 c the activated sludge of the sbr used as inoculum was obtained from the oxidation treatment unit of a local municipal wwtp trento italy the sbr inoculum had the following characteristics total chemical oxygen demand tcod 3450 270 mg cod l 1 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 101 51 mg tkn l 1 total suspended solids tss 4 1 0 5 g tss l 1 the ratio between volatile suspended solids and total suspended solids vss tss 0 8 the sbr was fed with the effluent of the primary sedimentation tank of the same wwtp from which the inoculum was taken a characterization of the influent wastewater is reported in table 1 to simulate the recirculation of the htcl to the existing conventional activated sludge cas process the htcl mass that could be sent to the water line was evaluated as the difference between the mass of hydrochar eq 3 and the mass of gas eq 4 3 m hydrochar f htc ts y hydrochar η 4 m gas f htc ts y gas where fhtc is the flow rate entering the htc process ton year 1 ts is the total solid mass percentage of the sludge fed to the htc reactor equal to 10 yhydrochar and ygas are respectively the hydrochar yield eq 1 and the gas yield eq 2 after the htc treatment and η is the dry matter content of the dewatered hydrochar assumed equal to 0 6 thus eqs 3 and 4 were used to compute the mass of htcl to be fed to the sbr system moreover given the characteristics of the htcl this estimation allows also to evaluate the wastewater overloading in terms of tcod and tkn on the biological compartment of the wwtp a characterization of htcl is reported in table 1 the experimental period was divided into four phases period i is the reference period where only influent wastewater was delivered to the sbr during period ii iii and iv different amounts of htcl were added to wastewater influent with different overloading of tcod and tkn more details are reported in section 3 2 2 4 sludge production and solid retention time the observed sludge yield yobs g tss g cod 1 was determined to estimate the sludge production of the sbr lab system during the entire experimental periods yobs is defined as the ratio between the amount of sludge produced and the amount of tcod removed from the system it can be expressed as 5 y obs x total cod in cod out q inf where xtotal g tss d 1 is the daily sludge mass production codin and codout are the influent and effluent tcod mg l 1 concentration respectively qinf is the influent flow rate l d 1 moreover the solid retention time srt of the sbr system was evaluated as the ratio between the total mass of sludge inside the system and the mass rate of sludge leaving the system 12 expressed as 6 srt v sbr x sbr x sbr q sbr waste x eff q eff where the vsbr is the volume of the sbr reactor l xsbr is the tss concentration inside the sbr g l 1 xeff is the tss concentration of the effluent g l 1 and qsbr waste and qeff are respectively the sludge wastage flow rate l d 1 and the effluent flow rate l d 1 2 5 analysis during the whole experimental period samples from the influent and effluent were taken twice a week for chemical analysis total suspended solids tss volatile solids vs total solids ts total chemical oxygen demand tcod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total organic nitrogen norg concentrations were quantified according to standard methods 3 soluble cod scod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were measured after sample filtration on a 0 45 μm paper filter the biodegradability of the htcl was evaluated with respirometric tests by using the respirometric experimental setup reported in mancuso et al 23 the activated sludge from the oxidation tank of the municipal wwtp of trento having a tss content equal to 4 1 0 5 g tss l 1 was used as inoculum the soluble biodegradable cod scodbio and the readily biodegradable cod rbcod of the htcl were determined according to andreottola et al 2 and wentzel et al 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 htcl characterization htc was performed on the 10 ts content mixture of digestate and dewatered sludge at 190 c for a treatment time of 1 h the htc test was characterized in terms of solid liquid and gas yields by means of eqs 1 and 2 the hydrochar yield was equal to 53 2 while the gas yield was 2 6 therefore the yield of the htcl was equal to 44 2 the hydrochar yield is lower than those reported in literature 5 8 15 24 and in our previous studies where the same sludge from trento wwtp was treated in the htc reactor 1 13 however these differences could be attributed to the variation in the digested sludge composition i e ts content 1 9 in this study 3 1 in 13 2 3 in 1 that after the htc process can lead to the formation of a higher concentration of hydro soluble compounds chemical analyses were conducted on the htcl after a solid separation from the htc slurry performed with a qualitative filter paper results show that the htcl had a tcod and a tkn concentration equal respectively to 40 200 3200 mg tcod l 1 and 4030 310 mg tkn l 1 this result is consistent with several literature studies where it is reported that the tcod and tkn concentrations of sewage sludge htcl vary between respectively 10 0 63 9 g tcod l 1 and 2 2 4 7 g tkn l 1 9 18 34 37 moreover the rbcod concentration of the htcl estimated by means of respirometric assay was equal to 4460 220 mg rbcod l 1 about 11 of the tcod this results is consistent with the rbcod concentration of a municipal wastewater influent ranging between 11 and 14 2 moreover fig 2 reports the oxygen uptake rate our profile of the htcl that could be used to determine the contribution of the scodbio to the tcod the our shows a gradually decreasing trend linked to the progressive disappearance of the substrates from the fastest to the slowest biodegradable ones the respirogram exhibits high values at the beginning of the test where the oxidation of the rbcod and the hydrolysis of readily hydrolysable cod rhcod and slowly biodegradable cod sbcod occur the duration of this first step depends on the amount of rbcod present in the sample the higher the concentration of rbcod the longer the starting phase will be according to rbcod concentration data the first phase of the our curve lasted for about 10 h the second part of the our curve corresponds to the endogenous respiration of the biomass this phase lasted for about 15 h and showed an exponential decrease of the endogenous respiration rate scodbio was evaluated considering the trend of our versus time and computing the area between the total our and the endogenous respiration the concentration of the scodbio was equal to 19 200 80 mg scodbio l 1 accounting for 48 of the tcod concentration considering that the cod concentration of the htcl is measured after a qualitative filtration the particulate cod pcod could be assumed as a small part of the total cod ranging between 1 and 2 thus the pcod of the htcl accounts for about 600 mg pcod l 1 while the scod is equal to 39 600 mg l 1 fig 3 shows the fractionation of the tcod in terms of pcod scodinert rbcod and rhcod sbcod of the htcl the sum of rhcod and sbcod accounts for 37 while the amount of non biodegradable soluble cod scodinert is equal to 51 this value is higher than that reported for influent municipal wastewater which ranges from 17 to 25 conversely the scodbio 48 is lower in respect to the typical range 60 70 2 the htcl used for the scodbio evaluation was obtained after a qualitative filtration meaning that a portion of solid materials hydrochar was still present in the sample as reported in ferrentino et al 13 the hydrochar has also biodegradable characteristics which can contribute at longer time than that used for the respirometric test to increase the scodbio concentration however these results highlight that a portion of tcod is biodegradable thus the removal of the biodegradable organic substances present in the htcl is in any case possible through biological processes such as conventional activated sludge 3 2 input data for the sbr system in this section a scenario is outlined where the htc process is inserted into the wwtp of trento treatment capacity equal to 120 000 pe italy and the htcl is recycled back to the water line as a source of carbon to sustain the denitrification process the amount of htcl to be fed to the sbr system was evaluated considering the hydrochar the htcl and gas yields obtained from the htc test and simulating the real production of the htc process when applied to the trento wwtp the mass of digested and dewatered sludge delivered to the htc process would be of about 11 600 tons per year ts 10 given the yield of hydrochar equal to 53 2 and following eq 3 the mass of hydrochar produced from the htc process would be equal to 1019 tons year 1 the mass of gas computed following eq 4 would totalize 35 tons year 1 thus the mass of htcl produced would be of about 10 550 m3 year 1 considering a density of the htcl equal to that of the water the average actual treatment capacity of the cas system of trento municipal wwtp is 25 000 m3 day 1 with average tcod and tkn concentrations of respectively 184 15 mg cod l 1 and 57 6 4 6 mg tkn l 1 the tcod and tkn concentrations of the htcl as reported above are equal to 40 180 3200 mg tcod l 1 and 4030 310 mg tkn l 1 thus the overloading on the cas process present in the water line of the trento wwtp due to the recirculation of the htcl would be equal to 25 and 8 respectively for the tcod and tkn concentrations furthermore the influent flows of the sbr system were also evaluated considering the proportionality of the concentrations between the real wwtp and the sbr system the sbr influent wastewater was equal to 2 l d 1 while the influent htcl was equal to 2 ml d 1 in addition to the overloading percentage obtained the sbr system was also tested to treat a flow of htcl equal to 4 ml d 1 and 8 ml d 1 which corresponds to an overloading in the water line of respectively 50 tcod and 16 tkn and 100 cod and 32 tkn considering this the experimental period was divided into four phases i reference period only influent wastewater was delivered to the sbr ii period ii 2 ml d 1 of htcl in addition to the influent wastewater corresponding to an overloading of the water line equal to 25 tcod and 8 tkn iii period iii 4 ml d 1 of htcl added to the influent wastewater overloading of 50 tcod and 16 tkn and iv period iv 8 ml d 1 of htcl added to the influent wastewater overloading of 100 tcod and 32 tkn 3 3 nur tests as reported in table 1 the average value tcod tn ratio of the influent wastewater of trento wwtp is equal to 3 1 which is lower than the typical values reported in literature ranging between 4 and 6 27 thus recycling the htcl to the cas system could contribute to the denitrification process as an external carbon source addition to evaluate the effects of the htcl on the denitrification efficiency of the sbr system a nur batch test was performed prior to each increase of the htcl load in the sbr system fig 4 shows the results of the nur tests after the addition of 2 4 and 8 ml of htcl to the batch reactor these results were compared to nur tests with an equivalent cod concentration of acetic acid a readily biodegradable carbon source used as reference to assess the maximum denitrification rate vn max that could be obtained fig 4a reports the vn of the biomass after the addition of 2 ml of htcl and alternatively 8 ml of acetic acid concentration of solution 10 g l 1 results show that the vn htc is equal to 0 46 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 compared to the vn max equal to 0 78 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 meaning that the degradation of the htcl in anoxic conditions is possible even if the denitrification rate is almost half that of a rapidly biodegradable substrate increasing the amount of htcl and acetic acid added to the batch reactors up to 4 ml and 16 ml respectively the vn htc increased to 0 82 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 compared to 1 16 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 of vn max fig 4b a further increase to 1 63 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 was observed when the htcl added was equal to 8 ml fig 4c all the tests revealed that the htcl could be used as an alternative to replace conventional and expensive carbon sources for enhancing the biological denitrification process without causing inhibitory effects on the biomass these results are comparable with those obtained by guo et al 16 where hydrolysate sludge after thermal treatment at 100 c for 1 h was used as external carbon for the denitrification process obtaining denitrification rates equal to 0 19 0 44 0 75 0 93 and 1 09 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 at scod n ratio of 4 5 6 7 and 8 respectively 3 4 sbr treatment performance the sbr lab scale system performance was monitored for 80 days the amount of htcl treated varied in the periods ii iii and iv rather than the period i where only wastewater was added when treating real wastewater the organic carbon and nutrient components in the stream fluctuated throughout the study period fig 5 shows the characteristics of influent and effluent of the sbr system during each experimental period tcod influent and effluent concentration as well as its removal were monitored to address the overall organic compound removal in the lab scale system as shown in fig 5a all the treatment periods were quite effective in the tcod removal results show an average removal higher than 84 with an effluent tcod concentration always lower than 41 mg l 1 throughout the entire duration of the experimental test more precisely during the reference period period i the average tcod influent and effluent concentrations were respectively 197 46 mg tcod l 1 and 31 7 mg tcod l 1 with a removal equal to 84 during period ii and iii the influent concentrations were equal to respectively 214 33 mg tcod l 1 and 267 17 mg tcod l 1 while the effluent concentrations were 26 4 mg tcod l 1 and 27 2 mg tcod l 1 thus the tcod removal of period i and ii was respectively equal to 88 and 89 in period iv which was characterized by the highest cod overloading due to the htcl recirculation the tcod removal reached 91 with an average influent and effluent concentrations equal to respectively 362 12 mg tcod l 1 and 34 1 mg tcod l 1 considering period iv and performing a cod mass balance result showed that the non biodegradable soluble cod of the htcl in the effluent wastewater was equal to 11 mg l 1 thus the contribution of non biodegradable soluble cod in the effluent wastewater was lower than 1 of the influent scod thus the organic compounds overloading from 25 to 100 did not have negative effects on the removal performance meaning that the htcl could be recycled back and treated in the biological compartment of the water line of a wwtp ensuring compliance with the regulatory limits for the discharge of effluents in addition to the tcod nitrogen removal was also monitored high nh4 n removal fig 5b was observed during the entire duration of the experimental test results show a nh4 n removal equal to 99 98 and 96 respectively during period ii iii and iv comparable to that of period i which was equal to 99 thus the htcl addition did not cause worsening of nh4 n removal on the contrary the tkn removal slightly decreased by increasing the load of htcl treated in the sbr system fig 5c in the reference period the tkn removal was equal to 94 with a decrease to 92 in period ii iii and iv meaning that a portion of the organic nitrogen added to the sbr system with the htcl was not biodegradable on the contrary the tn removal was very low in period i equal to 28 fig 5d this could be ascribed to the low c n ratio as reported in table 1 meaning that the denitrification process did not take place adequately however during period ii when feeding a flow equal to 2 ml d 1 of htcl to the sbr system corresponding to 8 tkn overloading an increase up to 33 in the tn removal was observed moreover increasing the tkn overloading to 16 period iii and 32 period iv a further increase in the tn removal was observed reaching respectively 47 and 64 however in all the experimental periods the tn removal was always below 70 indeed we cannot rule out that there was an accumulation of nitrites inside the reactor actually the pathway of nitrogen removal should be further investigated in view of an enhanced tn removal results reveal that the htc liquor could be used as a carbon source in the biological compartment of the water line of a wwtp to enhance the denitrification process and improve the quality of the effluent to be discharged furthermore the tss concentration of the influent and effluent of the sbr system was also monitored to evaluate that no negative effects occurred to sludge settleability results show an increase in the tss removal from 88 in period i up to 92 in period ii and to 94 in period iii and iv data not shown 3 5 sludge production the solid production was quantified considering the solids wastage for sampling and the mass of solids in the effluent of the sbr system tss concentration in the sbr system was monitored to ensure that no solid mass accumulation occurred inside the reactor moreover no sewage sludge discharge was performed during the entire duration of the experimental test thus the tss production was equal to 60 mg tss d 1 in period i and 69 mg tss d 1 in period ii iii and iv meaning that the addition of htcl to the sbr system increased its solid production interestingly the increase in the flow of htcl from 2 ml d 1 up to 8 ml d 1 fed to the sbr system did not produce an increase in the tss production moreover the cod removal was equal to 135 mg cod d 1 156 mg cod d 1 198 mg cod d 1 and 268 mg cod d 1 respectively during period i ii iii and iv when the htcl was fed to the sbr an increase in the influent cod concentration was observed while the effluent cod concentration values were always lower and comparable to that of period i thus the amount of cod removed increased when increasing the flow of htcl fed to the sbr system therefore the observed sludge yield yobs in period ii iii and iv obtained by applying eq 5 was equal to 0 44 g tss g cod 1 0 35 g tss g cod 1 and 0 26 g tss g cod 1 respectively the yobs of period i considered as reference was equal to 0 45 g tss g cod 1 corresponding to a typical literature value for cas processes and generally ranging between 0 40 and 0 44 g tss g cod 1 12 moreover the srt was equal to 45 days in period i and decreased to 36 35 and 30 days respectively in period ii iii and iv results reveal that by increasing the htcl flow to the sbr system a reduction in the sludge production occurred due to an increase in cod removal 4 conclusions htcl was produced through the htc process 190 c 1 h applied to a mixture of digested and dewatered municipal sludge 80 days of stable operation of the lab scale sbr system revealed that the htcl can be utilised as a carbon source for biological denitrification ensuring high percentage removal of tcod nh4 n and tn accounting respectively up to 91 98 and 64 moreover the tn removal increased from 28 up to 64 thanks to the feeding of htcl meaning that htcl could be used as alternative carbon source to sustain the denitrification process and meet the regulatory limits for the effluent discharge respirometric tests revealed that up to 11 of the tcod was ascribed to rbcod while the scodbio was equal to 48 batch tests confirmed a maximum denitrification rate ranging between 0 46 and 1 63 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 depending on the htcl load declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

13260,this study investigates the suitability of a sequencing batch reactor sbr for treating the liquor htcl derived from hydrothermal carbonization htc of sewage sludge in addition to the influent municipal wastewater the sbr was fed for 80 days with an increasing mixing ratio htcl municipal wastewater htcl was used as external carbon source to enhance the denitrification process in the water line of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp the feeding of the htcl caused an overloading in the cod and tkn concentration of the biological treatment equal to respectively 25 and 8 period ii 50 and 16 period iii and 100 and 32 period iv results revealed that good efficiencies of cod removal were obtained during the entire experimental test accounting up to 91 in period iv moreover the removal of tn was improved increasing from 28 in the reference period period i where no htcl was fed to 33 47 and 64 respectively in period ii iii and iv thus an improvement in the denitrification process was obtained when htcl was fed to the biological reactor in addition to the influent wastewater the implementation of the sbr system was supported by nitrate uptake rate nur tests and respirometric assays to evaluate the nitrate removal after the addition of htcl and the fraction of readily biodegradable cod rbcod and soluble biodegradable cod scodbio on the total cod of the htcl graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment hydrothermal carbonization htc liquor denitrification process carbon source 1 introduction biological denitrification a process where heterotrophic bacteria reduce nitrites and nitrates to nitrogen in anoxic conditions is widely applied in nitrogen removal for municipal and industrial wastewater 22 30 this process is economically convenient as compared to physicochemical treatment processes nevertheless the rate and extension of the denitrification depend mainly on the final carbon to nitrogen ratio in the biological reactor 7 this means that biological denitrification needs organic carbon source to support heterotrophic denitrifiers bacteria activities 6 wastewaters often lack in organic matter and this carbon shortage can block the denitrification process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps therefore in many wwtps carbon sources such as ethanol methanol and acetate are added as external carbon supply in order to achieve an efficient denitrification performance and meet the regulatory limits for the discharge 21 32 39 supplementing carbon guarantees excellent nitrogen removal but increases the operating cost of wastewater treatment waste activated sludge produced in wwtps has a great amount of organic substances that can be used as inexpensive carbon source for enhancing biological denitrification 36 however sludge needs a solubilization step prior to its possible use as a carbon source in the view of a resource recovery from waste recently many researchers have studied sludge pre treatment methods for carbon source recovery such as wet oxidation 31 thermal hydrolysis 4 17 36 fermentation 39 alkali fermentation 20 and mechanical disintegration 19 as far as we know there are no studies reporting the application of hydrothermal carbonization liquor htcl as external carbon supplements to improve biological denitrification hydrothermal carbonization htc is a process occurring in liquid water without any oxygen addition by which under temperatures in the range 180 280 c for a duration from few minutes up to several hours wet biomasses are converted to a solid carbonaceous fraction called hydrochar a liquid fraction called htcl and a minor gas fraction 13 in wastewater treatment htc has been recognized as a promising post treatment of the anaerobic digestion that can strongly increase sludge dewaterability thus reducing the amount of sludge to be disposed of 25 in addition htc can also improve biogas production by cycling back to the anaerobic digester the htcl and possibly a portion of the hydrochar moreover the derived hydrochar can be used as soil improver adsorbent for wastewater remediation resource for phosphorous recovery or if allowed fuel for thermal energy production in addition the derived htcl contains a high load of organic compounds from 10 to 64 g cod l 1 that solubilize during the htc process 25 wirth et al 35 reported that htcl could contain up to 15 of the initial carbon present in the sewage sludge mainly as acetic acid that can be used as a readily biodegradable substrate by heterotrophic denitrifiers bacteria moreover nyktari et al 29 reported that volatile fatty acids vfas in the htcl represent from 9 8 up to 30 of the total organic carbon depending on the htc operating conditions and among them the highest contribution is given by acetic acid due to this high organic content several research groups have investigated the valorization of the htcl through the anaerobic digestion ad process 1 13 28 35 however a portion of the htcl can be also cycled back to the main biological reactor of a wwtp supplementing external carbon source and thus contributing to enhance the biological denitrification process in this view the htc process can be used both to i enhance the biogas production in the anaerobic digester by cycling back to it the hydrochar and a portion of the htcl 13 and ii to enhance the biological denitrification process by cycling back a portion or in some cases the whole htcl in the mainstream reactor of the wwtp water line this scenario reported in fig 1 promotes the containments of wwtp operating costs because no external carbon substrate is needed to guarantee a high performance denitrification process thus the present study focuses on the htcl treatment in the biological compartment of a wwtp water line the main aim is to provide a potential new approach of htcl treatment and its possible use recovery as carbon source in this study htcl derived from htc of a mixture of digested sludges a portion taken upstream of the centrifuge a portion downstream thereof was used as carbon source in a sequencing batch reactor sbr the denitrification performance at different loading rate was investigated furthermore a detailed characterization of the htcl was performed using respirometric assay to evaluate the readily biodegradable cod rbcod and the soluble biodegradable cod scodbio 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrothermal carbonization sludge exiting the anaerobic digester digestate dry matter content 1 9 0 1 and the same digestate after the addition of polyelectrolyte and the passage in centrifuge dewatered sludge dry matter content 23 3 0 4 from the local municipal wwtp of trento italy were used in this study based on the solid content of each digestate and dewatered sludges were mixed to obtain a mixed feedstock with a dry biomass to water ratio b w equal to 0 1 and a dry matter content of about 10 this value was chosen to simulate the implementation in full scale applications where a mixed sludge with a dry matter content equal to 10 can be easily pumped to the htc reactor 11 an htc experimental system designed and constructed at the university of trento was used for this study details about the experimental setup are reported in merzari et al 26 the mixed sludge was treated in the htc reactor at an operating temperature of 190 c for 1 h reaction time after that period and after cooling the reactor the hydrothermally treated sludge was filtered with a qualitative paper filter to separate the htc liquor from the hydrochar the recovered htc liquor was collected and then kept at 24 c for further usage the yield of hydrochar was calculated using the following equation 1 y hydrochar w 1 w 0 100 where w0 is the dry weight of the mixed feedstock before the htc treatment and w1 is the dry weight of the derived hydrochar the gas yield was computed following eq 2 through the ideal gas law assuming only co2 as the gaseous product using a water displacement cylinder 14 2 y gas w co 2 w 0 100 where wco2 is the weight of co2 the liquid yield was calculated as the complement to 100 of the solid and gas yields eqs 1 and 2 were used to compute the amount of htcl produced and recycled back to the biological denitrification compartment the basic idea was to make a quantitative simulation of what could be the flows involved at the real plant level when adopting the innovative process scheme proposed in this research 2 2 nitrate uptake rate nur tests the nitrate uptake rate nur test was performed to evaluate the microbial activity of the biomass after the addition of the htc liquor that can be used by bacteria as external carbon source for the denitrification process batch tests were performed using a 2 l reactor where 1 2 l of activated sludge tank of trento wwtp tss 4 1 1 5 g tss l 1 italy was used as inoculum and put in anoxic conditions a solution of 1 g l 1 of nitrate was used to obtain a no3 n concentration inside the batch reactor at least equal to 30 mg no3 n l 1 at the beginning of the test a solution of known concentration of cod as htcl or sodium acetate was injected mixing conditions were ensured by using a magnetic stirrer samples were taken every 20 min filtered with a 0 45 μm paper filter and then used for further analysis the nur test allowed to evaluate the denitrification rate vn expressed as mg n g 1 tss h 1 as the slope of the linear regression of the nitrate concentration versus time 2 3 sbr lab scale system given the results of the nur test a laboratory scale system consisting of an alternate aerobic and anoxic sbr was designed and implemented to simulate the water line of trento wwtp the sbr was a cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 2 l diameter and height were 12 0 and 21 0 cm respectively having a hydraulic retention time hrt equal to 0 75 day disc diffusers were placed for the aeration at the bottom of the sbr a mechanical stirrer was used to mix the activated sludge the sbr had eight cycles a day and each cycle 3 h consisted of anoxic feeding 44 min aeration 27 min anoxic feeding 44 min aeration 27 min settling 23 min and supernatant extraction 15 min once a day at the end of the supernatant extraction phase excess sludge was manually extracted to keep constant the tss concentration in the sbr concentrations of dissolved oxygen do during the aeration phases were monitored by using a do probe oxi 340i and maintained between 1 and 3 mg l 1 the lab system was equipped with two peristaltic pumps to allow the feeding and the discharge of the wastewater the experimental plant was monitored with chemical analysis twice a week using ph do and temperature as online parameters ph and temperature were left free to vary and their average values were respectively 7 5 0 2 and 20 3 c the activated sludge of the sbr used as inoculum was obtained from the oxidation treatment unit of a local municipal wwtp trento italy the sbr inoculum had the following characteristics total chemical oxygen demand tcod 3450 270 mg cod l 1 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 101 51 mg tkn l 1 total suspended solids tss 4 1 0 5 g tss l 1 the ratio between volatile suspended solids and total suspended solids vss tss 0 8 the sbr was fed with the effluent of the primary sedimentation tank of the same wwtp from which the inoculum was taken a characterization of the influent wastewater is reported in table 1 to simulate the recirculation of the htcl to the existing conventional activated sludge cas process the htcl mass that could be sent to the water line was evaluated as the difference between the mass of hydrochar eq 3 and the mass of gas eq 4 3 m hydrochar f htc ts y hydrochar η 4 m gas f htc ts y gas where fhtc is the flow rate entering the htc process ton year 1 ts is the total solid mass percentage of the sludge fed to the htc reactor equal to 10 yhydrochar and ygas are respectively the hydrochar yield eq 1 and the gas yield eq 2 after the htc treatment and η is the dry matter content of the dewatered hydrochar assumed equal to 0 6 thus eqs 3 and 4 were used to compute the mass of htcl to be fed to the sbr system moreover given the characteristics of the htcl this estimation allows also to evaluate the wastewater overloading in terms of tcod and tkn on the biological compartment of the wwtp a characterization of htcl is reported in table 1 the experimental period was divided into four phases period i is the reference period where only influent wastewater was delivered to the sbr during period ii iii and iv different amounts of htcl were added to wastewater influent with different overloading of tcod and tkn more details are reported in section 3 2 2 4 sludge production and solid retention time the observed sludge yield yobs g tss g cod 1 was determined to estimate the sludge production of the sbr lab system during the entire experimental periods yobs is defined as the ratio between the amount of sludge produced and the amount of tcod removed from the system it can be expressed as 5 y obs x total cod in cod out q inf where xtotal g tss d 1 is the daily sludge mass production codin and codout are the influent and effluent tcod mg l 1 concentration respectively qinf is the influent flow rate l d 1 moreover the solid retention time srt of the sbr system was evaluated as the ratio between the total mass of sludge inside the system and the mass rate of sludge leaving the system 12 expressed as 6 srt v sbr x sbr x sbr q sbr waste x eff q eff where the vsbr is the volume of the sbr reactor l xsbr is the tss concentration inside the sbr g l 1 xeff is the tss concentration of the effluent g l 1 and qsbr waste and qeff are respectively the sludge wastage flow rate l d 1 and the effluent flow rate l d 1 2 5 analysis during the whole experimental period samples from the influent and effluent were taken twice a week for chemical analysis total suspended solids tss volatile solids vs total solids ts total chemical oxygen demand tcod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total organic nitrogen norg concentrations were quantified according to standard methods 3 soluble cod scod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were measured after sample filtration on a 0 45 μm paper filter the biodegradability of the htcl was evaluated with respirometric tests by using the respirometric experimental setup reported in mancuso et al 23 the activated sludge from the oxidation tank of the municipal wwtp of trento having a tss content equal to 4 1 0 5 g tss l 1 was used as inoculum the soluble biodegradable cod scodbio and the readily biodegradable cod rbcod of the htcl were determined according to andreottola et al 2 and wentzel et al 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 htcl characterization htc was performed on the 10 ts content mixture of digestate and dewatered sludge at 190 c for a treatment time of 1 h the htc test was characterized in terms of solid liquid and gas yields by means of eqs 1 and 2 the hydrochar yield was equal to 53 2 while the gas yield was 2 6 therefore the yield of the htcl was equal to 44 2 the hydrochar yield is lower than those reported in literature 5 8 15 24 and in our previous studies where the same sludge from trento wwtp was treated in the htc reactor 1 13 however these differences could be attributed to the variation in the digested sludge composition i e ts content 1 9 in this study 3 1 in 13 2 3 in 1 that after the htc process can lead to the formation of a higher concentration of hydro soluble compounds chemical analyses were conducted on the htcl after a solid separation from the htc slurry performed with a qualitative filter paper results show that the htcl had a tcod and a tkn concentration equal respectively to 40 200 3200 mg tcod l 1 and 4030 310 mg tkn l 1 this result is consistent with several literature studies where it is reported that the tcod and tkn concentrations of sewage sludge htcl vary between respectively 10 0 63 9 g tcod l 1 and 2 2 4 7 g tkn l 1 9 18 34 37 moreover the rbcod concentration of the htcl estimated by means of respirometric assay was equal to 4460 220 mg rbcod l 1 about 11 of the tcod this results is consistent with the rbcod concentration of a municipal wastewater influent ranging between 11 and 14 2 moreover fig 2 reports the oxygen uptake rate our profile of the htcl that could be used to determine the contribution of the scodbio to the tcod the our shows a gradually decreasing trend linked to the progressive disappearance of the substrates from the fastest to the slowest biodegradable ones the respirogram exhibits high values at the beginning of the test where the oxidation of the rbcod and the hydrolysis of readily hydrolysable cod rhcod and slowly biodegradable cod sbcod occur the duration of this first step depends on the amount of rbcod present in the sample the higher the concentration of rbcod the longer the starting phase will be according to rbcod concentration data the first phase of the our curve lasted for about 10 h the second part of the our curve corresponds to the endogenous respiration of the biomass this phase lasted for about 15 h and showed an exponential decrease of the endogenous respiration rate scodbio was evaluated considering the trend of our versus time and computing the area between the total our and the endogenous respiration the concentration of the scodbio was equal to 19 200 80 mg scodbio l 1 accounting for 48 of the tcod concentration considering that the cod concentration of the htcl is measured after a qualitative filtration the particulate cod pcod could be assumed as a small part of the total cod ranging between 1 and 2 thus the pcod of the htcl accounts for about 600 mg pcod l 1 while the scod is equal to 39 600 mg l 1 fig 3 shows the fractionation of the tcod in terms of pcod scodinert rbcod and rhcod sbcod of the htcl the sum of rhcod and sbcod accounts for 37 while the amount of non biodegradable soluble cod scodinert is equal to 51 this value is higher than that reported for influent municipal wastewater which ranges from 17 to 25 conversely the scodbio 48 is lower in respect to the typical range 60 70 2 the htcl used for the scodbio evaluation was obtained after a qualitative filtration meaning that a portion of solid materials hydrochar was still present in the sample as reported in ferrentino et al 13 the hydrochar has also biodegradable characteristics which can contribute at longer time than that used for the respirometric test to increase the scodbio concentration however these results highlight that a portion of tcod is biodegradable thus the removal of the biodegradable organic substances present in the htcl is in any case possible through biological processes such as conventional activated sludge 3 2 input data for the sbr system in this section a scenario is outlined where the htc process is inserted into the wwtp of trento treatment capacity equal to 120 000 pe italy and the htcl is recycled back to the water line as a source of carbon to sustain the denitrification process the amount of htcl to be fed to the sbr system was evaluated considering the hydrochar the htcl and gas yields obtained from the htc test and simulating the real production of the htc process when applied to the trento wwtp the mass of digested and dewatered sludge delivered to the htc process would be of about 11 600 tons per year ts 10 given the yield of hydrochar equal to 53 2 and following eq 3 the mass of hydrochar produced from the htc process would be equal to 1019 tons year 1 the mass of gas computed following eq 4 would totalize 35 tons year 1 thus the mass of htcl produced would be of about 10 550 m3 year 1 considering a density of the htcl equal to that of the water the average actual treatment capacity of the cas system of trento municipal wwtp is 25 000 m3 day 1 with average tcod and tkn concentrations of respectively 184 15 mg cod l 1 and 57 6 4 6 mg tkn l 1 the tcod and tkn concentrations of the htcl as reported above are equal to 40 180 3200 mg tcod l 1 and 4030 310 mg tkn l 1 thus the overloading on the cas process present in the water line of the trento wwtp due to the recirculation of the htcl would be equal to 25 and 8 respectively for the tcod and tkn concentrations furthermore the influent flows of the sbr system were also evaluated considering the proportionality of the concentrations between the real wwtp and the sbr system the sbr influent wastewater was equal to 2 l d 1 while the influent htcl was equal to 2 ml d 1 in addition to the overloading percentage obtained the sbr system was also tested to treat a flow of htcl equal to 4 ml d 1 and 8 ml d 1 which corresponds to an overloading in the water line of respectively 50 tcod and 16 tkn and 100 cod and 32 tkn considering this the experimental period was divided into four phases i reference period only influent wastewater was delivered to the sbr ii period ii 2 ml d 1 of htcl in addition to the influent wastewater corresponding to an overloading of the water line equal to 25 tcod and 8 tkn iii period iii 4 ml d 1 of htcl added to the influent wastewater overloading of 50 tcod and 16 tkn and iv period iv 8 ml d 1 of htcl added to the influent wastewater overloading of 100 tcod and 32 tkn 3 3 nur tests as reported in table 1 the average value tcod tn ratio of the influent wastewater of trento wwtp is equal to 3 1 which is lower than the typical values reported in literature ranging between 4 and 6 27 thus recycling the htcl to the cas system could contribute to the denitrification process as an external carbon source addition to evaluate the effects of the htcl on the denitrification efficiency of the sbr system a nur batch test was performed prior to each increase of the htcl load in the sbr system fig 4 shows the results of the nur tests after the addition of 2 4 and 8 ml of htcl to the batch reactor these results were compared to nur tests with an equivalent cod concentration of acetic acid a readily biodegradable carbon source used as reference to assess the maximum denitrification rate vn max that could be obtained fig 4a reports the vn of the biomass after the addition of 2 ml of htcl and alternatively 8 ml of acetic acid concentration of solution 10 g l 1 results show that the vn htc is equal to 0 46 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 compared to the vn max equal to 0 78 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 meaning that the degradation of the htcl in anoxic conditions is possible even if the denitrification rate is almost half that of a rapidly biodegradable substrate increasing the amount of htcl and acetic acid added to the batch reactors up to 4 ml and 16 ml respectively the vn htc increased to 0 82 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 compared to 1 16 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 of vn max fig 4b a further increase to 1 63 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 was observed when the htcl added was equal to 8 ml fig 4c all the tests revealed that the htcl could be used as an alternative to replace conventional and expensive carbon sources for enhancing the biological denitrification process without causing inhibitory effects on the biomass these results are comparable with those obtained by guo et al 16 where hydrolysate sludge after thermal treatment at 100 c for 1 h was used as external carbon for the denitrification process obtaining denitrification rates equal to 0 19 0 44 0 75 0 93 and 1 09 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 at scod n ratio of 4 5 6 7 and 8 respectively 3 4 sbr treatment performance the sbr lab scale system performance was monitored for 80 days the amount of htcl treated varied in the periods ii iii and iv rather than the period i where only wastewater was added when treating real wastewater the organic carbon and nutrient components in the stream fluctuated throughout the study period fig 5 shows the characteristics of influent and effluent of the sbr system during each experimental period tcod influent and effluent concentration as well as its removal were monitored to address the overall organic compound removal in the lab scale system as shown in fig 5a all the treatment periods were quite effective in the tcod removal results show an average removal higher than 84 with an effluent tcod concentration always lower than 41 mg l 1 throughout the entire duration of the experimental test more precisely during the reference period period i the average tcod influent and effluent concentrations were respectively 197 46 mg tcod l 1 and 31 7 mg tcod l 1 with a removal equal to 84 during period ii and iii the influent concentrations were equal to respectively 214 33 mg tcod l 1 and 267 17 mg tcod l 1 while the effluent concentrations were 26 4 mg tcod l 1 and 27 2 mg tcod l 1 thus the tcod removal of period i and ii was respectively equal to 88 and 89 in period iv which was characterized by the highest cod overloading due to the htcl recirculation the tcod removal reached 91 with an average influent and effluent concentrations equal to respectively 362 12 mg tcod l 1 and 34 1 mg tcod l 1 considering period iv and performing a cod mass balance result showed that the non biodegradable soluble cod of the htcl in the effluent wastewater was equal to 11 mg l 1 thus the contribution of non biodegradable soluble cod in the effluent wastewater was lower than 1 of the influent scod thus the organic compounds overloading from 25 to 100 did not have negative effects on the removal performance meaning that the htcl could be recycled back and treated in the biological compartment of the water line of a wwtp ensuring compliance with the regulatory limits for the discharge of effluents in addition to the tcod nitrogen removal was also monitored high nh4 n removal fig 5b was observed during the entire duration of the experimental test results show a nh4 n removal equal to 99 98 and 96 respectively during period ii iii and iv comparable to that of period i which was equal to 99 thus the htcl addition did not cause worsening of nh4 n removal on the contrary the tkn removal slightly decreased by increasing the load of htcl treated in the sbr system fig 5c in the reference period the tkn removal was equal to 94 with a decrease to 92 in period ii iii and iv meaning that a portion of the organic nitrogen added to the sbr system with the htcl was not biodegradable on the contrary the tn removal was very low in period i equal to 28 fig 5d this could be ascribed to the low c n ratio as reported in table 1 meaning that the denitrification process did not take place adequately however during period ii when feeding a flow equal to 2 ml d 1 of htcl to the sbr system corresponding to 8 tkn overloading an increase up to 33 in the tn removal was observed moreover increasing the tkn overloading to 16 period iii and 32 period iv a further increase in the tn removal was observed reaching respectively 47 and 64 however in all the experimental periods the tn removal was always below 70 indeed we cannot rule out that there was an accumulation of nitrites inside the reactor actually the pathway of nitrogen removal should be further investigated in view of an enhanced tn removal results reveal that the htc liquor could be used as a carbon source in the biological compartment of the water line of a wwtp to enhance the denitrification process and improve the quality of the effluent to be discharged furthermore the tss concentration of the influent and effluent of the sbr system was also monitored to evaluate that no negative effects occurred to sludge settleability results show an increase in the tss removal from 88 in period i up to 92 in period ii and to 94 in period iii and iv data not shown 3 5 sludge production the solid production was quantified considering the solids wastage for sampling and the mass of solids in the effluent of the sbr system tss concentration in the sbr system was monitored to ensure that no solid mass accumulation occurred inside the reactor moreover no sewage sludge discharge was performed during the entire duration of the experimental test thus the tss production was equal to 60 mg tss d 1 in period i and 69 mg tss d 1 in period ii iii and iv meaning that the addition of htcl to the sbr system increased its solid production interestingly the increase in the flow of htcl from 2 ml d 1 up to 8 ml d 1 fed to the sbr system did not produce an increase in the tss production moreover the cod removal was equal to 135 mg cod d 1 156 mg cod d 1 198 mg cod d 1 and 268 mg cod d 1 respectively during period i ii iii and iv when the htcl was fed to the sbr an increase in the influent cod concentration was observed while the effluent cod concentration values were always lower and comparable to that of period i thus the amount of cod removed increased when increasing the flow of htcl fed to the sbr system therefore the observed sludge yield yobs in period ii iii and iv obtained by applying eq 5 was equal to 0 44 g tss g cod 1 0 35 g tss g cod 1 and 0 26 g tss g cod 1 respectively the yobs of period i considered as reference was equal to 0 45 g tss g cod 1 corresponding to a typical literature value for cas processes and generally ranging between 0 40 and 0 44 g tss g cod 1 12 moreover the srt was equal to 45 days in period i and decreased to 36 35 and 30 days respectively in period ii iii and iv results reveal that by increasing the htcl flow to the sbr system a reduction in the sludge production occurred due to an increase in cod removal 4 conclusions htcl was produced through the htc process 190 c 1 h applied to a mixture of digested and dewatered municipal sludge 80 days of stable operation of the lab scale sbr system revealed that the htcl can be utilised as a carbon source for biological denitrification ensuring high percentage removal of tcod nh4 n and tn accounting respectively up to 91 98 and 64 moreover the tn removal increased from 28 up to 64 thanks to the feeding of htcl meaning that htcl could be used as alternative carbon source to sustain the denitrification process and meet the regulatory limits for the effluent discharge respirometric tests revealed that up to 11 of the tcod was ascribed to rbcod while the scodbio was equal to 48 batch tests confirmed a maximum denitrification rate ranging between 0 46 and 1 63 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 depending on the htcl load declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

sem sodium hydroxide naoh 1 introduction water pollution has increased exponentially with the increase in the human population as such textile industry is considered one of the major industries that consume a high quantity of chemicals and water and as a result produces environmentally hazardous wastewater 1 the use of dyes in recent years has increased exponentially according to ben mansour et al 2 around 800 000 tons of dyes are produced every year cationic dyes are most commonly used due to their high solubility and ease of dyeing various fabrics including silk wool paper and acrylic 3 due to the excess use of such products the water discharged from the industry consists of various hazardous chemicals including heavy metals azodyes bisphenol a bpa suspended solids high chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod 4 dyes cannot undergo degradation hence are present in water bodies for a very long time which can prevent the passage of light into the water this has become one of the most crucial environmental issues such hindrance can affect photosynthetic activities which can affect the water quality and leads to gas solubility and also affect the aquatic life and the food web 5 the maximum discharge limits and toxicological effects of most dyes on the environment and human health are not yet established however the color limit and measurement are only required as specific limits for dyes and colored water limits however the typical characteristic of textile effluent is 50 2500 pt co unit and the effluent color limitation is 100 pt co unit 5 6 as such one of the members of the triphenylmethane class of dyes is crystal violet cv cv is cationic and is readily used in textile paper and other fields and subsequently found in wastewater effluent cv is considered carcinogenic hazardous and mutagenic for living organisms and categorized as a rebellious molecule that is non biodegradable hence persists in the environment for a very long time 7 in addition it is known to be detrimental for both aquatic animals and humans for aquatic animals it is known to be responsible for mitotic poisoning which is associated with the abnormal accumulation of metaphases tumors in fishes as well as hepatocarcinoma reticular cell sarcoma in various organs including the ovary bladder and uterus 8 while in humans it can cause chemical cystitis irritation of the skin and digestive tracts respiratory and renal failure 9 therefore appropriate methods to eliminate these pollutants from water are necessary before releasing them into the environment 10 wastewater treatment can be classified into three major groups i physical treatment ii biological treatment and iii chemical treatment fig 1 illustrates some of their methods and the advantages and disadvantages associated with them although existing technologies such as membrane processes chemical reactions sedimentation biological process precipitation electrochemical ion exchange coagulation flocculation and flotation may be efficient for removing cv from wastewater they are rather expensive and time consuming 11 while electrochemical degradation and nanofiltration have not been identified as optimum solutions 12 14 adsorption on the other hand has emerged as a promising technique for treating aqueous effluent owing to its simplicity and cost effectiveness over the years there have been several studies enriched with adsorption techniques for cationic dye removal from the liquid solution such vast studies have shown agricultural based adsorbents as a promising alternative to the current conventional materials that are readily used 15 17 additionally in recent years emerging technology incorporates nanoparticle based adsorbents several researchers have investigated the adsorption of dyes using various agricultural waste including shoukat et al 18 used mango stone for cv removal and found adsorption capacity as 52 6 mg g nguyen et al 19 investigated the efficient removal of toxic organic dyes using a zirconium organic framework as a recyclable nano adsorbent methylene blue and methyl orange were chosen as model dye pollutants it had a superior maximum capacity 746 mg g and 726 mg g respectively and reusability over several cycles of the adsorption raza et al 20 studied the adsorption of organic dyes using a 2d copper ii carboxylate framework three organic dyes namely methylene blue methyl orange and methyl red were studied the dye removal efficiency was attributed to the shapes synergy among structure dimensions and ionic strength of dyes to the adsorbent structure on the other hand moharrami motamedi 21 prepared cellulose nanocrystals from agricultural waste and obtained 2500 mg g and 1428 6 mg g adsorption capacity for cv and methylene blue respectively similarly other studies include potatoes plant waste 22 date palm leaves 23 agro industrial 24 peanut hull waste biomass 25 sugarcane bagasse soot 26 and hyacinth 27 while putri et al 28 have reported successful removal of cationic dyes from aqueous solution as well as effluents in addition to being low cost such materials also inherent other advantages including minimization of waste yet delivering high efficiency in dilute solution no additional requirement of nutrient ease of operation and non hazardous to the environment 29 cellulose is one of the key molecules that are found in various agricultural by products which has been reported to be useful in the adsorption process cellulosic biomaterials are suitable adsorbents due to their richness in organic functional groups such as carbonyl amine hydroxyl carboxyl ester amide and others 30 31 cellulosic biomass is a heterogeneous substance that consists of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin as well as a complex polymer of phenylpropane units 32 generally the biosorption capacity of biosorbents depends on several parameters including the physicochemical properties of the biosorbent the presence of other competing ions and various factors such as temperature and ph hazelnut shells hs exist in large quantities around to world as food waste hs consists of various polar functions including alcoholic carboxylic and carboxylic which can facilitate sorbent and pollutant binding 33 additionally hs is beneficial because of its microporous and mesoporous structure and large surface area just like other agricultural waste hs is also rich in lignin cellulose and hemicellulose various literature including uyan et al 34 senol 35 and hosgün et al 36 demirkaya et al 37 and gozaydin yuksel 38 studied the chemical morphology of hs all studies found lignin as a dominant polymer present in hs while cellulose and hemicellulose percentages varied according to region moreover hs can be used in a broader context and remove other cationic dyes from an aqueous medium various studies were conducted to understand the adsorption mechanism of cationic dyes by hs 39 43 nanoparticles have widely been used as adsorbents for water and wastewater matrices and have unique adsorption properties compared with corresponding bulk particles 13 44 47 the effect of nanoparticle size is not well understood hence it is vital to investigate the effect of nanoparticle size on the overall nanoadsorption processes and thermodynamics based on our knowledge no study has investigated the removal of cv by nanoparticles of hazelnut shells keeping the efficiency and importance of biosorption the present study aims to assess the efficiency and the potential of using a nano hazelnut shell nano hs for cv adsorption the effects of ph temperature initial cv concentration and particle size on the cv adsorption mechanisms onto hs and nano hs were carried out additionally the experimental data were modeled in four different isotherms namely langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin over and above the effect of nanoparticle size on the adsorption thermodynamics was investigated 2 methodology 2 1 materials collection and preparation hazelnut shells hs and hs nanoparticles nano hs hazelnut shells were collected from a local qatari market the shells were cracked compressed and sieved using a mechanical sieve retsch 5657 haan w germany to obtain different particle size ranges each particle size range was collected stored in a glass bottle and kept in a dry place the 0 125 mm 0 250 mm range was used throughout the hs experiments the hs nanoparticles nano hs were attained from cryomill retsch cryomill the nano hs were washed with distilled water three times and dried in the oven overnight at 65 c 2 2 preparation of stock solution of crystal violet a stock solution of 1000 mg l of cv was prepared in distilled water the cv was obtained from breckland scientific supplies ltd chemical formula c25h30n3cl molecular weight 407 98 g mol λmax 591 nm 2 3 characterization of the adsorbents hs and nano hs physical and chemical characterizations of hs and nano hs were studied scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem 50 series and transmission electron microscope tem were used to determine the surface characterization and understand the morphology of the adsorbent brunauer emmett teller bet quantachrome corporation nova 3000 was used to determine the surface areas and pore size distribution fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using a universal attenuated total reflectance sensor ftir uatr perkinelmer spectrum range 400 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 was used to determine the functional group present on the surface of the adsorbents 2 4 the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity of cv onto hs and nano hs the adsorption experiment for the effect of ph was carried out at different ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 the diverse ph values of cv solution were adjusted by adding 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh and 0 1 m hydrochloric acid hcl solution using a ph meter ph meter jenway 370 a mass of 0 05 g of the adsorbent was added to the glass beaker subsequently the samples were kept in the rotary shaker brunswick innova 2100 2150 shaker at 160 rpm for 48 h the defined adsorption equilibrium time at room temperature then the bottles were removed filtrated and analyzed using a uv vis spectrometer perkinelmer lambda 25 uv vis the experiments were performed in triplicate and the average values were used to demonstrate the results 2 5 effect of initial concentration and solution temperature on the adsorption capacity of cv onto hs and nano hs the batch adsorption experiments were carried out at different initial cv concentrations 20 mg l 50 mg l 100 mg l 200 mg l 300 mg l 400 mg l 500 mg l 700 mg l 800 mg l and 1000 mg l the mass m to volume v ratio m v was kept as 1 1 0 05 g of the adsorbent was added in the borosilicate glass bottles and the final volume was adjusted to 50 ml based on the ph batch adsorption experiment section 2 4 results the cv solution was adjusted to ph 10 for both adsorbents the bottles were placed in a rotary shaker brunswick innova 2100 2150 shaker at 25 c for 48 h at 160 rpm to determine the effect of temperature on the adsorption process the batch cv adsorption experiments were conducted at different solution temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c the same protocol was followed for hs to validate the data the experiments were performed in triplicates and average values were presented the solution was then filtered using a syringe and a 0 20 μm membrane filter and the nano hs size was filtered by first centrifuging heraeus megafuge 16 centrifuge series and then carrying out filtration the separated solutions were diluted prior to uv vis spectrophotometer analysis the adsorption capacity qe mg g was calculated by eq 1 48 1 q e c 0 c e v m 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium cv concentration mg l before and after adsorption receptively v is the cv solution volume l and m is the adsorbent mass g 2 6 adsorption isotherm table 1 shows the four isotherm models that were studied in the current study 2 7 thermodynamic studies the thermodynamics was studied by determining various parameters including entropy change s enthalpy change h and gibb s free energy change g using eqs 2 3 and 4 50 2 ln k e h o rt s o r 3 δ g o rtln k e 4 δ g o δ h o tδ s o 2 8 statistical analysis the significant difference between the means of samples was determined using microsoft excel double factor two way anova furthermore it also helped to understand if there is any interaction between the two variables independent and dependent 3 result and discussion 3 1 ftir characterization fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of hs and nano hs before and after the cv adsorption the peak at 3320 cm 1 belongs to the oh functional group which is a common macromolecule found on cellulose lignin and hemicellulose 17 34 51 another possible explanation can also be the presence of water molecules 52 the peak at 2921 cm 1 in fig 2b is shifted to 2892 cm 1 after adsorption whichshowed the presence of ch stretch 19 53 the peaks are shown at 1735 cm 1 and 1731 cm 1 in fig 2a and 2b respectively suggesting the presence of the carboxylic acid group in hemicellulose 30 54 the bands around 1650 cm 1 and 1750 cm 1 in both fig 2a and 2b marked the presence of free esterified carboxyl groups while the bands at 1584 cm 1 and 1587 cm 1 in fig 2a and 2b respectively attributing to the co stretch of the carboxyl group of co 55 56 a strong sharp peak that was observed at 1024 cm 1 and 1014 cm 1 further confirmed the presence of cellulose in hs 55 lastly the presence of a peak in 1030 cm 1 1046 cm 1 was assigned to the co of alcohol and carboxylic acids 56 the ftir spectra indicated that the hs adsorbent in general consists of various carbons forms including aliphatic aromatic and cyclic as observed from the various peaks additionally it also demonstrates that hs in general has a heterogeneous surface with various functional groups present that will aid the adsorption of crystal violet ions furthermore the presence of such functional groups on the hazelnut shells including alcoholic carbonylic carboxylic and phenolic facilitated the adsorption rate by further increasing the negative charge leading to the high adsorption capacity of hs at high ph 57 fig 3 illustrates the major functional groups and the corresponding peaks that were reported for lignin hemicellulose and cellulose 44 58 59 the main composition of the three materials i e cellulose hemicellulose and lignin is alkanes esters aromatics ketones and alcohol with various oxygen containing functional groups it can be observed in fig 3 that there were two main absorbance regions approximately at low wavelengths 700 cm 1 1800 cm 1 and high wavelengths 2800 cm 1 3500 cm 1 the peak in the range of 1500 cm 1 to 1600 cm 1 corresponds to the aromatic ring vibrations which confirms the presence of lignin the absorbance around the 1730 cm 1 region could be attributed to the presence of methoxyloch3 aromatic cc and coc functional groups 58 3 2 scanning electron microscopy sem when comparing the surface pattern and porous forms of fig 4a and 4b it is apparent that hs appeared as a porous structure additionally irregular voids and pores were also shown in general both adsorbents appeared as irregular rough and mound surfaces moreover several layers of fibers that merged to form spirals are attributed to cellulose structure 60 these spiral like structures are expected to capture cv ions on the surface additionally the irregular and rough structures are evident for nano hs as seen in fig 4c and 4d these irregular morphologies are expected to facilitate the binding of cv onto the adsorbent while preventing desorption 61 it is evident that both adsorbents vary with their morphologies and have vivid different structures however nano hs is more heterogeneous and consists of a much rougher surface as oppose to hs this specific characteristic is expected to increase the chances of adsorption additionally the bet analysis revealed that nano hs has a larger surface area which is 4 885 m2 g and a high pore radius size of 76 3 nm while hs surface area was 3 709 m2 g and pore radius size was 50 6 nm these characteristics indeed will play an important role in the cv ions adsorption 62 63 additionally the edx data revealed that the particles had a high concentration of carbon 73 followed by oxygen 21 0 as shown in fig 5d the different regions of cv accumulation can be visualized from fig 4e 4h the successful capture of cv onto hs can be seen in fig 4e and 4f where the high porosity and deep cavities helped capture cv ions on the surface additionally as observed from sem and ftir hs in general consists of various functions that facilitated the binding of cv onto hs the intraparticle diffusion as observed in fig 4g and 4h occurred because of the effective pore volume diffusion generally the surface diffusion was insignificant owing to the intricate structure of the adsorbent a specific area was further examined in depth to have a further visualization of the adsorbent structure as shown in fig 5a and 5b both adsorbents exhibited an irregularly shaped particle with a rough surface and deep cavities additionally the particles possessed voids and bumps within their structure which were accessible for the adsorption of cv this is a favorable characteristic as it can increase the adsorption of cv onto the matter additionally it is also possible to visualize various regions for cv ions accumulation where mass adsorption of cv took place from ftir various functional groups of hs were identified which facilitated the binding of cv dye onto the surface due to the complexity of the hs surface it was assumed that cv could not move along the surface hence the surface diffusion into the adsorbent s particle was disregarded and considered negligible it was assumed that the intraparticle diffusion took place due to the effective pore volume diffusion and when the cv was trapped within the pores 3 3 tem analysis further observations of the nano hs structure were conducted by tem analysis as shown in fig 5c the size of the adsorbent and the inner pore distribution was not easily observed by sem analysis therefore the tem analysis was accomplished to further enhance the physical understanding of the adsorbent fig 5c shows the tem images as a well developed porous structure of the adsorbent that is homogeneously distributed additionally the nano hs exhibits an aggregated irregular surface with a high number of microspores and crevices at the surface the nano hs appeared as a conglomerate of very fine yet elongated particles as seen in fig 5c additionally the tem also suggests that the nanoparticles are present in cluster form of hs additionally the tem images confirmed the heterogeneity of nano hs adsorbent and irregular region of the adsorption process of the cv which can see as the darker region in fig 5c in general the tem images in high magnification show that the particles have the tendency to agglomerate additionally some areas also appeared as long irregular rod like structures le et al 64 found similar results in which the spherical structure of fe3o4 zno nanoparticles helped in the degradation of cv while gopi et al 65 noticed rod like structure in chitin nanoparticles whiskers facilitated cv adsorption 3 4 effect of the ph on the adsorption capacity it is clearly shown from fig 6a that the cv removal percentage increases with increasing ph from 2 to 8 and does not significantly increase at a ph value higher than 8 however ph 10 was reported to be the optimum ph the phzpc the total positive charges that are equal to the total negative charges exhibited a negative zeta potential value at all studied ph values it was shown that there was no isoelectric point the ph values and the zeta potentials were as follows at ph 3 11 mv ph 4 12 mv ph 6 35 mv ph 8 34 mv ph 10 41 mv the adsorption of cv onto hs is influenced by the ph solution the ph of the solution governs the interaction between cv and the adsorbent thus a change in ph solution directly influences their interaction and the ionizability of the functional groups this could be explained due to the electrostatic interaction between positively charged cv and the negatively charged on the adsorbent s surface 23 additionally at low ph the biosorption of cv is noted to be low due to the concentration of h ions present which results in repulsion between the cv ions eventually resulting in low adsorption 27 as the ph increased more negatively charged functional groups were accessible resulting in an increase in adsorption and a decrease in repulsion between the cations and adsorbents similar findings were also observed by doğan et al 40 who elucidated that negatively charged adsorbent was favorable for cv adsorption while on the other hand dabagh et al 66 reported no significant difference in adsorption capacity of cv onto novel fe3o4 graphene biochar composite and carpobrotus edulis moreover as the ph increased the cv adsorption onto the adsorbents reached up to 91 as seen in fig 6a it was also deduced that the ph of the solution provides a driving force to surpass the mass transfer s resistance between the cv ions and the adsorbent additionally empty sites at ph 8 and 9 were almost occupied as a result the reaction reached its equilibrium 3 5 adsorption mechanisms fig 6b proposes a schematic illustration of how cv ions might have bonded on the hs surface due to the complex chemical structure and the presence of many binding sites of the hs shell it is expected that cv can easily be adsorbed onto the surface it can be assumed that ion exchange electrostatic bond and hydrogen bonding can be the principal mechanism of cv removal the major components of such polymeric material shells are lignin cellulose and other phenolic compounds from the nature of the material as discussed earlier it can be speculated that lignin and cellulose are the active ion exchange compounds and phenolic groups present in the shell are the active site of adsorption activity 67 since the cv ions are positively charged the uptake of the cv molecule onto the external surface of the hs or hs nano would decrease the negativity charges on the adsorbent fig 6c illustrates the possible mechanism of cv adsorption onto hs and nano hs according to the ftir results the charged molecules of cv were adsorbed by the various functional groups onto the hs or nano hs mainly co cc co and the oh that were available from the adsorbents various adsorption mechanisms would be involved namely hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction π π interaction and n π interaction 68 as a result the hydrophobicity of the adsorbents will be increased furthermore as revealed in fig 6c the cv adsorption onto hs starts with fast transportation of cv to the liquid film from the bulk solution which can be attributed to the intense mixing throughout the experiment after that the negatively charged outer surface will readily attract the positively charged cv leading to a moderate fast channel diffusion hs oh hs o h hs o cv cl hs o cv hs oh cv cl hs o cv hcl the cv equilibrium configurations reactivity and interactions onto nano hs were proposed based on the conceptual density functional theory and the discussion of el haouti et al 70 el haouti et al 70 investigated the adsorption mechanisms of two cationic dyes toluidine blue tb and cv onto a nano clay fig 7 shows various parameters that were used to describe the chemical reactions eq 1 3 represents the one electron energies for the mentioned parameter of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo the change in the chemical stasis of cv molecules on the nano hs surface is illustrated in fig 7 from various orientations the adsorbed molecules of cv cations had a comparatively lower adsorption rate 33 formed a single layer during the adsorption process the aromatic rings of cv molecules are positioned towards the nano hs surface the interconnection between the h atom of the ch3 groups of cv molecule and the nano hs surface will be maximized due to the orientation of the aromatic moieties the monolayer formation specifies that the adsorption was a chemisorption process that also agrees with the findings from the adsorption experiments fig 8a c shows the adsorption mechanism of the cv into the intra intermolecular hydrogen bonding pattern of cellulose structure 71 hemicellulose and lignin 68 and the proposed configurations of cv adsorption onto nano hs this could be through face to face adsorption single edge adsorption cellulose single edge adsorption hemicellulose single edge adsorption lignin face to face adsorption loaded cv and single edge adsorption cellulose hemicellulose and lignin 70 as the load increases to 66 and 100 some adsorbed molecules would either form a flat orientation by settling flat on the basal surface while some may form a combination of tilted and random piles the neat positive charge that is present on the studied cv ions is not limited to the n atom but delocalized on the whole cv usually the electrostatic and secondarily van der waals interactions between cv and the oxygen atoms of the cellulose hemicellulose and lignin are predominantly attractive this also indicates high dispersion of the cv and chemically electrical interactions between cv and nano hs surface π π stacking hydrogen bond etc additionally the free conjugated electrons in cv play an essential part in the adsorption process by the interfacial interactions between cv molecules and cellulose hemicellulose and lignin components in the nano hs surface the energy components that were considered during the adsorption were both bonded and non bonded interactions such as electrostatic and van der waals involved in interaction energy 3 6 effect of concentration on the adsorption capacity of hs and nano hs the amount of the cv ions adsorbed on the adsorbent is a function of concentration at equilibrium therefore increasing the initial cv concentration caused the cv adsorption onto hs and nano hs to increase this is also predictable as it suggests the mass transfer of cv on the available adsorption sites on hs surfaces as the concentration increased the adsorption capacity of hs also increased as seen in fig 9 the adsorption capacity on hs increased from from19 77 mg g to 325 09 mg g and 20 mg g to 304 mg g on nano hs additionally there was a notable increase in the adsorption capacity from 20 mg l to 500 mg l this could be due to the high driving and attractive forces such as electrostatic force and van der waals force between the cv and the adsorbent molecules and on the adsorbents sites surface 61 additionally the fast diffusion of cv onto hs can also be associated with the rapid pore diffusion into the intraparticle matrixes which consists of various chromophore groups as identified earlier that caused equilibrium rapidly 52 furthermore the rapid increase in cv adsorption on hs is also due to a high driving force for cv ions transfer which was maximized in a concentrated solution 74 it was found that the adsorption capacity was better with a more concentrated solution 40 however the adsorption capacity declined from 700 mg l which can be due to no vacant sites available on hs surface this indicates that the sites on the adsorbent have reached saturation and therefore cannot adsorb more cv in other words the decrease in adsorption rate was caused due to an increase in the surface loading of cv ions thus initially the adsorption was very rapid and high then a slower adsorption rate was followed due to the gradual decrease in the adsorption site the highest adsorption capacity is 325 09 mg g and 304 mg g in fig 9 and 4 8 at 500 mg l of the initial dye of cv the intraparticle diffusion process may give information regarding the adsorption mechanism of cv onto the adsorbents moreover fig 9 illustrates a tetra linear graph that implies that in the adsorption mechanism there were four major steps namely i the cv molecules were attracted as a monolayer or multilayer at the external surface of the adsorbent for the hs the pore size was bigger than the nano hs indicating the possibility of the cv molecules getting inside the pores which were slightly below the surface iii inner pores adsorption by the cv molecules and iv equilibrium and the possibility of desorption at high concentration 75 table 2 shows a compilation of various studies that used agricultural waste to remove dyes and their maximum adsorption capacity franco et al 52 found a similar mechanism of cv adsorption onto pecan pericarp as well as karaçetin et al 42 also found a similar trend of methylene blue adsorption onto hs two way anova was performed to authenticate the data for the effect of concentration and ph on the adsorption process according to table 3 the p value for the effect of ph for both hs and nano hs was less than 0 05 indicating the reactions were significantly different for the effect of initial concentration the ph value for nano hs was less than 0 05 while f value was greater than f critic this showed that the adsorption of cv onto nano hs was significantly affected by the effect of the initial concentration of cv while for hs the p value was greater than 0 05 implying that the effect of initial dye concentration was not significantly affected in fig 9 at a low concentration region initial cv concentration 200 mg l the cv molecules form a monolayer coverage on the adsorbents surface until all the available sites are saturated on the other hand by increasing the cv concentration higher than 400 mg l an inflection point in the isotherm can be observed this increase in cv uptake may specify that the adsorption mechanism has changed to a multilayer adsorption step fig 10 illustrates the monolayer multilayer adsorption of cv onto the adsorbent two active sites must be reflected namely the original active sites at the adsorbent surface and novel active sites i e in succession adsorbed onto previously adsorbed cv molecules 76 as follows 4 cv s k 1 cv sk 1 cv s cv s first adsorption layer 5 cv cv s k 2 c v 2 s k 2 c v 2 s cv cv s second adsorption layer 6 cv c v 2 s k 3 c v 3 s k 3 c v 3 s cv c v 2 s third adsorption layer 7 cv c v n 1 s kn c v n s kn c v n s cv c v n 1 s nth adsorption layer where cv is a crystal violet molecule s is a free surface adsorbent site cvn s is a multilayer complex at the surface and k1 k2 k3 kn are the equilibrium constants related to each i layer respectively besides a strong dependence from the adsorption capacity with the temperature can be observed in fig 11 especially at high cv concentrations this is clearly shown for the hs adsorbent comparing to the nano hs however by increasing the solution temperature the adsorption curves illustrate a significant increase in this inclination this shows that multilayer adsorption is significantly favored by the temperature in conclusion the cv adsorption process onto hs could happen by two different adsorption mechanisms depending on the experimental conditions such as the solution temperature and the initial cv concentration 3 7 effect of temperature fig 11 shows the influence of temperature on the adsorption capacity of hs and nano hs the adsorption of cv on hs favored endothermic conditions in general the increase in temperature also increased adsorption capacity for example at 25 c 282 11 mg g of cv was adsorbed as compared to 335 50 mg g at 45 c an increase in adsorption capacity can be due to the increase in the diffusion rate of the adsorbate molecules throughout the external and internal boundary of the internal pores of hs due to the decrease in solution viscosity additionally an increase in temperature also influences the biosorption activity by increasing the kinetic energy of the solute as well as the surface activity additionally it is also possible that high temperature favored the interaction between chromophore groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic of the hazelnut shell and the cationic group on cv dye furthermore electrostatic attraction forces and hydrogen bonding between the oh group of hs shell and nitrogen atom in cv might have taken place at high temperatures 40 similar findings were observed in a study by derafa zaghouane boudiaf 74 who investigated the adsorption capacity of cv and concluded that the adsorption capacity was enhanced at a higher temperature as well as karaçetin et al 42 who concluded that an increase in temperature was favorable for mb adsorption onto hs while on the other hand nano hs favored exothermic conditions as observed from fig 11 at 25 c 567 45 mg g was the highest adsorption rate achieved which decreased to 291 36 mg g and 109 29 mg g at 35 c and 45 c respectively this can be explained due to a physical modification of the adsorbent that might have taken place at high temperatures the pores might have surged which caused a decrease in adsorption capacity 3 8 adsorption isotherm the adsorption studies aid in outlining how adsorbate molecules interact with an adsorbent four isotherm models langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherm were studied in this study these isotherm models will show the dispersal of dyes ions between the solid and liquid phase which helps in providing qualitative information for any adsorption process table 4 shows the four isothermal model and their relevant calculated parameters constants and correlation coefficients langmuir isotherm presumes that the adsorption of cv on the hs and nano hs occurred on a homogenous surface and no further adsorption could occur the correlation coefficient r2 was close to 1 for hs 0 92 0 93 for the langmuir isotherm and for nano hs it was between 0 90 and 0 96 suggesting that the langmuir isotherm could be used to explain the adsorption of cv onto hs furthermore for hs the maximum adsorption capacity q indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity increased as the temperature from 133 33 mg g at 25 c while 181 82 mg g at 45 c however for the nano hs the maximum adsorption capacity decreased as the temperature increased from 294 12 at 25 c to 133 33 mg g at 45 c additionally the affinity between the adsorbate and adsorbent is denoted by k l which demonstrated a strong binding at 25 c for hs while for nano hs it showed high affinity at 45 c freundlich isotherm assumes that the adsorption took place on a heterogeneous and multilayer surface 77 the adsorption capacity kf of hs and nano hs showed an overall increase as the temperature increased from 4 10 mg g g l 1 n at 25 c and 3 33 mg g g l 1 n for nano hs which increased to 4 40 mg g g l 1 n and 4 07 mg g g l 1 n at 45 c the highest coefficient relation for hs was 0 85 while nano hs was reported to be 0 89 at 35 c the constant freundlich n is referred to as the adsorption intensity of adsorbents the n value indicates whether the reaction was chemical or physical adsorption the values for both hs and nano hs were greater than 1 indicating the adsorption was best explained as physical adsorption generally the value of 1 n was higher than 1 which indicated the adsorption process was favorable 22 the dubinin radushkevich d r was not suitable to describe the adsorption process of cv onto hs and nano hs as the r2 value was between 0 65 and 0 73 for hs and 0 62 0 80 for nano hs additionally d r is considered more applicable for a single solute adsorption type due to its characterization of good performance and easy mathematical equations 49 lastly temkin isotherm was also not best fitted as the r2 values were 0 34 0 87 for hs and 0 50 0 95 for nano hs ahmed et al 57 also studied the removal of cv and rejected temkin due to low correlation efficiency tran et al 51 evaluated the methylene blue adsorption on carbonaceous hydrochar and found that the adsorption process was best described by the langmuir model from the data tabulated in table 4 it is evident that the adsorption process of hs and nano hs can be best described using the langmuir model this model assumes that the adsorption was on a monolayer without any internal interaction between adsorbed ions additionally the adsorption occurred on a homogenous site additionally the maximum adsorption capacity for hs was 181 82 mg g and 294 12 mg g for nano hs additionally it is also evident nano hs is a better adsorbent for cv this can be due to the formation of deeper cavities and the general morphology of nano cv table 5 shows a comparison of the current study against other studies that have used different adsorbents to remove cv from an aqueous solution the table shows that hs had commendable adsorption capacity in contrast to other agricultural waste thus it can be concluded hs 181 82 mg g and nano hs 294 12 mg g can prove to be excellent adsorbents to remove cv by comparing with other low cost adsorbents it is evident that the value of qmax obtained in the current study is higher in contrast to other reported adsorbents moreover hs can be considered as an applicable adsorbent for the removal of other cationic dyes which can be attributed to the fact that cationic dyes adsorption decreases in an acidic environment i e low ph value due to the excess existence of h ions that will compete with the cationic dyes for the available active sites on the adsorbent surface increasing the solution ph will increase the removal efficiency due to the less electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent surface and the positively charged cationic dyes in addition due to the presence of oh and coo functional groups the adsorption of cationic dyes is more favored at ph phpzc furthermore the carboxyl groups present on the surface of hs as a major negative functional group will bear with the cationic dyes and enhance its adsorption cellulose based adsorbents like hs can adsorb cationic dyes through columbic attraction because of the negatively charged surface that is acquired by hs cellulosic material in contact with water our results are in line with ferrero 41 who investigated the removal of methylene blue from an aqueous medium by hs and found that the langmuir isotherm model best fitted the experimental data and the adsorption capacity increases with increasing the ph value similarly doğan et al 40 found that removal of cationic dyes by hs increased significantly with increasing the initial concentration and temperature this can be attributed to the fact that changing the solution temperature for the adsorption of cationic dye leads to the increase in the diffusion rate of dye molecules across the external boundary layer as well as in the hs internal pores the applicability of hs on the adsorption of different cationic dyes was supported by karaçetin et al 42 who observed that cationic dye adsorption is an endothermic and spontaneous process 3 9 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic parameters for instance change in entropy s changes in enthalpy δh and the gibbs free energy δg can be used to indicate the thermodynamic viability of the adsorption process the positive δh table 6 for hs indicates that the reaction was endothermic as the temperature increased the value of δg also increased indicating that the reaction was favorable and spontaneous and the favorability declined as the temperature increased while the positive value of s indicated a good affinity between cv and hs this can be due to several various forces such as van der waals electrostatic 79 80 the negative value of h signifies that the cv adsorption onto nano hs was an exothermic reaction the high value of s further indicated a good affinity of cv ions on to hs nanoparticles which caused an increase in randomness 50 lastly the positive value of δg greater than 20 kj mol indicates that the reaction requires energy input and physical absorption was reconfirmed regardless of the temperature similar findings were found in a study by silva et al 30 the gibbs free energy of nanoparticles increases as temperature increases furthermore the positive values of the adsorption gibbs free energy are higher at higher temperatures which suggests adsorptions become less favorable at higher temperatures in addition there is an inverse relationship between adsorption gibbs free energy and diameter d of the particle size at a given temperature 81 the result indicates that the nano hs has a negative effect on the entropy and the enthalpy this could be explained as nano hs can produce a strong surface effect and the effect of the surface area on the adsorption gibbs free energy is substantial this means that the chemical potential at the nanoscale level μ should reflect both the bulk μb and the interfacial μi parts as 8 μ μ b μ i μ b 4 σv d where v is the molar volume of the nano adsorbent and σ is the surface tension therefore the gibbs free energy of nanoparticles could be as 9 δg δg b σ σ 4 v d where σ is the surface tension of the adsorption product in a saturated state denotes adsorption equilibrium in the current study there could be an increase in the surface tension after adsorption which means that σ is bigger than σ and the gibbs free energy of nanoparticles becomes more positive in the case of nano hs fig 12 3 10 desorption studies regeneration of hs and nano hs the desorption studies were performed to assess the reusability of hs and nano hs to remediate cv from an aqueous solution the hs and nano hs after the adsorption experiments were subjected to cv desorption using ethanol solution and acetic acid 1 0 m for 24 h the repeatability study was conducted three times 88 01 and 70 86 were the average desorption removal efficiency recorded respectively which indicated that both adsorbents could successfully be used repeatedly for cv dye adsorption this can be due to the strong interaction between cv and nano hs in comparison to hs 3 11 cost analysis when comparing the efficiency of an adsorbent the cost of the adsorbent plays a crucial role 83 it is considered vital when determining the success of any adsorption treatment techniques usually a sorbent is considered cost effective when the material is available in nature or requires little to no modification to enhance its adsorption capabilities in this study a cost effective method was used to remediate cv from an aqueous solution using an agro waste it aimed to use sustainable material by recycling hazelnut shells which are typically discarded and regarded as waste in addition the chemicals such as hcl and naoh that were used in the study were of very low concentration and volume electricity used while performing the experiment was the only cost that this study required additionally by calculating the maximum adsorption capacity and comparing it with other viable options it proved hs could be replaced as an effective adsorbent material to remove cv from an aqueous solution 4 conclusion this study suggested hs as a successful adsorbent for cv removal the adsorption process preferred a basic environment which enhanced the surface structure of hs to enhance adsorption additionally the various functional group identified from ftir also played a major role before and after sem images revealed that hs was a heterogeneous highly porous and deep cavities surface which helped in capturing cv ions onto the adsorbent the presence of cv ions after adsorption confirmed the success of the adsorption binding of cv on the hs and nano hs adsorbent langmuir isotherm best describes the adsorption process for both hs and nano hs with r2 values higher than 0 90 the maximum

13261,this paper discusses the nanoadsorption mechanisms of crystal violet cv using a nano hazelnut shell nano hs from an aqueous solution the effect of various factors such as ph temperature and initial cv concentration on the adsorption process was also evaluated the physical and chemical characterizations of hazelnut shells hs and nano hs were studied using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscope tem various functional groups including oh co ch and co were identified that are facilitated the cv sorption onto the adsorbents additionally the sem revealed the adsorbents as a heterogeneous structure with deep cavities and high porosity which is thought to play a vital role in capturing and binding the cv ions onto the surface of the adsorbent the optimum ph in this study was reported to be 10 while langmuir isotherm was identified as the best suited model to describe the adsorption process with a 93

sem sodium hydroxide naoh 1 introduction water pollution has increased exponentially with the increase in the human population as such textile industry is considered one of the major industries that consume a high quantity of chemicals and water and as a result produces environmentally hazardous wastewater 1 the use of dyes in recent years has increased exponentially according to ben mansour et al 2 around 800 000 tons of dyes are produced every year cationic dyes are most commonly used due to their high solubility and ease of dyeing various fabrics including silk wool paper and acrylic 3 due to the excess use of such products the water discharged from the industry consists of various hazardous chemicals including heavy metals azodyes bisphenol a bpa suspended solids high chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod 4 dyes cannot undergo degradation hence are present in water bodies for a very long time which can prevent the passage of light into the water this has become one of the most crucial environmental issues such hindrance can affect photosynthetic activities which can affect the water quality and leads to gas solubility and also affect the aquatic life and the food web 5 the maximum discharge limits and toxicological effects of most dyes on the environment and human health are not yet established however the color limit and measurement are only required as specific limits for dyes and colored water limits however the typical characteristic of textile effluent is 50 2500 pt co unit and the effluent color limitation is 100 pt co unit 5 6 as such one of the members of the triphenylmethane class of dyes is crystal violet cv cv is cationic and is readily used in textile paper and other fields and subsequently found in wastewater effluent cv is considered carcinogenic hazardous and mutagenic for living organisms and categorized as a rebellious molecule that is non biodegradable hence persists in the environment for a very long time 7 in addition it is known to be detrimental for both aquatic animals and humans for aquatic animals it is known to be responsible for mitotic poisoning which is associated with the abnormal accumulation of metaphases tumors in fishes as well as hepatocarcinoma reticular cell sarcoma in various organs including the ovary bladder and uterus 8 while in humans it can cause chemical cystitis irritation of the skin and digestive tracts respiratory and renal failure 9 therefore appropriate methods to eliminate these pollutants from water are necessary before releasing them into the environment 10 wastewater treatment can be classified into three major groups i physical treatment ii biological treatment and iii chemical treatment fig 1 illustrates some of their methods and the advantages and disadvantages associated with them although existing technologies such as membrane processes chemical reactions sedimentation biological process precipitation electrochemical ion exchange coagulation flocculation and flotation may be efficient for removing cv from wastewater they are rather expensive and time consuming 11 while electrochemical degradation and nanofiltration have not been identified as optimum solutions 12 14 adsorption on the other hand has emerged as a promising technique for treating aqueous effluent owing to its simplicity and cost effectiveness over the years there have been several studies enriched with adsorption techniques for cationic dye removal from the liquid solution such vast studies have shown agricultural based adsorbents as a promising alternative to the current conventional materials that are readily used 15 17 additionally in recent years emerging technology incorporates nanoparticle based adsorbents several researchers have investigated the adsorption of dyes using various agricultural waste including shoukat et al 18 used mango stone for cv removal and found adsorption capacity as 52 6 mg g nguyen et al 19 investigated the efficient removal of toxic organic dyes using a zirconium organic framework as a recyclable nano adsorbent methylene blue and methyl orange were chosen as model dye pollutants it had a superior maximum capacity 746 mg g and 726 mg g respectively and reusability over several cycles of the adsorption raza et al 20 studied the adsorption of organic dyes using a 2d copper ii carboxylate framework three organic dyes namely methylene blue methyl orange and methyl red were studied the dye removal efficiency was attributed to the shapes synergy among structure dimensions and ionic strength of dyes to the adsorbent structure on the other hand moharrami motamedi 21 prepared cellulose nanocrystals from agricultural waste and obtained 2500 mg g and 1428 6 mg g adsorption capacity for cv and methylene blue respectively similarly other studies include potatoes plant waste 22 date palm leaves 23 agro industrial 24 peanut hull waste biomass 25 sugarcane bagasse soot 26 and hyacinth 27 while putri et al 28 have reported successful removal of cationic dyes from aqueous solution as well as effluents in addition to being low cost such materials also inherent other advantages including minimization of waste yet delivering high efficiency in dilute solution no additional requirement of nutrient ease of operation and non hazardous to the environment 29 cellulose is one of the key molecules that are found in various agricultural by products which has been reported to be useful in the adsorption process cellulosic biomaterials are suitable adsorbents due to their richness in organic functional groups such as carbonyl amine hydroxyl carboxyl ester amide and others 30 31 cellulosic biomass is a heterogeneous substance that consists of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin as well as a complex polymer of phenylpropane units 32 generally the biosorption capacity of biosorbents depends on several parameters including the physicochemical properties of the biosorbent the presence of other competing ions and various factors such as temperature and ph hazelnut shells hs exist in large quantities around to world as food waste hs consists of various polar functions including alcoholic carboxylic and carboxylic which can facilitate sorbent and pollutant binding 33 additionally hs is beneficial because of its microporous and mesoporous structure and large surface area just like other agricultural waste hs is also rich in lignin cellulose and hemicellulose various literature including uyan et al 34 senol 35 and hosgün et al 36 demirkaya et al 37 and gozaydin yuksel 38 studied the chemical morphology of hs all studies found lignin as a dominant polymer present in hs while cellulose and hemicellulose percentages varied according to region moreover hs can be used in a broader context and remove other cationic dyes from an aqueous medium various studies were conducted to understand the adsorption mechanism of cationic dyes by hs 39 43 nanoparticles have widely been used as adsorbents for water and wastewater matrices and have unique adsorption properties compared with corresponding bulk particles 13 44 47 the effect of nanoparticle size is not well understood hence it is vital to investigate the effect of nanoparticle size on the overall nanoadsorption processes and thermodynamics based on our knowledge no study has investigated the removal of cv by nanoparticles of hazelnut shells keeping the efficiency and importance of biosorption the present study aims to assess the efficiency and the potential of using a nano hazelnut shell nano hs for cv adsorption the effects of ph temperature initial cv concentration and particle size on the cv adsorption mechanisms onto hs and nano hs were carried out additionally the experimental data were modeled in four different isotherms namely langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin over and above the effect of nanoparticle size on the adsorption thermodynamics was investigated 2 methodology 2 1 materials collection and preparation hazelnut shells hs and hs nanoparticles nano hs hazelnut shells were collected from a local qatari market the shells were cracked compressed and sieved using a mechanical sieve retsch 5657 haan w germany to obtain different particle size ranges each particle size range was collected stored in a glass bottle and kept in a dry place the 0 125 mm 0 250 mm range was used throughout the hs experiments the hs nanoparticles nano hs were attained from cryomill retsch cryomill the nano hs were washed with distilled water three times and dried in the oven overnight at 65 c 2 2 preparation of stock solution of crystal violet a stock solution of 1000 mg l of cv was prepared in distilled water the cv was obtained from breckland scientific supplies ltd chemical formula c25h30n3cl molecular weight 407 98 g mol λmax 591 nm 2 3 characterization of the adsorbents hs and nano hs physical and chemical characterizations of hs and nano hs were studied scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem 50 series and transmission electron microscope tem were used to determine the surface characterization and understand the morphology of the adsorbent brunauer emmett teller bet quantachrome corporation nova 3000 was used to determine the surface areas and pore size distribution fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using a universal attenuated total reflectance sensor ftir uatr perkinelmer spectrum range 400 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 was used to determine the functional group present on the surface of the adsorbents 2 4 the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity of cv onto hs and nano hs the adsorption experiment for the effect of ph was carried out at different ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 the diverse ph values of cv solution were adjusted by adding 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh and 0 1 m hydrochloric acid hcl solution using a ph meter ph meter jenway 370 a mass of 0 05 g of the adsorbent was added to the glass beaker subsequently the samples were kept in the rotary shaker brunswick innova 2100 2150 shaker at 160 rpm for 48 h the defined adsorption equilibrium time at room temperature then the bottles were removed filtrated and analyzed using a uv vis spectrometer perkinelmer lambda 25 uv vis the experiments were performed in triplicate and the average values were used to demonstrate the results 2 5 effect of initial concentration and solution temperature on the adsorption capacity of cv onto hs and nano hs the batch adsorption experiments were carried out at different initial cv concentrations 20 mg l 50 mg l 100 mg l 200 mg l 300 mg l 400 mg l 500 mg l 700 mg l 800 mg l and 1000 mg l the mass m to volume v ratio m v was kept as 1 1 0 05 g of the adsorbent was added in the borosilicate glass bottles and the final volume was adjusted to 50 ml based on the ph batch adsorption experiment section 2 4 results the cv solution was adjusted to ph 10 for both adsorbents the bottles were placed in a rotary shaker brunswick innova 2100 2150 shaker at 25 c for 48 h at 160 rpm to determine the effect of temperature on the adsorption process the batch cv adsorption experiments were conducted at different solution temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c the same protocol was followed for hs to validate the data the experiments were performed in triplicates and average values were presented the solution was then filtered using a syringe and a 0 20 μm membrane filter and the nano hs size was filtered by first centrifuging heraeus megafuge 16 centrifuge series and then carrying out filtration the separated solutions were diluted prior to uv vis spectrophotometer analysis the adsorption capacity qe mg g was calculated by eq 1 48 1 q e c 0 c e v m 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium cv concentration mg l before and after adsorption receptively v is the cv solution volume l and m is the adsorbent mass g 2 6 adsorption isotherm table 1 shows the four isotherm models that were studied

3 and 4 50 2 ln k e h o rt s o r 3 δ g o rtln k e 4 δ g o δ h o tδ s o 2 8 statistical analysis the significant difference between the means of samples was determined using microsoft excel double factor two way anova furthermore it also helped to understand if there is any interaction between the two variables independent and dependent 3 result and discussion 3 1 ftir characterization fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of hs and nano hs before and after the cv adsorption the peak at 3320 cm 1 belongs to the oh functional group which is a common macromolecule found on cellulose lignin and hemicellulose 17 34 51 another possible explanation can also be the presence of water molecules 52 the peak at 2921 cm 1 in fig 2b is shifted to 2892 cm 1 after adsorption whichshowed the presence of ch stretch 19 53 the peaks are shown at 1735 cm 1 and 1731 cm 1 in fig 2a and 2b respectively suggesting the presence of the carboxylic acid group in hemicellulose 30 54 the bands around 1650 cm 1 and 1750 cm 1 in both fig 2a and 2b marked the presence of free esterified carboxyl groups while the bands at 1584 cm 1 and 1587 cm 1 in fig 2a and 2b respectively attributing to the co stretch of the carboxyl group of co 55 56 a strong sharp peak that was observed at 1024 cm 1 and 1014 cm 1 further confirmed the presence of cellulose in hs 55 lastly the presence of a peak in 1030 cm 1 1046 cm 1 was assigned to the co of alcohol and carboxylic acids 56 the ftir spectra indicated that the hs adsorbent in general consists of various carbons forms including aliphatic aromatic and cyclic as observed from the various peaks additionally it also demonstrates that hs in general has a heterogeneous surface with various functional groups present that will aid the adsorption of crystal violet ions furthermore the presence of such functional groups on the hazelnut shells including alcoholic carbonylic carboxylic and phenolic facilitated the adsorption rate by further increasing the negative charge leading to the high adsorption capacity of hs at high ph 57 fig 3 illustrates the major functional groups and the corresponding peaks that were reported for lignin hemicellulose and cellulose 44 58 59 the main composition of the three materials i e cellulose hemicellulose and lignin is alkanes esters aromatics ketones and alcohol with various oxygen containing functional groups it can be observed in fig 3 that there were two main absorbance regions approximately at low wavelengths 700 cm 1 1800 cm 1 and high wavelengths 2800 cm 1 3500 cm 1 the peak in the range of 1500 cm 1 to 1600 cm 1 corresponds to the aromatic ring vibrations which confirms the presence of lignin the absorbance around the 1730 cm 1 region could be attributed to the presence of methoxyloch3 aromatic cc and coc functional groups 58 3 2 scanning electron microscopy sem when comparing the surface pattern and porous forms of fig 4a and 4b it is apparent that hs appeared as a porous structure additionally irregular voids and pores were also shown in general both adsorbents appeared as irregular rough and mound surfaces moreover several layers of fibers that merged to form spirals are attributed to cellulose structure 60 these spiral like structures are expected to capture cv ions on the surface additionally the irregular and rough structures are evident for nano hs as seen in fig 4c and 4d these irregular morphologies are expected to facilitate the binding of cv onto the adsorbent while preventing desorption 61 it is evident that both adsorbents vary with their morphologies and have vivid different structures however nano hs is more heterogeneous and consists of a much rougher surface as oppose to hs this specific characteristic is expected to increase the chances of adsorption additionally the bet analysis revealed that nano hs has a larger surface area which is 4 885 m2 g and a high pore radius size of 76 3 nm while hs surface area was 3 709 m2 g and pore radius size was 50 6 nm these characteristics indeed will play an important role in the cv ions adsorption 62 63 additionally the edx data revealed that the particles had a high concentration of carbon 73 followed by oxygen 21 0 as shown in fig 5d the different regions of cv accumulation can be visualized from fig 4e 4h the successful capture of cv onto hs can be seen in fig 4e and 4f where the high porosity and deep cavities helped capture cv ions on the surface additionally as observed from sem and ftir hs in general consists of various functions that facilitated the binding of cv onto hs the intraparticle diffusion as observed in fig 4g and 4h occurred because of the effective pore volume diffusion generally the surface diffusion was insignificant owing to the intricate structure of the adsorbent a specific area was further examined in depth to have a further visualization of the adsorbent structure as shown in fig 5a and 5b both adsorbents exhibited an irregularly shaped particle with a rough surface and deep cavities additionally the particles possessed voids and bumps within their structure which were accessible for the adsorption of cv this is a favorable characteristic as it can increase the adsorption of cv onto the matter additionally it is also possible to visualize various regions for cv ions accumulation where mass adsorption of cv took place from ftir various functional groups of hs were identified which facilitated the binding of cv dye onto the surface due to the complexity of the hs surface it was assumed that cv could not move along the surface hence the surface diffusion into the adsorbent s particle was disregarded and considered negligible it was assumed that the intraparticle diffusion took place due to the effective pore volume diffusion and when the cv was trapped within the pores 3 3 tem analysis further observations of the nano hs structure were conducted by tem analysis as shown in fig 5c the size of the adsorbent and the inner pore distribution was not easily observed by sem analysis therefore the tem analysis was accomplished to further enhance the physical understanding of the adsorbent fig 5c shows the tem images as a well developed porous structure of the adsorbent that is homogeneously distributed additionally the nano hs exhibits an aggregated irregular surface with a high number of microspores and crevices at the surface the nano hs appeared as a conglomerate of very fine yet elongated particles as seen in fig 5c additionally the tem also suggests that the nanoparticles are present in cluster form of hs additionally the tem images confirmed the heterogeneity of nano hs adsorbent and irregular region of the adsorption process of the cv which can see as the darker region in fig 5c in general the tem images in high magnification show that the particles have the tendency to agglomerate additionally some areas also appeared as long irregular rod like structures le et al 64 found similar results in which the spherical structure of fe3o4 zno nanoparticles helped in the degradation of cv while gopi et al 65 noticed rod like structure in chitin nanoparticles whiskers facilitated cv adsorption 3 4 effect of the ph on the adsorption capacity it is clearly shown from fig 6a that the cv removal percentage increases with increasing ph from 2 to 8 and does not significantly increase at a ph value higher than 8 however ph 10 was reported to be the optimum ph the phzpc the total positive charges that are equal to the total negative charges exhibited a negative zeta potential value at all studied ph values it was shown that there was no isoelectric point the ph values and the zeta potentials were as follows at ph 3 11 mv ph 4 12 mv ph 6 35 mv ph 8 34 mv ph 10 41 mv the adsorption of cv onto hs is influenced by the ph solution the ph of the solution governs the interaction between cv and the adsorbent thus a change in ph solution directly influences their interaction and the ionizability of the functional groups this could be explained due to the electrostatic interaction between positively charged cv and the negatively charged on the adsorbent s surface 23 additionally at low ph the biosorption of cv is noted to be low due to the concentration of h ions present which results in repulsion between the cv ions eventually resulting in low adsorption 27 as the ph increased more negatively charged functional groups were accessible resulting in an increase in adsorption and a decrease in repulsion between the cations and adsorbents similar findings were also observed by doğan et al 40 who elucidated that negatively charged adsorbent was favorable for cv adsorption while on the other hand dabagh et al 66 reported no significant difference in adsorption capacity of cv onto novel fe3o4 graphene biochar composite and carpobrotus edulis moreover as the ph increased the cv adsorption onto the adsorbents reached up to 91 as seen in fig 6a it was also deduced that the ph of the solution provides a driving force to surpass the mass transfer s resistance between the cv ions and the adsorbent additionally empty sites at ph 8 and 9 were almost occupied as a result the reaction reached its equilibrium 3 5 adsorption mechanisms fig 6b proposes a schematic illustration of how cv ions might have bonded on the hs surface due to the complex chemical structure and the presence of many binding sites of the hs shell it is expected that cv can easily be adsorbed onto the surface it can be assumed that ion exchange electrostatic bond and hydrogen bonding can be the principal mechanism of cv removal the major components of such polymeric material shells are lignin cellulose and other phenolic compounds from the nature of the material as discussed earlier it can be speculated that lignin and cellulose are the active ion exchange compounds and phenolic groups present in the shell are the active site of adsorption activity 67 since the cv ions are positively charged the uptake of the cv molecule onto the external surface of the hs or hs nano would decrease the negativity charges on the adsorbent fig 6c illustrates the possible mechanism of cv adsorption onto hs and nano hs according to the ftir results the charged molecules of cv were adsorbed by the various functional groups onto the hs or nano hs mainly co cc co and the oh that were available from the adsorbents various adsorption mechanisms would be involved namely hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction π π interaction and n π interaction 68 as a result the hydrophobicity of the adsorbents will be increased furthermore as revealed in fig 6c the cv adsorption onto hs starts with fast transportation of cv to the liquid film from the bulk solution which can be attributed to the intense mixing throughout the experiment after that the negatively charged outer surface will readily attract the positively charged cv leading to a moderate fast channel diffusion hs oh hs o h hs o cv cl hs o cv hs oh cv cl hs o cv hcl the cv equilibrium configurations reactivity and interactions onto nano hs were proposed based on the conceptual density functional theory and the discussion of el haouti et al 70 el haouti et al 70 investigated the adsorption mechanisms of two cationic dyes toluidine blue tb and cv onto a nano clay fig 7 shows various parameters that were used to describe the chemical reactions eq 1 3 represents the one electron energies for the mentioned parameter of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo the change in the chemical stasis of cv molecules on the nano hs surface is illustrated in fig 7 from various orientations the adsorbed molecules of cv cations had a comparatively lower adsorption rate 33 formed a single layer during the adsorption process the aromatic rings of cv molecules are positioned towards the nano hs surface the interconnection between the h atom of the ch3 groups of cv molecule and the nano hs surface will be maximized due to the orientation of the aromatic moieties the monolayer formation specifies that the adsorption was a chemisorption process that also agrees with the findings from the adsorption experiments fig 8a c shows the adsorption mechanism of the cv into the intra intermolecular hydrogen bonding pattern of cellulose structure 71 hemicellulose and lignin 68 and the proposed configurations of cv adsorption onto nano hs this could be through face to face adsorption single edge adsorption cellulose single edge adsorption hemicellulose single edge adsorption lignin face to face adsorption loaded cv and single edge adsorption cellulose hemicellulose and lignin 70 as the load increases to 66 and 100 some adsorbed molecules would either form a flat orientation by settling flat on the basal surface while some may form a combination of tilted and random piles the neat positive charge that is present on the studied cv ions is not limited to the n atom but delocalized on the whole cv usually the electrostatic and secondarily van der waals interactions between cv and the oxygen atoms of the cellulose hemicellulose and lignin are predominantly attractive this also indicates high dispersion of the cv and chemically electrical interactions between cv and nano hs surface π π stacking hydrogen bond etc additionally the free conjugated electrons in cv play an essential part in the adsorption process by the interfacial interactions between cv molecules and cellulose hemicellulose and lignin components in the nano hs surface the energy components that were considered during the adsorption were both bonded and non bonded interactions such as electrostatic and van der waals involved in interaction energy 3 6 effect of concentration on the adsorption capacity of hs and nano hs the amount of the cv ions adsorbed on the adsorbent is a function of concentration at equilibrium therefore increasing the initial cv concentration caused the cv adsorption onto hs and nano hs to increase this is also predictable as it suggests the mass transfer of cv on the available adsorption sites on hs surfaces as the concentration increased the adsorption capacity of hs also increased as seen in fig 9 the adsorption capacity on hs increased from from19 77 mg g to 325 09 mg g and 20 mg g to 304 mg g on nano hs additionally there was a notable increase in the adsorption capacity from 20 mg l to 500 mg l this could be due to the high driving and attractive forces such as electrostatic force and van der waals force between the cv and the adsorbent molecules and on the adsorbents sites surface 61 additionally the fast diffusion of cv onto hs can also be associated with the rapid pore diffusion into the intraparticle matrixes which consists of various chromophore groups as identified earlier that caused equilibrium rapidly 52 furthermore the rapid increase in cv adsorption on hs is also due to a high driving force for cv ions transfer which was maximized in a concentrated solution 74 it was found that the adsorption capacity was better with a more concentrated solution 40 however the adsorption capacity declined from 700 mg l which can be due to no vacant sites available on hs surface this indicates that the sites on the adsorbent have reached saturation and therefore cannot adsorb more cv in other words the decrease in adsorption rate was caused due to an increase in the surface loading of cv ions thus initially the adsorption was very rapid and high then a slower adsorption rate was followed due to the gradual decrease in the adsorption site the highest adsorption capacity is 325 09 mg g and 304 mg g in fig 9 and 4 8 at 500 mg l of the initial dye of cv the intraparticle diffusion process may give information regarding the adsorption mechanism of cv onto the adsorbents moreover fig 9 illustrates a tetra linear graph that implies that in the adsorption mechanism there were four major steps namely i the cv molecules were attracted as a monolayer or multilayer at the external surface of the adsorbent for the hs the pore size was bigger than the nano hs indicating the possibility of the cv molecules getting inside the pores which were slightly below the surface iii inner pores adsorption by the cv molecules and iv equilibrium and the possibility of desorption at high concentration 75 table 2 shows a compilation of various studies that used agricultural waste to remove dyes and their maximum adsorption capacity franco et al 52 found a similar mechanism of cv adsorption onto pecan pericarp as well as karaçetin et al 42 also found a similar trend of methylene blue adsorption onto hs two way anova was performed to authenticate the data for the effect of concentration and ph on the adsorption process according to table 3 the p value for the effect of ph for both hs and nano hs was less than 0 05 indicating the reactions were significantly different for the effect of initial concentration the ph value for nano hs was less than 0 05 while f value was greater than f critic this showed that the adsorption of cv onto nano hs was significantly affected by the effect of the initial concentration of cv while for hs the p value was greater than 0 05 implying that the effect of initial dye concentration was not significantly affected in fig 9 at a low concentration region initial cv concentration 200 mg l the cv molecules form a monolayer coverage on the adsorbents surface until all the available sites are saturated on the other hand by increasing the cv concentration higher than 400 mg l an inflection point in the isotherm can be observed this increase in cv uptake may specify that the adsorption mechanism has changed to a multilayer adsorption step fig 10 illustrates the monolayer multilayer adsorption of cv onto the adsorbent two active sites must be reflected namely the original active sites at the adsorbent surface and novel active sites i e in succession adsorbed onto previously adsorbed cv molecules 76 as follows 4 cv s k 1 cv sk 1 cv s cv s first adsorption layer 5 cv cv s k 2 c v 2 s k 2 c v 2 s cv cv s second adsorption layer 6 cv c v 2 s k 3 c v 3 s k 3 c v 3 s cv c v 2 s third adsorption layer 7 cv c v n 1 s kn c v n s kn c v n s cv c v n 1 s nth adsorption layer where cv is a crystal violet molecule s is a free surface adsorbent site cvn s is a multilayer complex at the surface and k1 k2 k3 kn are the equilibrium constants related to each i layer respectively besides a strong dependence from the adsorption capacity with the temperature can be observed in fig 11 especially at high cv concentrations this is clearly shown for the hs adsorbent comparing to the nano hs however by increasing the solution temperature the adsorption curves illustrate a significant increase in this inclination this shows that multilayer adsorption is significantly favored by the temperature in conclusion the cv adsorption process onto hs could happen by two different adsorption mechanisms depending on the experimental conditions such as the solution temperature and the initial cv concentration 3 7 effect of temperature fig 11 shows the influence of temperature on the adsorption capacity of hs and nano hs the adsorption of cv on hs favored endothermic conditions in general the increase in temperature also increased adsorption capacity for example at 25 c 282 11 mg g of cv was adsorbed as compared to 335 50 mg g at 45 c an increase in adsorption capacity can be due to the increase in the diffusion rate of the adsorbate molecules throughout the external and internal boundary of the internal pores of hs due to the decrease in solution viscosity additionally an increase in temperature also influences the biosorption activity by increasing the kinetic energy of the solute as well as the surface activity additionally it is also possible that high temperature favored the interaction between chromophore groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic of the hazelnut shell and the cationic group on cv dye furthermore electrostatic attraction forces and hydrogen bonding between the oh group of hs shell and nitrogen atom in cv might have taken place at high temperatures 40 similar findings were observed in a study by derafa zaghouane boudiaf 74 who investigated the adsorption capacity of cv and concluded that the adsorption capacity was enhanced at a higher temperature as well as karaçetin et al 42 who concluded that an increase in temperature was favorable for mb adsorption onto hs while on the other hand nano hs favored exothermic conditions as observed from fig 11 at 25 c 567 45 mg g was the highest adsorption rate achieved which decreased to 291 36 mg g and 109 29 mg g at 35 c and 45 c respectively this can be explained due to a physical modification of the adsorbent that might have taken place at high temperatures the pores might have surged which caused a decrease in adsorption capacity 3 8 adsorption isotherm the adsorption studies aid in outlining how adsorbate molecules interact with an adsorbent four isotherm models langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherm were studied in this study these isotherm models will show the dispersal of dyes ions between the solid and liquid phase which helps in providing qualitative information for any adsorption process table 4 shows the four isothermal model and their relevant calculated parameters constants and correlation coefficients langmuir isotherm presumes that the adsorption of cv on the hs and nano hs occurred on a homogenous surface and no further adsorption could occur the correlation coefficient r2 was close to 1 for hs 0 92 0 93 for the langmuir isotherm and for nano hs it was between 0 90 and 0 96 suggesting that the langmuir isotherm could be used to explain the adsorption of cv onto hs furthermore for hs the maximum adsorption capacity q indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity increased as the temperature from 133 33 mg g at 25 c while 181 82 mg g at 45 c however for the nano hs the maximum adsorption capacity decreased as the temperature increased from 294 12 at 25 c to 133 33 mg g at 45 c additionally the affinity between the adsorbate and adsorbent is denoted by k l which demonstrated a strong binding at 25 c for hs while for nano hs it showed high affinity at 45 c freundlich isotherm assumes that the adsorption took place on a heterogeneous and multilayer surface 77 the adsorption capacity kf of hs and nano hs showed an overall increase as the temperature increased from 4 10 mg g g l 1 n at 25 c and 3 33 mg g g l 1 n for nano hs which increased to 4 40 mg g g l 1 n and 4 07 mg g g l 1 n at 45 c the highest coefficient relation for hs was 0 85 while nano hs was reported to be 0 89 at 35 c the constant freundlich n is referred to as the adsorption intensity of adsorbents the n value indicates whether the reaction was chemical or physical adsorption the values for both hs and nano hs were greater than 1 indicating the adsorption was best explained as physical adsorption generally the value of 1 n was higher than 1 which indicated the adsorption process was favorable 22 the dubinin radushkevich d r was not suitable to describe the adsorption process of cv onto hs and nano hs as the r2 value was between 0 65 and 0 73 for hs and 0 62 0 80 for nano hs additionally d r is considered more applicable for a single solute adsorption type due to its characterization of good performance and easy mathematical equations 49 lastly temkin isotherm was also not best fitted as the r2 values were 0 34 0 87 for hs and 0 50 0 95 for nano hs ahmed et al 57 also studied the removal of cv and rejected temkin due to low correlation efficiency tran et al 51 evaluated the methylene blue adsorption on carbonaceous hydrochar and found that the adsorption process was best described by the langmuir model from the data tabulated in table 4 it is evident that the adsorption process of hs and nano hs can be best described using the langmuir model this model assumes that the adsorption was on a monolayer without any internal interaction between adsorbed ions additionally the adsorption occurred on a homogenous site additionally the maximum adsorption capacity for hs was 181 82 mg g and 294 12 mg g for nano hs additionally it is also evident nano hs is a better adsorbent for cv this can be due to the formation of deeper cavities and the general morphology of nano cv table 5 shows a comparison of the current study against other studies that have used different adsorbents to remove cv from an aqueous solution the table shows that hs had commendable adsorption capacity in contrast to other agricultural waste thus it can be concluded hs 181 82 mg g and nano hs 294 12 mg g can prove to be excellent adsorbents to remove cv by comparing with other low cost adsorbents it is evident that the value of qmax obtained in the current study is higher in contrast to other reported adsorbents moreover hs can be considered as an applicable adsorbent for the removal of other cationic dyes which can be attributed to the fact that cationic dyes adsorption decreases in an acidic environment i e low ph value due to the excess existence of h ions that will compete with the cationic dyes for the available active sites on the adsorbent surface increasing the solution ph will increase the removal efficiency due to the less electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent surface and the positively charged cationic dyes in addition due to the presence of oh and coo functional groups the adsorption of cationic dyes is more favored at ph phpzc furthermore the carboxyl groups present on the surface of hs as a major negative functional group will bear with the cationic dyes and enhance its adsorption cellulose based adsorbents like hs can adsorb cationic dyes through columbic attraction because of the negatively charged surface that is acquired by hs cellulosic material in contact with water our results are in line with ferrero 41 who investigated the removal of methylene blue from an aqueous medium by hs and found that the langmuir isotherm model best fitted the experimental data and the adsorption capacity increases with increasing the ph value similarly doğan et al 40 found that removal of cationic dyes by hs increased significantly with increasing the initial concentration and temperature this can be attributed to the fact that changing the solution temperature for the adsorption of cationic dye leads to the increase in the diffusion rate of dye molecules across the external boundary layer as well as in the hs internal pores the applicability of hs on the adsorption of different cationic dyes was supported by karaçetin et al 42 who observed that cationic dye adsorption is an endothermic and spontaneous process 3 9 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic parameters for instance change in entropy s changes in enthalpy δh and the gibbs free energy δg can be used to indicate the thermodynamic viability of the adsorption process the positive δh table 6 for hs indicates that the reaction was endothermic as the temperature increased the value of δg also increased indicating that the reaction was favorable and spontaneous and the favorability declined as the temperature increased while the positive value of s indicated a good affinity between cv and hs this can be due to several various forces such as van der waals electrostatic 79 80 the negative value of h signifies that the cv adsorption onto nano hs was an exothermic reaction the high value of s further indicated a good affinity of cv ions on to hs nanoparticles which caused an increase in randomness 50 lastly the positive value of δg greater than 20 kj mol indicates that the reaction requires energy input and physical absorption was reconfirmed regardless of the temperature similar findings were found in a study by silva et al 30 the gibbs free energy of nanoparticles increases as temperature increases furthermore the positive values of the adsorption gibbs free energy are higher at higher temperatures which suggests adsorptions become less favorable at higher temperatures in addition there is an inverse relationship between adsorption gibbs free energy and diameter d of the particle size at a given temperature 81 the result indicates that the nano hs has a negative effect on the entropy and the enthalpy this could be explained as nano hs can produce a strong surface effect and the effect of the surface area on the adsorption gibbs free energy is substantial this means that the chemical potential at the nanoscale level μ should reflect both the bulk μb and the interfacial μi parts as 8 μ μ b μ i μ b 4 σv d where v is the molar volume of the nano adsorbent and σ is the surface tension therefore the gibbs free energy of nanoparticles could be as 9 δg δg b σ σ 4 v d where σ is the surface tension of the adsorption product in a saturated state denotes adsorption equilibrium in the current study there could be an increase in the surface tension after adsorption which means that σ is bigger than σ and the gibbs free energy of nanoparticles becomes more positive in the case of nano hs fig 12 3 10 desorption studies regeneration of hs and nano hs the desorption studies were performed to assess the reusability of hs and nano hs to remediate cv from an aqueous solution the hs and nano hs after the adsorption experiments were subjected to cv desorption using ethanol solution and acetic acid 1 0 m for 24 h the repeatability study was conducted three times 88 01 and 70 86 were the average desorption removal efficiency recorded respectively which indicated that both adsorbents could successfully be used repeatedly for cv dye adsorption this can be due to the strong interaction between cv and nano hs in comparison to hs 3 11 cost analysis when comparing the efficiency of an adsorbent the cost of the adsorbent plays a crucial role 83 it is considered vital when determining the success of any adsorption treatment techniques usually a sorbent is considered cost effective when the material is available in nature or requires little to no modification to enhance its adsorption capabilities in this study a cost effective method was used to remediate cv from an aqueous solution using an agro waste it aimed to use sustainable material by recycling hazelnut shells which are typically discarded and regarded as waste in addition the chemicals such as hcl and naoh that were used in the study were of very low concentration and volume electricity used while performing the experiment was the only cost that this study required additionally by calculating the maximum adsorption capacity and comparing it with other viable options it proved hs could be replaced as an effective adsorbent material to remove cv from an aqueous solution 4 conclusion this study suggested hs as a successful adsorbent for cv removal the adsorption process preferred a basic environment which enhanced the surface structure of hs to enhance adsorption additionally the various functional group identified from ftir also played a major role before and after sem images revealed that hs was a heterogeneous highly porous and deep cavities surface which helped in capturing cv ions onto the adsorbent the presence of cv ions after adsorption confirmed the success of the adsorption binding of cv on the hs and nano hs adsorbent langmuir isotherm best describes the adsorption process for both hs and nano hs with r2 values higher than 0 90 the maximum adsorption capacity for hs was 181 82 mg g and nano hs was 294 12 mg g moreover the process followed an endothermic reaction for hs and exothermic for nano hs based on these results the adsorption process shows the successful ability of both adsorbents for removing cv from aqueous solution without consuming much cost energy this study offers a sustainable option by utilizing agricultural wastes that do not necessarily require modification to adsorb cationic dyes and proving to be a suitable alternative for cv removal in wastewater treatment processes declaration of competing interest the

via in situ free radical copolymerization of acrylic acid aa and n vinyl pyrrolidone nvp monomers precisely nphs were fabricated through the same procedures except for the use of different nanosheets clay and graphene oxide go the successful incorporation of clay and go into the hydrogel matrix was confirmed by different analyses then the effect of nanofiller type on the microstructure characteristics surface porosity swelling ratio and fo performance fo water flux and water recovery of the modified nphs were systemically studied compared to the pure hydrogel clay and the go

reused four times without any significant reduction in fo water flux finally the best performing clay and go modified nphs were used as proper draw agents to treat the water soluble rhodamine b dye from an aqueous solution 200 ppm therefore this study provides a simple method for preparing highly porous and hydrophilic nphs which can probably have potential applications in the fo process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords draw agent nanocomposite polymer hydrogels graphene oxide nanoclay forward osmosis process 1 introduction the presence of synthetic dyes in wastewater has been increasing with the growth of industry and human activities e g textile industry paper manufacturing cosmetics and pigment applications 1 2 rhodamine b rhb a basic red dye of the xanthene class is widely used in the tissues and foodstuff industry 3 the reproductive and developmental toxicity carcinogenicity chronic toxicity and neurotoxicity of rhb towards animals and humans have been experimentally proven 4 several physical and chemical methods have been developed to remove the dye from wastewater such as the electrolytic process membrane separation chemical coagulation and oxidation 5 6 among them membrane separation due to its ease of operation is widely used 7 to date various pressure driven membrane based separation technologies are introduced for dye removal including nanofiltration nf 8 ultrafiltration uf 9 and reverse osmosis ro 10 however these processes suffer from energy intensive properties and unfavorable membrane fouling drawbacks 11 therefore developing an effective wastewater treatment method with high performance and minimum operational costs is urgently desired to relieve these issues 12 forward osmosis fo is a membrane based desalination approach that uses an osmotic pressure gradient as a driving force 13 14 fo was used in various applications during the past decade due to its minimum fouling tendency excellent rejection to different contaminates and low energy consumption 15 16 after the fo process an additional separation unit is necessary to regenerate the draw agent and produce pure water 17 the permeated water can be harvested through various methods such as thermal electro dialysis pressure assisted membrane and precipitation 18 however using these methods the water recovery stage in the fo process suffers from high operation cost problems 19 for a high performance fo system the selection of a suitable draw solute is crucial 20 notably a suitable draw agent must meet several vital criteria including compatibility with the membrane surface low cost regeneration mechanism non toxicity and high fo water flux 21 23 so far common compounds have been used as draw agents such as saccharides organic and inorganic salts volatile chemicals and polymers 23 24 however most of these draw solutes undergo a complicated regeneration process or have relatively high reverse salt fluxes 25 polymer hydrogels as three dimensional materials can absorb a large amount of water via h bonding in their matrix 26 27 this swelling property arises from the presence and dissociation of ionic groups within the hydrogel backbone recently hydrogels were introduced as draw agents in the fo process 28 the incorporation of various nanostructures i e go qgo cnt in nanocomposite polymer hydrogels nphs has rendered some unique features to strengthen hydrogel properties such as high swelling ratio water recovery and fo water flux 27 29 30 in the present work we investigate a practical strategy to use two types of nanosheets clay and go to improve the osmotic properties of the nphs in the fo process clay an inexpensive and natural material comprises a layered silicate structure 31 32 due to their unique characteristics including the low toxicity copiousness mechano chemical stability specific surface area water holding capacity and ion exchange capacity they have been widely used as nanofillers in nphs fabrication 33 34 recently go nanosheets have also been used to prepare nphs with highly porous structures and good water absorbing capacity 35 go belongs to a class of two dimensional materials formed of carbon atoms in a hexagonal structure with adequate hydrophilic functional groups i e hydroxyl epoxy carbonyl and carboxyl 36 37 these functional groups prevalent on the go surface offer the extraordinary potential for making high performance nphs in the fo process in this study paa co pvp based nphs modified with clay and go nanosheets were fabricated via in situ free radical copolymerization careful analysis of above mentioned nphs has provided to realize the effects of nanofiller type and concentration on the physicochemical characteristics of nphs as a novel fo draw agent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials n n methylene bisacrylaminde mba 99 sigma aldrich as cross linker ammonium persulfate aps 98 sigma aldrich as initiator acrylic acid aa 99 sigma aldrich and n vinyl pyrrolidone nvp 99 sigma aldrich as monomers were used for the preparation of the polymer network hydrogel graphene oxide was synthesized and characterized similarly to our previously reported study 38 nanoclay was purchased from southern clay products usa as reported in our previous work the thin film composite tfc fo membrane was fabricated via interfacial polymerization on a porous support layer 12 rhb as a model dye mw 479 g mol sigma aldrich was applied to evaluate the hydrogel s dye removal performance 2 2 polymer hydrogels synthesis the free radical copolymerization reaction was performed in a 100 ml three neck flask for the pure paa co pvp hydrogel synthesis to investigate the monomer impact on polymer hydrogel properties different ratios of monomers aa nvp 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 were used firstly a pre determined amount of monomers totally 1 5 g were dissolved in 20 ml of di water then 0 01 g of mba was added into monomers aqueous solution at this stage the aps solution as the initiator 8 mg in 5 ml di water was added into the copolymerization system and the reaction was performed for 1 h at 70 c during the whole copolymerization n2 gas was slowly bubbled into the reaction system to remove water and impurities after completing the copolymerization reaction the products were soaked in ethanol as non solvent for 2 h afterward the hydrogels were dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 50 c the same procedure was used to synthesize the clay and go modified paa co pvp hydrogel the as fabricated nphs were denoted by ch x clay modified and gh x go modified where x represents the nanomodifier concentrations of 0 1 wt 0 25 wt 0 5 wt and 1 0 wt in hydrogel matrix the synthesis procedure of nphs is shown in fig 1 2 3 characterization the pure and nphs crystallinity was investigated by an x ray diffractometer philips pw1730 netherland the functional groups of different polymer hydrogels were analyzed using attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir bruker equinox 55 spectroscopy the surface morphology of polymer hydrogels was studied using scanning electron microscopy sem images zeiss dsm 960 a germany 2 4 swelling ratio measurements using a gravimetrical method the swelling ratios sr of hydrogels were determined as follows 0 05 g of dry hydrogels were dipped in 100 ml distilled water at 25 c and taken out at periodic intervals to assess hydrogels weight variations the sr value was determined as the following equation 39 40 1 sr w s w d w d where ws g and wd g are the weights of the swollen after a certain time of test and dried samples respectively 2 5 fo water flux measurements a lab scale fo set up similar to that mentioned in previous work was used to evaluate different hydrogels water flux in the fo process as a draw agent 30 the tfc membrane with 4 9 cm2 surface area was placed in set up one side was filled with deionized di water and 200 ppm rhb dye as the feed solutions dry and powder polymer hydrogel was used as the draw agent on supports side of the membrane the water flux lmh was calculated based on the decreased feed solution volume during the fo experiment 2 j v v a a t here va is the volume change l of the feed solution during the fo experiment time t h a m2 is the fo membrane surface area 4 9 cm2 2 6 water recovery to separate adsorbed water from the hydrogels in a water recovery process the swollen hydrogel in the fo process were centrifuged at 25 c and 3000 rpm for 10 min then water recovery was calculated using eq 3 3 r w 1 w 0 100 where w0 and w1 represent the weight of the adsorbed water during fo process and released water during the water recovery experiment 2 7 hydrogel recycling test after removing swollen hydrogels from the fo set up they dried in the oven until constant weight then the water flux of dried hydrogels was then measured again in the fo process with the procedure described earlier this process was repeated for 4 cycles 3 results and discussion before incorporating different nanofiller within the hydrogel matrix the monomer ratio in control paa co pvp hydrogel ph should be optimized to do this we used different vp aa ratios in ph synthesis then the physicochemical characteristics of as synthesized ph in terms of swelling ratio fo water flux water recovery and morphology were thoroughly investigated the obtained results in table 1 revealed that ph with a high ratio of aa aa vp 2 has better performances than others the morphology of phs with different monomer ratios is shown in fig 2 the improved performance in ph with a high ratio of aa could be attributed to the following reasons 1 the strongly ionic carboxylate groups can generate higher osmotic pressure than neutral pyrrolidone groups and 2 due to the strong electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged carboxylate groups the polymer chains in ph 1 2 could extend completely resulting in more water permeating into the hydrogel matrix 41 in addition ph 1 2 has a flake like morphology that could be improving the water flux and swelling ratio by facilitating water molecules diffusion into the hydrogel network 42 3 1 characterization of modified hydrogels fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of control ph 1 2 and ch 0 5 and gh 0 5 nphs to investigate the changes in functional group following incorporation of clay and go the pure ph 1 2 spectrum was used for comparison the control ph 1 2 exhibited characteristic peaks at about 1675 1550 cm 1 corresponding to the amid co n stretching and ch2 bending vibration respectively 43 the peak at 1427 cm 1 in ph 1 2 spectrum can correspond to cc stretching which confirmed that the free radical polymerization reaction had been successful 44 a broadband peak at 2700 and 3200 cm 1 verified the presence of hydrophilic functional groups i e hydroxyl or carboxylic acid in the hydrogel matrix however due to the homogenous distribution of clay and go in the hydrogel matrix their lower concentration compared to the monomers and overlapping of clay go and ph characteristics peaks only the highest intensity appeared in the spectrum of the nanocomposite polymer hydrogel the ftir spectra approve go and clay incorporation in the hydrogel matrix as is evident from bands observed at approximately 1045 cm 1 stretching of co on go and 972 cm 1 al al oh vibrations on clay 45 46 the crystalline structure of polymer hydrogels was investigated via the xrd technique and results are shown in fig 3 the broad peak that appeared at 2θ 15 25 in the ph 1 2 spectrum shows the semi crystalline nature of polymer hydrogel originating from polymer chains inter hydrogen bonding 47 compared with the ph 1 2 spectrum no new peaks were observed in the spectrum of ch 0 5 and gh 0 5 confirming the homogeneous dispersion of nanofiller within the hydrogel matrix this phenomenon also has been observed in other nanomodified hydrogels 27 the sem images of clay and go modified hydrogels with different magnifications are shown in fig 4 at low magnification all hydrogels have similar morphology however at high magnification the morphological variances between the hydrogels with different concentrations have appeared compared to ph 1 2 morphology a different morphology was observed for both clay and go modified hydrogels it could be easily found that a porous structure was obtained with an increase in clay and go loading in the hydrogel matrix from 0 1 to 0 5 wt generally a porous structure simplifies the permeation of water into the hydrogel matrix however a further rise in clay and go content 1 wt have a paradoxical effect on hydrogel morphology where more compact hydrogels were obtained it can be expected that this morphological change will show its impact on the performance of hydrogels by reducing the water flux and swelling ratio 3 2 the swelling ratio of hydrogels in assessing hydrogels specifications the swelling ratio is one of the main characteristics that should be studied the osmotic pressure difference between the hydrogel matrix and external solution and repulsion of hydrophilic groups are the two main reasons for polymeric hydrogel swelling 48 the effect of clay and go modification on the swelling ratio of hydrogels is shown in fig 5 as can be seen all hydrogels swelled in three stage 1 swelled quickly in the first 60 min 2 increased slightly 60 120 min and 3 plateaued when the swelling of the hydrogel reaches equilibrium the equilibrium swelling ratio of clay and go modified hydrogels is higher than that of ph 1 2 table 1 it is generally accepted that hydrophilic nanofillers i e go and clay can raise the osmotic pressure within the hydrogel matrix by increasing the functional groups availability 29 however the swelling ratios of go based hydrogels are higher than clay based hydrogels this phenomenon can be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic moieties of the hydrogel and the go surface which increases the water absorption capacity by expanding the hydrogel network however increasing clay and go content in the hydrogel ch 1 0 and gh 1 0 leads to a swelling ratio drop in general during the swelling process the polymer chains vary their conformation to form a swollen state the higher concentrations of nanomodifier made the polymer matrix more compact and restricted polymer chains movement and finally prevented water penetration into hydrogel networks 49 50 3 3 hydrogel as a draw agent in the fo process polymer hydrogels with high osmotic pressure can be used in the fo process as the draw agents as shown in fig 8 a dead end type fo set up was used to study the fo performance of nphs using conventional tfc membrane and di water as feed solution and 0 05 g hydrogels as draw agent fig 6 presents the fo water fluxes of modified hydrogels based on nanomodifier type and concentration due to the high driving force within the initial state s hydrogels the water flux was exceptionally high during the first hours however water flux dropped gradually by proceeding fo process probably due to the decline in osmotic pressure as the swelling degree increased 51 moreover the modification with nanomaterials regardless of their type significantly impacts fo water flux as shown the water flux of both clay and go modified hydrogels reveal an up and down trend with the raising nanomodifier loading in the hydrogel matrix following the swelling ratio trend fig 5 the highest water flux is achieved with gh 0 5 4 3 lmh and ch 0 5 4 1 lmh hydrogels in addition the water flux of gh 0 5 is slightly higher than ch 0 5 mainly due to the ionized carboxyl groups in the go surface providing higher osmotic pressure however the water flux decreases to 2 7 and 2 6 lmh as the clay and go loading raises to 1 wt respectively these results align with the reported literature where incorporating a hydrophilic nanomaterial provides higher water flux in the fo process 23 52 53 inorganic salts i e nacl were widely used as draw solutions in the fo process and usually had high water flux than other draw agents however they regeneration is complicated and needs another membrane separation process to make clean water in addition the reverse salt flux is another parameter that should be considered in the fo process the lower reverse salt flux in some applications of fo i e protein enrichment is vital because trace impurity diffusing by reverse salt flux may denature the target products 54 table 2 compares the fo water flux of clay and go modified hydrogels with various literature reports as can be seen the fo water flux of the gh 0 5 and ch 0 5 is higher than those reported in the literature however hydrogels initial fo water flux is lower than 1 m nacl 6 4 lmh a negligible reverse salt flux was observed for gh 0 5 and ch 0 5 samples while 2 5 gmh of the reverse salt flux was found for the nacl draw agent the conventional tfc membrane with a polyamide rejection layer usually has a mean pore size of less than 1 nm 55 while the polymer hydrogel size is much larger than this consequently the polyamide rejection layer effectively repressed polymer hydrogels transition and resulted in unimportant reverse salt flux 3 4 water recovery water recovery is one of the essential steps in the fo process in which the draw agent must be separated from the diluted draw solution therefore a hydrogel with easy water recovery and regeneration is preferred in the fo process 59 the water recovery for various hydrogels was determined based on the maximum water released from swollen hydrogels 60 for both clay and go modified hydrogels with the increased content of nanomodifier in the hydrogel matrix water recovery of the resultant hydrogel increases however a decline in water recovery was observed for the gh 0 5 and ch 0 5 interestingly the water recovery of clay modified hydrogels is higher than go modified hydrogels hydrogen bonding is the primary interaction between hydrophilic functional groups of go and water molecules which is relatively weaker than ionic interaction in clay and water 52 61 as a result a high amount of water can be recovered in go modified hydrogels therefore these results show that the nanofiller types and their loading significantly promote water recovery from swollen modified hydrogels than pure polymer hydrogel 3 5 recycle test clay and go based hydrogels reusability was conducted in the current study to confirm hydrogel s potential water treatment applications ch 0 5 and gh 0 5 were chosen to be used in reusability measurements after each dewatering process the dried hydrogel is grounded into the fine powder and directly placed in the fo system for the next fo test after 1 h water drawing for each fo test the water flux generated from the recycled hydrogels was measured and the results are shown in fig 7 b the results showed that the fo water flux performance of nphs slightly reduced after each recycling process however they still maintain their water absorbing capability at a reasonable level 3 6 performance of nphs in dye removal based on fo performance gh 0 5 and ch 0 5 were selected for rhb dye removal in the fo process using a homemade set up and conventional tfc membrane initially nphs as a draw agent was placed on the support side of a tfc membrane and then the active side was contacted with feed solution after the 24 h fo test the absorbed water separated from swollen hydrogel and was analyzed using a uv spectrophotometer to calculate dye rejection value the calculated fo water flux was 3 8 lmh for ch 0 5 and 4 1 lmh for gh 0 5 indicating good water treatment ability in addition rhb rejection of 99 9 was found for both fo processes the slight decline in fo water flux could be ascribed to the increased concentration of the feed solution which leads to a decrease in effective osmotic pressure across the tfc fo membrane and consequently decreasing the net driving force to draw ultrapure water from the feed side after the fo process the swollen hydrogel was regenerated and used again in the rhb dye removal test obtained results were consistent with the recovery results in fig 7a confirming that colorant wastewater has no adverse effect on the hydrogel recovery these results verified that clay and go have the same effect on ph performance and could be used in wastewater treatments and desalination applications 4 conclusion in summary we have described an effective method for improving performance of the polymer hydrogels in fo process clay and go nanosheets were successfully incorporated within the paa co pvp hydrogel matrix via in situ radical copolymerization compared with unmodified ph the clay and go incorporation increased the surface porosity and swelling behavior of nphs the improved swelling ratio can be ascribed to the high porosity and hydrophilicity of the nphs however when the nanomodifier concentration was excessive a significant reduction in the surface porosity and swelling ratio of the nphs was observed subsequently the lab scale fo cell was used to assess the fo water flux recycling and dye removal ability of nphs as a result the nphs fabricated using go had a slightly higher fo water flux 4 3 lmh than clay based nphs 4 1 lmh this improvement in fo water flux was attributed to the several impacts of improved surface porosity hydrophilicity and osmotic pressure difference of the go modified nphs in addition in the water recovery test go based nphs presented better performance than clay based nphs taken together our findings indicated that nanofillers type has a significant effect on the surface porosity swelling ratio and water recovery of the nphs and this impact should be considered in the fabrication of hydrogel based draw agents for the fo process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

was performed in a 100 ml three neck flask for the pure paa co pvp hydrogel synthesis to investigate the monomer impact on polymer hydrogel properties different ratios of monomers aa nvp 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 were used firstly a pre determined amount of monomers totally 1 5 g were dissolved in 20 ml of di water then 0 01 g of mba was added into monomers aqueous solution at this stage the aps solution as the initiator 8 mg in 5 ml di water was added into the copolymerization system and the reaction was performed for 1 h at 70 c during the whole copolymerization n2 gas was slowly bubbled into the reaction system to remove water and impurities after completing the copolymerization reaction the products were soaked in ethanol as non solvent for 2 h afterward the hydrogels were dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 50 c the same procedure was used to synthesize the clay and go modified paa co pvp hydrogel the as fabricated nphs were denoted by ch x clay modified and gh x go modified where x represents the nanomodifier concentrations of 0 1 wt 0 25 wt 0 5 wt and 1 0 wt in hydrogel matrix the synthesis procedure of nphs is shown in fig 1 2 3 characterization the pure and nphs crystallinity was investigated by an x ray diffractometer philips pw1730 netherland the functional groups of different polymer hydrogels were analyzed using attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir bruker equinox 55 spectroscopy the surface morphology of polymer hydrogels was studied using scanning electron microscopy sem images zeiss dsm 960 a germany 2 4 swelling ratio measurements using a gravimetrical method the swelling ratios sr of hydrogels were determined as follows 0 05 g of dry hydrogels were dipped in 100 ml distilled water at 25 c and taken out at periodic intervals to assess hydrogels weight variations the sr value was determined as the following equation 39 40 1 sr w s w d w d where ws g and wd g are the weights of the swollen after a certain time of test and dried samples respectively 2 5 fo water flux measurements a lab scale fo set up similar to that mentioned in previous work was used to evaluate different hydrogels water flux in the fo process as a draw agent 30 the tfc membrane with 4 9 cm2 surface area was placed in set up one side was filled with deionized di water and 200 ppm rhb dye as the feed solutions dry and powder polymer hydrogel was used as the draw agent on supports side of the membrane the water flux lmh was calculated based on the decreased feed solution volume during the fo experiment 2 j v v a a t here va is the volume change l of the feed solution during the fo experiment time t h a m2 is the fo membrane surface area 4 9 cm2 2 6 water recovery to separate adsorbed water from the hydrogels in a water recovery process the swollen hydrogel in the fo process were centrifuged at 25 c and 3000 rpm for 10 min then water recovery was calculated using eq 3 3 r w 1 w 0 100 where w0 and w1 represent the weight of the adsorbed water during fo process and released water during the water recovery experiment 2 7 hydrogel recycling test after removing swollen hydrogels from the fo set up they dried in the oven until constant weight then the water flux of dried hydrogels was then measured again in the fo process with the procedure described earlier this process was repeated for 4 cycles 3 results and discussion before incorporating different nanofiller within the hydrogel matrix the monomer ratio in control paa co pvp hydrogel ph should be optimized to do this we used different vp aa ratios in ph synthesis then the physicochemical characteristics of as synthesized ph in terms of swelling ratio fo water flux water recovery and morphology were thoroughly investigated the obtained results in table 1 revealed that ph with a high ratio of aa aa vp 2 has better performances than others the morphology of phs with different monomer ratios is shown in fig 2 the improved performance in ph with a high ratio of aa could be attributed to the following reasons 1 the strongly ionic carboxylate groups can generate higher osmotic pressure than neutral pyrrolidone groups and 2 due to the strong electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged carboxylate groups the polymer chains in ph 1 2 could extend completely resulting in more water permeating into the hydrogel matrix 41 in addition ph 1 2 has a flake like morphology that could be improving the water flux and swelling ratio by facilitating water molecules diffusion into the hydrogel network 42 3 1 characterization of modified hydrogels fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of control ph 1 2 and ch 0 5 and gh 0 5 nphs to investigate the changes in functional group following incorporation of clay and go the pure ph 1 2 spectrum was used for comparison the control ph 1 2 exhibited characteristic peaks at about 1675 1550 cm 1 corresponding to the amid co n stretching and ch2 bending vibration respectively 43 the peak at 1427 cm 1 in ph 1 2 spectrum can correspond to cc stretching which confirmed that the free radical polymerization reaction had been successful 44 a broadband peak at 2700 and 3200 cm 1 verified the presence of hydrophilic functional groups i e hydroxyl or carboxylic acid in the hydrogel matrix however due to the homogenous distribution of clay and go in the hydrogel matrix their lower concentration compared to the monomers and overlapping of clay go and ph characteristics peaks only the highest intensity appeared in the spectrum of the nanocomposite polymer hydrogel the ftir spectra approve go and clay incorporation in the hydrogel matrix as is evident from bands observed at approximately 1045 cm 1 stretching of co on go and 972 cm 1 al al oh vibrations on clay 45 46 the crystalline structure of polymer hydrogels was investigated via the xrd technique and results are shown in fig 3 the broad peak that appeared at 2θ 15 25 in the ph 1 2 spectrum shows the semi crystalline nature of polymer hydrogel originating from polymer chains inter hydrogen bonding 47 compared with the ph 1 2 spectrum no new peaks were observed in the spectrum of ch 0 5 and gh 0 5 confirming the homogeneous dispersion of nanofiller within the hydrogel matrix this phenomenon also has been observed in other nanomodified hydrogels 27 the sem images of clay and go modified hydrogels with different magnifications are shown in fig 4 at low magnification all hydrogels have similar morphology however at high magnification the morphological variances between the hydrogels with different concentrations have appeared compared to ph 1 2 morphology a different morphology was observed for both clay and go modified hydrogels it could be easily found that a porous structure was obtained with an increase in clay and go loading in the hydrogel matrix from 0 1 to 0 5 wt generally a porous structure simplifies the permeation of water into the hydrogel matrix however a further rise in clay and go content 1 wt have a paradoxical effect on hydrogel morphology where more compact hydrogels were obtained it can be expected that this morphological change will show its impact on the performance of hydrogels by reducing the water flux and swelling ratio 3 2 the swelling ratio of hydrogels in assessing hydrogels specifications the swelling ratio is one of the main characteristics that should be studied the osmotic pressure difference between the hydrogel matrix and external solution and repulsion of hydrophilic groups are the two main reasons for polymeric hydrogel swelling 48 the effect of clay and go modification on the swelling ratio of hydrogels is shown in fig 5 as can be seen all hydrogels swelled in three stage 1 swelled quickly in the first 60 min 2 increased slightly 60 120 min and 3 plateaued when the swelling of the hydrogel reaches equilibrium the equilibrium swelling ratio of clay and go modified hydrogels is higher than that of ph 1 2 table 1 it is generally accepted that hydrophilic nanofillers i e go and clay can raise the osmotic pressure within the hydrogel matrix by increasing the functional groups availability 29 however the swelling ratios of go based hydrogels are higher than clay based hydrogels this phenomenon can be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic moieties of the hydrogel and the go surface which increases the water absorption capacity by expanding the hydrogel network however increasing clay and go content in the hydrogel ch 1 0 and gh 1 0 leads to a swelling ratio drop in general during the swelling process the polymer chains vary their conformation to form a swollen state the higher concentrations of nanomodifier made the polymer matrix more compact and restricted polymer chains movement and finally prevented water penetration into hydrogel networks 49 50 3 3 hydrogel as a draw agent in the fo process polymer hydrogels with high osmotic pressure can be used in the fo process as the draw agents as shown in fig 8 a dead end type fo set up was used to study the fo performance of nphs using conventional tfc membrane and di water as feed solution and 0 05 g hydrogels as draw agent fig 6 presents the fo water fluxes of modified hydrogels based on nanomodifier type and concentration due to the high driving force within the initial state s hydrogels the water flux was exceptionally high during the first hours however water flux dropped gradually by proceeding fo process probably due to the decline in osmotic pressure as the swelling degree increased 51 moreover the modification with nanomaterials regardless of their type significantly impacts fo water flux as shown the water flux of both clay and go modified hydrogels reveal an up and down trend with the raising nanomodifier loading in the hydrogel matrix following the swelling ratio trend fig 5 the highest water flux is achieved with gh 0 5 4 3 lmh and ch 0 5 4 1 lmh hydrogels in addition the water flux of gh 0 5 is slightly higher than ch 0 5 mainly due to the ionized carboxyl groups in the go surface providing higher osmotic pressure however the water flux decreases to 2 7 and 2 6 lmh as the clay and go loading raises to 1 wt respectively these results align with the reported literature where incorporating a hydrophilic nanomaterial provides higher water flux in the fo process 23 52 53 inorganic salts i e nacl were widely used as draw solutions in the fo process and usually had high water flux than other draw agents however they regeneration is complicated and needs another membrane separation process to make clean water in addition the reverse salt flux is another parameter that should be considered in the fo process the lower reverse salt flux in some applications of fo i e protein enrichment is vital because trace impurity diffusing by reverse salt flux may denature the target products 54 table 2 compares the fo water flux of clay and go modified hydrogels with various literature reports as can be seen the fo water flux of the gh 0 5 and ch 0 5 is higher than those reported in the literature however hydrogels initial fo water flux is lower than 1 m nacl 6 4 lmh a negligible reverse salt flux was observed for gh 0 5 and ch 0 5 samples while 2 5 gmh of the reverse salt flux was found for the nacl draw agent the conventional tfc membrane with a polyamide rejection layer usually has a mean pore size of less than 1 nm 55 while the polymer hydrogel size is much larger than this consequently the polyamide rejection layer effectively repressed polymer hydrogels transition and resulted in unimportant reverse salt flux 3 4 water recovery water recovery is one of the essential steps in the fo process in which the draw agent must be separated from the diluted draw solution therefore a hydrogel with easy water recovery and regeneration is preferred in the fo process 59 the water recovery for various hydrogels was determined based on the maximum water released from swollen hydrogels 60 for both clay and go modified hydrogels with the increased content of nanomodifier in the hydrogel matrix water recovery of the resultant hydrogel increases however a decline in water recovery was observed for the gh 0 5 and ch 0 5 interestingly the water recovery of clay modified hydrogels is higher than go modified hydrogels hydrogen bonding is the primary interaction between hydrophilic functional groups of go and water molecules which is relatively weaker than ionic interaction in clay and water 52 61 as a result a high amount of water can be recovered in go modified hydrogels therefore these results show that the nanofiller types and their loading significantly promote water recovery from swollen modified hydrogels than pure polymer hydrogel 3 5 recycle test clay and go based hydrogels reusability was conducted in the current study to confirm hydrogel s potential water treatment applications ch 0 5 and gh 0 5 were chosen to be used in reusability measurements after each dewatering process the dried hydrogel is grounded into the fine powder and directly placed in the fo system for the next fo test after 1 h water drawing for each fo test the water flux generated from the recycled hydrogels was measured and the results are shown in fig 7 b the results showed that the fo water flux performance of nphs slightly reduced after each recycling process however they still maintain their water absorbing capability at a reasonable level 3 6 performance of nphs in dye removal based on fo performance gh 0 5 and ch 0 5 were selected for rhb dye removal in the fo process using a homemade set up and conventional tfc membrane initially nphs as a draw agent was placed on the support side of a tfc membrane and then the active side was contacted with feed solution after the 24 h fo test the absorbed water separated from swollen hydrogel and was analyzed using a uv spectrophotometer to calculate dye rejection value the calculated fo water flux was 3 8 lmh for ch 0 5 and 4 1 lmh for gh 0 5 indicating good water treatment ability in addition rhb rejection of 99 9 was found for both fo processes the slight decline in fo water flux could be ascribed to the increased concentration of the feed solution which leads to a decrease in effective osmotic pressure across the tfc fo membrane and consequently decreasing the net driving force to draw ultrapure water from the feed side after the fo process the swollen hydrogel was regenerated and used again in the rhb dye removal test obtained results were consistent with the recovery results in fig 7a confirming that colorant wastewater has no adverse effect on the hydrogel recovery these results verified that clay and go have the same effect on ph performance and could be used in wastewater treatments and desalination applications 4 conclusion in summary we have described an effective method for improving performance of the polymer hydrogels in fo process clay and go nanosheets were successfully incorporated within the paa co pvp hydrogel matrix via in situ radical copolymerization compared with unmodified ph the clay and go incorporation increased the surface porosity and swelling behavior of nphs the improved swelling ratio can be ascribed to the high porosity and hydrophilicity of the nphs however when the nanomodifier concentration was excessive a significant reduction in the surface porosity and swelling ratio of the nphs was observed subsequently the lab scale fo cell was used to assess the fo water flux recycling and dye removal ability of nphs as a result the nphs fabricated using go had a slightly higher fo water flux 4 3 lmh than clay based nphs 4 1 lmh this improvement in fo water flux was attributed to the several impacts of improved surface porosity hydrophilicity and osmotic pressure difference of the go modified nphs in addition in the water recovery test go based nphs presented better performance than clay based nphs taken together our findings indicated that nanofillers type has a significant effect on the surface porosity swelling ratio and water recovery of the nphs and this impact should be considered in the fabrication of hydrogel based draw agents for the fo process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

13263,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox receives considerable attentions from researchers because it could achieve biological denitrification from wastewater with low carbon resource input during anammox hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo plays a critical role in the biological conversion of ammonium nh4 to dinitrogen gas in this study we constructed a hzo gene recombinant bacterium by genetic process technology with the aim to effectively remove n2h4 in anammox process the result indicates about 80 n2h4 n could be removed by the obtained hzo gene recombinant bacterium under the optimum condition an initial n2h4 n concentration of 5 mg l and a bacterial dosage of 20 ml more importantly the high n2h4 n removal efficiency about 70 could be maintained when hzo gene recombinant bacterium spread to the sixth generation the recombinant protein of hzo gene recombinant bacterium could be successfully expressed and show a stable activity to n2h4 removal under low intensity wastewater suggesting the removal of n2h4 was attributed to the successful expression of hzo enzyme of anammox bacterium in e coli keywords hydrazine oxidoreductase genetic recombinant bacterium n2h4 n removal protein expression 1 introduction due to the development of industry and agriculture a large amount of nitrogen nh4 n no3 n contained wastewater is draining into natural water bodies 1 nitrogen species once entering aquatic environment could stimulate the overgrowth of plants and algae cause or aggravate water eutrophication 2 3 nitrogenous contaminants in wastewater could be removed by physicochemical and biological methods the common physicochemical approaches for n removal include air stripping selective ion exchange and break point chlorination 4 however these methods usually consume a lot of chemicals or energy and are liable to cause secondary pollution in contrast to these physiochemical methods biological denitrification processes have the advantages of simplicity high efficiency and low cost 5 6 up to date researchers have conducted extensive studies on biological denitrification in wastewater treatment a lot of biological strategies such as simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd sequencing batch reactor sbr anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and single reactor for high activity ammonia removal over nitrite sharon have been successfully established 7 10 of these methods anammox process is widely accepted as one of the effective technologies for n removal from wastewater 11 12 at where ammonium nh4 n is oxidized with nitrite no2 n as an electron acceptor to dinitrogen gas n2 under anaerobic condition relative to conventional denitrification processes anammox can achieve greater n removal efficiency for ammonium rich wastewater with less chemical and energy consumption 13 14 microbial metabolism of n by anammox bacteria is catalyzed by a variety of enzymes among which nitrite reductase nir 15 hydrazine hydrolase hh 16 and hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo are the most important ones 17 according to the brocadia annam oxidans biochemical model proposed by kuenen et al 18 the main reaction of anammox can be divided into three steps first no2 is reduced to hydroxylamine nh2oh under the catalytic role of nir secondly nh2oh and nh3 combine to form hydrazine n2h4 under the aid of hh finally the produced n2h4 is oxidized into n2 at the presence of hzo during the whole anammox process hzo is regarded as the main rate limiting enzyme 19 it was reported that the last functional gene biomarker in hzo could promote the conversion of n2h4 to n2 20 21 therefore the activity of hzo bacteria play a crucial role for nitrogen removal during the important step n2h4 removal of anammox process 22 in practice anammox is challenged with the cultivation and enrichment of anammox bacteria due to the harsh living conditions and long generation cycle about 10 12 days of these strains 23 to solve this problem researchers carried out numerous studies on anammox bacteria such as hzo bacteria from the perspective of molecular means or functional genes of ammonia oxidizing bacteria 24 25 the result indicated that using engineering bacteria by genetic transformation and bioengineering methods could effectively increase the survival rate of anammox bacteria and thus improve nitrogen removal ability for example jo et al 26 successfully synthesized a type of engineering bacteria containing pseudomonas plasmid and used it to remove hydrocarbons from crude oil where a much high degradation efficiency was achieved by this strain zhang et al 27 obtained a protoplast fusant with enhanced degradation ability of polyacrylamide by intergeneric protoplast fusion between bacillus subtilis and rhodopseudomonas spheroids achmon et al 28 synthesized a recombinant bacterium from escherichia coli to produce 2 phenylethanol 2 pe the genetic engineering strain showed a high survival rate and strong adaptability and achieved a high yield toward the targeted product lin et al 29 selected two groups of mixed engineering bacteria sw a and sw b to degraded tph in waste oil based drilling fluid sediments and found that these engineering bacteria had high degradation ability in a recent study lin et al 30 successfully constructed a recombinant strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa with nosz defcient to effectively recover n2o during denitrifcation treatment processes above results suggest that genetic engineering technologies have great potential to be applied to construct engineering strains for the efficient denitrification of n via anammox process however the study regarding the manipulation of hzo gene to build up engineering bacterium is still scarce therefore the goal of this study is to construct a hzo gene recombinant bacterium by incorporating hzo gene from natural soil sample into e coli with the aim of to effectively removing n2h4 the intermediate product during anammox the stability and toxicity tolerance of the obtained recombinant bacterium on n2h4 were tested the removal of n2h4 by the recombinant bacteria was validated by testing n2h4 removal using the purified hzo recombinant protein 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil samples soil samples were collected from the sub superficial soil layer 10 20 cm of xisha wetland park 31 43 426 n 121 13 910 e in shanghai chongming island

was stored under 80 c for further investigation if needed 2 2 dna extraction and pcr amplification total dna in the soil sample was extracted with power soil dna isolation kit which was purchased from mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca the extracted gene fragments were analyzed with 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and stored at 20 c for pcr amplification reaction the fragments of hzo gene were further amplified using the primer pairs of hzof1 5 tgtgcatggtcaattgaaag 3 and hzor1 5 caacctcttc wgcaggtgcatg 3 31 pcr amplification was performed in a 25 μl solution which contained 0 2 μl takara ex

32 33 the amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1 agarosegels and purified using axygen dna gel recovery kits axygen usa 2 3 preparation and characterization of hzo gene recombinant bacterium the purified pcr product containing the target gene was linked to pgex 6p 1 50 ng promega beijing the connecting reaction was carried out under 4 c for 17 h at first 2 μl of linked dna and 50 μl of competent e coli dh5α takara were added into a sterilization centrifuge tube then the mixture was incubated in ice for 20 min heated for 45 50 s in a constant temperature water bath at 42 c and finally placed in ice for 2 min afterward lb liquid was added to the centrifuge tube and the culture was oscillated for 1 5 h in a constant temperature oscillator at 37 c forty μl of x gal 20 mg ml and 16 μl of iptg 50 mg ml were coated on the lb solid medium containing 100 μg ml ampicillin respectively and stand for 30 min after that 100 μl bacterial culture solution was coated in the medium sterile indoor operation which was incubated under 37 c in the incubator for 21 h 34 the positive monoclonal clones blue clones were selected by blue white spot screening and cultured in an lb liquid medium for 17 h at 37 c afterward the corresponding vector primers were used to carry out the pcr of the colony and the positive clones were identified by pcr the clones identified as positive were selected for further sequencing bio engineering shanghai co ltd 35 the hzo engineering bacterium and empty plasmid bacterium were counted using dilution plate method after the strains were cultivated in lb medium to logarithmic growth period od600 reached 0 6 200 μl bacterial suspension was transferred into two sterilized test tubes respectively both the hzo recombinant bacterial culture and empty plasmid bacterium liquid 100 μl were collected the diluted suspension was uniformly coated on lb solid medium for 21 h at 37 c the od600 value of the bacterial suspension was monitored by a uv 4802 spectrophotometry to identify the growth of bacteria the morphology of hzo engineering bacterium and the empty plasmid bacterium were characterized by a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6700f 2 4 nitrogen removal tests under aseptic condition different dosages of hzo gene recombinant bacterium suspension 0 5 10 20 30 and 40 ml under logarithmic growth phase were transferred into 100 ml n2h4 solution 40 mg ml the mixture was agitated in a thermostatic oscillator at a rate of 200 rpm under 37 c liquid sample was taken at a predetermined interval and filtered with a 0 22 μm filter to remove bacterial cells the concentration of n2h4 n in the solution was monitored using dimethyl amino benzene formaldehyde spectrophotometry 36 the effect of n concentration on the growth of hzo gene recombinant bacterium was explored by dosing 20 ml of bacterium suspension at the logarithmic growth phase into 100 ml n2h4 n solution with different n concentration 20 30 40 65 and 85 mg ml liquid samples were also taken at a predetermined interval and the n2h4 n concentration in the solution was measured 2 5 analysis and determination of fusion protein the expression of recombinant protein is critical for the rapid degradation of n2h4 n by the recombinant strain of hzo gene therefore the expression and protein concentration of recombinant protein in the recombinant bacterium were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page 37 and sk3071 non interfering protein concentration assay kit 38 a proper amount of iptg inducer induction time and temperature were selected for the identification of protein expression the effect of the fusion protein on n removal was tested by adding 50 μl fusion proteins into 100 ml solution with different n2h4 concentration 1 10 45 mg l the sample was collected to measure the absorbance of solution at 458 nm to determine the content of n2h4 by p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde spectrophotometric method 39 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of constructed hzo gene recombinant bacterium as shown in fig 1 a the size of microbial dna isolated from the soil sample is 23 kd by using genomic dna as the template hzo gene fragment was amplified by the primer hzof1 hzor1 and purified where the band at 1030 bp was successfully obtained fig 1 b and c this fragment is consistent with that reported by li et al 40 suggesting hzo gene was successfully isolated both blue and white colonies were found in the culture of hzo gene recombinant bacterium fig 1 d therefore blue colonies were subsequently cultured on lb liquid medium and further validated by pcr analysis where the band at around 1000 bp was also detected fig 1 e the hzo gene recombinant bacterium was further sequenced and validated by matching the sequence with the library of anammox bacterium the code of the gene sequence submitted to ncbi gene pool kp099436 the result indicates the degree of matching reached 95 this result suggests it belongs to the hzo gene sequences of anammox bacterium the morphologies of the hzo gene recombinant bacterium and its parent bacterium e coli were characterized by sem as shown in fig 1 f the recombinant bacterium presents largely in a spherical shape which was much different from the rod like e coli fig 1 f the change in the shape of the bacterium was likely caused by the excessive metabolic loading produced by the host bacterium as a result of the introduction of foreign gene the growth curves of the hzo engineering bacterium with and without n2h4 are displayed in fig 2 as observed the od600 value of the hzo engineering bacterial culture medium with n2h4 is higher than n2h4 free case at the first 360 min afterward the bacterial density of culture without n2h4 increased remarkably and surpassed the culture medium with 4 38 mg l n2h4 n this should be due to the toxicity resulted from the high concentration of n2h4 finally the growth curve for the hzo engineering bacterium stabilized after 800 min at where the od value was higher than 0 6 3 2 removal of n2h4 n by hzo gene recombinant bacterium the efficacy of n2h4 n removal by the hzo gene recombinant bacterium at logarithmic phase was investigated fig 3 a and b show the effects of inoculum dosage of the hzo recombinant on n2h4 n removal and the bacterial cell density in terms of od600 value under different initial n2h4 concentrations as observed with increasing bacterial dosage both the removal efficiency of n2h4 n and the od600 value of bacterial suspension increased the final removal of n2h4 n by the hzo engineering bacterium reached 90 when the bacterial dosage exceeded 20 ml this suggested that n2h4 n could be effectively removed by the obtained hzo gene recombinant bacterium the cell density of the recombinant bacteria increased steadily with the progress of bacterium dosage this result indicates a high bacterial inoculum amount could resist the toxic effect of n2h4 however with the dosage of hzo engineering bacterium increasing from 20 to 40 ml the removal of n2h4 n kept at a similar level therefore 20 ml was selected as the optimum dosage of the hzo recombinant for further tests from fig 3 c the removal of n2h4 n by the hzo engineering bacterium could be strengthened with the increase of initial n2h4 n concentration and the highest removal reached around 80 at the end of each test meanwhile it could be observed from fig 3 d that the od600 value of bacterial culture decreased with the increase of initial n2h4 n concentration this suggests that a high concentration of n2h4 could inhibit the growth of hzo gene recombinant bacterium despite this the bacterium could stably survive with the cell density od600 value maintaining across a long period 1600 min this result reveals that the hzo gene recombinant bacterium has strong tolerance and could withstand the toxicity of n2h4 under a certain concentration to investigate the generation stability and tolerance of hzo gene recombinant bacterium the method reported by lu et al 41 and yao et al 42 was used in this study the result reveals the characteristic band of hzo gene could be inherited stably by the 8th generation recombinant bacterium according to the analysis of pcr product electrophoresis fig 4 a and b display the n2h4 removal by different generations of hzo gene recombinant bacteria and the variation of the cell density od600 value during the degradation respectively for different generations the activity toward the removal of n2h4 n by the hzo engineering bacterium and the accompanying bacterial growth reflected by od600 value were inconsistent the removal of n2h4 n gradually decreased with the increase of the bacterium generation for example n2h4 n removal by the 2nd 4th and 6th generations of bacterium could attain 60 80 whereas the removal of n2h4 n by the 9th generation of bacterium dropped significantly only 27 this could also be consolidated by the growth of the recombinant cell where the 9th generation of bacterium gave very low survival rate in contrast to its predecessors according to above result it can be concluded that n2h4 n removal by the hzo gene recombinant bacterium was stable from the second generation to the sixth generation the effect of initial n2h4 n concentration on the growth of bacterium is shown in fig 4 c as can be observed the od600 value of bacterial suspension decreased greatly with increasing initial n2h4 n concentration probably due to the high toxicity of n2h4 this suggests that a high n2h4 content more than 30 mg l could suppress the growth of the hzo recombinant engineered bacterium for a fixed n2h4 concentration however the od600 value of bacterial suspension could be maintained throughout the test which manifests that the hzo engineering bacterium could tolerate toxic n2h4 within a certain extent 3 3 n2h4 n removal by recombinant protein the sds page analysis of recombinant protein components of hzo engineering bacterium and e coli were carried out and the results are shown in fig 5 a and b compared with e coli the expression of protein band at around 62 kd for the hzo gene recombinant bacterium increased significantly the molecular weight of this band is consistent with that reported by shimamura et al 43 by comparing the induced supernatant and precipitation of the hzo recombinant genetic engineered bacterium the expressed products existed mainly as the form of soluble proteins and inclusion bodies the result of the sds page analysis for the target protein is displayed in fig 5 c it suggests that the recombinant protein of hzo engineering bacterium was successfully expressed and purified the purified protein was colored in accordance with the tmb blot step using the western color reagent kit and the result is displayed in fig 6 the 62 kd target band was successfully obtained which suggests that the recombinant protein of the hzo engineering bacterium was successfully expressed the purity of the fusion protein reached over 90 after the analysis the concentration of fusion protein was determined by non interference protein assay kit sk3071 and the fusion protein concentration reached 0 58 mg ml in 30 μl sample the activity of the recombinant protein of the hzo gene recombinant bacterium on n2h4 n removal was tested and the result is shown in fig 7 it could be observed that when the initial concentration of n2h4 was 45 and 10 mg l the removal of n2h4 by the expression protein fluctuated greatly this should be ascribed to the strong toxic effect of high concentration of n2h4 which caused the inactivation of the expressed protein however when the initial concentration of n2h4 deceased to 1 mg l the removal of n2h4 could increase gradually with the progress of reaction time this result is consistent with the study from li et al 44 who reported the recombinant protein expression of hzo engineering bacterium could maintain the metabolic activity at a low level of n2h4 the removal of n2h4 in liquid should be attributed to the successful expression of hzo gene hosted by e coli which could generate a large amount of active recombinant proteins to act on the removal of toxic n2h4 from the result of this study we preliminarily confirm that the hzo gene of anammox bacteria could be incorporated into e coli to strength the removal of n2h4 future effort is required on the possible engineering application of this hzo gene recombinant bacterium in anammox process alternative by extracting the proteins of this strain we can also obtain active enzyme to eliminate the intermedia n2h4 which may also provide a strategy for the application of this gene recombinant bacterium 4 conclusion in this study a hzo gene recombinant strain was successfully prepared by genetic engineering technology and used to remove n2h4 n from wastewater the removal of n2h4 by the hzo engineering bacterium increased with the increase of inoculum dosage and the decrease of initial n2h4 n concentration the removal efficiency could reach about 80 at an initial n2h4 concentration up to 85 mg l however the growth of this strain could be suppressed when n2h4 content exceeded 30 mg l in the

13263,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox receives considerable attentions from researchers because it could achieve biological denitrification from wastewater with low carbon resource input during anammox hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo plays a critical role in the biological conversion of ammonium nh4 to dinitrogen gas in this study we constructed a hzo gene recombinant bacterium by genetic process technology with the aim to effectively remove n2h4 in anammox process the result indicates about 80 n2h4 n could be removed by the obtained hzo gene recombinant bacterium under the optimum condition an initial n2h4 n concentration of 5 mg l and a bacterial dosage of 20 ml more importantly the high n2h4 n removal efficiency about 70 could be maintained when hzo gene recombinant bacterium spread to the sixth generation the recombinant protein of hzo gene recombinant bacterium could be successfully expressed and show a stable activity to n2h4 removal under low intensity wastewater suggesting the removal of n2h4 was attributed to the successful expression of hzo enzyme of anammox bacterium in e coli keywords hydrazine oxidoreductase genetic recombinant bacterium n2h4 n removal protein expression 1 introduction due to the development of industry and agriculture a large amount of nitrogen nh4 n no3 n contained wastewater is draining into natural water bodies 1 nitrogen species once entering aquatic environment could stimulate the overgrowth of plants and algae cause or aggravate water eutrophication 2 3 nitrogenous contaminants in wastewater could be removed by physicochemical and biological methods the common physicochemical approaches for n removal include air stripping selective ion exchange and break point chlorination 4 however these methods usually consume a lot of chemicals or energy and are liable to cause secondary pollution in contrast to these physiochemical methods biological denitrification processes have the advantages of simplicity high efficiency and low cost 5 6 up to date researchers have conducted extensive studies on biological denitrification in wastewater treatment a lot of biological strategies such as simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd sequencing batch reactor sbr anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and single reactor for high activity ammonia removal over nitrite sharon have been successfully established 7 10 of these methods anammox process is widely accepted as one of the effective technologies for n removal from wastewater 11 12 at where ammonium nh4 n is oxidized with nitrite no2 n as an electron acceptor to dinitrogen gas n2 under anaerobic condition relative to conventional denitrification processes anammox can achieve greater n removal efficiency for ammonium rich wastewater with less chemical and energy consumption 13 14 microbial metabolism of n by anammox bacteria is catalyzed by a variety of enzymes among which nitrite reductase nir 15 hydrazine hydrolase hh 16 and hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo are the most important ones 17 according to the brocadia annam oxidans biochemical model proposed by kuenen et al 18 the main reaction of anammox can be divided into three steps first no2 is reduced to hydroxylamine nh2oh under the catalytic role of nir secondly nh2oh and nh3 combine to form hydrazine n2h4 under the aid of hh finally the produced n2h4 is oxidized into n2 at the presence of hzo during the whole anammox process hzo is regarded as the main rate limiting enzyme 19 it was reported that the last functional gene biomarker in hzo could promote the conversion of n2h4 to n2 20 21 therefore the activity of hzo bacteria play a crucial role for nitrogen removal during the important step n2h4 removal of anammox process 22 in practice anammox is challenged with the cultivation and enrichment of anammox bacteria due to the harsh living conditions and long generation cycle about 10 12 days of these strains 23 to solve this problem researchers carried out numerous studies on anammox bacteria such as hzo bacteria from the perspective of molecular means or functional genes of ammonia oxidizing bacteria 24 25 the result indicated that using engineering bacteria by genetic transformation and bioengineering methods could effectively increase the survival rate of anammox bacteria and thus improve nitrogen removal ability for example jo et al 26 successfully synthesized a type of engineering bacteria containing pseudomonas plasmid and used it to remove hydrocarbons from crude oil where a much high degradation efficiency was achieved by this strain zhang et al 27 obtained a protoplast fusant with enhanced degradation ability of polyacrylamide by intergeneric protoplast fusion between bacillus subtilis and rhodopseudomonas spheroids achmon et al 28 synthesized a recombinant bacterium from escherichia coli to produce 2 phenylethanol 2 pe the genetic engineering strain showed a high survival rate and strong adaptability and achieved a high yield toward the targeted product lin et al 29 selected two groups of mixed engineering bacteria sw a and sw b to degraded tph in waste oil based drilling fluid sediments and found that these engineering bacteria had high degradation ability in a recent study lin et al 30 successfully constructed a recombinant strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa with nosz defcient to effectively recover n2o during denitrifcation treatment processes above results suggest that genetic engineering technologies have great potential to be applied to construct engineering strains for the efficient denitrification of n via anammox process however the study regarding the manipulation of hzo gene to build up engineering bacterium is still scarce therefore the goal of this study is to construct a hzo gene recombinant bacterium by incorporating hzo gene from natural soil sample into e coli with the aim of to effectively removing n2h4 the intermediate product during anammox the stability and toxicity tolerance of the obtained recombinant bacterium on n2h4 were tested the removal of n2h4 by the recombinant bacteria was validated by testing n2h4 removal using the purified hzo recombinant protein 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil samples soil samples were collected from the sub superficial soil layer 10 20 cm of xisha wetland park 31 43 426 n 121 13 910 e in shanghai chongming island

bacterium the purified pcr product containing the target gene was linked to pgex 6p 1 50 ng promega beijing the connecting reaction was carried out under 4 c for 17 h at first 2 μl of linked dna and 50 μl of competent e coli dh5α takara were added into a sterilization centrifuge tube then the mixture was incubated in ice for 20 min heated for 45 50 s in a constant temperature water bath at 42 c and finally placed in ice for 2 min afterward lb liquid was added to the centrifuge tube and the culture was oscillated for 1 5 h in a constant temperature oscillator at 37 c forty μl of x gal 20 mg ml and 16 μl of iptg 50 mg ml were coated on the lb solid medium containing 100 μg ml ampicillin respectively and stand for 30 min after that 100 μl bacterial culture solution was coated in the medium sterile indoor operation which was incubated under 37 c in the incubator for 21 h 34 the positive monoclonal clones blue clones were selected by blue white spot screening and cultured in an lb liquid medium for 17 h at 37 c afterward the corresponding vector primers were used to carry out the pcr of the colony and the positive clones were identified by pcr the clones identified as positive were selected for further sequencing bio engineering shanghai co ltd 35 the hzo engineering bacterium and empty plasmid bacterium were counted using dilution plate method after the strains were cultivated in lb medium to logarithmic growth period od600 reached 0 6 200 μl bacterial suspension was transferred into two sterilized test tubes respectively both the hzo recombinant bacterial culture and empty plasmid bacterium liquid 100 μl were collected the diluted suspension was uniformly coated on lb solid medium for 21 h at 37 c the od600 value of the bacterial suspension was monitored by a uv 4802 spectrophotometry to identify the growth of bacteria the morphology of hzo engineering bacterium and the empty plasmid bacterium were characterized by a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6700f 2 4 nitrogen removal tests under aseptic condition different dosages of hzo gene recombinant bacterium suspension 0 5 10 20 30 and 40 ml under logarithmic growth phase were transferred into 100 ml n2h4 solution 40 mg ml the mixture was agitated in a thermostatic oscillator at a rate of 200 rpm under 37 c liquid sample was taken at a predetermined interval and filtered with a 0 22 μm filter to remove bacterial cells the concentration of n2h4 n in the solution was monitored using dimethyl amino benzene formaldehyde spectrophotometry 36 the effect of n concentration on the growth of hzo gene recombinant bacterium was explored by dosing 20 ml of bacterium suspension at the logarithmic growth phase into 100 ml n2h4 n solution with different n concentration 20 30 40 65 and 85 mg ml liquid samples were also taken at a predetermined interval and the n2h4 n concentration in the solution was measured 2 5 analysis and determination of fusion protein the expression of recombinant protein is critical for the rapid degradation of n2h4 n by the recombinant strain of hzo gene therefore the expression and protein concentration of recombinant protein in the recombinant bacterium were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page 37 and sk3071 non interfering protein concentration assay kit 38 a proper amount of iptg inducer induction time and temperature were selected for the identification of protein expression the effect of the fusion protein on n removal was tested by adding 50 μl fusion proteins into 100 ml solution with different n2h4 concentration 1 10 45 mg l the sample was collected to measure the absorbance of solution at 458 nm to determine the content of n2h4 by p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde spectrophotometric method 39 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of constructed hzo gene recombinant bacterium as shown in fig 1 a the size of microbial dna isolated from the soil sample is 23 kd by using genomic dna as the template hzo gene fragment was amplified by the primer hzof1 hzor1 and purified where the band at 1030 bp was successfully obtained fig 1 b and c this fragment is consistent with that reported by li et al 40 suggesting hzo gene was successfully isolated both blue and white colonies were found in the culture of hzo gene recombinant bacterium fig 1 d therefore blue colonies were subsequently cultured on lb liquid medium and further validated by pcr analysis where the band at around 1000 bp was also detected fig 1 e the hzo gene recombinant bacterium was further sequenced and validated by matching the sequence with the library of anammox bacterium the code of the gene sequence submitted to ncbi gene pool kp099436 the result indicates the degree of matching reached 95 this result suggests it belongs to the hzo gene sequences of anammox bacterium the morphologies of the hzo gene recombinant bacterium and its parent bacterium e coli were characterized by sem as shown in fig 1 f the recombinant bacterium presents largely in a spherical shape which was much different from the rod like e coli fig 1 f the change in the shape of the bacterium was likely caused by the excessive metabolic loading produced by the host bacterium as a result of the introduction of foreign gene the growth curves of the hzo engineering bacterium with and without n2h4 are displayed in fig 2 as observed the od600 value of the hzo engineering bacterial culture medium with n2h4 is higher than n2h4 free case at the first 360 min afterward the bacterial density of culture without n2h4 increased remarkably and surpassed the culture medium with 4 38 mg l n2h4 n this should be due to the toxicity resulted from the high concentration of n2h4 finally the growth curve for the hzo engineering bacterium stabilized after 800 min at where the od value was higher than 0 6 3 2 removal of n2h4 n by hzo gene recombinant bacterium the efficacy of n2h4 n removal by the hzo gene recombinant bacterium at logarithmic phase was investigated fig 3 a and b show the effects of inoculum dosage of the hzo recombinant on n2h4 n removal and the bacterial cell density in terms of od600 value under different initial n2h4 concentrations as observed with increasing bacterial dosage both the removal efficiency of n2h4 n and the od600 value of bacterial suspension increased the final removal of n2h4 n by the hzo engineering bacterium reached 90 when the bacterial dosage exceeded 20 ml this suggested that n2h4 n could be effectively removed by the obtained hzo gene recombinant bacterium the cell density of the recombinant bacteria increased steadily with the progress of bacterium dosage this result indicates a high bacterial inoculum amount could resist the toxic effect of n2h4 however with the dosage of hzo engineering bacterium increasing from 20 to 40 ml the removal of n2h4 n kept at a similar level therefore 20 ml was selected as the optimum dosage of the hzo recombinant for further tests from fig 3 c the removal of n2h4 n by the hzo engineering bacterium could be strengthened with the increase of initial n2h4 n concentration and the highest removal reached around 80 at the end of each test meanwhile it could be observed from fig 3 d that the od600 value of bacterial culture decreased with the increase of initial n2h4 n concentration this suggests that a high concentration of n2h4 could inhibit the growth of hzo gene recombinant bacterium despite this the bacterium could stably survive with the cell density od600 value maintaining across a long period 1600 min this result reveals that the hzo gene recombinant bacterium has strong tolerance and could withstand the toxicity of n2h4 under a certain concentration to investigate the generation stability and tolerance of hzo gene recombinant bacterium the method reported by lu et al 41 and yao et al 42 was used in this study the result reveals the characteristic band of hzo gene could be inherited stably by the 8th generation recombinant bacterium according to the analysis of pcr product electrophoresis fig 4 a and b display the n2h4 removal by different generations of hzo gene recombinant bacteria and the variation of the cell density od600 value during the degradation respectively for different generations the activity toward the removal of n2h4 n by the hzo engineering bacterium and the accompanying bacterial growth reflected by od600 value were inconsistent the removal of n2h4 n gradually decreased with the increase of the bacterium generation for example n2h4 n removal by the 2nd 4th and 6th generations of bacterium could attain 60 80 whereas the removal of n2h4 n by the 9th generation of bacterium dropped significantly only 27 this could also be consolidated by the growth of the recombinant cell where the 9th generation of bacterium gave very low survival rate in contrast to its predecessors according to above result it can be concluded that n2h4 n removal by the hzo gene recombinant bacterium was stable from the second generation to the sixth generation the effect of initial n2h4 n concentration on the growth of bacterium is shown in fig 4 c as can be observed the od600 value of bacterial suspension decreased greatly with increasing initial n2h4 n concentration probably due to the high toxicity of n2h4 this suggests that a high n2h4 content more than 30 mg l could suppress the growth of the hzo recombinant engineered bacterium for a fixed n2h4 concentration however the od600 value of bacterial suspension could be maintained throughout the test which manifests that the hzo engineering bacterium could tolerate toxic n2h4 within a certain extent 3 3 n2h4 n removal by recombinant protein the sds page analysis of recombinant protein components of hzo engineering bacterium and e coli were carried out and the results are shown in fig 5 a and b compared with e coli the expression of protein band at around 62 kd for the hzo gene recombinant bacterium increased significantly the molecular weight of this band is consistent with that reported by shimamura et al 43 by comparing the induced supernatant and precipitation of the hzo recombinant genetic engineered bacterium the expressed products existed mainly as the form of soluble proteins and inclusion bodies the result of the sds page analysis for the target protein is displayed in fig 5 c it suggests that the recombinant protein of hzo engineering bacterium was successfully expressed and purified the purified protein was colored in accordance with the tmb blot step using the western color reagent kit and the result is displayed in fig 6 the 62 kd target band was successfully obtained which suggests that the recombinant protein of the hzo engineering bacterium was successfully expressed the purity of the fusion protein reached over 90 after the analysis the concentration of fusion protein was determined by non interference protein assay kit sk3071 and the fusion protein concentration reached 0 58 mg ml in 30 μl sample the activity of the recombinant protein of the hzo gene recombinant bacterium on n2h4 n removal was tested and the result is shown in fig 7 it could be observed that when the initial concentration of n2h4 was 45 and 10 mg l the removal of n2h4 by the expression protein fluctuated greatly this should be ascribed to the strong toxic effect of high concentration of n2h4 which caused the inactivation of the expressed protein however when the initial concentration of n2h4 deceased to 1 mg l the removal of n2h4 could increase gradually with the progress of reaction time this result is consistent with the study from li et al 44 who reported the recombinant protein expression of hzo engineering bacterium could maintain the metabolic activity at a low level of n2h4 the removal of n2h4 in liquid should be attributed to the successful expression of hzo gene hosted by e coli which could generate a large amount of active recombinant proteins to act on the removal of toxic n2h4 from the result of this study we preliminarily confirm that the hzo gene of anammox bacteria could be incorporated into e coli to strength the removal of n2h4 future effort is required on the possible engineering application of this hzo gene recombinant bacterium in anammox process alternative by extracting the proteins of this strain we can also obtain active enzyme to eliminate the intermedia n2h4 which may also provide a strategy for the application of this gene recombinant bacterium 4 conclusion in this study a hzo gene recombinant strain was successfully prepared by genetic engineering technology and used to remove n2h4 n from wastewater the removal of n2h4 by the hzo engineering bacterium increased with the increase of inoculum dosage and the decrease of initial n2h4 n concentration the removal efficiency could reach about 80 at an initial n2h4 concentration up to 85 mg l however the growth of this strain could be suppressed when n2h4 content exceeded 30 mg l in the water the removal ability toward n2h4 n by the hzo engineering bacterium could be stably inherited to the sixth generation the purified fusion protein was also found to be effective in removing n2h4 n and showed significant activity under low level of n2h4 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

13264,chlorinated ethenes are among the most frequently occurring groundwater contaminants pump and granular activated carbon gac treatment is frequently applied to limit the spreading from point contaminations perchloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce sorb well to gac but dichloroethene dce and vinyl chloride vc sorb poorly thereby defining a low efficiency seen as amounts of gac used on the other hand ozone reacts fast with vc and dce but slowly with pce and tce we utilise for the first time the synergy between ozonation and gac to treat chlorinated ethenes contaminated groundwater as an upgrade to an existing gac treatment installation laboratory experiments confirmed that vc and trans dce could be 90 removed with just 0 23 g o3 m3 corresponding to 0 18 mg o3 mg doc for cis dce 1 1 dce and tce ozone doses of 0 86 0 87 and 2 8 mg o3 mg doc respectively were required to remove 90 in full scale trans dce and 1 1 dce were completely removed with 1 6 g o3 m3 while only 90 of cis dce and 50 tce were removed with this ozone dose a relationship between extinction of fluorescence from naturally occurring organic matter with ozone was used to gauge the ozone dose delivered in the full scale system this approach predicted precisely the removal of chlorinated ethenes finally based on the obtained results we estimated that an optimised ozone treatment would increase the lifetime of an activated carbon filters from 1 0 years to 7 2 years graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations aop advanced oxidation process ca chloroethane dca dichloroethane dce dicloroethene doc dissolved organic carbon gac granular activated carbon loq limit of quantification nom natural organic matter pce perchlororethene tce trichloroethene uv ultraviolet vc vinyl chloride keywords chlorinated ethenes vinyl chloride ozone granular activated carbon gac fluorescence spectroscopy 1 introduction perchloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce were previously widely used for example in dry cleaning and as degreasers in the metal industry however their intensive use has resulted in a high number of polluted sites in locations where they were stored used or disposed due to the physiochemical properties of pce and tce and their biodegradation into dichloroethene dce and vinyl chloride vc pollutants spread to groundwater and thus are of major concern in terms of potable water production since the compounds are toxic and carcinogenic 1 2 excavating soil from pollution hotspots and limiting the spread to groundwater through pump and treatment operations are the most widely used abatement methods most pumped water is treated by sorption to granular activated carbon gac gac adsorption capacity increases in line with the hydrophobicity of a pollutant 3 but it is a matter of some debate whether background organic matter competes with the adsorption of volatile organic compounds 4 according to jubanyet al 5 who estimated the lifetime of gac when adsorbing stripped volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons from groundwater affinity increases in the following order vc cis trans dce tce pce 1 1 dce 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca thus the sorption of vc is often the limiting condition when designing and operating gac this is particularly unfortunate as vc is also by far the most toxic hydrocarbon and thus has the lowest water quality criteria concentration 6 the sorption of chlorinated ethenes has the disadvantage that it only transfers pollutants from one phase to another 7 9 and waste has to be handled ozonation on the other hand is very successful in oxidising compounds but this process is quite selective second order kinetic rate constants of ozone with chlorinated ethenes as described by von sonntag and von gunten 10 show that ozone reacts quickly with vc but with increasing chlorine atoms the reaction is slower thus the reaction with tce is approximately 1000 times slower than with vc as ozone reacts fastest with compounds that sorb the least amount to activated carbon as illustrated in fig 1 the two treatments appear to complement each other for the treatment of water polluted with various chlorinated ethenes as often found in actual contamination cases however the feasibility of a combined treatment depends on the required ozone dose needed to remove chlorinated ethenes with low chlorine content if a high ozone dosage is required to remove the less chlorinated ethenes sufficiently it might render the reaction chamber unacceptably large to allow the ozone to react fully or result in ozone remaining in the treatment effluent and being lost by reacting with the envisioned gac filter in order to enhance the process involved in and economic efficiency of ozonation advanced oxidation processes aops have been implemented that combine ozone with other oxidising agents such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and uv light for the formation of hydroxyl radical oh which is more reactive and less selective than ozone studies have shown that comparing to ozone the combination of o3 h2o2 accelerates and increases tce and pce treatment efficiency which in turn leads to less utilisation and subsequently a longer lifetime of gac 8 11 12 the removal of tce and pce from groundwater by o3 h2o2 has been used for example in the usa 13 aops are expensive and therefore they are recommended for water with a chemical oxygen demand cod less than 5 g l 14 a promising cost effective way to assure water remediation is the use of an aop as a preliminary treatment step followed by biological treatment 15 ozone dosage measurement and control in small continuous systems represent a technical challenge in that ozone generator outputs notoriously fluctuate due to operating times ambient temperature and small fluctuations in feed gas quality measuring the delivered dose in water is not feasible due to the fast initial reaction with organic matter in the water and the gold standard of applying concentration meters on gas streams in and out of the bubble contactor often being too costly for small installations fluorescence and uv absorbance measurements have been applied in several studies as indicators of water remediation efficiency during ozonation 16 it has been found that the two methods correlate to a significant degree 17 however fluorescence spectroscopy is of a higher sensitivity and able to classify different fluorescing compounds providing complicated absorbance spectra 18 additionally fluorescence instrumentation can easily be installed in a system for online measurements thereby offering the ability to observe any quantitative or qualitative changes in organic matter in a non invasive and rapid manner 19 20 the aim of this study is to test the concept of synergy between ozone and gac that we predicted based on an opposite order of reaction rate constant with ozone ko3 and partition coefficient kd the synergy is confirmed to our knowledge for the first time by investigating ozone doses required to remove chlorinated ethenes in laboratory experiments and determining removal in a full scale system furthermore ozone dosing and the removal of chlorinated ethenes in laboratory and full scale experiments are compared using fluorescence removal moreover we investigate fluorescence removal as an ozone dosing tool in a continuous system instead of a ozone sensor finally we estimate the lifetime of gac filters at different ozone doses 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich denmark aps and used as received ozone stock solution for laboratory experiments was made using a 20 g h nameplate capacity ozone generator from o3 technology ab vellinge sweden supplied with dry oxygen gas the generated ozone was dispersed in a collection bottle containing ultrapure water to create the ozone stock solution to increase ozone solubility the bottle was kept in an ice bath ozone concentration in the stock solution was typically approximately 40 mg l 2 2

according to standard methods 2 2 2 ozone ozone concentration was estimated by the indigo method described in 21 and the following reagents were used 0 5 m phosphate buffer ph 2 and 1 g l potassium

a sample were added to a cuvette at a total volume of 2 5 ml the volume of the sample and the ultrapure water was dependent on the desired ozone concentration in the blank solutions ultrapure water

asi v uvc persulphate analyser the calibration curve was created by potassium hydrogen phthalate standards to cover a range from 50 to 2000 μg l r2 0 9949 the injection volume of the samples was 3 ml the limit of quantification loq was 50 μg l in the following nvoc is referred to as doc 2 2 5 uv absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy changes in uv absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy were investigated as a surrogate for ozone dose delivered to the water uv absorbance was measured at 254 nm in a cuvette with a 4 0 cm light path using a varian cary 50bio uv vis spectrophotometer agilent

chlorinated compounds samples destined for measuring the concentration of the volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons were collected in 20 ml glass vials with no headspace they were stored at 4 c and brought up to room temperature prior to analysis immediately before the analysis an amount of the sample had to be removed following which internal standard chloroform was added the final volume in the vial was 10 5 ml including the sample and the internal standard the method used was headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometry hs gc ms further information about the methods can be found

immediately added all samples were preserved at 20 c in a freezer before analysis by hplc ms ms the samples reached room temperature then 900 μl of the sample was transferred into an hplc vial and 100 μl internal standard solution mecoprop was added thereafter lastly a 100 μl sample from the hplc vial was injected and analysed by hplc ms ms as previously described in tang et al 24 2 3 system configuration on the site of a discontinued industry using tce in north zeeland denmark a pump and treat treatment plant has been built the treatment plant consists of two aerated sand filters in series followed by two gac filters in series for this specific project the facility was modified with the addition of ozonation o3 technology nordic aps between the sand filtration and gac adsorption processes fig 2 first the aeration and sand filteration removed iron and manganese oxides next water was ozonated in a system composed of four cylindrical columns connected in series ozone was produced by a generator feed with oxygen produced by a psa oxygen generator the ozone was diffused as small bubbles in the bottom of the first column counter current to the water flow after ozonation the water was polished by gac filters the flow of the polluted water was 1 16 m3 h and oxygen flow was 3 l min the focus of this study was mainly on ozonation 2 4 experiments 2 4 1 removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in laboratory experiments chlorinated hydrocarbons contaminated water for the laboratory experiments was collected at the treatment plant after aeration and sand filtration in glass bottles without headspace and stored at 4 c until use since the concentration of vc was below the gc ms detection limit in the aerated water spiking with vc was necessary to verify that ozone can efficiently destroy it a 1 l blue cap bottle filled completely with aerated water was spiked with vc gas and then shaken overnight to achieve dissolution of vc gas afterwards the spiked water was divided into 20 ml vials with no headspace which had to remain cool at 8 c some of the vials were put aside and used as blanks in the rest of the vials immediately before adding the ozone an exactly calculated volume of water was removed and then replaced with the same volume of ozone stock solution in order to maintain no headspace conditions the water was treated with 0 5 1 2 4 and 7 g o3 m3 as well as 4 and 7 g o3 m3 combined with 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 the dosage of h2o2 was selected to roughly reduce the expected time for complete ozone hydrolysis to 2 3 min based on hey et al 25 for the control samples ultrapure water was used instead of ozone stock solution the controls were needed to confirm that volatile compounds would not be released during ozone transfer all of the samples were left to react overnight and volatiles concentrations were measured by gc ms the following day a second experiment was performed with ozone concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 8 g m3 and a duplicate was prepared for the samples of the two highest ozone concentrations with additional 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 this time apart from measuring the concentration of the chlorinated hydrocarbons fluorescence and uv absorbance was measured in a third experiment the aerated water was spiked with 97 μg l clofibric acid and ozonated in the same way as carried out in the second experiment of vc clofibric acid concentration was determined in hplc ms ms 2 4 2 treatment with o3 and o3 h2o2 in the field different ozone doses were tested by adjusting the setting on the ozone generator and thereby getting different ozone concentrations in the gas stream supplied to the ozonation column total gas flow in the bubble contactor remained unchanged regardless of the dosage the exact ozone input into the system was measured by an ozone analyser bmt 964 bmt messtechnik gmbh berlin germany connected at the outlet of the ozone generator the concentrations used were 0 2 7 10 and 27 g o3 nm3 air corresponding to ozone doses of 0 0 3 1 0 1 6 and 4 2 g o3 m3 water treated respectively assuming all ozone was transferred to the water the two highest ozone doses were also tested with an additional 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 at the inlet to the first column at the application of each ozone dose the system was allowed to reach equilibrium estimated as 4 hydraulic retention times hrts before the samples were collected from the outlet of the second and fourth column the fluorescence of the samples was measured on the spot in order to confirm that the system was well functioning further explained in sections 2 4 4 and 3 4 moreover unreacted ozone in the columns was measured by the indigo method presented in section 2 2 2 and 20 ml vials were filled completely to avoid headspace and then taken to the laboratory for gc ms and uv absorbance analysis samples for chlorethenes analysis were added to thiosulfate prior to filling the vial in order to quench residual ozone 2 4 3 decomposition of ozone ozone lifetime was measured in aerated water for the ozone only or ozone combined with h2o2 treatments water was divided into subsamples of 50 ml each which were then placed in a cooling bath at 8 c ozone stock solution was added to achieve direct oxidation with 2 4 4 8 and 6 3 g o3 m3 and advanced oxidation with 2 4 and 6 3 g o3 m3 together with 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 ozone concentration in the subsamples was measured over time via the method described in section 2 2 2 while their initial ozone concentration was measured by the same method as in the blank solutions 2 4 4 fluorescence and uv absorbance calibration curves the procedure for ozone transfer was the same as in 2 5 3 meaning that the water was divided into subsamples which were first cooled at 8 c and then spiked with various ozone dosages ranging from 0 to 5 3 g m3 the day after fluorescence and uv absorbance were measured the experiment was conducted three times over the period of the project to verify its reproducibility 2 5 data treatment the efficiency of ozone in terms of removing chlorinated compounds and clofibric acid was calculated based on a 90 removal rate the exponential eq 1 gives the remaining concentration of a pollutant c in relation to its initial concentration c0 for a particular ozone dose do3 the constant ddo3 represents the ozone dose required for 90 removal of a pollutant 26 27 1 c c 0 10 do 3 ddo 3 in order to fit the ozone input into the specific water matrix of this case eq 2 is created which describes the ozone needed for 90 pollutant removal in relation to the dissolved organic carbon doc of the sample 2 z 90 ddo 3 doc the mass balance of ozone in the columns at the treatment facility could be calculated by eq 3 assuming that there was no ozone in the outlet gas in the top of the column 3 o 3 in o 3 reacted o 3 residual where o3in is the inlet ozone o3reacted is the ozone that reacted in the columns and o3residual is the remaining ozone 3 results and discussions at an industrial area in north zeeland denmark tce pollution was present due to previous activity the pollution had spread to groundwater and remediation had been installed to prevent any further spread as the main pollutant was tce tce and its degradation products were found in the groundwater the following concentrations of tce and its degradation products were measured in the water after sand filtration tce 1026 1172 μg l cis dce 119 127 μg l trans dce 20 25 μg l 1 1 dce 4 1 4 4 μg l and 1 1 dca 14 15 μg l vc and ca were below loq furthermore some physical chemical parameters of the water were measured and the results were as follows doc 1 3 mg l ph 7 4 dissolved oxygen 8 8 mg l alkalinity 5 8 meq l uv absorbance at 254 nm 0 104 cm 1 iron 0 01 mg l and manganese 0 002 mg l 3 1 chlorinated ethenes in laboratory treatment in this part of the study water from the study site spiked with vc two experiments and clofibric acid one experiment was treated with ozonation and o3 h2o2 under controlled conditions in the laboratory results from the second experiment with the spiked vc are presented in fig 3 while results from the other two experiments are in the supporting information si for all compounds investigated decreasing concentrations were measured in line with increasing applied ozone doses as expected and seen in fig 3 vc and trans dce reacted most with ozone and they were completely removed with less than 1 g o3 m3 cis dce and 1 1 dce followed in terms of reactivity tce as it is more resistant had to be treated with a higher ozone dose in order to see a significant reduction the order of compound degradability was as expected based on the reaction rate constants given in von sonntag and von gunten 10 as known 1 1 dca is rather inactive because of the single bond of the ethane structure a percentage of 84 was still present after treatment with 5 8 g o3 m3 for the two highest concentrations of ozone namely 3 6 and 5 8 g o3 m3 which were combined with h2o2 no traces of vc trans dce cis dce or 1 1 dce were detected the black borderline symbols for tce and 1 1 dca in fig 3a illustrate that the presence of h2o2 had no impact on the removal of the compounds as both compounds react very slow with ozone 28 the removal pathway was most likely due to a reaction with hydroxyl radicals originating from ozone decomposition and therefore no difference was found when adding hydrogen peroxide similar results have been seen when comparing ozone and ozone hydrogen peroxide treatment of pharmaceuticals in biologically treated wastewater 27 eq 1 was fitted to all the data and z90 was calculated using eq 2 estimated z90 values from the ozonation experiments are presented in table 2 the data from the three experiments were fairly similar among the three experiments the average z90 of vc and trans dce were 0 18 mg o3 mg doc the z90 for tce was 2 8 mg o3 mg doc as expected the relationship between the z90 values and the reaction rate constants table 1 was reverse proportional a low z90 indicates that the compound reacted quickly with ozone which in turn means a high rate constant our laboratory method of applying precise ozone amounts to water samples by using a water solution have not been used on water with such a low doc as the groundwater from this site to verify the method employed to determine reactivity we spiked clofibric acid into water during one experiment in order to compare with our previous study 27 where we determined the z90 of clofibric acid at 1 5 0 3 mg o3 mg doc in biologically treated wastewater conducting an experiment with a substance of known z90 would verify the reliability of the remaining z90 values however since the water matrix here was clearer and with much lower toc than biologically treated wastewater the z90 of clofibric acid was eventually 2 3 mg o3 mg doc the reaction rate of clofibric acid with ozone is 20 m 1 s 1 29 which fits well with the z90 value for clofibric acid which was closer to tce than 1 1 dce 3 2 application of ozone and o3 h2o2 treatment in the field in the field experiments ozone doses of 0 0 3 1 0 1 6 and 4 2 g o3 m3 water treated were applied and advanced oxidation was also implemented for the two highest ozone inputs with additional h2o2 at the inlet of the first column each setting was repeated two or three times fig 4 displays the relative concentrations of the chlorinated hydrocarbons in relation to their initial concentrations for each condition in the middle after column 2 and at the end after column 4 of the ozonation setup the concentration of vc in the aerated groundwater was below the gc ms detection limit and consequently its treatment could not be examined further however since vc has a very low z90 according to the experiments in section 3 1 it was expected that it would be entirely destroyed in the ozonation columns pce and ca were also not detected in the aerated groundwater as anticipated the greatest removal was achieved by the highest ozone dose 4 2 g o3 m3 at 78 removal of tce other researchers have found similar removal success during the ozonation of tce contaminated ground water in a bench scale laboratory setup ikehata et al 30 reduced tce concentration to below loq and thus found more than 80 removal with an ozone dose of 5 g m3 while tammaro et al 31 obtained up to an 86 reduction with 8 4 g m3 in a laboratory scale semi batch setup in a recent pilot scale study tkachenko et al 32 removed 94 of tce using an ozone dose of approximately 19 g m3 at an ozone dose of 1 6 g o3 m3 trans dce and 1 1 dce were removed to below loq while 90 of cis dce and around 50 of tce were removed as well this might be a better solution from a cost effective perspective because when ozonation can achieve the complete removal of vc and the dce isomers alongside the partial removal of tce the lifetime of gac is anticipated to increase which will subsequently decrease the cost of gac replacement the advanced oxidation had an overall efficiency quite similar to the ozonation for cis dce and tce fig 4 both compounds have a rate constant with ozone 14 540 m 1 s 1 that is significantly lower than with hydroxyl radicals 4 0 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 28 33 thus in the experiment without the addition of hydrogen peroxide the removal likely involve hydroxyl radicals originating from ozone decomposition and therefore no difference in efficiency was found when adding hydrogen peroxide when adding hydrogen peroxide together with ozone more hydroxyl radicals were formed and so one would expect the higher removal of ozone recalcitrant compounds however both nom and carbonate act as scavengers and reduce the efficiency of advanced oxidation glaze and kang 12 and karimi et al 7 both found in their studies a negative effect of high alkalinity on the o3 h2o2 treatment of tce and pce neither of the two methods was successful at reducing 1 1 dca and only 10 24 was removed at the outlet of the last column in the experiments with 1 6 g o3 m3 and 4 2 g o3 m3 the results also revealed that the reaction between ozone and the chlorinated substances mainly occurred in the first two columns compound concentration did not change considerably from the middle until the end of the process the concentration of ozone at the end of the system was measured and it was always less than 1 g m3 moreover no h2o2 was detected at the outlet of the ozone system 3 3 decomposition of ozone during ozone and o3 h2o2 treatment the decomposition of ozone only and ozone in the presence of h2o2 in aerated groundwater was investigated ozonation at dosages of 2 4 4 8 and 6 3 g o3 m3 resulted in respective half lives t½ of 17 18 20 and 29 min fig 5 a the ozone consumption rate is highly dependent on the amount and quality of the organic matter and ph in this case since the doc was relatively low at 1 3 mg l and ph was 7 4 ozone reduction was a slow process these results have to be taken into consideration for ozone treatment in the field high amounts of unreacted ozone at the end of ozonation could indicate a waste of ozone and pose a risk for reactions downstream such as toxicity to the possible biological filtration that may occur in the gac filter the addition of 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 accelerated ozone reduction as seen in fig 5b the lifetime of ozone was reduced to less than 6 min for all tested concentrations these results are compatible with the theory that h2o2 and ozone form hydroxyl radicals which react quickly and unselectively when advanced oxidation was applied in the pilot plant no ozone was expected to be found at the ozonation outlet as the retention time was estimated at approximately 15 min however ozone concentrations at 0 2 0 3 g m3 were measured in the outlet of the ozone setup in experiments when hydrogen peroxide was added 3 4 fluorescence for ozone dosage measurement scanning of the aerated groundwater in the fluorescence spectrometer showed a peak at excitation wavelength 230 nm and an emission wavelength 425 nm fig s1 in si based on the literature the acquired fluorescence peak was a humic like a peak which is found in natural waters 34 35 to investigate the relation between fluorescence and ozone dosage groundwater was treated with different ozone doses following which fluorescence and uv absorbance were measured the experiment was performed three times with water collected on different days relative fluorescence in relation to the initial fluorescence plotted against the ozone concentrations of each experiment as well as all experiments is illustrated in fig 6 a b fig 6c d are the respective plots for uv absorbance low ozone doses 1 g m3 removed a significant part of the fluorescence while at higher ozone doses the removal of fluorescence per gram ozone added was much less thus a two phase exponential decay model was fitted to the measurements in graphpad prism with high correlation r2 0 99 neither fluorescence from excitation at 230 nm and emission at 425 nm nor uv absorbance necessarily originated from one substance in fact in this water it would have to have originated from multiple compounds with different reactivity to ozone otherwise there would have been a first order exponential decay relation similar to the removal of the chlorinated ethenes data from all three experiments were collected and fitted as well fig 6b d by comparing the figures the two methods fluorescence and uv absorbance are compatible to a great degree since the curves have a similar shape and both plateau at similar ozone concentrations it seems that most of the fluorescent natural organic substances were removed with 4 5 g o3 m3 the difference in the intensity of absorbance signals must be attributed to the presence of non fluorescent compounds similar differences in fluorescence and uv absorbance during ozonation have been found during the ozonation of wastewater effluents 36 the correlation between the remaining pollutant and both fluorescence and uv absorbance for water treated with different ozone doses was investigated fig 7 the chlorinated ethenes and the organic compounds humic acids responsible for fluorescence required different amounts of ozone to be removed which is notable due to the fact that they do not follow a linear correlation given by the dotted line in fig 7a b the starting point of all the lines is 1 1 where the water was untreated when reaching the 0 0 point ozone dosage increased thus reacting more with the fluorescent humic like substances and pollutants as can be seen the lines of vc and trans dce become very sharply horizontal on the x axis when the chlorinated hydrocarbons were removed it was only the humic like compounds that continued to decrease for higher ozone inputs for cis dce 1 1 dce and tce the lines reach y 0 in a smoother way however the line for 1 1 dca is less sharp because the increasing amounts of ozone did not have a great influence on the persistent 1 1 dca removing fluorescence during ozonation has previously been investigated during the treatment of water in recirculating aquaculture 17 and wastewater treatment 36 38 both spiliotopoulou et al 37 and park et al 36 investigated the correlation of fluorescence with pharmaceutical removal during the ozonation of biologically treated municipal wastewater and found that compounds that react quickly with ozone were removed faster than fluorescence while recalcitrant compounds were removed slower thus their findings were similar to ours in spite of the very different matrix the plots for uv absorbance fig 7c d follow a very similar trend to fig 7a b nevertheless the angle of the lines is more acute which happens because the water also contains compounds that absorb and do not fluoresce such as inorganic matter 3 5 mass balances of ozone in the field scale treatment as described in section 3 2 the field experiment included ozonation with doses at 0 0 3 1 0 1 6 and 4 2 g o3 m3 as well as coupling of the two highest ozone doses with h2o2 the inlet reacted and residual ozone was measured in order to calculate the mass balance presented in eq 3 the fluorescence spectrophotometer was carried to the field to estimate the reacted ozone samples were collected from either column 2 or 4 and their fluorescence was measured fluorescence values were interpolated using the curve day 3 in fig 6a providing the corresponding ozone consumption residual ozone was measured by the indigo method the inlet ozone was determined by measuring ozone gas with an ozone analyser for ozone treatment at 0 3 1 0 and 1 6 g o3 m3 the ozone analyser fluctuated and so a mean value was used for calculations however the concentration measurement was stable for ozone input at 4 2 g o3 m3 the results after column 2 are given in fig 8 while the remaining results can be found in table s2 in si in general it was found that the transfer of ozone was high and successful in order to achieve high ozone transfer it is important to have tiny bubbles as they have high internal pressure and rapid mass transfer rates 39 by visual inspection of the first column in the full scale system the bubble size was estimated to be a mixture of micro and macro bubbles for the treatment at 0 3 1 0 and 1 6 g o3 m3 the interpolated concentrations of reacted ozone were below 1 1 g m3 values that belong to the first part of the curve therefore the mass balances were more accurate and did not fluctuate greatly from 100 recovery fluctuation of the ozone analyser when applying these settings has to be taken into consideration for the noted deviations on the contrary treatments with 4 2 g o3 m3 were on the second part of the fluorescence curve thus underestimating the amount of ozone that reacted in the system 3 6 prediction of chlorinated ethene removal vs measured in order to gauge the precision of the laboratory experiments in predicting ozonation in a real life scenario as exemplified by the full scale system the removal of chlorinated ethenes was estimated and compared with the measured removal the removal of chlorinated ethenes was predicted using the delivered ozone dose ozone consumption as estimated in section 3 5 the z90 values given in section 3 1 the doc value and eqs 1 and 2 it was estimated for trans dce cis dce and tce fig 9 the estimated removals fitted well with the measured ones the measurement of fluorescence removal together with laboratory batch experiments can thus be a powerful tool in predicting the removal of pollutants in full scale systems 3 7 estimation of the gac filter s lifetime to evaluate the effect of adding ozone during treatment on the lifetime of the gac filter estimations of breakthrough curves for the different chlorinated ethenes and across a range of concentrations were performed the breakthrough curves were modelled using an analytical model developed by genuchten and alves 40 constants such as the dispersion coefficient and average pore velocity in the gac filter were found in a danish report 41 wherein they were estimated based on laboratory experiments and a full scale gac filter details on the model and the constants used herein are provided in si first the amount of carbon in the column was set to obtain a breakthrough concentration of vc at the outlet of the gac filter corresponding to water quality criteria after 1 year afterwards the lifetime was estimated for water after ozone treatment at different levels table 2 the concentrations of the chlorinated ethenes after ozone treatment were estimated based on eqs 1 and 2 and the z90 values given in section 3 1 a low amount of ozone 0 3 g m3 in this case would remove vc trans dce and 1 1 dce to below water quality criteria and the limiting compound would be cis dce resulting in a gac filter lifespan of 4 3 years at 1 5 g m3 of ozone only tce was above the water quality criteria with a lifespan of 7 2 years with an ozone dose of 8 g m3 tce would come in under the water quality criteria and the gac filter should last for a very long time thus the results indicate that there is a good synergy between treatment with low levels of ozone and subsequent gac filtration 4 conclusion the findings of this study are as follows more than 90 of vc and trans dce was removed at 0 18 mg o3 mg doc while the ozone doses required to remove 90 of cis dce 1 1 dce and tce were 0 86 0 87 and 2 8 mg o3 mg doc respectively in full scale experiments the removal of the chlorinated ethenes increased in line with an increase in ozone dose and both trans dce and 1 1 dce were completely removed at 1 6 g o3 m3 while only 90 of cis dce and 50 tce were removed with this ozone dose the addition of hydrogen peroxide reduced the ozone s lifetime while no change in the removal of chlorinated ethenes was observed furthermore hydrogen peroxide addition reduced residual ozone concentration at the highest ozone doses in the full scale system in the laboratory experiments a relationship between fluorescence originating from natural organic matter and the ozone dose was found and it was then used to determine the delivered ozone dose in the full scale system furthermore the estimated removal of chlorinated ethenes based on estimated delivered ozone dose fitted very well with what was actually removed in the full scale system thus the removal of fluorescence can be a powerful tool for evaluating performance the lifetime of a gac filter was estimated with different ozone treatments and in this regard optimal ozone treatment at 1 5 g m3 increased it from 1 year to 7 2 years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

13264,chlorinated ethenes are among the most frequently occurring groundwater contaminants pump and granular activated carbon gac treatment is frequently applied to limit the spreading from point contaminations perchloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce sorb well to gac but dichloroethene dce and vinyl chloride vc sorb poorly thereby defining a low efficiency seen as amounts of gac used on the other hand ozone reacts fast with vc and dce but slowly with pce and tce we utilise for the first time the synergy between ozonation and gac to treat chlorinated ethenes contaminated groundwater as an upgrade to an existing gac treatment installation laboratory experiments confirmed that vc and trans dce could be 90 removed with just 0 23 g o3 m3 corresponding to 0 18 mg o3 mg doc for cis dce 1 1 dce and tce ozone doses of 0 86 0 87 and 2 8 mg o3 mg doc respectively were required to remove 90 in full scale trans dce and 1 1 dce were completely removed with 1 6 g o3 m3 while only 90 of cis dce and 50 tce were removed with this ozone dose a relationship between extinction of fluorescence from naturally occurring organic matter with ozone was used to gauge the ozone dose delivered in the full scale system this approach predicted precisely the removal of chlorinated ethenes finally based on the obtained results we estimated that an optimised ozone treatment would increase the lifetime of an activated carbon filters from 1 0 years to 7 2 years graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations aop advanced oxidation process ca chloroethane dca dichloroethane dce dicloroethene doc dissolved organic carbon gac granular activated carbon loq limit of quantification nom natural organic matter pce perchlororethene tce trichloroethene uv ultraviolet vc vinyl chloride keywords chlorinated ethenes vinyl chloride ozone granular activated carbon gac fluorescence spectroscopy 1 introduction perchloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce were previously widely used for example in dry cleaning and as degreasers in the metal industry however their intensive use has resulted in a high number of polluted sites in locations where they were stored used or disposed due to the physiochemical properties of pce and tce and their biodegradation into dichloroethene dce and vinyl chloride vc pollutants spread to groundwater and thus are of major concern in terms of potable water production since the compounds are toxic and carcinogenic 1 2 excavating soil from pollution hotspots and limiting the spread to groundwater through pump and treatment operations are the most widely used abatement methods most pumped water is treated by sorption to granular activated carbon gac gac adsorption capacity increases in line with the hydrophobicity of a pollutant 3 but it is a matter of some debate whether background organic matter competes with the adsorption of volatile organic compounds 4 according to jubanyet al 5 who estimated the lifetime of gac when adsorbing stripped volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons from groundwater affinity increases in the following order vc cis trans dce tce pce 1 1 dce 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca thus the sorption of vc is often the limiting condition when designing and operating gac this is particularly unfortunate as vc is also by far the most toxic hydrocarbon and thus has the lowest water quality criteria concentration 6 the sorption of chlorinated ethenes has the disadvantage that it only transfers pollutants from one phase to another 7 9 and waste has to be handled ozonation on the other hand is very successful in oxidising compounds but this process is quite selective second order kinetic rate constants of ozone with chlorinated ethenes as described by von sonntag and von gunten 10 show that ozone reacts quickly with vc but with increasing chlorine atoms the reaction is slower thus the reaction with tce is approximately 1000 times slower than with vc as ozone reacts fastest with compounds that sorb the least amount to activated carbon as illustrated in fig 1 the two treatments appear to complement each other for the treatment of water polluted with various chlorinated ethenes as often found in actual contamination cases however the feasibility of a combined treatment depends on the required ozone dose needed to remove chlorinated ethenes with low chlorine content if a high ozone dosage is required to remove the less chlorinated ethenes sufficiently it might render the reaction chamber unacceptably large to allow the ozone to react fully or result in ozone remaining in the treatment effluent and being lost by reacting with the envisioned gac filter in order to enhance the process involved in and economic efficiency of ozonation advanced oxidation processes aops have been implemented that combine ozone with other oxidising agents such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and uv light for the formation of hydroxyl radical oh which is more reactive and less selective than ozone studies have shown that comparing to ozone the combination of o3 h2o2 accelerates and increases tce and pce treatment efficiency which in turn leads to less utilisation and subsequently a longer lifetime of gac 8 11 12 the removal of tce and pce from groundwater by o3 h2o2 has been used for example in the usa 13 aops are expensive and therefore they are recommended for water with a chemical oxygen demand cod less than 5 g l 14 a promising cost effective way to assure water remediation is the use of an aop as a preliminary treatment step followed by biological treatment 15 ozone dosage measurement and control in small continuous systems represent a technical challenge in that ozone generator outputs notoriously fluctuate due to operating times ambient temperature and small fluctuations in feed gas quality measuring the delivered dose in water is not feasible due to the fast initial reaction with organic matter in the water and the gold standard of applying concentration meters on gas streams in and out of the bubble contactor often being too costly for small installations fluorescence and uv absorbance measurements have been applied in several studies as indicators of water remediation efficiency during ozonation 16 it has been found that the two methods correlate to a significant degree 17 however fluorescence spectroscopy is of a higher sensitivity and able to classify different fluorescing compounds providing complicated absorbance spectra 18 additionally fluorescence instrumentation can easily be installed in a system for online measurements thereby offering the ability to observe any quantitative or qualitative changes in organic matter in a non invasive and rapid manner 19 20 the aim of this study is to test the concept of synergy between ozone and gac that we predicted based on an opposite order of reaction rate constant with ozone ko3 and partition coefficient kd the synergy is confirmed to our knowledge for the first time by investigating ozone doses required to remove chlorinated ethenes in laboratory experiments and determining removal in a full scale system furthermore ozone dosing and the removal of chlorinated ethenes in laboratory and full scale experiments are compared using fluorescence removal moreover we investigate fluorescence removal as an ozone dosing tool in a continuous system instead of a ozone sensor finally we estimate the lifetime of gac filters at different ozone doses 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich denmark aps and used as received ozone stock solution for laboratory experiments was made using a 20 g h nameplate capacity ozone generator from o3 technology ab vellinge sweden supplied with dry oxygen gas the generated ozone was dispersed in a collection bottle containing ultrapure water to create the ozone stock solution to increase ozone solubility the bottle was kept in an ice bath ozone concentration in the stock solution was typically approximately 40 mg l 2 2 quantification 2 2 1 alkalinity ph and dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen and ph were measured on site using probes from oxyguard international a s denmark alkalinity was determined by titration and according to standard methods 2 2 2 ozone ozone concentration was estimated by the indigo method described in 21 and the following reagents were used 0 5 m phosphate buffer ph 2 and 1 g l potassium indigotrisulfonate solution in 20 mm phosphoric acid for the ozone lifetime laboratory experiments 0 1 ml of potassium indigotrisulfonate solution 0 25 ml of 0 5 m phosphate buffer ultrapure water and a sample were added to a cuvette at a total volume of 2 5 ml the volume of the sample and the ultrapure water was dependent on the desired ozone concentration in the blank solutions ultrapure water was used instead of the sample absorbance was measured at 600 nm and ozone concentrations were determined by comparing the blank with the sample using δa 20 000 1 cm mol o3 added per l 22 in the field the volumes of the reagents sample and ultrapure water were adjusted to fit in a 50 ml volumetric flask 2 2 3 hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide was measured on site through its reaction with potassium titanium oxide oxalate in an acid solution using a one step colorimetric method the reaction forms a yellow pertitanic acid complex which can be measured spectrophotometrically at 400 nm the method is valid for determining hydrogen peroxide within the range 0 025 100 mg l 23 2 2 4 non volatile organic carbon the non volatile organic carbon nvoc of the samples was measured with a shimadzu asi v uvc persulphate analyser the calibration curve was created by potassium hydrogen phthalate standards to cover a range from 50 to 2000 μg l r2 0 9949 the injection volume of the samples was 3 ml the limit of quantification loq was 50 μg l in the following nvoc is referred to as doc 2 2 5 uv absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy changes in uv absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy were investigated as a surrogate for ozone dose delivered to the water uv absorbance was measured at 254 nm in a cuvette with a 4 0 cm light path using a varian cary 50bio uv vis spectrophotometer agilent for fluorescence a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent was used at an excitation wavelength of 230 nm an emission wavelength of 425 nm an excitation slit of 5 nm an emission slit of 5 nm and a high pmt voltage settings for the fluorescence spectrophotometer were determined after having scanned samples within a broad range of emission and excitation wavelengths 2 2 6 volatile chlorinated compounds samples destined for measuring the concentration of the volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons were collected in 20 ml glass vials with no headspace they were stored at 4 c and brought up to room temperature prior to analysis immediately before the analysis an amount of the sample had to be removed following which internal standard chloroform was added the final volume in the vial was 10 5 ml including the sample and the internal standard the method used was headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometry hs gc ms further information about the methods can be found in si the analysis was conducted for pce tce cis dce vc 1 1 dca 1 1 dce trans dce and chloroethane ca the loq was 0 024 μg l for pce cis dce and trans dce 0 023 μg l for 1 1 dca and 1 1 dce 0 2714 μg

immediately added all samples were preserved at 20 c in a freezer before analysis by hplc ms ms the samples reached room temperature then 900 μl of the sample was transferred into an hplc vial and 100 μl internal standard solution mecoprop was added thereafter lastly a 100 μl sample from the hplc vial was injected and analysed by hplc ms ms as previously described in tang et al 24 2 3 system configuration on the site of a discontinued industry using tce in north zeeland denmark a pump and treat treatment plant has been built the treatment plant consists of two aerated sand filters in series followed by two gac filters in series for this specific project the facility was modified with the addition of ozonation o3 technology nordic aps between the sand filtration and gac adsorption processes fig 2 first the aeration and sand filteration removed iron and manganese oxides next water was ozonated in a system composed of four cylindrical columns connected in series ozone was produced by a generator feed with oxygen produced by a psa oxygen generator the ozone was diffused as small bubbles in the bottom of the first column counter current to the water flow after ozonation the water was polished by gac filters the flow of the polluted water was 1 16 m3 h and oxygen flow was 3 l min the focus of this study was mainly on ozonation 2 4 experiments 2 4 1 removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in laboratory experiments chlorinated hydrocarbons contaminated water for the laboratory experiments was collected at the treatment plant after aeration and sand filtration in glass bottles without headspace and stored at 4 c until use since the concentration of vc was below the gc ms detection limit in the aerated water spiking with vc was necessary to verify that ozone can efficiently destroy it a 1 l blue cap bottle filled completely with aerated water was spiked with vc gas and then shaken overnight to achieve dissolution of vc gas afterwards the spiked water was divided into 20 ml vials with no headspace which had to remain cool at 8 c some of the vials were put aside and used as blanks in the rest of the vials immediately before adding the ozone an exactly calculated volume of water was removed and then replaced with the same volume of ozone stock solution in order to maintain no headspace conditions the water was treated with 0 5 1 2 4 and 7 g o3 m3 as well as 4 and 7 g o3 m3 combined with 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 the dosage of h2o2 was selected to roughly reduce the expected time for complete ozone hydrolysis to 2 3 min based on hey et al 25 for the control samples ultrapure water was used instead of ozone stock solution the controls were needed to confirm that volatile compounds would not be released during ozone transfer all of the samples were left to react overnight and volatiles concentrations were measured by gc ms the following day a second experiment was performed with ozone concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 8 g m3 and a duplicate was prepared for the samples of the two highest ozone concentrations with additional 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 this time apart from measuring the concentration of the chlorinated hydrocarbons fluorescence and uv absorbance was measured in a third experiment the aerated water was spiked with 97 μg l clofibric acid and ozonated in the same way as carried out in the second experiment of vc clofibric acid concentration was determined in hplc ms ms 2 4 2 treatment with o3 and o3 h2o2 in the field different ozone doses were tested by adjusting the setting on the ozone generator and thereby getting different ozone concentrations in the gas stream supplied to the ozonation column total gas flow in the bubble contactor remained unchanged regardless of the dosage the exact ozone input into the system was measured by an ozone analyser bmt 964 bmt messtechnik gmbh berlin germany connected at the outlet of the ozone generator the concentrations used were 0 2 7 10 and 27 g o3 nm3 air corresponding to ozone doses of 0 0 3 1 0 1 6 and 4 2 g o3 m3 water treated respectively assuming all ozone was transferred to the water the two highest ozone doses were also tested with an additional 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 at the inlet to the first column at the application of each ozone dose the system was allowed to reach equilibrium estimated as 4 hydraulic retention times hrts before the samples were collected from the outlet of the second and fourth column the fluorescence of the samples was measured on the spot in order to confirm that the system was well functioning further explained in sections 2 4 4 and 3 4 moreover unreacted ozone in the columns was measured by the indigo method presented in section 2 2 2 and 20 ml vials were filled completely to avoid headspace and then taken to the laboratory for gc ms and uv absorbance analysis samples for chlorethenes analysis were added to thiosulfate prior to filling the vial in order to quench residual ozone 2 4 3 decomposition of ozone ozone lifetime was measured in aerated water for the ozone only or ozone combined with h2o2 treatments water was divided into subsamples of 50 ml each which were then placed in a cooling bath at 8 c ozone stock solution was added to achieve direct oxidation with 2 4 4 8 and 6 3 g o3 m3 and advanced oxidation with 2 4 and 6 3 g o3 m3 together with 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 ozone concentration in the subsamples was measured over time via the method described in section 2 2 2 while their initial ozone concentration was measured by the same method as in the blank solutions 2 4 4 fluorescence and uv absorbance calibration curves the procedure for ozone transfer was the same as in 2 5 3 meaning that the water was divided into subsamples which were first cooled at 8 c and then spiked with various ozone dosages ranging from 0 to 5 3 g m3 the day after fluorescence and uv absorbance were measured the experiment was conducted three times over the period of the project to verify its reproducibility 2 5 data treatment the efficiency of ozone in terms of removing chlorinated compounds and clofibric acid was calculated based on a 90 removal rate the exponential eq 1 gives the remaining concentration of a pollutant c in relation to its initial concentration c0 for a particular ozone dose do3 the constant ddo3 represents the ozone dose required for 90 removal of a pollutant 26 27 1 c c 0 10 do 3 ddo 3 in order to fit the ozone input into the specific water matrix of this case eq 2 is created which describes the ozone needed for 90 pollutant removal in relation to the dissolved organic carbon doc of the sample 2 z 90 ddo 3 doc the mass balance of ozone in the columns at the treatment facility could be calculated by eq 3 assuming that there was no ozone in the outlet gas in the top of the column 3 o 3 in o 3 reacted o 3 residual where o3in is the inlet ozone o3reacted is the ozone that reacted in the columns and o3residual is the remaining ozone 3 results and discussions at an industrial area in north zeeland denmark tce pollution was present due to previous activity the pollution had spread to groundwater and remediation had been installed to prevent any further spread as the main pollutant was tce tce and its degradation products were found in the groundwater the following concentrations of tce and its degradation products were measured in the water after sand filtration tce 1026 1172 μg l cis dce 119 127 μg l trans dce 20 25 μg l 1 1 dce 4 1 4 4 μg l and 1 1 dca 14 15 μg l vc and ca were below loq furthermore some physical chemical parameters of the water were measured and the results were as follows doc 1 3 mg l ph 7 4 dissolved oxygen 8 8 mg l alkalinity 5 8 meq l uv absorbance at 254 nm 0 104 cm 1 iron 0 01 mg l and manganese 0 002 mg l 3 1 chlorinated ethenes in laboratory treatment in this part of the study water from the study site spiked with vc two experiments and clofibric acid one experiment was treated with ozonation and o3 h2o2 under controlled conditions in the laboratory results from the second experiment with the spiked vc are presented in fig 3 while results from the other two experiments are in the supporting information si for all compounds investigated decreasing concentrations were measured in line with increasing applied ozone doses as expected and seen in fig 3 vc and trans dce reacted most with ozone and they were completely removed with less than 1 g o3 m3 cis dce and 1 1 dce followed in terms of reactivity tce as it is more resistant had to be treated with a higher ozone dose in order to see a significant reduction the order of compound degradability was as expected based on the reaction rate constants given in von sonntag and von gunten 10 as known 1 1 dca is rather inactive because of the single bond of the ethane structure a percentage of 84 was still present after treatment with 5 8 g o3 m3 for the two highest concentrations of ozone namely 3 6 and 5 8 g o3 m3 which were combined with h2o2 no traces of vc trans dce cis dce or 1 1 dce were detected the black borderline symbols for tce and 1 1 dca in fig 3a illustrate that the presence of h2o2 had no impact on the removal of the compounds as both compounds react very slow with ozone 28 the removal pathway was most likely due to a reaction with hydroxyl radicals originating from ozone decomposition and therefore no difference was found when adding hydrogen peroxide similar results have been seen when comparing ozone and ozone hydrogen peroxide treatment of pharmaceuticals in biologically treated wastewater 27 eq 1 was fitted to all the data and z90 was calculated using eq 2 estimated z90 values from the ozonation experiments are presented in table 2 the data from the three experiments were fairly similar among the three experiments the average z90 of vc and trans dce were 0 18 mg o3 mg doc the z90 for tce was 2 8 mg o3 mg doc as expected the relationship between the z90 values and the reaction rate constants table 1 was reverse proportional a low z90 indicates that the compound reacted quickly with ozone which in turn means a high rate constant our laboratory method of applying precise ozone amounts to water samples by using a water solution have not been used on water with such a low doc as the groundwater from this site to verify the method employed to determine reactivity we spiked clofibric acid into water during one experiment in order to compare with our previous study 27 where we determined the z90 of clofibric acid at 1 5 0 3 mg o3 mg doc in biologically treated wastewater conducting an experiment with a substance of known z90 would verify the reliability of the remaining z90 values however since the water matrix here was clearer and with much lower toc than biologically treated wastewater the z90 of clofibric acid was eventually 2 3 mg o3 mg doc the reaction rate of clofibric acid with ozone is 20 m 1 s 1 29 which fits well with the z90 value for clofibric acid which was closer to tce than 1 1 dce 3 2 application of ozone and o3 h2o2 treatment in the field in the field experiments ozone doses of 0 0 3 1 0 1 6 and 4 2 g o3 m3 water treated were applied and advanced oxidation was also implemented for the two highest ozone inputs with additional h2o2 at the inlet of the first column each setting was repeated two or three times fig 4 displays the relative concentrations of the chlorinated hydrocarbons in relation to their initial concentrations for each condition in the middle after column 2 and at the end after column 4 of the ozonation setup the concentration of vc in the aerated groundwater was below the gc ms detection limit and consequently its treatment could not be examined further however since vc has a very low z90 according to the experiments in section 3 1 it was expected that it would be entirely destroyed in the ozonation columns pce and ca were also not detected in the aerated groundwater as anticipated the greatest removal was achieved by the highest ozone dose 4 2 g o3 m3 at 78 removal of tce other researchers have found similar removal success during the ozonation of tce contaminated ground water in a bench scale laboratory setup ikehata et al 30 reduced tce concentration to below loq and thus found more than 80 removal with an ozone dose of 5 g m3 while tammaro et al 31 obtained up to an 86 reduction with 8 4 g m3 in a laboratory scale semi batch setup in a recent pilot scale study tkachenko et al 32 removed 94 of tce using an ozone dose of approximately 19 g m3 at an ozone dose of 1 6 g o3 m3 trans dce and 1 1 dce were removed to below loq while 90 of cis dce and around 50 of tce were removed as well this might be a better solution from a cost effective perspective because when ozonation can achieve the complete removal of vc and the dce isomers alongside the partial removal of tce the lifetime of gac is anticipated to increase which will subsequently decrease the cost of gac replacement the advanced oxidation had an overall efficiency quite similar to the ozonation for cis dce and tce fig 4 both compounds have a rate constant with ozone 14 540 m 1 s 1 that is significantly lower than with hydroxyl radicals 4 0 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 28 33 thus in the experiment without the addition of hydrogen peroxide the removal likely involve hydroxyl radicals originating from ozone decomposition and therefore no difference in efficiency was found when adding hydrogen peroxide when adding hydrogen peroxide together with ozone more hydroxyl radicals were formed and so one would expect the higher removal of ozone recalcitrant compounds however both nom and carbonate act as scavengers and reduce the efficiency of advanced oxidation glaze and kang 12 and karimi et al 7 both found in their studies a negative effect of high alkalinity on the o3 h2o2 treatment of tce and pce neither of the two methods was successful at reducing 1 1 dca and only 10 24 was removed at the outlet of the last column in the experiments with 1 6 g o3 m3 and 4 2 g o3 m3 the results also revealed that the reaction between ozone and the chlorinated substances mainly occurred in the first two columns compound concentration did not change considerably from the middle until the end of the process the concentration of ozone at the end of the system was measured and it was always less than 1 g m3 moreover no h2o2 was detected at the outlet of the ozone system 3 3 decomposition of ozone during ozone and o3 h2o2 treatment the decomposition of ozone only and ozone in the presence of h2o2 in aerated groundwater was investigated ozonation at dosages of 2 4 4 8 and 6 3 g o3 m3 resulted in respective half lives t½ of 17 18 20 and 29 min fig 5 a the ozone consumption rate is highly dependent on the amount and quality of the organic matter and ph in this case since the doc was relatively low at 1 3 mg l and ph was 7 4 ozone reduction was a slow process these results have to be taken into consideration for ozone treatment in the field high amounts of unreacted ozone at the end of ozonation could indicate a waste of ozone and pose a risk for reactions downstream such as toxicity to the possible biological filtration that may occur in the gac filter the addition of 0 1 g h2o2 g o3 accelerated ozone reduction as seen in fig 5b the lifetime of ozone was reduced to less than 6 min for all tested concentrations these results are compatible with the theory that h2o2 and ozone form hydroxyl radicals which react quickly and unselectively when advanced oxidation was applied in the pilot plant no ozone was expected to be found at the ozonation outlet as the retention time was estimated at approximately 15 min however ozone concentrations at 0 2 0 3 g m3 were measured in the outlet of the ozone setup in experiments when hydrogen peroxide was added 3 4 fluorescence for ozone dosage measurement scanning of the aerated groundwater in the fluorescence spectrometer showed a peak at excitation wavelength 230 nm and an emission wavelength 425 nm fig s1 in si based on the literature the acquired fluorescence peak was a humic like a peak which is found in natural waters 34 35 to investigate the relation between fluorescence and ozone dosage groundwater was treated with different ozone doses following which fluorescence and uv absorbance were measured the experiment was performed three times with water collected on different days relative fluorescence in relation to the initial fluorescence plotted against the ozone concentrations of each experiment as well as all experiments is illustrated in fig 6 a b fig 6c d are the respective plots for uv absorbance low ozone doses 1 g m3 removed a significant part of the fluorescence while at higher ozone doses the removal of fluorescence per gram ozone added was much less thus a two phase exponential decay model was fitted to the measurements in graphpad prism with high correlation r2 0 99 neither fluorescence from excitation at 230 nm and emission at 425 nm nor uv absorbance necessarily originated from one substance in fact in this water it would have to have originated from multiple compounds with different reactivity to ozone otherwise there would have been a first order exponential decay relation similar to the removal of the chlorinated ethenes data from all three experiments were collected and fitted as well fig 6b d by comparing the figures the two methods fluorescence and uv absorbance are compatible to a great degree since the curves have a similar shape and both plateau at similar ozone concentrations it seems that most of the fluorescent natural organic substances were removed with 4 5 g o3 m3 the difference in the intensity of absorbance signals must be attributed to the presence of non fluorescent compounds similar differences in fluorescence and uv absorbance during ozonation have been found during the ozonation of wastewater effluents 36 the correlation between the remaining pollutant and both fluorescence and uv absorbance for water treated with different ozone doses was investigated fig 7 the chlorinated ethenes and the organic compounds humic acids responsible for fluorescence required different amounts of ozone to be removed which is notable due to the fact that they do not follow a linear correlation given by the dotted line in fig 7a b the starting point of all the lines is 1 1 where the water was untreated when reaching the 0 0 point ozone dosage increased thus reacting more with the fluorescent humic like substances and pollutants as can be seen the lines of vc and trans dce become very sharply horizontal on the x axis when the chlorinated hydrocarbons were removed it was only the humic like compounds that continued to decrease for higher ozone inputs for cis dce 1 1 dce and tce the lines reach y 0 in a smoother way however the line for 1 1 dca is less sharp because the increasing amounts of ozone did not have a great influence on the persistent 1 1 dca removing fluorescence during ozonation has previously been investigated during the treatment of water in recirculating aquaculture 17 and wastewater treatment 36 38 both spiliotopoulou et al 37 and park et al 36 investigated the correlation of fluorescence with pharmaceutical removal during the ozonation of biologically treated municipal wastewater and found that compounds that react quickly with ozone were removed faster than fluorescence while recalcitrant compounds were removed slower thus their findings were similar to ours in spite of the very different matrix the plots for uv absorbance fig 7c d follow a very similar trend to fig 7a b nevertheless the angle of the lines is more acute which happens because the water also contains compounds that absorb and do not fluoresce such as inorganic matter 3 5 mass balances of ozone in the field scale treatment as described in section 3 2 the field experiment included ozonation with doses at 0 0 3 1 0 1 6 and 4 2 g o3 m3 as well as coupling of the two highest ozone doses with h2o2 the inlet reacted and residual ozone was measured in order to calculate the mass balance presented in eq 3 the fluorescence spectrophotometer was carried to the field to estimate the reacted ozone samples were collected from either column 2 or 4 and their fluorescence was measured fluorescence values were interpolated using the curve day 3 in fig 6a providing the corresponding ozone consumption residual ozone was measured by the indigo method the inlet ozone was determined by measuring ozone gas with an ozone analyser for ozone treatment at 0 3 1 0 and 1 6 g o3 m3 the ozone analyser fluctuated and so a mean value was used for calculations however the concentration measurement was stable for ozone input at 4 2 g o3 m3 the results after column 2 are given in fig 8 while the remaining results can be found in table s2 in si in general it was found that the transfer of ozone was high and successful in order to achieve high ozone transfer it is important to have tiny bubbles as they have high internal pressure and rapid mass transfer rates 39 by visual inspection of the first column in the full scale system the bubble size was estimated to be a mixture of micro and macro bubbles for the treatment at 0 3 1 0 and 1 6 g o3 m3 the interpolated concentrations of reacted ozone were below 1 1 g m3 values that belong to the first part of the curve therefore the mass balances were more accurate and did not fluctuate greatly from 100 recovery fluctuation of the ozone analyser when applying these settings has to be taken into consideration for the noted deviations on the contrary treatments with 4 2 g o3 m3 were on the second part of the fluorescence curve thus underestimating the amount of ozone that reacted in the system 3 6 prediction of chlorinated ethene removal vs measured in order to gauge the precision of the laboratory experiments in predicting ozonation in a real life scenario as exemplified by the full scale system the removal of chlorinated ethenes was estimated and compared with the measured removal the removal of chlorinated ethenes was predicted using the delivered ozone dose ozone consumption as estimated in section 3 5 the z90 values given in section 3 1 the doc value and eqs 1 and 2 it was estimated for trans dce cis dce and tce fig 9 the estimated removals fitted well with the measured ones the measurement of fluorescence removal together with laboratory batch experiments can thus be a powerful tool in predicting the removal of pollutants in full scale systems 3 7 estimation of the gac filter s lifetime to evaluate the effect of adding ozone during treatment on the lifetime of the gac filter estimations of breakthrough curves for the different chlorinated ethenes and across a range of concentrations were performed the breakthrough curves were modelled using an analytical model developed by genuchten and alves 40 constants such as the dispersion coefficient and average pore velocity in the gac filter were found in a danish report 41 wherein they were estimated based on laboratory experiments and a full scale gac filter details on the model and the constants used herein are provided in si first the amount of carbon in the column was set to obtain a breakthrough concentration of vc at the outlet of the gac filter corresponding to water quality criteria after 1 year afterwards the lifetime was estimated for water after ozone treatment at different levels table 2 the concentrations of the chlorinated ethenes after ozone treatment were estimated based on eqs 1 and 2 and the z90 values given in section 3 1 a low amount of ozone 0 3 g m3 in this case would remove vc trans dce and 1 1 dce to below water quality criteria and the limiting compound would be cis dce resulting in a gac filter lifespan of 4 3 years at 1 5 g m3 of ozone only tce was above the water quality criteria with a lifespan of 7 2 years with an ozone dose of 8 g m3 tce would come in under the water quality criteria and the gac filter should last for a very long time thus the results indicate that there is a good synergy between treatment with low levels of ozone and subsequent gac filtration 4 conclusion the findings of this study are as follows more than 90 of vc and trans dce was removed at 0 18 mg o3 mg doc while the ozone doses required to remove 90 of cis dce 1 1 dce and tce were 0 86 0 87 and 2 8 mg o3 mg doc respectively in full scale experiments the removal of the chlorinated ethenes increased in line with an increase in ozone dose and both trans dce and 1 1 dce were completely removed at 1 6 g o3 m3 while only 90 of cis dce and 50 tce were removed with this ozone dose the addition of hydrogen peroxide reduced the ozone s lifetime while no change in the removal of chlorinated ethenes was observed furthermore hydrogen peroxide addition reduced residual ozone concentration at the highest ozone doses in the full scale system in the laboratory experiments a relationship between fluorescence originating from natural organic matter and the ozone dose was found and it was then used to determine the delivered ozone dose in the full scale system furthermore the estimated removal of chlorinated ethenes based on estimated delivered ozone dose fitted very well with what was actually removed in the full scale system thus the removal of fluorescence can be a powerful tool for evaluating performance the lifetime of a gac filter was estimated with different ozone treatments and in this regard optimal ozone treatment at 1 5 g m3 increased it from 1 year to 7 2 years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
