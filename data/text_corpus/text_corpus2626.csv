13130,amine modified black liquor bl and purified lignin pl derived biochar were successfully synthesized by facile one step hydrothermal carbonization htc with hexamethylenediamine hmda a variety of analytical techniques were used to characterize the physico chemical properties of biochar the effects of experimental parameters initial concentration of pollutant contact time solution ph and coexisting ions on the adsorption performance of biochar were systematically investigated the adsorption capacity of cr vi on biochar prepared by bl and pl was significantly different under the optimal hydrothermal temperature the maximum adsorption amount of bl 180 hydrothermal temperature 180 c was 741 74 mg g while that of pl 150 hydrothermal temperature 150 c was only 165 16 mg g as calculated by langmuir model at 45 c therefore the preparation of biochar by direct htc of bl showed more significant advantages and potential than pl in removing cr vi from wastewater further amine modification enhanced the adsorption performance of biochar especially for pl biochar the maximum adsorption amount of n bl 180 was increased to 859 43 mg g whereas that of n pl 150 was significantly increased to 583 77 mg g moreover the modified biochar exhibited excellent reusability the removal mechanism of cr vi was attributed to electrostatic interaction complexation as well as redox reaction this work provides a successful attempt of amine modified bl biochar under mild condition which provided a novel idea for the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords black liquor biochar amine modification hydrothermal carbonization cr vi removal 1 introduction the pollution of water resources caused by toxic metal ions has become a worldwide environmental problem chromium cr as a redox active metal element is widely applied to steel manufacturing 1 leather tanning 2 textile dyeing 3 electroplating 4 and other chemical industries wanton discharge of large amounts of cr containing wastewater has become a global environmental problem of increasing concern there are mainly two kinds of oxidation forms of cr in solution cr vi and cr iii cr vi has been recognized as one of the most hazardous pollutants because of its high toxicity 5 carcinogenicity 6 and mutagenicity 7 when cr vi is ingested by the human body it will not only cause diseases such as vomiting nausea and severe diarrhea 2 but also cause serious damage to human organs 8 hence the treatment of cr vi containing industrial effluent has aroused widespread public concern different technologies have been explored for cr vi removal such as chemical precipitation 9 ion exchange 10 biological treatment 11 membrane separation 12 photocatalysis 13 and adsorption 14 nevertheless each of these technologies possesses its own inherent defaults for instance biological treatment is time consuming and affected by the environment as for chemical precipitation the precipitated sludge may cause secondary pollution 11 compared with other methods the virtues of adsorption contain simple operation low energy consumption renewability and great treatment effect 15 16 biochar is an excellent adsorbent commonly utilized to remove cr vi from effluents usually it is a carbon rich adsorbent prepared by biomass pyrolysis in a relatively high temperature and oxygen limited environment 17 in recent years hydrothermal carbonization htc has been regarded as an effective method for the preparation of high performance biochar compared with traditional high temperature pyrolysis the reaction conditions of htc are relatively mild 300 c and the prepared biochar retains the nitrogen and oxygen elements of the raw material 18 19 hydrothermal biochar can be derived from a variety of raw materials such as cotton stalk 1 peanut shell 7 reed 2 grapefruit peel 20 etc which endows biochar with low cost low energy consumption and environment friendly characteristics in addition the nitrogen containing biochar can be prepared by nitrogen containing precursors doping or post treatment the introduction of nitrogen containing functional groups can enhance the complexation and electrostatic interaction between biochar and heavy metals anions thus improving the adsorption capacity of biochar 21 23 for example wei et al prepared nitrogen doped biochar microspheres using waste peanut shell as raw material in deionized water and dimethyl formamide solution 24 the prepared biochar showed improved cr vi performance with the maximum adsorption amount of 181 82 mg g wang et al reported a hydrothermal method to synthesize amino functionalized carbon microspheres from glucose 25 the introduction of amino groups improved the adsorption amount of cr vi 243 60 mg g therefore the introduction of amine groups plays an important role in improving the adsorption performance of biochar black liquor bl is the waste liquid produced in the pulp and paper making process 26 bl is not only rich in lignin but also contains part of hemicellulose recoverable alkali and inorganic salts 27 29 at present the bl is usually directly burned or discharged resulting in the waste of biomass resources and environmental pollution if bl can be directly converted to biochar by hydrothermal method it can not only eliminate the expense of evaporation or concentration of bl but also can alleviate the problem of bl wanton emission however to date there are few reports about the preparation of biochar from direct htc of bl al kaabi et al carried out the biochar production from bl by using standard htc and oxidation 30 the produced biochar possessed high content of energy which can be used as a solid fuel directly or after processing in our previous work 29 we investigated the direct htc of bl to produce phenolics and biochar the potential of bl biochar for cr vi adsorption was preliminarily investigated the adsorption amount of bl biochar for cr vi was 246 4 mg g after 4 h adsorption however the influence factors and adsorption mechanism were not addressed in addition the modified biochar derived from bl to further improve its adsorption performance of cr vi has not been explored and reported herein a facile one step htc was proposed to prepare modified biochar from bl the biochar prepared from pl was investigated as a contrast the physico chemical properties of biochar were determined by elemental analyzer n2 physisorption scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps in addition the effects of hydrothermal temperature cr vi solution ph concentration of pollutant adsorption time and coexisting ions on the adsorption of cr vi were studied by batch adsorption experiments to explore the superiority of bl derived biochar and the feasibility of amine modification finally the adsorption kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics were studied and the mechanism of adsorption was explored and proposed materials and methods 2 1 materials black liquor bl was kindly provided by a paper mill in shandong province china the purified lignin pl was obtained from bl by sulfuric acid method and the product was finally obtained by washing drying and passing through a 100 mesh sieve all reagents were analytical k2cr2o7 hexamethylenediamine hmda and sym diphenylcarbazide were purchased from macklin reagent co ltd shanghai china other chemicals including ethanol hcl naoh h2so4 h3po4 were purchased from kelong chemical co ltd chengdu china 2 2 preparation of biochar in a typical preparation scheme 1 5 g bl or pl was dispersed in 95 ml deionized water under the condition of constant stirring the mixed solution was adjusted to ph 7 with hcl and then poured into the high pressure reaction kettle the air in the kettle was replaced by n2 for 3 times under the condition of constant stirring the temperature was raised to the required temperature 150 180 200 and 220 c at 3 c min and kept for 0 5 h after natural cooling to ambient temperature the solid liquid mixture was extracted and separated the ethanol and deionized water were used to wash the biochar for three times bl x and pl x x was the reaction temperature were obtained after drying at 60 c for 24 h the hmda modified biochar was obtained by one step htc 5 g bl or pl and 5 g of hmda were dispersed in 90 ml distilled water the hydrothermal reaction was carried out according to the above experimental operation the amine modified biochar labeled as n bl x and n pl x was obtained 2 3 characterization the elemental analyzer elementar vario el iii was utilized to determine the content of c h o and n elements sem apreo fei hillsboro usa was performed to measure the morphology and micro structures of biochar the phase structure and composition were analyzed by xrd riaku utima iv at a scanning speed of 5 min the ft ir analysis was conducted by a nicolet 380 ft ir spectrometer the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of biochar were determined at 77 k by the micromeritics asap 2020 system density functional theory dft equation was used to calculate the pore distribution the sbet of biochar was calculated by brunauer emmett teller bet method the chemical state and surface composition of biochar were conducted by xps vg escalab 250 xi thermo electron 2 4 adsorption experiments all intermittent adsorption experiments were carried out in a constant temperature shaker the required cr vi solutions of different concentrations were obtained by dissolving different weight of k2cr2o7 in deionized water 0 05 g biochar was added to 50 ml cr vi solutions in all adsorption experiments 1 0 mol l hcl or naoh solution was applied to the adjustment of solution ph the adsorption experiments were performed at 35 c and 150 rpm under the condition of uniform shaking 1 ml of each sample was taken after centrifugation the supernatant was diluted for measurement in order to reduce the experimental error parallel adsorption experiments were carried out the average value of which was reported based on previous studies 31 32 the ph value of zero charge phpzc of biochar was determined the effect of initial ph 2 6 initial concentration 500 1300 mg g adsorption time 0 17 72 h and coexisting ions on the adsorption of cr vi was investigated the regeneration experiments were performed to study the reusability of the biochar the adsorbed biochar was treated with 0 1 m naoh aqueous solution at 35 c after a period of adsorption the concentration of cr vi was determined at 542 nm through a uv vis spectrophotometer the concentration of total chromium in solution was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 986f china the cr iii concentration was obtained by subtraction method the adsorption amount qe mg g and removal rate were obtained through the following equations 1 q e c 0 c e m v 2 removal rate c 0 c e c e 100 where c0 and ce mg l means the initial and final concentration of cr vi solution respectively v l means the solution volume and m g means the biochar weight results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical properties of biochar sem was performed to investigate the micromorphology and pore structure of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 as displayed in fig 1a d the micromorphology of biochar is significantly different among them bl 180 is an irregular cluster structure covered with massive globules on the surface in contrast pl 150 is a flat block structure with a few gullies on the surface under the action of hmda the clusters of pellets on the surface of bl 180 are fused resulting in the formation of n bl 180 with multiple spherical surfaces and interconnected pores similarly the flat block structure of pl 150 is destroyed to form a honeycomb structure with uniform pores the addition of hmda enhances the solution ph and promotes the decomposition of lignin during the htc 33 therefore the solid content of biochar decreases and pores are produced 34 in addition compared with n pl 150 the contact area between n bl 180 and cr vi is larger because of the multi spherical surface indicating the potential adsorption performance of n bl 180 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions are illustrated in fig 2 the bet surface area sbet micropore volume vmic external area volume vext total pore volume vtot and average pore size dp calculated by the isotherms are described in table 1 the isotherm of bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 is typical type iv isotherm with h3 type hysteresis loop fig 2a manifesting the presence of mesoporous structure in biochar 35 in contrast pl 150 shows type iii isotherm with desorption hysteresis 36 it indicates that the interaction between pl 150 and n2 is weak and the presence of various pores is inappreciable fig 2a which is consistent with the image in sem as shown in fig 2b the pore size curves of bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 have a broad distribution mesopores and macropores are the main pore structures and there are almost no micropores in n bl 180 and n pl 150 it is consistent with a sharp increase in the relative pressure near 1 0 in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms in addition the pore volume of n bl 180 and n pl 150 increases further especially for n pl 150 the pore size distribution curve changes from nearly smooth curve to multi peak distribution indicating that the modification effect of hmda on pl is significant as shown in table 1 the sbet of bl 180 and pl 150 is only 2 83 and 2 53 m2 g while vtot is only 0 0010 and 0 0010 cm3 g respectively for comparison the sbet 9 24 and 6 98 m2 g and vtot 0 0209 and 0 0213 cm3 g of n bl 180 and n pl 150 are significantly improved at the same time the dp increases from 1 68 nm of bl 180 and 1 71 nm of pl 150 to 8 41 nm and 12 23 nm respectively these results indicate that amine modification improves the structural properties of bl 180 and pl 150 the elemental compositions of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 are listed in table 1 compared with bl 180 and pl 150 the h content of n bl 180 and n pl 150 increases from 4 10 and 5 44 to 5 28 and 5 78 respectively while the content of n rises from 0 11 and 0 23 to 3 41 and 3 08 the results demonstrate that amounts of amino groups are successfully introduced onto the biochar through hmda modification the lattice structure changes of biochar were characterized by xrd as exhibited in fig 3 all biochar shows a diffraction peak at 2θ 22 0 which belongs to the typical diffraction peak in the 002 plane of graphite 37 it can be seen that all biochar has amorphous and disordered structure 38 after modification the area of the diffraction peak of n bl 180 and n pl 150 in the plane 002 decreases indicating that the addition of hmda reduces the crystallinity and graphitization degree of biochar in addition the degree of crystallinity and graphitization of bl 180 and n bl 180 are lower than that of pl 150 and n pl 150 the alkali in the black liquor might promote the formation of pores and defects 39 41 3 2 adsorption performance 3 2 1 effect of initial ph the initial ph value has an important influence on the surface charges of biochar as illustrated in fig 4a and b the phpzc value of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 is 6 86 7 48 4 37 and 6 93 respectively amine modification increases the phpzc values of both bl and pl biochar when the ph of the solution is below its phpzc the biochar surface is protonated that is positively charged otherwise the surface of the biochar is negatively charged the main form of cr vi is hcro4 at ph 2 with the increase of ph it will become cr2o7 2 and cro4 2 42 43 when the ph is 2 the adsorption capacity of bl 180 and n bl 180 is maximal 467 44 mg g and 489 85 mg g respectively when the ph increases from 2 to 3 the adsorption capacity sharply drops to 165 20 and 151 61 mg g at ph range of 4 6 the adsorption capacity reaches a relatively stable stage around 59 31 mg g and 41 67 mg g respectively the increase of ph has more obvious influence on n bl 180 the similar phenomenon is observed for pl 150 and n pl 150 under acidic conditions the nitrogen containing functional groups on the surfaces of n bl 180 and n pl 150 are easily protonated which makes the surfaces of n bl 180 and n pl 150 positively charged 24 the cr vi anions are readily adsorbed on the surface of positively charged biochar through electrostatic interaction however with increasing ph the concentration of oh in the solution increases the amino groups on the surface of biochar change from protonated state to deprotonated state which results in a gradual decrease in electrostatic attraction therefore the adsorption capacity of biochar for cr vi decreases significantly 44 therefore the optimal ph of initial solution for all the adsorption experiments is selected as 2 in addition most of the δph of pl 150 is negative fig 4b indicating that there are few positive charges on the surface of pl 150 which may be the main reason for the poor adsorption performance of pl 150 3 2 2 effect of adsorption time and cr vi concentration the contact time of cr vi with biochar and initial cr vi concentration are also important factors affecting the adsorption capacity as displayed in fig 5a the initial concentration poses a considerable impact on the adsorption performance of bl 180 as the initial concentration increases from 500 to 1300 mg l the residual cr vi concentration grows from 0 55 to 740 55 mg l accordingly the removal rate decreases from 99 89 to 43 04 however the adsorption amount of cr vi on bl 180 grows from 499 45 to 559 45 mg g the results demonstrate that the higher initial concentration provides a larger mass transfer driving force it helps the adsorbate to surmount the resistance from the solution to the surface of bl 180 it is also not difficult to find that the residual cr vi concentration decreases rapidly in the first 12 h and then slowly decreases in 12 48 h then it reaches the equilibrium at about 72 h at first massive adsorption vacancies exist on the surface of bl 180 cr vi in the liquid phase is rapidly adsorbed on the surface of bl 180 as the adsorption progresses the active sites on bl 180 gradually decreases to saturation therefore the adsorption rate gradually slows down and then reaches equilibrium 45 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 all show the similar tendency however it is worth noting that n bl 180 and pl 150 are more affected by the initial concentration of solution in addition the effect of low concentration solution on the adsorption capacity of n bl 180 and n pl 150 is shown in fig s2 obviously both n bl 180 and n pl 150 show excellent cr vi removal ability at cr vi concentration of 10 mg l the removal rates achieve 100 for both n bl 180 and n pl 150 after 5 min adsorption the residual cr vi concentration is below 0 013 mg l which meets the highest criteria of china s national discharge standard 0 1 mg l gb 21900 2008 when the solution concentration increases from 10 mg l to 50 mg l the removal rates reach 100 after 10 min the results demonstrate that the surface of n bl 180 and n pl 150 have rich adsorption sites which reflects the rapid adsorption capacity of n bl 180 and n pl 150 for cr vi 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics to evaluate the possible rate control steps during the adsorption process the adsorption kinetics of cr vi on bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 were fitted by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models the kinetic equations are shown in equations 3 and 4 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 where qe and qt mg g denotes the adsorbed cr vi amount at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 min 1 and k2 mg g min are the rate constants of first order and second order kinetic models the fitting plots are displayed in figs s3 and s4 as shown in tables 2 and 3 the correlation coefficients r2 of pseudo first order kinetic model for bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 are all larger than those of pseudo first order kinetic model besides the theoretical qe from the pseudo second order kinetic model is much closer to the experimental qe exp for instance for n bl 180 at cr vi concentration of 1500 mg l the qe exp is 804 87 mg g the qe predicted from pseudo second order kinetic model is 781 25 mg g however that from first order is only 416 08 mg g hence the cr vi adsorption process on bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 is more consistent with the pseudo second order model signifying the chemical interaction between cr vi and biochar in terms of pl 150 the r2 of the pseudo second order is lower indicating that the cr vi adsorption on pl 150 is mainly physical adsorption this may be due to the fact that pl 150 has few functional groups on its surface and cr vi is adsorbed only by pores on pl 150 it reflects the necessity of modification of pl derived biochar 3 2 4 adsorption isotherm in order to evaluate the adsorption isotherms between biochar and cr vi the experimental data were fitted with langmuir eq 5 and freundlich eq 6 models 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where qe mg g defines as the adsorption amount at equilibrium ce mg l defines as the equilibrium concentration of cr vi qm mg g is the theoretical saturated adsorption capacity and kl l mg defines as the langmuir constant kf and 1 n denote the freundlich constants the adsorption isotherm curves and according parameters are depicted in fig 6 and table 4 in the experimental concentration range the higher r2 of the langmuir model signifies that it is more applicable for all biochar at three different temperatures indicating the monomolecular layer adsorption at 45 c the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 for cr vi is 741 74 859 43 165 16 and 583 77 mg g respectively except for pl 150 bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 all show excellent adsorption performance the adsorption capacity of bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 for cr vi is much higher than that of the reported hydrothermal biochar table 5 indicating great potential in future application in addition amine modification significantly improves the adsorption performance of both bl and pl biochar 3 2 5 thermodynamic analysis the adsorption process of cr vi by biochar was further investigated by calculating the relevant thermodynamic parameters the calculation equations of thermodynamic parameters including δg kj mol δh kj mol and δs j mol k at different temperatures are as follows 7 ln k d h rt s r 8 g h t s 9 k d c 0 c e c e v m where kd ml g defines as an equilibrium constant r means the gas constant 8 314 j mol k t k defines as the absolute temperature based on the linear relationship between lnkd and 1 t see fig 7 δh and δs are calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight line as shown in table 6 the δg of the four kinds of biochar are all negative indicating that the adsorption process of cr vi on biochar is spontaneous the absolute value of δg increases with increasing temperature indicating that the higher the temperature is the greater the driving force of the adsorption process is therefore the higher temperature is beneficial to the adsorption of cr vi on biochar the adsorption process is demonstrated to be the endothermic reaction by the positive value of δh it is consistent with the results that the adsorption amount grows with increasing temperature the δs value is also positive which demonstrates the affinity of biochar for cr vi as well as the randomness of solid solution interface 5 51 according to the results of the δh and δg cr vi adsorption on biochar is a spontaneous endothermic process 3 2 6 effect of coexisting ions considering the actual industrial wastewater the existence of coexisting ions may lead to competitive adsorption of cr vi 52 therefore common ions in water al3 ni2 cu2 so4 2 co3 2 cl 500 mg l were mixed with cr vi at the same concentration to investigate the adsorption of cr vi by biochar 0 05 g as illustrated in fig 8 the effect of coexisting ions on cr vi adsorption by all biochar presents almost the same trend for all the anions studied so4 2 shows the strongest inhibition after adsorption for 72 h the removal rate by bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 decreases from 99 93 99 98 68 87 and 94 35 to 86 38 87 12 53 45 and 81 48 respectively co3 2 and cl have little impact on cr vi removal the removal rate remains above 95 30 of the control solution on the one hand the valence state of the anion affects the inhibitory effect of coexisting ions the higher the charge density of anions is the stronger the competitiveness of the adsorption sites is cr vi mainly exists in the form of hcro4 anion in the solution at ph 2 as a result the stronger adsorption competition exists between so4 2 as a divalent anion and the hcro4 37 53 on the other hand compared to co3 2 with the same valence state the ionic radius of so4 2 is closer to that of hcro4 which leads to the more serious inhibition of so4 2 than co3 2 54 for all the cations studied only al3 exhibits some impact on cr vi removal the hydrolysis reaction of al3 in aqueous solution might result in an increase of solution ph which weakens the electrostatic attraction between biochar and anion cr vi 5 55 hence the removal rate drops overall although the presence of coexisting ions will hinder the adsorption of cr vi the removal rates still remain at a high level the prepared biochar has excellent adsorption potential and selectivity for cr vi especially for bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 3 2 7 regeneration and reusability of modified biochar the reusability evaluation is of great significance to the application potential and economic benefits of biochar as shown in fig 9 after four cycles the adsorption capacity of cr vi on n bl 180 and n pl 150 decreases to 71 03 and 70 37 of the original adsorption capacity respectively the results show that the modified biochar has good chemical stability and reusability the decrease of adsorption capacity during the cycle is attributed to the irreversible loss of active functional groups such as nh3 oh and cooh 3 3 mechanism of cr vi adsorption on n bl 180 and n pl 150 ft ir was used to investigate the surface functional groups of biochar as illustrated in fig 10 the ft ir spectra of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 samples are similar the peak at 3430 cm 1 originates from the oh stretching vibration 29 the peaks observed at 2933 2841 and 1460 cm 1 are attributed to ch stretching vibration in ch3 ch2 and o ch3 39 56 57 the aromatic structure in the biochar samples is confirmed by the vibration of the aromatic skeleton corresponding to the bands at 1415 1516 and 1615 cm 1 5 56 58 the peaks at 1325 and 1115 cm 1 in the spectra are typical syringyl s peaks and the peak at 1212 cm 1 is ascribed to phenolic hydroxyl groups and ethers the intensity of these peaks in bl 180 and n bl 180 are weaker than those in pl 150 and n pl 150 which may be due to the complex composition of bl except for lignin bl also contains polysaccharides decomposition products and inorganic salts from the pulping process 29 59 moreover all the characteristic absorption peaks in n bl 180 and n pl 150 are sharper than those in bl 180 and pl 150 it reveals that the introduction of hmda increases the content of functional groups in biochar 34 after cr vi adsorption some characteristic absorption peaks in biochar produce shift or even disappear and the peak intensity changes for example the ch vibration at 2933 and 2841 cm 1 almost disappear the aromatic skeleton vibration peak appears at 1415 cm 1 in bl 180 cr vi the ch stretching vibration peak of o ch3 at 1460 cm 1 of n bl 180 cr vi shifts to 1415 cm 1 and the peak strength increases the results indicate that the active groups on the surface of biochar may react with cr vi to form stable aromatic structures the peak at 1115 cm 1 is weakened while the peaks at 1325 and 1212 cm 1 even disappear after the cr vi adsorption some new bands at 518 804 and 945 cm 1 appear which can be applied to cr vi o cr iii oh and cr vi o respectively 60 62 moreover the intensity of these new characteristic peaks in n bl 180 and n pl 150 are much higher than those in bl 180 and pl 150 it can be found that cr vi ions adsorbed on the surface of biochar are partially reduced to cr iii moreover cr iii ions are also adsorbed on the surface of biochar xps was conducted to further explore the adsorption mechanism as shown in fig 11a cr 2p signal appears in the spectrum of n bl 180 cr vi each peak of cr 2p in fig 11b can be deconvoluted into two peaks the peak at 576 9 and 586 3 ev belongs to cr iii 2p1 2 and cr iii 2p3 2 5 whereas the peak at 578 9 and 587 2 ev is assigned to cr vi 2p1 2 and cr vi 2p3 2 respectively 63 64 the content of cr vi and cr iii on the surface of n bl 180 is 39 83 and 60 17 respectively the results show that most of the adsorbed cr vi ions are reduced to cr iii the less toxic cr iii and cr vi coexist on n bl 180 cr vi in order to further investigate the adsorption mechanism of cr iii on n bl 180 the distribution of total chromium cr vi and cr iii in the solution was determined the results are shown in fig s4 with the increase of contact time the concentration of cr vi in the solution gradually decreases until it is completely removed cr iii which is not present in the initial solution is gradually increased to 85 87 mg l the presence of cr iii indicates that the cr vi in the solution is reduced to cr iii with lower toxicity most of the cr iii are adsorbed on the n bl 180 surface through complexation and the rest of cr iii is released into the solution fig 11c describes the changes of c 1s chemical state of n bl 180 before and after cr vi adsorption the c 1s peak is divided into three major components including binding energy of 284 5 285 4 and 288 2 ev which is indexed to cc 28 67 co 64 05 and co 7 28 respectively 43 65 66 after adsorption the content of co decreases to 50 67 while the content of co increases to 20 11 it indicates that the c oh group can provide electrons for the reduction of cr vi to cr iii and itself is oxidized to co 67 in the o 1s xps spectrum after adsorption fig 11c a new characteristic peak cr2o7 2 occurs at 529 9 ev indicating that cr vi is attached on the surface of n bl 180 cr vi as an oxygen containing anion at the same time the content of nh 399 5 ev in the n 1s spectrum is significantly reduced after cr vi adsorption fig 11e a new peak ascribed to the protonated amino group nh appears at 401 5 ev 5 the above results indicate that oxygen and nitrogen containing groups play a vital role in cr vi removal amino groups and some oxygen containing groups such as oh and cooh are easy to be protonated in acidic solution ph 2 68 70 the formed nh3 oh2 and cooh2 can adsorb cr vi anions through electrostatic interaction similarly the same phenomenon appears in the xps spectra of n pl 150 and n pl 150 cr vi fig 12 therefore the interaction between n bl 180 and cr vi anions and cr iii can be described as follows 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 in addition the content of n h 5 00 in the n pl 150 n 1s spectrum after cr vi adsorption is much lower than that of n bl 180 19 33 which may be one of the main reasons why the adsorption performance of n bl 180 for cr vi is better than that of n pl 150 according to the above analysis and discussion the adsorption mechanism of cr vi on n bl 180 is proposed in scheme 2 firstly in acidic solution cr vi anions bind to the protonated n bl 180 surface through electrostatic interaction eqs 10 12 and form complexes with functional groups eq 13 subsequently the cr vi anions adsorbed on the n bl 180 surface are reduced to cr iii by co electron donor groups eqs 14 and 15 finally cr iii is bound to the surface of n bl 180 by complexation with the amino groups and carboxyl eqs 16 and 17 4 conclusion modified biochar derived from black liquor and lignin is synthesized by one step hydrothermal carbonization the nitrogen content of n bl 180 and n pl 150 is 3 41 and 3 08 respectively which indicates that the amino groups have been successfully grafted onto the surface of biochar the initial ph value of the solution is crucial to the adsorption of cr vi the maximum adsorption capacities of cr vi on bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 at 45 c and ph 2 are 741 74 859 43 165 16 and 583 77 mg g respectively the adsorption process of cr vi by bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 fits well with the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir isotherm model according to thermodynamic analysis the adsorption of cr vi on biochar is a spontaneous endothermic process the n bl 180 and n pl 150 have excellent selectivity for cr vi comparatively speaking the adsorption performance of bl derived biochar is better than that from pl hence the direct htc of bl shows significant advantages and great application prospects in cr vi removal from wastewater one step amine modification with hmda improves the adsorption amount of biochar for cr vi the introduction of amino groups not only enhances the complex interaction between biochar and cr vi ions but also improves the electrostatic interaction between them in addition modified biochar has good chemical stability and reusability the adsorption capacity remains above 70 1 after four cycles notably this method can be extended to other waste biomass which extends the range of amine modified biochar and has significant application prospect in cr vi containing effluent remediation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13130,amine modified black liquor bl and purified lignin pl derived biochar were successfully synthesized by facile one step hydrothermal carbonization htc with hexamethylenediamine hmda a variety of analytical techniques were used to characterize the physico chemical properties of biochar the effects of experimental parameters initial concentration of pollutant contact time solution ph and coexisting ions on the adsorption performance of biochar were systematically investigated the adsorption capacity of cr vi on biochar prepared by bl and pl was significantly different under the optimal hydrothermal temperature the maximum adsorption amount of bl 180 hydrothermal temperature 180 c was 741 74 mg g while that of pl 150 hydrothermal temperature 150 c was only 165 16 mg g as calculated by langmuir model at 45 c therefore the preparation of biochar by direct htc of bl showed more significant advantages and potential than pl in removing cr vi from wastewater further amine modification enhanced the adsorption performance of biochar especially for pl biochar the maximum adsorption amount of n bl 180 was increased to 859 43 mg g whereas that of n pl 150 was significantly increased to 583 77 mg g moreover the modified biochar exhibited excellent reusability the removal mechanism of cr vi was attributed to electrostatic interaction complexation as well as redox reaction this work provides a successful attempt of amine modified bl biochar under mild condition which provided a novel idea for the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords black liquor biochar amine modification hydrothermal carbonization cr vi removal 1 introduction the pollution of water resources caused by toxic metal ions has become a worldwide environmental problem chromium cr as a redox active metal element is widely applied to steel manufacturing 1 leather tanning 2 textile dyeing 3 electroplating 4 and other chemical industries wanton discharge of large amounts of cr containing wastewater has become a global environmental problem of increasing concern there are mainly two kinds of oxidation forms of cr in solution cr vi and cr iii cr vi has been recognized as one of the most hazardous pollutants because of its high toxicity 5 carcinogenicity 6 and mutagenicity 7 when cr vi is ingested by the human body it will not only cause diseases such as vomiting nausea and severe diarrhea 2 but also cause serious damage to human organs 8 hence the treatment of cr vi containing industrial effluent has aroused widespread public concern different technologies have been explored for cr vi removal such as chemical precipitation 9 ion exchange 10 biological treatment 11 membrane separation 12 photocatalysis 13 and adsorption 14 nevertheless each of these technologies possesses its own inherent defaults for instance biological treatment is time consuming and affected by the environment as for chemical precipitation the precipitated sludge may cause secondary pollution 11 compared with other methods the virtues of adsorption contain simple operation low energy consumption renewability and great treatment effect 15 16 biochar is an excellent adsorbent commonly utilized to remove cr vi from effluents usually it is a carbon rich adsorbent prepared by biomass pyrolysis in a relatively high temperature and oxygen limited environment 17 in recent years hydrothermal carbonization htc has been regarded as an effective method for the preparation of high performance biochar compared with traditional high temperature pyrolysis the reaction conditions of htc are relatively mild 300 c and the prepared biochar retains the nitrogen and oxygen elements of the raw material 18 19 hydrothermal biochar can be derived from a variety of raw materials such as cotton stalk 1 peanut shell 7 reed 2 grapefruit peel 20 etc which endows biochar with low cost low energy consumption and environment friendly characteristics in addition the nitrogen containing biochar can be prepared by nitrogen containing precursors doping or post treatment the introduction of nitrogen containing functional groups can enhance the complexation and electrostatic interaction between biochar and heavy metals anions thus improving the adsorption capacity of biochar 21 23 for example wei et al prepared nitrogen doped biochar microspheres using waste peanut shell as raw material in deionized water and dimethyl formamide solution 24 the prepared biochar showed improved cr vi performance with the maximum adsorption amount of 181 82 mg g wang et al reported a hydrothermal method to synthesize amino functionalized carbon microspheres from glucose 25 the introduction of amino groups improved the adsorption amount of cr vi 243 60 mg g therefore the introduction of amine groups plays an important role in improving the adsorption performance of biochar black liquor bl is the waste liquid produced in the pulp and paper making process 26 bl is not only rich in lignin but also contains part of hemicellulose recoverable alkali and inorganic salts 27 29 at present the bl is usually directly burned or discharged resulting in the waste of biomass resources and environmental pollution if bl can be directly converted to biochar by hydrothermal method it can not only eliminate the expense of evaporation or concentration of bl but also can alleviate the problem of bl wanton emission however to date there are few reports about the preparation of biochar from direct htc of bl al kaabi et al carried out the biochar production from bl by using standard htc and oxidation 30 the produced biochar possessed high content of energy which can be used as a solid fuel directly or after processing in our previous work 29 we investigated the direct htc of bl to produce phenolics and biochar the potential of bl biochar for cr vi adsorption was preliminarily investigated the adsorption amount of bl biochar for cr vi was 246 4 mg g after 4 h adsorption however the influence factors and adsorption mechanism were not addressed in addition the modified biochar derived from bl to further improve its adsorption performance of cr vi has not been explored and reported herein a facile one step htc was proposed to prepare modified biochar from bl the biochar prepared from pl was investigated as a contrast the physico chemical properties of biochar were determined by elemental analyzer n2 physisorption scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps in addition the effects of hydrothermal temperature cr vi solution ph concentration of pollutant adsorption time and coexisting ions on the adsorption of cr vi were studied by batch adsorption experiments to explore the superiority of bl derived biochar and the feasibility of amine modification finally the adsorption kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics were studied and the mechanism of adsorption was explored and proposed materials and methods 2 1 materials black liquor bl was kindly provided by a paper mill in shandong province china the purified lignin pl was obtained from bl by sulfuric acid method and the product was finally obtained by washing drying and passing through a 100 mesh sieve all reagents were analytical k2cr2o7 hexamethylenediamine hmda and sym diphenylcarbazide were purchased from macklin reagent co ltd shanghai china other chemicals including ethanol hcl naoh h2so4 h3po4 were purchased from kelong chemical co ltd chengdu china 2 2 preparation of biochar in a typical preparation scheme 1 5 g bl or pl was dispersed in 95 ml deionized water under the condition of constant stirring the mixed solution was adjusted to ph 7 with hcl and then poured into the high pressure reaction kettle the air in the kettle was replaced by n2 for 3 times under the condition of constant stirring the temperature was raised to the required temperature 150 180 200 and 220 c at 3 c min and kept for 0 5 h after natural cooling to ambient temperature the solid liquid mixture was extracted and separated the ethanol and deionized water were used to wash the biochar for three times bl x and pl x x was the reaction temperature were obtained after drying at 60 c for 24 h the hmda modified biochar was obtained by one step htc 5 g bl or pl and 5 g of hmda were dispersed in 90 ml distilled water the hydrothermal reaction was carried out according to the above experimental operation the amine modified biochar labeled as n bl x and n pl x was obtained 2 3 characterization the elemental analyzer elementar vario el iii was utilized to determine the content of c h o and n elements sem apreo fei hillsboro usa was performed to measure the morphology and micro structures of biochar the phase structure and composition were analyzed by xrd riaku utima iv at a scanning speed of 5 min the ft ir analysis was conducted by a nicolet 380 ft ir spectrometer the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of biochar were determined at 77 k by the micromeritics asap 2020 system density functional theory dft equation was used to calculate the pore distribution the sbet of biochar was calculated by brunauer emmett teller bet method the chemical state and surface composition of biochar were conducted by xps vg escalab 250 xi thermo electron 2 4 adsorption experiments all intermittent adsorption experiments were carried out in a constant temperature shaker the required cr vi solutions of different concentrations were obtained by dissolving different weight of k2cr2o7 in deionized water 0 05 g biochar was added to 50 ml cr vi solutions in all adsorption experiments 1 0 mol l hcl or naoh solution was applied to the adjustment of solution ph the adsorption experiments were performed at 35 c and 150 rpm under the condition of uniform shaking 1 ml of each sample was taken after centrifugation the supernatant was diluted for measurement in order to reduce the experimental error parallel adsorption experiments were carried out the average value of which was reported based on previous studies 31 32 the ph value of zero charge phpzc of biochar was determined the effect of initial ph 2 6 initial concentration 500 1300 mg g adsorption time 0 17 72 h and coexisting ions on the adsorption of cr vi was investigated the regeneration experiments were performed to study the reusability of the biochar the adsorbed biochar was treated with 0 1 m naoh aqueous solution at 35 c after a period of adsorption the concentration of cr vi was determined at 542 nm through a uv vis spectrophotometer the concentration of total chromium in solution was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 986f china the cr iii concentration was obtained by subtraction method the adsorption amount qe mg g and removal rate were obtained through the following equations 1 q e c 0 c e m v 2 removal rate c 0 c e c e 100 where c0 and ce mg l means the initial and final concentration of cr vi solution respectively v l means the solution volume and m g means the biochar weight results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical properties of biochar sem was performed to investigate the micromorphology and pore structure of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 as displayed in fig 1a d the micromorphology of biochar is significantly different among them bl 180 is an irregular cluster structure covered with massive globules on the surface in contrast pl 150 is a flat block structure with a few gullies on the surface under the action of hmda the clusters of pellets on the surface of bl 180 are fused resulting in the formation of n bl 180 with multiple spherical surfaces and interconnected pores similarly the flat block structure of pl 150 is destroyed to form a honeycomb structure with uniform pores the addition of hmda enhances the solution ph and promotes the decomposition of lignin during the htc 33 therefore the solid content of biochar decreases and pores are produced 34 in addition compared with n pl 150 the contact area between n bl 180 and cr vi is larger because of the multi spherical surface indicating the potential adsorption performance of n bl 180 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions are illustrated in fig 2 the bet surface area sbet micropore volume vmic external area volume vext total pore volume vtot and average pore size dp calculated by the isotherms are described in table 1 the isotherm of bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 is typical type iv isotherm with h3 type hysteresis loop fig 2a manifesting the presence of mesoporous structure in biochar 35 in contrast pl 150 shows type iii isotherm with desorption hysteresis 36 it indicates that the interaction between pl 150 and n2 is weak and the presence of various pores is inappreciable fig 2a which is consistent with the image in sem as shown in fig 2b the pore size curves of bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 have a broad distribution mesopores and macropores are the main pore structures and there are almost no micropores in n bl 180 and n pl 150 it is consistent with a sharp increase in the relative pressure near 1 0 in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms in addition the pore volume of n bl 180 and n pl 150 increases further especially for n pl 150 the pore size distribution curve changes from nearly smooth curve to multi peak distribution indicating that the modification effect of hmda on pl is significant as shown in table 1 the sbet of bl 180 and pl 150 is only 2 83 and 2 53 m2 g while vtot is only 0 0010 and 0 0010 cm3 g respectively for comparison the sbet 9 24 and 6 98 m2 g and vtot 0 0209 and 0 0213 cm3 g of n bl 180 and n pl 150 are significantly improved at the same time the dp increases from 1 68 nm of bl 180 and 1 71 nm of pl 150 to 8 41 nm and 12 23 nm respectively these results indicate that amine modification improves the structural properties of bl 180 and pl 150 the elemental compositions of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 are listed in table 1 compared with bl 180 and pl 150 the h content of n bl 180 and n pl 150 increases from 4 10 and 5 44 to 5 28 and 5 78 respectively while the content of n rises from 0 11 and 0 23 to 3 41 and 3 08 the results demonstrate that amounts of amino groups are successfully introduced onto the biochar through hmda modification the lattice structure changes of biochar were characterized by xrd as exhibited in fig 3 all biochar shows a diffraction peak at 2θ 22 0 which belongs to the typical diffraction peak in the 002 plane of graphite 37 it can be seen that all biochar has amorphous and disordered structure 38 after modification the area of the diffraction peak of n bl 180 and n pl 150 in the plane 002 decreases indicating that the addition of hmda reduces the crystallinity and graphitization degree of biochar in addition the degree of crystallinity and graphitization of bl 180 and n bl 180 are lower than that of pl 150 and n pl 150 the alkali in the black liquor might promote the formation of pores and defects 39 41 3 2 adsorption performance 3 2 1 effect of initial ph the initial ph value has an important influence on the surface charges of biochar as illustrated in fig 4a and b the phpzc value of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 is 6 86 7 48 4 37 and 6 93 respectively amine modification increases the phpzc values of both bl and pl biochar when the ph of the solution is below its phpzc the biochar surface is protonated that is positively charged otherwise the surface of the biochar is negatively charged the main form of cr vi is hcro4 at ph 2 with the increase of ph it will become cr2o7 2 and cro4 2 42 43 when the ph is 2 the adsorption capacity of bl 180 and n bl 180 is maximal 467 44 mg g and 489 85 mg g respectively when the ph increases from 2 to 3 the adsorption capacity sharply drops to 165 20 and 151 61 mg g at ph range of 4 6 the adsorption capacity reaches a relatively stable stage around 59 31 mg g and 41 67 mg g respectively the increase of ph has more obvious influence on n bl 180 the similar phenomenon is observed for pl 150 and n pl 150 under acidic conditions the nitrogen containing functional groups on the surfaces of n bl 180 and n pl 150 are easily protonated which makes the surfaces of n bl 180 and n pl 150 positively charged 24 the cr vi anions are readily adsorbed on the surface of positively charged biochar through electrostatic interaction however with increasing ph the concentration of oh in the solution increases the amino groups on the surface of biochar change from protonated state to deprotonated state which results in a gradual decrease in electrostatic attraction therefore the adsorption capacity of biochar for cr vi decreases significantly 44 therefore the optimal ph of initial solution for all the adsorption experiments is selected as 2 in addition most of the δph of pl 150 is negative fig 4b indicating that there are few positive charges on the surface of pl 150 which may be the main reason for the poor adsorption performance of pl 150 3 2 2 effect of adsorption time and cr vi concentration the contact time of cr vi with biochar and initial cr vi concentration are also important factors affecting the adsorption capacity as displayed in fig 5a the initial concentration poses a considerable impact on the adsorption performance of bl 180 as the initial concentration increases from 500 to 1300 mg l the residual cr vi concentration grows from 0 55 to 740 55 mg l accordingly the removal rate decreases from 99 89 to 43 04 however the adsorption amount of cr vi on bl 180 grows from 499 45 to 559 45 mg g the results demonstrate that the higher initial concentration provides a larger mass transfer driving force it helps the adsorbate to surmount the resistance from the solution to the surface of bl 180 it is also not difficult to find that the residual cr vi concentration decreases rapidly in the first 12 h and then slowly decreases in 12 48 h then it reaches the equilibrium at about 72 h at first massive adsorption vacancies exist on the surface of bl 180 cr vi in the liquid phase is rapidly adsorbed on the surface of bl 180 as the adsorption progresses the active sites on bl 180 gradually decreases to saturation therefore the adsorption rate gradually slows down and then reaches equilibrium 45 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 all show the similar tendency however it is worth noting that n bl 180 and pl 150 are more affected by the initial concentration of solution in addition the effect of low concentration solution on the adsorption capacity of n bl 180 and n pl 150 is shown in fig s2 obviously both n bl 180 and n pl 150 show excellent cr vi removal ability at cr vi concentration of 10 mg l the removal rates achieve 100 for both n bl 180 and n pl 150 after 5 min adsorption the residual cr vi concentration is below 0 013 mg l which meets the highest criteria of china s national discharge standard 0 1 mg l gb 21900 2008 when the solution concentration increases from 10 mg l to 50 mg l the removal rates reach 100 after 10 min the results demonstrate that the surface of n bl 180 and n pl 150 have rich adsorption sites which reflects the rapid adsorption capacity of n bl 180 and n pl 150 for cr vi 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics to evaluate the possible rate control steps during the adsorption process the adsorption kinetics of cr vi on bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 were fitted by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models the kinetic equations are shown in equations 3 and 4 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 where qe and qt mg g denotes the adsorbed cr vi amount at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 min 1 and k2 mg g min are the rate constants of first order and second order kinetic models the fitting plots are displayed in figs s3 and s4 as shown in tables 2 and 3 the correlation coefficients r2 of pseudo first order kinetic model for bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 are all larger than those of pseudo first order kinetic model besides the theoretical qe from the pseudo second order kinetic model is much closer to the experimental qe exp for instance for n bl 180 at cr vi concentration of 1500 mg l the qe exp is 804 87 mg g the qe predicted from pseudo second order kinetic model is 781 25 mg g however that from first order is only 416 08 mg g hence the cr vi adsorption process on bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 is more consistent with the pseudo second order model signifying the chemical interaction between cr vi and biochar in terms of pl 150 the r2 of the pseudo second order is lower indicating that the cr vi adsorption on pl 150 is mainly physical adsorption this may be due to the fact that pl 150 has few functional groups on its surface and cr vi is adsorbed only by pores on pl 150 it reflects the necessity of modification of pl derived biochar 3 2 4 adsorption isotherm in order to evaluate the adsorption isotherms between biochar and cr vi the experimental data were fitted with langmuir eq 5 and freundlich eq 6 models 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where qe mg g defines as the adsorption amount at equilibrium ce mg l defines as the equilibrium concentration of cr vi qm mg g is the theoretical saturated adsorption capacity and kl l mg defines as the langmuir constant kf and 1 n denote the freundlich constants the adsorption isotherm curves and according parameters are depicted in fig 6 and table 4 in the experimental concentration range the higher r2 of the langmuir model signifies that it is more applicable for all biochar at three different temperatures indicating the monomolecular layer adsorption at 45 c the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 for cr vi is 741 74 859 43 165 16 and 583 77 mg g respectively except for pl 150 bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 all show excellent adsorption performance the adsorption capacity of bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 for cr vi is much higher than that of the reported hydrothermal biochar table 5 indicating great potential in future application in addition amine modification significantly improves the adsorption performance of both bl and pl biochar 3 2 5 thermodynamic analysis the adsorption process of cr vi by biochar was further investigated by calculating the relevant thermodynamic parameters the calculation equations of thermodynamic parameters including δg kj mol δh kj mol and δs j mol k at different temperatures are as follows 7 ln k d h rt s r 8 g h t s 9 k d c 0 c e c e v m where kd ml g defines as an equilibrium constant r means the gas constant 8 314 j mol k t k defines as the absolute temperature based on the linear relationship between lnkd and 1 t see fig 7 δh and δs are calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight line as shown in table 6 the δg of the four kinds of biochar are all negative indicating that the adsorption process of cr vi on biochar is spontaneous the absolute value of δg increases with increasing temperature indicating that the higher the temperature is the greater the driving force of the adsorption process is therefore the higher temperature is beneficial to the adsorption of cr vi on biochar the adsorption process is demonstrated to be the endothermic reaction by the positive value of δh it is consistent with the results that the adsorption amount grows with increasing temperature the δs value is also positive which demonstrates the affinity of biochar for cr vi as well as the randomness of solid solution interface 5 51 according to the results of the δh and δg cr vi adsorption on biochar is a spontaneous endothermic process 3 2 6 effect of coexisting ions considering the actual industrial wastewater the existence of coexisting ions may lead to competitive adsorption of cr vi 52 therefore common ions in water al3 ni2 cu2 so4 2 co3 2 cl 500 mg l were mixed with cr vi at the same concentration to investigate the adsorption of cr vi by biochar 0 05 g as illustrated in fig 8 the effect of coexisting ions on cr vi adsorption by all biochar presents almost the same trend for all the anions studied so4 2 shows the strongest inhibition after adsorption for 72 h the removal rate by bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 decreases from 99 93 99 98 68 87 and 94 35 to 86 38 87 12 53 45 and 81 48 respectively co3 2 and cl have little impact on cr vi removal the removal rate remains above 95 30 of the control solution on the one hand the valence state of the anion affects the inhibitory effect of coexisting ions the higher the charge density of anions is the stronger the competitiveness of the adsorption sites is cr vi mainly exists in the form of hcro4 anion in the solution at ph 2 as a result the stronger adsorption competition exists between so4 2 as a divalent anion and the hcro4 37 53 on the other hand compared to co3 2 with the same valence state the ionic radius of so4 2 is closer to that of hcro4 which leads to the more serious inhibition of so4 2 than co3 2 54 for all the cations studied only al3 exhibits some impact on cr vi removal the hydrolysis reaction of al3 in aqueous solution might result in an increase of solution ph which weakens the electrostatic attraction between biochar and anion cr vi 5 55 hence the removal rate drops overall although the presence of coexisting ions will hinder the adsorption of cr vi the removal rates still remain at a high level the prepared biochar has excellent adsorption potential and selectivity for cr vi especially for bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 3 2 7 regeneration and reusability of modified biochar the reusability evaluation is of great significance to the application potential and economic benefits of biochar as shown in fig 9 after four cycles the adsorption capacity of cr vi on n bl 180 and n pl 150 decreases to 71 03 and 70 37 of the original adsorption capacity respectively the results show that the modified biochar has good chemical stability and reusability the decrease of adsorption capacity during the cycle is attributed to the irreversible loss of active functional groups such as nh3 oh and cooh 3 3 mechanism of cr vi adsorption on n bl 180 and n pl 150 ft ir was used to investigate the surface functional groups of biochar as illustrated in fig 10 the ft ir spectra of bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 samples are similar the peak at 3430 cm 1 originates from the oh stretching vibration 29 the peaks observed at 2933 2841 and 1460 cm 1 are attributed to ch stretching vibration in ch3 ch2 and o ch3 39 56 57 the aromatic structure in the biochar samples is confirmed by the vibration of the aromatic skeleton corresponding to the bands at 1415 1516 and 1615 cm 1 5 56 58 the peaks at 1325 and 1115 cm 1 in the spectra are typical syringyl s peaks and the peak at 1212 cm 1 is ascribed to phenolic hydroxyl groups and ethers the intensity of these peaks in bl 180 and n bl 180 are weaker than those in pl 150 and n pl 150 which may be due to the complex composition of bl except for lignin bl also contains polysaccharides decomposition products and inorganic salts from the pulping process 29 59 moreover all the characteristic absorption peaks in n bl 180 and n pl 150 are sharper than those in bl 180 and pl 150 it reveals that the introduction of hmda increases the content of functional groups in biochar 34 after cr vi adsorption some characteristic absorption peaks in biochar produce shift or even disappear and the peak intensity changes for example the ch vibration at 2933 and 2841 cm 1 almost disappear the aromatic skeleton vibration peak appears at 1415 cm 1 in bl 180 cr vi the ch stretching vibration peak of o ch3 at 1460 cm 1 of n bl 180 cr vi shifts to 1415 cm 1 and the peak strength increases the results indicate that the active groups on the surface of biochar may react with cr vi to form stable aromatic structures the peak at 1115 cm 1 is weakened while the peaks at 1325 and 1212 cm 1 even disappear after the cr vi adsorption some new bands at 518 804 and 945 cm 1 appear which can be applied to cr vi o cr iii oh and cr vi o respectively 60 62 moreover the intensity of these new characteristic peaks in n bl 180 and n pl 150 are much higher than those in bl 180 and pl 150 it can be found that cr vi ions adsorbed on the surface of biochar are partially reduced to cr iii moreover cr iii ions are also adsorbed on the surface of biochar xps was conducted to further explore the adsorption mechanism as shown in fig 11a cr 2p signal appears in the spectrum of n bl 180 cr vi each peak of cr 2p in fig 11b can be deconvoluted into two peaks the peak at 576 9 and 586 3 ev belongs to cr iii 2p1 2 and cr iii 2p3 2 5 whereas the peak at 578 9 and 587 2 ev is assigned to cr vi 2p1 2 and cr vi 2p3 2 respectively 63 64 the content of cr vi and cr iii on the surface of n bl 180 is 39 83 and 60 17 respectively the results show that most of the adsorbed cr vi ions are reduced to cr iii the less toxic cr iii and cr vi coexist on n bl 180 cr vi in order to further investigate the adsorption mechanism of cr iii on n bl 180 the distribution of total chromium cr vi and cr iii in the solution was determined the results are shown in fig s4 with the increase of contact time the concentration of cr vi in the solution gradually decreases until it is completely removed cr iii which is not present in the initial solution is gradually increased to 85 87 mg l the presence of cr iii indicates that the cr vi in the solution is reduced to cr iii with lower toxicity most of the cr iii are adsorbed on the n bl 180 surface through complexation and the rest of cr iii is released into the solution fig 11c describes the changes of c 1s chemical state of n bl 180 before and after cr vi adsorption the c 1s peak is divided into three major components including binding energy of 284 5 285 4 and 288 2 ev which is indexed to cc 28 67 co 64 05 and co 7 28 respectively 43 65 66 after adsorption the content of co decreases to 50 67 while the content of co increases to 20 11 it indicates that the c oh group can provide electrons for the reduction of cr vi to cr iii and itself is oxidized to co 67 in the o 1s xps spectrum after adsorption fig 11c a new characteristic peak cr2o7 2 occurs at 529 9 ev indicating that cr vi is attached on the surface of n bl 180 cr vi as an oxygen containing anion at the same time the content of nh 399 5 ev in the n 1s spectrum is significantly reduced after cr vi adsorption fig 11e a new peak ascribed to the protonated amino group nh appears at 401 5 ev 5 the above results indicate that oxygen and nitrogen containing groups play a vital role in cr vi removal amino groups and some oxygen containing groups such as oh and cooh are easy to be protonated in acidic solution ph 2 68 70 the formed nh3 oh2 and cooh2 can adsorb cr vi anions through electrostatic interaction similarly the same phenomenon appears in the xps spectra of n pl 150 and n pl 150 cr vi fig 12 therefore the interaction between n bl 180 and cr vi anions and cr iii can be described as follows 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 in addition the content of n h 5 00 in the n pl 150 n 1s spectrum after cr vi adsorption is much lower than that of n bl 180 19 33 which may be one of the main reasons why the adsorption performance of n bl 180 for cr vi is better than that of n pl 150 according to the above analysis and discussion the adsorption mechanism of cr vi on n bl 180 is proposed in scheme 2 firstly in acidic solution cr vi anions bind to the protonated n bl 180 surface through electrostatic interaction eqs 10 12 and form complexes with functional groups eq 13 subsequently the cr vi anions adsorbed on the n bl 180 surface are reduced to cr iii by co electron donor groups eqs 14 and 15 finally cr iii is bound to the surface of n bl 180 by complexation with the amino groups and carboxyl eqs 16 and 17 4 conclusion modified biochar derived from black liquor and lignin is synthesized by one step hydrothermal carbonization the nitrogen content of n bl 180 and n pl 150 is 3 41 and 3 08 respectively which indicates that the amino groups have been successfully grafted onto the surface of biochar the initial ph value of the solution is crucial to the adsorption of cr vi the maximum adsorption capacities of cr vi on bl 180 n bl 180 pl 150 and n pl 150 at 45 c and ph 2 are 741 74 859 43 165 16 and 583 77 mg g respectively the adsorption process of cr vi by bl 180 n bl 180 and n pl 150 fits well with the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir isotherm model according to thermodynamic analysis the adsorption of cr vi on biochar is a spontaneous endothermic process the n bl 180 and n pl 150 have excellent selectivity for cr vi comparatively speaking the adsorption performance of bl derived biochar is better than that from pl hence the direct htc of bl shows significant advantages and great application prospects in cr vi removal from wastewater one step amine modification with hmda improves the adsorption amount of biochar for cr vi the introduction of amino groups not only enhances the complex interaction between biochar and cr vi ions but also improves the electrostatic interaction between them in addition modified biochar has good chemical stability and reusability the adsorption capacity remains above 70 1 after four cycles notably this method can be extended to other waste biomass which extends the range of amine modified biochar and has significant application prospect in cr vi containing effluent remediation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13131,the effective control of antibiotic pollution in water has become an important issue in the field of environmental protection in this study the composite of iron sulfide and melamine sponge fes ms was successfully synthesized by in situ synthesis method and applied to the oxidative removal of tetracycline tc in the presence of peroxymonosulfate pms under optimal conditions fes ms 0 1 g l and pms 0 2 mm 95 7 of tc was degraded in 5 min the presence of no3 so4 2 and cl slightly inhibited tc removal whereas hpo4 had a certain promotion effect in activating pms to degrade tc the primary reactive oxygen species ros including so4 oh 1o2 and o2 were identified through electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy and radical quenching experiments in addition fe3 in solution could react with fes to produce fe2 which continuously activates pms to generate radicals for tc degradation the presence of ms reduced the agglomeration of fes and played a protective role in the slow release of fe2 the degradation performance was further validated in real water matrices this study provided new insight into fabricating functional material for the remediation of antibiotic wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords peroxymonosulfate tetracycline sponge fes wastewater treatment 1 introduction tetracyclines tcs are typical antibiotics that are widely used in aquaculture animal husbandry and agricultural production 1 in china tcs are the most employed in the family of antibiotics manufactured and the quantity of antibiotics used has increased rapidly from 147 000 tons in 2009 to 162 000 tons in 2013 2 due to the partially metabolized and absorbed by livings most of tcs are still excreted in the form of maternal structures and entering the environment through certain pathways 3 it is reported that approximately 82 85 of tcs were detected in water and 0 1 17 mg kg tetracycline residue levels were found in animal feces 4 5 the refractory tcs and its intermediates induce the activity of functional microorganisms and then gradually develop resistance to them afterwards resistant bacteria can be transferred in the environment creating a potential threat to human health 6 8 therefore it is important to eliminate tcs in polluted waters via effective methods to alleviate the negative effect on the environment and human beings various techniques have been applied to remove antibiotics from water such as adsorption 9 biodegradation 10 photodegradation 11 12 and advanced oxidation processes aops 13 among them aops that utilize oxidants to generate active species with high oxidation capacity have been developed for efficient degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants 14 especially sulfate radicals so4 based aops have received increasing attention due to the higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v and longer half life period 30 40 μs compared to oh 1 8 2 7 v 1 μs 15 the most economical and effective method to generate so4 was activating persulfate by transition metals such as mn 16 co 17 18 cu 19 21 and fe 22 23 among these strategies the reactions between fe2 and persulfate have been regarded as the most suitable one which does not require external energy input and has milder reaction conditions than other activation methods 24 as commonly used fe containing material fes has been adopted in treating organic pollutants which is owing to the excellent activation performance toward pms as well as the promoted cycle between fe ii fe iii 25 however the naked fes nanomaterials cannot exhibit high reactivity because they are extremely unstable and more susceptible to agglomeration 26 meanwhile the materials are easily dissipated during the reaction process and cannot be properly recovered which also has an impact on the subsequent treatment these drawbacks ultimately reduce their degradation efficiency and limit their environmental applications 27 generally the performance and use lifetime of nanomaterials are enhanced by introducing functional carriers 20 28 29 as a commercial polymer material three dimensional porous structure high porosity good stability high elasticity inexpensiveness and environmental sustainability are highlighted advantages of melamine sponge owing to these excellent properties melamine sponges are used in many fields such as oil water separation 30 31 adsorption 32 33 pressure sensors 34 supercapacitors and multifunctional adsorbents 35 for instance liu et al prepared a melamine formaldehyde mf sponges for oil water separation which contributed to satisfactory separation efficiency 98 7 and ultra high permeate flux up to 1 35 105 l m 2 h 1 30 a previous study found that the graphene polypyrrole modified melamine sponge was used as a highly compressible supercapacitor electrode with a high specific capacitance of 464 10 f g 1 at 80 high compressive strain excellent multiplicative performance and ideal cycling stability 85 43 after 5000 cycles 36 sun and co workers synthesized a novel amino functional graphene sponge adsorbents afgs to remove pollutants in water and the results showed that afgs exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity 166 46 mg g 1 toward cr vi 32 meanwhile other study reported a simple method to prepare mf sponges which performed well over a wide ph range of 4 10 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 36 21 mg p g 33 these properties attracted more attention from the academia and were employed in the field of environmental remediation however current researches are mainly focused on oil water separation and pollutant adsorption to the best of our knowledge limited research had been conducted on loading nanomaterials onto melamine sponge to activate pms for antibiotic degradation the critical role of melamine sponge and degradation mechanisms of tcs in such system have not been systematically investigated as inspired by the discussions above we prepared a melamine sponge based ferrous sulfide composites fes ms for activation of pms for tc degradation the specific objectives were 1 to evaluate the degradation performance of tc in various systems 2 to elucidate the mechanism involved in the degradation process 3 to validate the removal efficiency of tc in different aqueous matrices and authentic water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o sodium sulfide na2s 9h2o sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid hcl sodium bicarbonate nahco3 disodium hydrogenphosphate na2hpo4 sodium chloride nacl sodium nitrate nano3 acetic acid acetonitrile and methanol were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china peroxymonosulfate pms tetracycline hydrochloride tc tert butyl alcohol tba 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp and 1 10 phenanthroline were obtained from aladdin chemical company shanghai china all chemicals used were of analytical grade and used without further purification all solutions were prepared with distilled water 2 2 preparation of fes melamine sponge melamine sponge cubes 5 mm 5 mm 5 mm with 100 300 μm in the pore size and 87 in porosity were supplied by yiwu xinhong daily necessities co ltd the sponge cubes were cleaned by pure water for several times to remove impurities on the surface of the sponge then the sponge cubes were immersed into 100 ml of dopamine solution 2 g l ph 8 5 for 24 h which was used to form an adhesive layer on the surface of the sponge cube 37 the material was then transferred into a dry oven at 40 c for 12 h excess deionized water was purged with nitrogen gas continuously for 15 min to spare the loading procedures were divided into three steps 1 120 ml of 0 1 mol l feso4 solution was prepared with deionized water and stirred for 15 min a certain amount of melamine sponge was added and stirred for 30 min 2 na2s solution 60 ml 0 1 mol l was added dropwise to the solution mentioned above then stirred for 2 h continuously surrounded by nitrogen gas 3 the fes loaded melamine sponge was prepared after washing with deionized water for several times and put into freeze vacuum drying for 48 h 2 3 experimental procedure all degradation experiments were carried out for 120 min in 250 ml beaker at 25 c 2 c with a speed of 450 rpm the initial concentration of the tc solution is 20 mg l 200 ml tc was added to the reaction flask without ph adjustment subsequently different concentration of fes ms 0 05 0 2 g l was added the suspension was stirred for 30 min until the adsorption desorption equilibrium added a certain concentration of pms 0 05 0 5 mol l at a specified time 1 ml suspension was taken out and methanol was added with the volume ratio of 1 1 for reaction quenching immediately in addition the mixed liquid mentioned above was filtered by a 0 22 μm disposable pes for further analysis the desired initial ph value of reaction system was adjusted by hcl and naoh 1 mol l before adding activator 2 4 analytical methods tc was analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa with a waters c18 column 5 μm 250 4 6 mm the eluent was the combination of 0 2 mol l acetic acid solution and acetonitrile 85 15 v v at 1 ml min the injection volume is 20 μl the column temperature is room temperature and the uv detector wavelength was set to 357 nm the concentration of the dissolved fe2 and total fe species are determined by 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometric method 38 to identify the shape and size of the samples the images of scanning electron microscopy sem was operated on zeiss sigma 300 germany the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was carried out on thermo scientific k alpha usa to identify the surface elemental compositions and specific surface area of the samples free radicals produced during the process were determined using an electron paramagnetic spectrometer epr bruker emxplus germany 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a trapping agent for so4 and oh and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp was employed as o2 and 1o2 trapping agent the intermediates of tetracycline were detected using hplc ms agilent usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fes ms the morphologies of fresh and used fes ms were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem the images in fig 1a showed that the original melamine sponge had a three dimensional mesh structure with a smooth surface as displayed in fig 1a the outer surface of the loaded sponge carrier was uniformly covered with fes in the form of flakes after the reactions fes was largely reduced due to the consumption during degradation process fig 1b however from fig 1c d we could clearly observe that the inner surface was still covered with flask fes completely both in fresh and used materials this phenomenon suggested that the sponge played a protective role slowing down the oxidation and loss of fes the eds results in table s1 confirmed the existence of fe o s elements and proved partial fes was oxidized in the air the chemical states in the samples were then characterized by x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps as exhibited in fig 2a five elements including c n o s and fe were detected which was consistent with eds results in the o 1s survey three significant peaks located at 530 5 ev 531 8 ev and 533 8 ev were corresponded to lattice oxygen feo co bond and surface hydroxyl group oh respectively fig 2b 25 39 40 meanwhile the xps fe 2p spectra of composite materials before and after reactions were shown in fig 2c two fitted peaks at 711 1 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 8 ev fe 2p1 2 were assigned to fe ii and the other peaks at 713 6 ev fe 2p3 2 and 727 8 ev fe 2p1 2 were corresponded to fe iii 41 42 the s 2p xps spectrum analysis fig 2d revealed that s species were mainly existed as so4 2 168 6 ev s0 165 7 ev s2 161 6 ev and sn 2 163 7 ev which accounted for 55 4 7 1 14 1 and 22 8 respectively 43 44 the reason for the high percentage of so4 2 may be due to the partial oxidation of s2 these characterizations strongly proved the successful preparation of fes ms 3 2 catalytic performance of fes ms the catalytic performances of different system were shown in fig 3 fes ms reached adsorption equilibrium at 30 min with a removal rate of 10 3 indicating the limited adsorption performance brought by the material the removal rate of tc in the pms only system was 61 8 which meant that pms alone could degrade part of the tc without catalyst approximately 81 3 degradation of tc by fes was achieved at 120 min which suggested that fes could activate certain pms to remove tc meanwhile 90 1 of tc was degraded in the fes ms pms system which was lower than that in fes ms pms system 97 3 removal within 10 min there were two reasons for the occurrence of results firstly the synthesized fes ms particles had a smaller particle size which led to a higher reactivity 45 secondly the addition of ms prevented the agglomeration of small sized fes particles providing the composites with a larger specific surface area more importantly the addition of support materials with high adsorption properties could enhance the adsorption of contaminants even concentrated them on the surface or inside the synthetic composite adsorption and accelerated the contact between tc and the complex for accentuating the activation process 46 47 compared with other catalysts table s2 the lower material dosage and pms concentration proved promising pollutants removal performance of fes ms pms system 3 3 influence of operation parameters the effect of catalyst dosage on the degradation of tc by fes ms pms system was displayed in fig s1a it could be clearly found that the degradation rate of tc was increased continuously with the increase of catalyst amount when the amount of fes ms was 0 05 g l 66 0 of tc was degraded and the tc degradation rate reached 77 5 when the fes ms concentration increased to 0 2 g l previous studies showed that the increase of catalysts would enhance their active sites of surface which effectively activated the pms and facilitated the generation of active radicals 38 48 further increasing composite material led to the insignificant enhancement of tc degradation which was ascribed to the fact that the generated iron hydroxides accumulated and covered on the catalyst surface thus lowering the reactivity of material the performance of different pms concentrations on the degradation of tc was discussed as displayed in fig s1b the removal rate of tc increased from 59 2 to 93 2 with increasing pms concentration from 0 05 mm to 0 2 mm the enhanced performance was probably attributed to the producing of more so4 with increasing pms dose however when the pms dose increased from 0 2 mm to 0 5 mm slightly enhancement of degradation performance was observed which was owing to the reactions between excess pms and so4 eq 1 40 49 meanwhile the redox potential of produced so5 was only 1 10 v which was not conducive to improve the degradation efficiency of tc in addition the increased so4 could lead to self quenching effects eqs 2 3 40 50 which also resulted in insignificant variation of tc removal 1 hso 5 so 4 so 5 so 4 2 h 2 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 3 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 8 so 4 2 as shown in fig s1c as the tc concentration 10 50 mg l increased the tc degradation efficiency at 120 min was decreased from 98 3 to 77 2 the concentration of tc showed a negative correlation trend with the degradation efficiency when the concentration of tc in the solution was high sufficient amounts of reactive radicals was required to enable the reaction to proceed rapidly the initial reaction ph impacted the production and reactivity of the active species therefore it was essential to evaluate the effect of the initial ph on tc degradation in the fes ms pms system as shown in fig s1d the preliminary tc removal rate was relatively slow at ph 3 0 which could be interpreted by the stabilizing effect of h on hso5 51 moreover fe2 was liable to release from fes at acidic ph which could react with pms and further convert to fe4 eq 4 52 the generation of large amount of fe4 leads to more pms consumption and less so4 generation in the iron based persulfate system 53 55 however when the initial ph values were 9 0 and 11 0 the tc degradation efficiencies were 81 1 and 83 2 respectively the decrease of tc degradation rate under such circumstances may be explained by the decrease of so4 production through the self decomposition of pms as well as the quenching effect brought by oh eq 5 53 55 56 although the removal of tc was influenced with varied ph 3 0 11 0 the total removal rates were still remained above 80 within 60 min these results indicated the fes ms pms system was suitable for a relatively wide range of ph values 4 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o feo 2 2 so 4 2 2 h 5 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh some anions such as no3 hpo4 2 cl and so4 2 are widely existed in natural waters 25 57 therefore the effects of different anions on tc removal were conducted as displayed in fig s1e in the presence of no3 cl and so4 2 the tc degradation rate decreased to 83 2 83 2 and 83 2 respectively this inhibition accompanied with no3 may be ascribed to the scavenging reaction which occurred between no3 and oh so4 with the subsequent formation of nitrate radicals no3 that were less reactive than oh so4 eqs 6 7 58 59 simultaneously no3 reacted with the reactive radicals in the solution and formed a competition mechanism with the target pollutant thus decreasing the degradation efficiency moreover no3 could be adsorbed to the catalyst surface and reduced the active sites on the catalyst surface thus causing significant inhibition of tc degradation 27 60 6 no 3 so 4 so 4 2 no 3 7 no 3 oh oh no 3 the decrease of tc degradation efficiency in the presence of cl mainly because cl reacted with so4 in a series of reactions to form radicals such as cl cl2 and cloh eqs 8 10 27 61 the effect of so4 2 on tc removal efficiency was similar to that of cl which was due to the excess decomposition of pms other possible explanation was that the introduction of so4 2 inhibited the conversion of fe3 to fe2 eq 11 and the decreased of fe2 leading to a decline of tc degradation rate 62 8 cl so 4 so 4 2 c 1 9 cloh cl oh cl 2 10 cl hso 5 so 4 2 hocl 11 s 2 s n 2 fe 3 s 0 so 4 2 fe 2 hpo4 had a certain promotion effect in activating pms to degrade tetracycline and the degradation efficiency was improved to 98 2 as previously reported hpo4 could effectively break the oo bond of pms to some extent which also implied that pms was decomposed more quickly and accelerated the production of free radicals 63 except for inorganic matters humic acid ha was an important constituent substance of natural organic matter which was usually present in surface water and wastewater 64 therefore degradation experiments were conducted in the existence of ha to evaluate the impacts of natural organic matter on the degradation process of tc as shown in fig s1f the degradation efficiency of tc in the fes ms pms system was significantly inhibited in the presence of ha which was due to competition of active oxidizing substances 11 3 4 possible mechanism of fes ms pms system for tc degradation 3 4 1 identification of active free radicals to further explore the major radicals generated in the fes ms pms system quenching experiments were performed by dosing various scavengers sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh were considered as the main radicals generated during the activation of pms 65 methanol meoh is usually regarded as an effective trapping agent for both oh and so4 while tert butanol tba is more effective in capturing oh than so4 as shown in eqs 12 15 46 66 in fig 4a it showed that only 35 8 tc was removed with adding meoh the molar ratio between tc and meoh is 1000 1 indicating both so4 and oh were generated in the process about 69 3 tc was removed in the presence of tba the molar ratio between tc and tba is 1000 1 demonstrating that the main reactive radical in the reaction system was so4 12 meoh oh intermediates k 1 2 2 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 13 meoh so 4 intermediates k 1 6 1 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 14 tba oh intermediates k 3 8 7 6 10 8 m 1 s 1 15 tba so 4 intermediates k 1 4 9 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 however the degradation of tc was not completely inhibited by the addition of excess ma or tba this observation implied that other reactive oxygen species may be also involved in the reaction solution in addition several other species such as superoxide and singlet oxygen species have been recently reported to be involved in pms activation therefore p bq was used to demonstrate the presence of o2 radicals k 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 with the introduction of p bq the elimination of tc was significantly reduced from 97 3 to 72 6 implying that o2 radicals were also generated in the reaction to further ascertain the generation of reactive radicals in the system epr analysis were undertaken the signals of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh were detected in the samples further indicating the coexistence of so4 and oh in the fes ms pms system fig 4b in addition the intensity of dmpo oh adduct signal was activated much stronger than dmpo so4 signal which in consistent with a preceding study 58 furthermore as could be seen in fig 4c an intensity 1 1 1 signal peak was observed as a single linear oxygen species 1o2 owing to pms self decomposed to form it eqs 16 17 meanwhile fe2 in fes ms also activated pms to produce 1o2 eq 18 59 while the appearance of six characteristic temp o2 peaks was observed in fig 4d confirming the formation of o2 through reduction of o2 eq 19 67 16 hso 5 so 4 oh 17 hso 5 so 5 2 so 4 2 hso 4 1 o 2 18 fe 2 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 fe 3 1 o 2 19 o 2 e o 2 3 4 2 the role of fes in heterogeneous activation free radicals were first generated near the surface of the activator and then diffused into the solution to oxidize the contaminant 68 therefore to further confirm the initial production site of the activated species the experiment of tc degradation by pms activated by fe2 was carried out firstly the levels of dissolved iron dissolved fe2 and total fe in fes ms pms system were measured the dissolved fe2 and total fe leached from fes ms pms system was 0 39 mg l and 0 48 mg l fig 5a in fe2 pms system approximately 31 3 of tc was degraded fig 5b thus it was demonstrated that although dissolved fe2 directly activated pms to generate radicals for tc removal surface bound fe2 played more instrumental role in the activation process by introducing so4 and oh to the system eqs 20 22 moreover as previous discussed in fig 2c the proportion of fe2 decreased from 35 1 to 30 7 while fe3 increased from 17 1 to 22 3 indicating that fe2 were involved in the degradation reaction and were oxidized to fe3 67 69 20 fe 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 4 oh 21 fe 2 hso 5 feo 2 so 4 2 h 22 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h according to previous study s2 acts as an electron donor and provides electrons for the reduction of fe3 to produce fe2 eq 23 25 to confirm the role of s element fe2 ms pms system was proposed for comparison in fig 5c d it could be observed that fes ms still has 70 2 degradation efficiency for tc after 5 use cycles in contrast only 38 3 tc was degraded in fe2 ms pms system after 5 usages the results clearly illustrated the enhanced performance in the presence of fes moreover s 2p spectra in fig 2d also proved the proposal the percentage of s2 and sn 2 decreased from 14 1 22 8 to 8 4 and 16 6 while the percentage of s0 and so4 2 increased by 5 3 and 10 3 respectively the conversion from s2 sn 2 to s0 so4 2 was due to the ease of s loss of electrons and in activation of pms 70 therefore the introduction of s element promoted the electron transfer between pms and iron ions at the interface thus promoting the fe2 fe3 cycle and making fe2 more regenerable 23 s 2 fe 3 4 h 2 o fe 2 so 4 2 8 h 3 4 3 protective effect of melamine sponge the above analysis indicated that melamine sponge functions as a carrier to disperse fes nanoparticles and enhances the fes ms degradation performance to prove the function of sponge the fe 2p spectra of fes and fes ms after the reaction system were characterized as suggested in fig 6a b the proportion of fe2 in fes ms pms system was higher than in fes pms system after reaction indicating that fe2 were liable transferring to fe3 in the fes pms system the sponges may have played a protective role slowing down the rate of oxidation and allowing the material to retain a high level of activity to degrade the contaminants simultaneously the sponge played a certain protective role to slow down the releasing rate of fe2 and more beneficial for s to promote the fe2 fe3 cycle and the activation of pms since fe in the solid phase was relatively protected well by the sponge we further explored the variation of fe in the solution in fig s2a b it showed in the fes ms pms system the fe2 and total fe concentration in the solution was 0 39 mg l and 0 48 mg l in the initial stage after five cycles the fe2 and total fe concentration decreased slowly and remained at 0 08 mg l and 0 14 mg l while in the fes pms system initial fe2 and total fe concentration was 0 79 mg l and 1 26 mg l after five cycles the fe2 and total fe concentration dropped rapidly to 0 04 mg l and 0 08 mg l from the above a more stable release of iron ions was found indicating melamine sponge could make the slow release of fe2 and fes ms could act as a controlled slow release fe2 source in summary the critical role of ms in the fes ms pms system could be interpreted as follows 1 melamine sponge can make the slow release of fe2 to solve the rapid consumption of fe2 2 the sponge plays a certain protective role to prevent fe2 from being oxidized 3 4 4 oxidation products and reaction pathways to evaluate the mineralization of tc degradation the total organic carbon toc in tc degradation by fes ms pms system was tested and shown in fig s3 within 120 min 46 3 of the toc was removed from the aqueous tc solution which implied the incomplete mineralization of tc and the production of intermediates the intermediates during the reaction were examined by uplc ms the possible structure of the intermediates was listed in table s3 three possible tc degradation pathways were proposed in fig 7 the key groups in tc such as hydroxyl dimethylamino a ketone b and formyl c groups could be oxidized to generate low toxic intermediates combining the literature reports and the mass spectrometric information of the intermediates we speculated routes for the potential removal of tc in the fes ms pms system 71 route iii the hydroxyl group oh in the parent structure of tc was vulnerable to attack to form a dehydrated fragment ion m z 427 10 the methyl group on the dimethylamine group n ch3 2 was destroyed and oh first replaced the hydrogen of n ch3 2 to obtain the formation of m z 361 followed by the removal of ch3 and conh2 and further decarbonized by oxidative ring opening 72 in route ii the amino group nh3 from the formamide group was destroyed and generated the product with m z 444 the cc double bond and the carbonyl α position were attacked to form the intermediate products with m z 362 and 320 10 73 74 in route i the ring opening products with intermediate m z 386 was generated by the deamidation reaction of tc the intermediates m z 318 m z 258 and m z 242 were designated as further oxidation products by decarbonylation dehydration and dihydroxylation processes 75 in summary the mechanisms of tc degradation by the system were proposed fig 8 fe2 activated pms to produce oh so4 and 1o2 while o2 was formed via the reaction between electrons and o2 these various reactive oxygen species ros further attacked and degraded tc during the tc degradation process surface bound fe2 played more important role in the activation process since s2 or sn 2 easily lost electrons in pms activation it accelerated the electron transfer between the pms and fe interfaces further promoted fe2 fe3 cycle and rapid regeneration of fe2 the melamine sponge played a certain protective role to prevent fe2 from being oxidized as well as slow released of fe2 to solve the rapid consumption of fe2 3 5 practical application of the fes ms pms system to investigate the practical applicability of the fes ms pms system water samples from yangtze river and tangxun lake wuhan china were obtained to investigate the effect of the water matrix on tc degradation in fig s4 the main properties of these samples were shown in table s4 the ph conductivity and total organic carbon of yangtze river were 6 92 111 2 μs cm and 5 05 mg l and in tangxun lake the ph conductivity and total organic carbon were 6 75 216 2 μs cm and 7 01 mg l as shown in tc removal rates were 61 9 and 58 5 respectively which indicated that these samples contained complex mixtures of organic inorganic combinations the decreased performance may be due to the competition between organic matter inorganic anion and tc for the active free radicals the satisfactory performance in real water matrices further prove the broad application of fes ms pms system 4 conclusions in this study fes ms was successfully prepared by in situ synthesis method and could be further facilitated the degradation of tc through pms based aops fes ms was found to be significantly more effective in removing tc using less activator pms and even time in addition inorganic anions slightly inhibited the removal rate of tc in the following order no3 so4 2 cl hpo4 had a certain promotion effect in activating pms to degrade tc theoretically the enhanced tc degradation could be attributed to the synergistic effect between ms and fes with the sponge acting as a protective agent and effectively inhibiting the fes agglomeration the slow release of surface bound fe2 and dissolved fe2 promoted the pms activation process surface bound fe2 and s2 acted as electron donors during activation to generate so4 oh 1o2 and o2 mainly on the fes ms in conclusion the proposed fes ms activator may be a promising and effective activator for the remediation of antibiotic containing wastewater credit authorship contribution statement mengyao han writing

13131,the effective control of antibiotic pollution in water has become an important issue in the field of environmental protection in this study the composite of iron sulfide and melamine sponge fes ms was successfully synthesized by in situ synthesis method and applied to the oxidative removal of tetracycline tc in the presence of peroxymonosulfate pms under optimal conditions fes ms 0 1 g l and pms 0 2 mm 95 7 of tc was degraded in 5 min the presence of no3 so4 2 and cl slightly inhibited tc removal whereas hpo4 had a certain promotion effect in activating pms to degrade tc the primary reactive oxygen species ros including so4 oh 1o2 and o2 were identified through electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy and radical quenching experiments in addition fe3 in solution could react with fes to produce fe2 which continuously activates pms to generate radicals for tc degradation the presence of ms reduced the agglomeration of fes and played a protective role in the slow release of fe2 the degradation performance was further validated in real water matrices this study provided new insight into fabricating functional material for the remediation of antibiotic wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords peroxymonosulfate tetracycline sponge fes wastewater treatment 1 introduction tetracyclines tcs are typical antibiotics that are widely used in aquaculture animal husbandry and agricultural production 1 in china tcs are the most employed in the family of antibiotics manufactured and the quantity of antibiotics used has increased rapidly from 147 000 tons in 2009 to 162 000 tons in 2013 2 due to the partially metabolized and absorbed by livings most of tcs are still excreted in the form of maternal structures and entering the environment through certain pathways 3 it is reported that approximately 82 85 of tcs were detected in water and 0 1 17 mg kg tetracycline residue levels were found in animal feces 4 5 the refractory tcs and its intermediates induce the activity of functional microorganisms and then gradually develop resistance to them afterwards resistant bacteria can be transferred in the environment creating a potential threat to human health 6 8 therefore it is important to eliminate tcs in polluted waters via effective methods to alleviate the negative effect on the environment and human beings various techniques have been applied to remove antibiotics from water such as adsorption 9 biodegradation 10 photodegradation 11 12 and advanced oxidation processes aops 13 among them aops that utilize oxidants to generate active species with high oxidation capacity have been developed for efficient degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants 14 especially sulfate radicals so4 based aops have received increasing attention due to the higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v and longer half life period 30 40 μs compared to oh 1 8 2 7 v 1 μs 15 the most economical and effective method to generate so4 was activating persulfate by transition metals such as mn 16 co 17 18 cu 19 21 and fe 22 23 among these strategies the reactions between fe2 and persulfate have been regarded as the most suitable one which does not require external energy input and has milder reaction conditions than other activation methods 24 as commonly used fe containing material fes has been adopted in treating organic pollutants which is owing to the excellent activation performance toward pms as well as the promoted cycle between fe ii fe iii 25 however the naked fes nanomaterials cannot exhibit high reactivity because they are extremely unstable and more susceptible to agglomeration 26 meanwhile the materials are easily dissipated during the reaction process and cannot be properly recovered which also has an impact on the subsequent treatment these drawbacks ultimately reduce their degradation efficiency and limit their environmental applications 27 generally the performance and use lifetime of nanomaterials are enhanced by introducing functional carriers 20 28 29 as a commercial polymer material three dimensional porous structure high porosity good stability high elasticity inexpensiveness and environmental sustainability are highlighted advantages of melamine sponge owing to these excellent properties melamine sponges are used in many fields such as oil water separation 30 31 adsorption 32 33 pressure sensors 34 supercapacitors and multifunctional adsorbents 35 for instance liu et al prepared a melamine formaldehyde mf sponges for oil water separation which contributed to satisfactory separation efficiency 98 7 and ultra high permeate flux up to 1 35 105 l m 2 h 1 30 a previous study found that the graphene polypyrrole modified melamine sponge was used as a highly compressible supercapacitor electrode with a high specific capacitance of 464 10 f g 1 at 80 high compressive strain excellent multiplicative performance and ideal cycling stability 85 43 after 5000 cycles 36 sun and co workers synthesized a novel amino functional graphene sponge adsorbents afgs to remove pollutants in water and the results showed that afgs exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity 166 46 mg g 1 toward cr vi 32 meanwhile other study reported a simple method to prepare mf sponges which performed well over a wide ph range of 4 10 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 36 21 mg p g 33 these properties attracted more attention from the academia and were employed in the field of environmental remediation however current researches are mainly focused on oil water separation and pollutant adsorption to the best of our knowledge limited research had been conducted on loading nanomaterials onto melamine sponge to activate pms for antibiotic degradation the critical role of melamine sponge and degradation mechanisms of tcs in such system have not been systematically investigated as inspired by the discussions above we prepared a melamine sponge based ferrous sulfide composites fes ms for activation of pms for tc degradation the specific objectives were 1 to evaluate the degradation performance of tc in various systems 2 to elucidate the mechanism involved in the degradation process 3 to validate the removal efficiency of tc in different aqueous matrices and authentic water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o sodium

methanol were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china peroxymonosulfate pms tetracycline hydrochloride tc tert butyl alcohol tba 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp and 1 10 phenanthroline were obtained from aladdin chemical company shanghai china all chemicals used were of analytical grade and used without further purification all solutions were prepared with distilled water 2 2 preparation of fes melamine sponge melamine sponge cubes 5 mm 5 mm 5 mm with 100 300 μm in the pore size and 87 in porosity were supplied by yiwu xinhong daily necessities co ltd the sponge cubes were cleaned by pure water for several times to remove impurities on the surface of the sponge then the sponge cubes were immersed into 100 ml of dopamine solution 2 g l ph 8 5 for 24 h which was used to form an adhesive layer on the surface of the sponge cube 37 the material was then transferred into a dry oven at 40 c for 12 h excess deionized water was purged with nitrogen gas continuously for 15 min to spare the loading procedures were divided into three steps 1 120 ml of 0 1 mol l feso4 solution was prepared with deionized water and stirred for 15 min a certain amount of melamine sponge was added and stirred for 30 min 2 na2s solution 60 ml 0 1 mol l was added dropwise to the solution mentioned above then stirred for 2 h continuously surrounded by nitrogen gas 3 the fes loaded melamine sponge was prepared after washing with deionized water for several times and put into freeze vacuum drying for 48 h 2 3 experimental procedure all degradation experiments were carried out for 120 min in 250 ml beaker at 25 c 2 c with a speed of 450 rpm the initial concentration of the tc solution is 20 mg l 200 ml tc was added to the reaction flask without ph adjustment subsequently different concentration of fes ms 0 05 0 2 g l was added the suspension was stirred for 30 min until the adsorption desorption equilibrium added a certain concentration of pms 0 05 0 5 mol l at a specified time 1 ml suspension was taken out and methanol was added with the volume ratio of 1 1 for reaction quenching immediately in addition the mixed liquid mentioned above was filtered by a 0 22 μm disposable pes for further analysis the desired initial ph value of reaction system was adjusted by hcl and naoh 1 mol l before adding activator 2 4 analytical methods tc was analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa with a waters c18 column 5 μm 250 4 6 mm the eluent was the combination of 0 2 mol l acetic acid solution and acetonitrile 85 15 v v at 1 ml min the injection volume is 20 μl the column temperature is room temperature and the uv detector wavelength was set to 357 nm the concentration of the dissolved fe2 and total fe species are determined by 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometric method 38 to identify the shape and size of the samples the images of scanning electron microscopy sem was operated on zeiss sigma 300 germany the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was carried out on thermo scientific k alpha usa to identify the surface elemental compositions and specific surface area of the samples free radicals produced during the process were determined using an electron paramagnetic spectrometer epr bruker emxplus germany 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a trapping agent for so4 and oh and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp was employed as o2 and 1o2 trapping agent the intermediates of tetracycline were detected using hplc ms agilent usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fes ms the morphologies of fresh and used fes ms were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem the images in fig 1a showed that the original melamine sponge had a three dimensional mesh structure with a smooth surface as displayed in fig 1a the outer surface of the loaded sponge carrier was uniformly covered with fes in the form of flakes after the reactions fes was largely reduced due to the consumption during degradation process fig 1b however from fig 1c d we could clearly observe that the inner surface was still covered with flask fes completely both in fresh and used materials this phenomenon suggested that the sponge played a protective role slowing down the oxidation and loss of fes the eds results in table s1 confirmed the existence of fe o s elements and proved partial fes was oxidized in the air the chemical states in the samples were then characterized by x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps as exhibited in fig 2a five elements including c n o s and fe were detected which was consistent with eds results in the o 1s survey three significant peaks located at 530 5 ev 531 8 ev and 533 8 ev were corresponded to lattice oxygen feo co bond and surface hydroxyl group oh respectively fig 2b 25 39 40 meanwhile the xps fe 2p spectra of composite materials before and after reactions were shown in fig 2c two fitted peaks at 711 1 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 8 ev fe 2p1 2 were assigned to fe ii and the other peaks at 713 6 ev fe 2p3 2 and 727 8 ev fe 2p1 2 were corresponded to fe iii 41 42 the s 2p xps spectrum analysis fig 2d revealed that s species were mainly existed as so4 2 168 6 ev s0 165 7 ev s2 161 6 ev and sn 2 163 7 ev which accounted for 55 4 7 1 14 1 and 22 8 respectively 43 44 the reason for the high percentage of so4 2 may be due to the partial oxidation of s2 these characterizations strongly proved the successful preparation of fes ms 3 2 catalytic performance of fes ms the catalytic performances of different system were shown in fig 3 fes ms reached adsorption equilibrium at 30 min with a removal rate of 10 3 indicating the limited adsorption performance brought by the material the removal rate of tc in the pms only system was 61 8 which meant that pms alone could degrade part of the tc without catalyst approximately 81 3 degradation of tc by fes was achieved at 120 min which suggested that fes could activate certain pms to remove tc meanwhile 90 1 of tc was degraded in the fes ms pms system which was lower than that in fes ms pms system 97 3 removal within 10 min there were two reasons for the occurrence of results firstly the synthesized fes ms particles had a smaller particle size which led to a higher reactivity 45 secondly the addition of ms prevented the agglomeration of small sized fes particles providing the composites with a larger specific surface area more importantly the addition of support materials with high adsorption properties could enhance the adsorption of contaminants even concentrated them on the surface or inside the synthetic composite adsorption and accelerated the contact between tc and the complex for accentuating the activation process 46 47 compared with other catalysts table s2 the lower material dosage and pms concentration proved promising pollutants removal performance of fes ms pms system 3 3 influence of operation parameters the effect of catalyst dosage on the degradation of tc by fes ms pms system was displayed in fig s1a it could be clearly found that the degradation rate of tc was increased continuously with the increase of catalyst amount when the amount of fes ms was 0 05 g l 66 0 of tc was degraded and the tc degradation rate reached 77 5 when the fes ms concentration increased to 0 2 g l previous studies showed that the increase of catalysts would enhance their active sites of surface which effectively activated the pms and facilitated the generation of active radicals 38 48 further increasing composite material led to the insignificant enhancement of tc degradation which was ascribed to the fact that the generated iron hydroxides accumulated and covered on the catalyst surface thus lowering the reactivity of material the performance of different pms concentrations on the degradation of tc was discussed as displayed in fig s1b the removal rate of tc increased from 59 2 to 93 2 with increasing pms concentration from 0 05 mm to 0 2 mm the enhanced performance was probably attributed to the producing of more so4 with increasing pms dose however when the pms dose increased from 0 2 mm to 0 5 mm slightly enhancement of degradation performance was observed which was owing to the reactions between excess pms and so4 eq 1 40 49 meanwhile the redox potential of produced so5 was only 1 10 v which was not conducive to improve the degradation efficiency of tc in addition the increased so4 could lead to self quenching effects eqs 2 3 40 50 which also resulted in insignificant variation of tc removal 1 hso 5 so 4 so 5 so 4 2 h 2 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 3 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 8 so 4 2 as shown in fig s1c as the tc concentration 10 50 mg l increased the tc degradation efficiency at 120 min was decreased from 98 3 to 77 2 the concentration of tc showed a negative correlation trend with the degradation efficiency when the concentration of tc in the solution was high sufficient amounts of reactive radicals was required to enable the reaction to proceed rapidly the initial reaction ph impacted the production and reactivity of the active species therefore it was essential to evaluate the effect of the initial ph on tc degradation in the fes ms pms system as shown in fig s1d the preliminary tc removal rate was relatively slow at ph 3 0 which could be interpreted by the stabilizing effect of h on hso5 51 moreover fe2 was liable to release from fes at acidic ph which could react with pms and further convert to fe4 eq 4 52 the generation of large amount of fe4 leads to more pms consumption and less so4 generation in the iron based persulfate system 53 55 however when the initial ph values were 9 0 and 11 0 the tc degradation efficiencies were 81 1 and 83 2 respectively the decrease of tc degradation rate under such circumstances may be explained by the decrease of so4 production through the self decomposition of pms as well as the quenching effect brought by oh eq 5 53 55 56 although the removal of tc was influenced with varied ph 3 0 11 0 the total removal rates were still remained above 80 within 60 min these results indicated the fes ms pms system was suitable for a relatively wide range of ph values 4 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o feo 2 2 so 4 2 2 h 5 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh some anions such as no3 hpo4 2 cl and so4 2 are widely existed in natural waters 25 57 therefore the effects of different anions on tc removal were conducted as displayed in fig s1e in the presence of no3 cl and so4 2 the tc degradation rate decreased to 83 2 83 2 and 83 2 respectively this inhibition accompanied with no3 may be ascribed to the scavenging reaction which occurred between no3 and oh so4 with the subsequent formation of nitrate radicals no3 that were less reactive than oh so4 eqs 6 7 58 59 simultaneously no3 reacted with the reactive radicals in the solution and formed a competition mechanism with the target pollutant thus decreasing the degradation efficiency moreover no3 could be adsorbed to the catalyst surface and reduced the active sites on the catalyst surface thus causing significant inhibition of tc degradation 27 60 6 no 3 so 4 so 4 2 no 3 7 no 3 oh oh no 3 the decrease of tc degradation efficiency in the presence of cl mainly because cl reacted with so4 in a series of reactions to form radicals such as cl cl2 and cloh eqs 8 10 27 61 the effect of so4 2 on tc removal efficiency was similar to that of cl which was due to the excess decomposition of pms other possible explanation was that the introduction of so4 2 inhibited the conversion of fe3 to fe2 eq 11 and the decreased of fe2 leading to a decline of tc degradation rate 62 8 cl so 4 so 4 2 c 1 9 cloh cl oh cl 2 10 cl hso 5 so 4 2 hocl 11 s 2 s n 2 fe 3 s 0 so 4 2 fe 2 hpo4 had a certain promotion effect in activating pms to degrade tetracycline and the degradation efficiency was improved to 98 2 as previously reported hpo4 could effectively break the oo bond of pms to some extent which also implied that pms was decomposed more quickly and accelerated the production of free radicals 63 except for inorganic matters humic acid ha was an important constituent substance of natural organic matter which was usually present in surface water and wastewater 64 therefore degradation experiments were conducted in the existence of ha to evaluate the impacts of natural organic matter on the degradation process of tc as shown in fig s1f the degradation efficiency of tc in the fes ms pms system was significantly inhibited in the presence of ha which was due to competition of active oxidizing substances 11 3 4 possible mechanism of fes ms pms system for tc degradation 3 4 1 identification of active free radicals to further explore the major radicals generated in the fes ms pms system quenching experiments were performed by dosing various scavengers sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh were considered as the main radicals generated during the activation of pms 65 methanol meoh is usually regarded as an effective trapping agent for both oh and so4 while tert butanol tba is more effective in capturing oh than so4 as shown in eqs 12 15 46 66 in fig 4a it showed that only 35 8 tc was removed with adding meoh the molar ratio between tc and meoh is 1000 1 indicating both so4 and oh were generated in the process about 69 3 tc was removed in the presence of tba the molar ratio between tc and tba is 1000 1 demonstrating that the main reactive radical in the reaction system was so4 12 meoh oh intermediates k 1 2 2 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 13 meoh so 4 intermediates k 1 6 1 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 14 tba oh intermediates k 3 8 7 6 10 8 m 1 s 1 15 tba so 4 intermediates k 1 4 9 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 however the degradation of tc was not completely inhibited by the addition of excess ma or tba this observation implied that other reactive oxygen species may be also involved in the reaction solution in addition several other species such as superoxide and singlet oxygen species have been recently reported to be involved in pms activation therefore p bq was used to demonstrate the presence of o2 radicals k 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 with the introduction of p bq the elimination of tc was significantly reduced from 97 3 to 72 6 implying that o2 radicals were also generated in the reaction to further ascertain the generation of reactive radicals in the system epr analysis were undertaken the signals of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh were detected in the samples further indicating the coexistence of so4 and oh in the fes ms pms system fig 4b in addition the intensity of dmpo oh adduct signal was activated much stronger than dmpo so4 signal which in consistent with a preceding study 58 furthermore as could be seen in fig 4c an intensity 1 1 1 signal peak was observed as a single linear oxygen species 1o2 owing to pms self decomposed to form it eqs 16 17 meanwhile fe2 in fes ms also activated pms to produce 1o2 eq 18 59 while the appearance of six characteristic temp o2 peaks was observed in fig 4d confirming the formation of o2 through reduction of o2 eq 19 67 16 hso 5 so 4 oh 17 hso 5 so 5 2 so 4 2 hso 4 1 o 2 18 fe 2 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 fe 3 1 o 2 19 o 2 e o 2 3 4 2 the role of fes in heterogeneous activation free radicals were first generated near the surface of the activator and then diffused into the solution to oxidize the contaminant 68 therefore to further confirm the initial production site of the activated species the experiment of tc degradation by pms activated by fe2 was carried out firstly the levels of dissolved iron dissolved fe2 and total fe in fes ms pms system were measured the dissolved fe2 and total fe leached from fes ms pms system was 0 39 mg l and 0 48 mg l fig 5a in fe2 pms system approximately 31 3 of tc was degraded fig 5b thus it was demonstrated that although dissolved fe2 directly activated pms to generate radicals for tc removal surface bound fe2 played more instrumental role in the activation process by introducing so4 and oh to the system eqs 20 22 moreover as previous discussed in fig 2c the proportion of fe2 decreased from 35 1 to 30 7 while fe3 increased from 17 1 to 22 3 indicating that fe2 were involved in the degradation reaction and were oxidized to fe3 67 69 20 fe 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 4 oh 21 fe 2 hso 5 feo 2 so 4 2 h 22 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h according to previous study s2 acts as an electron donor and provides electrons for the reduction of fe3 to produce fe2 eq 23 25 to confirm the role of s element fe2 ms pms system was proposed for comparison in fig 5c d it could be observed that fes ms still has 70 2 degradation efficiency for tc after 5 use cycles in contrast only 38 3 tc was degraded in fe2 ms pms system after 5 usages the results clearly illustrated the enhanced performance in the presence of fes moreover s 2p spectra in fig 2d also proved the proposal the percentage of s2 and sn 2 decreased from 14 1 22 8 to 8 4 and 16 6 while the percentage of s0 and so4 2 increased by 5 3 and 10 3 respectively the conversion from s2 sn 2 to s0 so4 2 was due to the ease of s loss of electrons and in activation of pms 70 therefore the introduction of s element promoted the electron transfer between pms and iron ions at the interface thus promoting the fe2 fe3 cycle and making fe2 more regenerable 23 s 2 fe 3 4 h 2 o fe 2 so 4 2 8 h 3 4 3 protective effect of melamine sponge the above analysis indicated that melamine sponge functions as a carrier to disperse fes nanoparticles and enhances the fes ms degradation performance to prove the function of sponge the fe 2p spectra of fes and fes ms after the reaction system were characterized as suggested in fig 6a b the proportion of fe2 in fes ms pms system was higher than in fes pms system after reaction indicating that fe2 were liable transferring to fe3 in the fes pms system the sponges may have played a protective role slowing down the rate of oxidation and allowing the material to retain a high level of activity to degrade the contaminants simultaneously the sponge played a certain protective role to slow down the releasing rate of fe2 and more beneficial for s to promote the fe2 fe3 cycle and the activation of pms since fe in the solid phase was relatively protected well by the sponge we further explored the variation of fe in the solution in fig s2a b it showed in the fes ms pms system the fe2 and total fe concentration in the solution was 0 39 mg l and 0 48 mg l in the initial stage after five cycles the fe2 and total fe concentration decreased slowly and remained at 0 08 mg l and 0 14 mg l while in the fes pms system initial fe2 and total fe concentration was 0 79 mg l and 1 26 mg l after five cycles the fe2 and total fe concentration dropped rapidly to 0 04 mg l and 0 08 mg l from the above a more stable release of iron ions was found indicating melamine sponge could make the slow release of fe2 and fes ms could act as a controlled slow release fe2 source in summary the critical role of ms in the fes ms pms system could be interpreted as follows 1 melamine sponge can make the slow release of fe2 to solve the rapid consumption of fe2 2 the sponge plays a certain protective role to prevent fe2 from being oxidized 3 4 4 oxidation products and reaction pathways to evaluate the mineralization of tc degradation the total organic carbon toc in tc degradation by fes ms pms system was tested and shown in fig s3 within 120 min 46 3 of the toc was removed from the aqueous tc solution which implied the incomplete mineralization of tc and the production of intermediates the intermediates during the reaction were examined by uplc ms the possible structure of the intermediates was listed in table s3 three possible tc degradation pathways were proposed in fig 7 the key groups in tc such as hydroxyl dimethylamino a ketone b and formyl c groups could be oxidized to generate low toxic intermediates combining the literature reports and the mass spectrometric information of the intermediates we speculated routes for the potential removal of tc in the fes ms pms system 71 route iii the hydroxyl group oh in the parent structure of tc was vulnerable to attack to form a dehydrated fragment ion m z 427 10 the methyl group on the dimethylamine group n ch3 2 was destroyed and oh first replaced the hydrogen of n ch3 2 to obtain the formation of m z 361 followed by the removal of ch3 and conh2 and further decarbonized by oxidative ring opening 72 in route ii the amino group nh3 from the formamide group was destroyed and generated the product with m z 444 the cc double bond and the carbonyl α position were attacked to form the intermediate products with m z 362 and 320 10 73 74 in route i the ring opening products with intermediate m z 386 was generated by the deamidation reaction of tc the intermediates m z 318 m z 258 and m z 242 were designated as further oxidation products by decarbonylation dehydration and dihydroxylation processes 75 in summary the mechanisms of tc degradation by the system were proposed fig 8 fe2 activated pms to produce oh so4 and 1o2 while o2 was formed via the reaction between electrons and o2 these various reactive oxygen species ros further attacked and degraded tc during the tc degradation process surface bound fe2 played more important role in the activation process since s2 or sn 2 easily lost electrons in pms activation it accelerated the electron transfer between the pms and fe interfaces further promoted fe2 fe3 cycle and rapid regeneration of fe2 the melamine sponge played a certain protective role to prevent fe2 from being oxidized as well as slow released of fe2 to solve the rapid consumption of fe2 3 5 practical application of the fes ms pms system to investigate the practical applicability of the fes ms pms system water samples from yangtze river and tangxun lake wuhan china were obtained to investigate the effect of the water matrix on tc degradation in fig s4 the main properties of these samples were shown in table s4 the ph conductivity and total organic carbon of yangtze river were 6 92 111 2 μs cm and 5 05 mg l and in tangxun lake the ph conductivity and total organic carbon were 6 75 216 2 μs cm and 7 01 mg l as shown in tc removal rates were 61 9 and 58 5 respectively which indicated that these samples contained complex mixtures of organic inorganic combinations the decreased performance may be due to the competition between organic matter inorganic anion and tc for the active free radicals the satisfactory performance in real water matrices further prove the broad application of fes ms pms system 4 conclusions in this study fes ms was successfully prepared by in situ synthesis method and could be further facilitated the degradation of tc through pms based aops fes ms was found to be significantly more effective in removing tc using less activator pms and even time in addition inorganic anions slightly inhibited the removal rate of tc in the following order no3 so4 2 cl hpo4 had a certain promotion effect in activating pms to degrade tc theoretically the enhanced tc degradation could be attributed to the synergistic effect between ms and fes with the sponge acting as a protective agent and effectively inhibiting the fes agglomeration the slow release of surface bound fe2 and dissolved fe2 promoted the pms activation process surface bound fe2 and s2 acted as electron donors during activation to generate so4 oh 1o2 and o2 mainly on the fes ms in conclusion the proposed fes ms activator may be a promising and effective activator for the remediation of antibiotic containing wastewater credit authorship contribution statement mengyao han writing

1 to a few μg l 1 5 the concentrations of ciprofloxacin cip and norfloxacin nor in hospital wastewaters reached 26 μg l 1 and 37 μg l 1 3 respectively and 0 82 147 ng l 1 and 11 1 964 ng l 1 in municipal wastewaters 6 however the concentration of cip in wastewater may reach even 6 453 μg l 1 5 moreover the concentrations of sulfonamides and macrolides were measured as 22 07 and 85 1 μg kg 1 dry weight respectively in sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps the occurrence of antibiotics in wastewater systems may negatively impact microorganisms with short term effects 7 moreover long term exposure of antibiotics towards microorganisms even at sub inhibitory concentrations can cause chronic toxicity 8 with that in mind the presence of antibiotics in wastewater has become a challenge for biological treatment systems another problem connected with the release of antibiotics into wastewater relates to the development of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb 5 wastewater provides a fertile environment for args transfer and hosting args into the environment therefore the problem with args requires attention 9 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox became one of the more promising options for ammonia rich wastewater treatment because of its high nitrogen removal efficiency combined with significant cost savings for aeration dosing external organic carbon and production of less sludge 10 anammox bacteria convert ammonium into nitrogen gas using nitrite as electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions 11 however anammox bacteria are sensitive to various substances present in wastewater and may inhibit the anammox process therefore the sensitivities of anammox bacteria to different wastewater contaminants have restricted implementing anammox treatments in wwtps and anammox inhibition has been previously reported in a short term test fernandez et al 12 showed that 250 mg l 1 of chloramphenicol reduced anammox activity by 20 within 24 h in a long term test oxytetracycline otc at 2 mg l 1 decreased nitrogen removal efficiency by 60 for 120 days 13 however the effects of antibiotics on anammox bacteria abated when the microorganisms produce extracellular polymers epss that have a protective function 14 occurrence of antibiotics in wastewater is related to the development of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which become risk for human healthcare system 5 moreover the presence of antibiotic resistance inducing genes in the bacterial genome allows bacteria to protect themselves against negative antibiotic actions despite the fact that there are a few studied investigated development of args in the anammox system during antibiotic stress 23 27 the knowledge about the transfer of args between bacteria in the wastewater treatment system is still poor therefore clarifying the behavior of args in anammox system is essential the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of three antibiotics oxytetracycline otc ciprofloxacin cip and clarithromycin cla on the effectiveness of the implemented anammox process in a sequencing batch reactor sbr and a microbiological community structure and formation of antibiotic resistance in an anammox system under environmentally relevant antibiotic concentrations 0 001 mg l 1 otc cip and cla were selected because they are widely used in medicine animal breeding and as a growth promoter for animals a previous study reported that otc strongly suppressed anammox behavior however its effect was tested at concentrations above 1 mg l 1 significantly higher than concentrations observed in municipal wastewaters 13 15 from previous data cip 0 2 2 0 mg l 1 reduced nitrogen removal efficiency during nitrification denitrification by 10 6 15 3 16 however there is a lack of information regarding cip and cla on the anammox process furthermore to account for the reaction of anammox bacteria to antibiotic stresses short term and long term experiments were conducted a batch test and in an sbr respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and analytical methods experiments were conducted in four 1 l sbrs and placed in a thermostatic chamber at 35 c as shown in fig 1 each reactor was operated on 1 cycle per day for 30 day with 2 days of hydraulic retention time hrt and replacement rate 50 and do concentration was below 0 1 mg l 1 the first reactor control was carried out without adding antibiotics while 0 001 mg l 1 of otc cip and cla were added to the other three reactors r otc r cip and r cla respectively each reactor was inoculated with an equal amount of biomass and volatile suspended solids vss 1 2 0 6 g vss l 1 suspended anammox biomass used in this experiment was taken from a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr a volume of 20 l previously inoculated with anammox sludge from a full scale deamonification sbr in germany the anammox process was performed as described previously by ziembińska buczyńska et al 17 antibiotics were fed to the sbrs along with a mineral medium based on van de graaf et al 18 that had been adapted to anammox bacteria requirements the concentration of ammonium and nitrite was regulated by adding nh4cl and nano2 respectively the total nitrogen concentration was 230 mg l 1 while other elements

were measured according to the standard method 61 2 2 batch tests short term experiments were performed as batch tests according to the method described by tomaszewski et al 19 for the batch tests biomass samples in a medium containing antibiotic at concentrations of 0 control and 0 001 mg l 1 for otc cip and cla were prepared in 125 ml anaerobic batch reactors the tests were stirred at 250 rpm initial substrate concentrations were 25 mg n nh4 l 1 and 30 mg n no2 l 1 as nh4cl and nano2 respectively and the average biomass concentration was 0 9 0 2 g vss l 1 the tests were conducted at 35 c and a ph of 7 5 adjusted using 10 hcl or 10 naoh samples from the batch test reactors were collected at 20 120 min intervals for n nh4 and n no2 concentration measurements while n no3 was calculated based on stoichiometry 2 3 epss extraction and determination the biomass samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to extract epss followed by supernatant removal phosphate buffered saline 1 ph 7 was added to the precipitate for sonication 3 min 40 khz the mixture was heated in a water bath at 80 c for 3 min and centrifuged again at 8000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was collected for eps analysis while the remaining precipitate was used to measure vss levels the supernatant was analyzed for epss components including protein pn and polysaccharide ps the amounts of pn and ps were measured using the flint phenol method at 500 nm and the anthrone sulfuric acid method at 625 nm respectively 2 4 qpcr analysis quantitative pcr qpcr detected quantity changes of functional genes of

s test examined variance equalities based on preliminary statistical results the kruskal wallis test examined the significance of the differences between the relative gene abundance change in the presence of antibiotics dunn s test was conducted as a post hoc pairwise multiple comparison test to discern which pairs had significant differences dunn s test was further adjusted by the holm method in addition the shannon and simpson biodiversity index were calculated to examine microbial biodiversity in the collected samples spearman rank correlation was calculated between saas obtained in each reactor all calculations were conducted using ms excel 2013 and statistica 13 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 short term effects of otc cip and cla on the microbial activity short term test results of the anammox process conducted using 0 001 mg l 1 of otc cip and cla are shown in fig 2 relative activity of the anammox process was presented as a percentage of saa relative to the control without antibiotics addition those results showed that otc caused an increase of 7 1 in relative anammox activity while cip and cla caused slight decreases in anammox activity 8 4 and 3 2 respectively reports covering the effects of cip and cla on the anammox process are scarce however one study did investigate the effect of antibiotics in the same class erythromycin ery and norfloxacin nor belong to macrolide and fluoroquinolone classes respectively and were investigated by zhang et al 23 during short term experiments 4 h they observed decreases in anammox activity of 1 7 and 2 2 under ery and nor suppression 0 001 mg l 1 respectively similarly this study reports that cip which belongs to the fluoroquinolone class showed higher suppression of anammox than cla a macrolide sguanci et al 24 reported that doxycycline dox which belongs to the same class as otc had no impact on the anammox process in short term 24 h experiments at 5 and 10 mg l 1 noophan et al 25 reported that otc decreased total nitrogen removal efficiency from 74 73 to 33 48 22 15 at concentrations between 25 and 100 mg l 1 within 7 h moreover the half inhibitory concentration ic50 for otc was calculated as 517 5 mg l 1 in the batch test 26 however this inhibition concentration was several mg l 1 whereas in this study the trace concentration amount was much smaller 0 001 mg l 1 therefore otc inhibited the anammox process at concentrations above several mg l 1 the otc results suggested that suppression by this antibiotic at trace levels could activate some resistance mechanism which induced anammox stimulation zhang et al 27 reported that very low concentrations of sulfamethoxazole smx e g 0 1 mg l 1 stimulated up regulation of anammox functional genes hdh hzsa that suggests that under otc suppression an increase in anammox genes can be observed as a self protective mechanism that increases anammox activity moreover otc adsorbs onto the epss that protect against direct effects of the antibiotic on bacterial cells 27 this mechanism may play an important role in the short term protection of anammox bacteria 3 2 long term effects of otc cip and cla on anammox performance the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox systems suppressed by three antibiotics otc cip cla in 0 001 mg l 1 is shown in fig 3a nitrogen removal efficiency nre and fig 3b specific anammox activity saa all reactors were subjected to a similar nitrogen loading rate nlr with 0 115 kg the stabilities in the control reactor r otc and r cla were disturbed while the r cla reactor operated relatively stable with nre and saa reaching 62 4 6 37 and 0 058 0 06 kg n kg 1 vss d 1 respectively at days 2 9 and 17 in the control reactor r otc and r cla the maximum theoretical anammox nre 90 was reached 86 9 82 56 and 82 52 respectively while the nre in r cip did not exceed 70 15th operating day the deviation in the nitrogen removal efficiency may be associated with biomass adaptation or microbial community remodeling 21 anammox system start ups are characterized by endogenous denitrification which may reflect an increase in the nitrogen removal efficiency at the beginning of the experiment denitrification especially endogenous in anammox systems is characteristic of this process 17 the denitrification contribution is also analogous to the molecular analysis of functional genes the nirs and nirk genes in all reactors showed relatively high abundance during inoculation day 1 and maintained those values after antibiotic suppression day 30 described in section 3 3 comparing saa and nrr from the control reactor with reactors containing otc cip and cla there was no significant correlation p 0 05 between the reactors table s3 therefore implementing the anammox process had a more significant effect on anammox biomass and further adaptation to new conditions than the presence of antibiotics at 0 001 mg l 1 3 3 epss content microorganisms produce epss in response to stress in the presence of antibiotics 27 28 29 and affect biomass characteristics 30 proteins and polysaccharides are viewed as important among all epss components proteins pn and polysaccharides ps are hydrophobic and hydrophilic components within epss respectively lowering the pn ps ratio decreases the hydrophilicity and might reduce the flocculation of activated sludge 31 meng et al 32 suggested the pn ps ratio decrease could lead to sludge settling capacity reductions according to fig 4 the pn ps ratio increased in the control and r otc by 7 9 and 3 35 respectively but decreased in r cip and r cla by 8 0 and 10 5 respectively however the total epss production pn ps slightly decreased in the control by 1 4 while in sbrs with added otc cip and cla increased by 0 6 1 2 and 1 8 respectively it showed that initial exposure of streptomycin belonging to macrolide class stimulated epss production in the sludge 33 similar effects were described by zhang et al 27 where eps levels increased from 11 9 mg g 1 vss to 317 3 mg g 1 vss at treatment levels of 0 5 mg l 1 otc thus the production of epss was viewed as an important self protection mechanism against antibiotics moreover epss are the first barrier for a bacterial cell that directly contacts and interacts with antibiotics in activated sludge 29 the epss component responsible for antibiotic sorption is pn it provides an adsorption binding site via functional groups such as amine carboxyl hydroxyl group and hydrophobic regions 30 as previously reported by zhang et al 27 the presence of 0 5 mg l 1 otc increased the adsorption sites and was related to the pn ps ratio stronger hydrophobicity and greater adsorption site availability contributed to the higher pn ps ratio 27 30 and was observed in the current study for r otc thus sorption onto the pn fraction of epss may be an important part of the protective mechanism against antibiotics especially otc 3 4 variation of functional genes abundance the relative abundance of functional genes responsible for nitrogen transformation amoa nxra nirk nirs and hzo genes and integron 1 class inti1 were determined via qpcr using bacterial dna as a template all qpcr reactions were conducted at least in triplicate with efficiencies close to 1 0 the results are presented as the ratio of the specific reference gene to 16s rrna gene relative abundance gene the significance of the difference between relative genes abundance changes in the presence of these antibiotics was revealed by statistical methods table 2 as shown in fig 5 changes in amoa and nxra genes showed similar trends during the trials on day 1 the abundance of amoa and nxra in almost all reactors fed with antibiotics was higher compared to the control reactor amoa in the r otc reactor was the exception after the experiments concluded the abundance of both amoa and nxra genes in each reactor decreased moreover the abundances of amoa were higher than nxra in the operating sbrs reactor indicating a significant role of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob in the anammox biomass the occurrence of aob in anammox systems closely related to anammox bacteria has been previously confirmed 17 34 the presence of aob in anammox biomass is explained in two ways aob protects anammox bacteria against oxygen and produces nitrite or aob performs some anaerobic metabolism 17 35 36 however the relatively high abundance of the amoa gene commonly attributed to aob in wastewater treatment is also present in the nitrospira genus which undergoes complete nitrification in one step called comammox under anaerobic conditions 37 moreover nitrospira contains a full set of ammonium converting gene encoding enzymes ammonium monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr 37 therefore an abundance of amoa and nxra genes result in the occurrence of nitrospira in these systems and confirmed in metataxonomic analysis section 3 3 where the relative abundance of this genus in each reactor increased levels of hzo genes were the lowest of all investigated genes this was caused by inoculation to sbrs and anammox adaptation as shown in fig 5 the abundance of the hzo gene in the reactors fed with antibiotics decreased during the experimental period the abundance increased in the control reactor the difference in the change of hzo gene abundance in the control reactors and reactors with antibiotics addition was statistically significant p 0 05 table 3 these results suggest the presence of 0 001 mg l 1 otc cip and cla may suppress anammox bacteria which showed low enzymatic activity during the adaptation period zhang et al 27 compared the effects of otc and smx from 0 to 1 mg l 1 on anammox functional genes hzsa hdh and reported that both genes were more sensitive on smx than otc from 0 1 0 5 mg l 1 however they also proved that hdh was sensitive to a low otc dose 0 1 mg l 1 rather than a higher dose this suggested that trace concentrations of otc 0 001 mg l 1 may have an adverse effect on the hzo gene other studies showed that macrolide spiramycin at 1 5 mg l 1 did not lead to significant changes in the abundance of hzsa hdh and metabolic processes of anammox bacteria were not disturbed by long term exposure 38 the abundances of nirk and nirs were relatively similar order of magnitude on both the first and last day of the experiment in all reactors tested high abundances of both nirk and nirs in anammox systems may be due to using a carbon source derived from the decomposition of dead biomass by denitrifiers in a process called endogenous denitrification as shown in fig 5 nirs present a higher abundance than nirk this result suggested that denitrifiers in the biomass preferred the nirs pathway over nirk similar results in anammox systems have been previously reported by banach wiśniewska et al 39 the prevalence of the nirs gene abundance over nirk may be attributed to fact that nirk is cu copper dependent while nirs is cytochrome cd 1 containing 40 therefore bacteria utilizing the nirk pathway require cu limited in the laboratory scale anammox system from results obtained for both nirs and nirk the antibiotics used had a negligible impact on denitrification genes integron integrase 1 class gene inti1 has been proposed as a marker for anthropogenic arg pollution mainly due to significant linkage with args and rapid response to diverse environmental stresses 41 moreover a positive correlation was found in the relationship between inti1 and abundance of args in aquatic environments 42 43 which accentuates the need to study inti1 genes relative to args in the present study the control and reactors fed with antibiotics maintained constant levels 1 4 10 4 2 7 10 5 except for r otc which reached 9 7 10 4 towards the end of the experimental period a significant correlation p 0 05 between the abundance of inti1 and genes targeting tetracycline resistance tetc tetx was found in the anammox system suppressed by otc at 2 mg l 1 15 therefore there may be some linkage between inti1 and tet genes on the other hand inti1 integrated and expressed more than 100 types of args by genes cassette 44 though no tet genes were detected in any gene cassette by inti1 45 however previous studies revealed that inti1 coexists with tetc in conjugative plasmid which made them easier to transfer 46 47 3 5 variation of args nine primers were used to detect args in these experiments four primers encoding args for otc tetx tetc tetm tetw three primers for cip resistance qnrb qnrb4 qnrs and two primers for cla resistance mpha mphb moreover all primers were used to detect args in the control reactor as shown in table s4 only six args were detected three of which were targeted to otc tetx tetc tetw two targeted to cip qnrb4 qnrs and one targeted cla mpha as shown in fig 6 the number of each detected gene was expressed as a ratio of the functional genes to the 16s rrna gene relative genes abundance those results show that the relative abundance of each arg targeted otc increased after long term antibiotic feeding while the control reactor saw a decrease excluding tetw which slightly increased each otc args induced a different resistance mechanism efflux pump tetc ribosomal protection protein tetw and enzymatic modification tetx however the dominant resistance mechanism was efflux pump and enzymatic modification furthermore the highest increase was observed in tetc during long term testing zhang et al 38 obtained the overall absolute abundance of tetx which was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than the other otc args tetc tetg and tetm it is worth noting they used a higher concentration of otc 0 1 mg l 1 than in this study similar effects were reported by zhang et al 15 and shi et al 48 where the abundance of tetx far exceeded that of tetc under otc pressure at 1 0 2 0 mg l 1 therefore anammox bacteria use different protective mechanisms depending on the environmental concentration of the antibiotic the relatively low abundance of tetw genes may stem from the anammox process conducted in the laboratory condition using a mineral medium tetw is recognized as a typical marker for tetracycline args and is unique to wwtps and livestock 43 therefore its presence in a laboratory system can be marginal the relative abundances of both qnrb4 and qnrs increased slightly in the reactor fed with cip from 4 4 10 5 to 7 69 10 5 and from 7 4 10 8 to 6 7 10 7 respectively while the abundance in the control reactor decreased from 1 16 10 4 to 3 95 10 6 qnrb4 and from 3 78 10 7 to 3 25 10 8 qnrs which indicated that cip feeding induced qnrb4 and qnrs both qnrb4 and qnrs are protective genes and protect dna gyrase from inhibition by quinolones qnrs has become increasingly prevalent in anthropogenically influenced environments 49 50 the presence of qnrs genes in the laboratory system fed with a mineral medium was validated by ślipko et al 51 where the relative abundance of qnrs fluctuated over time spanning from below 10 5 copies 16s rrna gene to above 10 2 copies 16s rrna gene between 0 0001 and 0 1 mg l 1 of cip however these results were obtained for a conventional nitrification denitrification system in which the microorganisms have a higher growth rate than anammox bacteria 52 therefore the transfer of args can be faster on the other hand the relative abundance of mpha decreased in the reactor fed with cla from 7 45 10 4 to 9 0 10 5 and decreased in the control reactor from 8 9 10 4 to 2 2 10 5 zhang et al 38 suggested that mpha might be more susceptible to macrolide antibiotics in environmental samples due to a resistance mechanism the presence of the mpha gene in the bacteria genome induced ability of bacteria chemical modification of antibiotics caused the degradation or replacement of the active group by synthesis of oxidoreductase 53 therefore a reduction in the relative abundance of this gene was observed zhang et al 23 concluded that it was not easy to induce args by nor in the anammox system although nor at 0 001 mg l 1 suppressed the anammox system they did not detect that genes targeted nor resistance on the other hand this study showed that cip at 0 001 mg l 1 induced development of genes targeted for quinolones resistance therefore these results suggest that cip more readily induces nor resistance to quinolones 3 6 microbial community changes a 16s rdna based high throughput sequencing technique determined the microbial community composition changes during long term exposure of otc cip and cla the sequence numbers otu of the eight samples were 69 027 control 1 76 350 control 30 48 991 r otc 1 70 008 r otc 30 69 311 r cip 1 83 064 r cip 30 48 004 r cla 1 and 75 487 r cla 30 the otu was defined as the sequence with the similarity 95 the same out values co existed in the four samples day 1 and four samples day 30 were 37 and 42 respectively as shown in fig s1 these results indicated a microbial community change occurred under antibiotic suppression based on otus values the shannon and simpson biodiversity indexes were calculated fig s2 for each reactor both indexes slightly decrease at the end of the experiment planctomycetes proteobacteria and bateroidetes were the dominant phyla in this study on day 1 fig 7 similar dominant communities were observed by cheng et al 54 under otc and cu nanoparticle stresses however after day 30 as the main phyla functioned proteobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospira such a high abundance of proteobacteria was similar to conventional nitrification denitrification systems in which this phylum dominates 55 however the occurrence of proteobacteria in this study can traced to the presence of death cells of bacteria in anammox biomass as a result of the implementation period on the other hand it was reported that proteobacteria readily utilizes antibiotics like otc as a carbon source 56 therefore antibiotic addition may improve the conditions for this phylum on day 1 plantomycetes accounted for 21 28 control 19 56 r otc 21 27 r cip and 17 42 r cla in the end significant changes were observed where relative abundances dropped to 4 75 control 9 84 r otc 3 59 r cip and 12 00 r cla during the experiment the third phylum transformed from platomycetes to nitrospira reached 25 27 control 11 33 r otc 33 13 r cip and 13 31 r cla up from 9 01 13 05 13 16 and 14 02 respectively previous studies reported that nitrospira is relatively abundant in anammox systems 17 52 57 chloroflexi was quite abundant in these systems and the abundances of these bacteria increased from 8 1 control 7 9 r otc 7 6 r cip and 8 37 r cla to 9 59 9 6 12 03 and 11 45 chloroflexi exists in technical and lab scale anammox reactors and utilize epss produced by anammox bacteria in anaerobic systems 54 the taxonomic results at the genus level are shown in fig 7 bar chart the major genera of anammox bacteria in each reactor were candidatus brocadia and candidatus jettenia whose abundances dropped during the trial period for candidatus brocadia it dropped from 7 0 control 5 6 r otc 5 9 r cip and 5 7 r cla to 1 1 1 3 0 8 and 2 2 respectively while for candidatus jettenia it dropped from 5 6 control 2 3 r otc 2 6 r cip and 1 0 r cla to 0 2 0 6 0 2 and 0 9 because the highest drop in anammox bacteria was observed in the control reactor it suggested these changes were caused by remodeling of the anammox biomass community after inoculation it is worth noting that previous studies reported that candidatus brocadia adapts to certain antibiotics like sulfamethazine at concentrations below 7 mg l 1 58 this also suggested that some adaptation mechanism may have taken place towards cla which had the lowest decrease of all reactors in candidatus brocadia abundance by 3 5 despite the decrease in anammox bacteria abundance in the control this was the only reactor in which the hzo gene abundance fig 5 increased this may be due to unclassified planctomycetes with an abundance of 11 29 in the control reactor which may exhibit enzymatic activity the role of unclassified planctomycetes in anammox systems was also pointed out by tomaszewski et al 52 as shown in fig s3 the dominant genera were clustered into two main groups where both candidatus brocadia and candidatus jettenia demonstrated a small distance between nodes showing similarity between the data sets obtained for each one significant abundance increases were observed for nitrospira nitrospirae phylum which belongs to nob and converts nitrite into nitrate however in 2015 it was reported that nitrospira performed both stages of nitrification 59 this suggested that nitrospira helps anammox bacteria with nitrogen removal under anaerobic conditions similar results were reported by tomaszewski et al 52 where nitrospira supported anammox bacteria under reduced graphene oxide rgo suppression moreover increasing the abundance of this genus in the system during trials could lead to a suspicion that nitrospira was more resistant to antibiotic suppression than anammox bacteria in contrast zhang et al 60 reported that nitrospira was present in concentrations much lower than anammox bacteria under ery suppression nitrosomonas and denitratisoma representing aob and denitrifiers respectively were detected with lower abundance than primary anammox bacteria genera in the reactors studied moreover both nitrosomonas and denitratisoma were inhibited throughout the experiment zhang et al 60 documented that the presence of these genera had an impact on anammox performance deviation under ery furthermore for nor at 0 001 mg l 1 an increase was observed 0 57 while ery 0 001 mg l 1 caused slight variation 23 4 conclusions short and long term effects on anammox performance including production of epss variation of functional genes and arg abundances as well as community structure were analyzed nitrogen removal performance showed that antibiotics 0 001 mg l 1 had no significant impact on the anammox process each antibiotic decreased the biodiversity of anammox biomass all antibiotics decreased the abundance of the hzo gene both otc and cip increased args tetc and tetw for otc qnrb4 and qnrs for cip in the anammox system while args targeted cla mpha decreased during anammox testing the antibiotics at trace concentrations had negative impacts on anammox at the gene level and had negligible effects on nitrogen removal mainly due to co existing with other nitrogen cycle bacteria in the biomass furthermore the antibiotics induced development of anammox bacteria resistance via production of eps and increased args abundance further studies involving the effects of otc cip and cla on the anammox process should focus on elucidating the mechanism of resistance gene transfer in the anammox biomass and investigating all the protective mechanisms of anammox bacteria including regulation of gene expression and production

13132,this study investigated the inhibitory effect of three antibiotics oxytetracycline otc ciprofloxacin cip and clarithromycin cla on the anammox process conducted in four sequencing batch reactors

measured by qpcr these results indicated that none of the antibiotics significantly impacted nitrogen removal rate nrr in the anammox process and specific anammox activity saa analysis of the functional gene abundance variation showed significant inhibition of hzo by antibiotics while in control and increased from 3 88 10 6 to 1 26 10 5 the relative abundance of almost all detected args increased tetc and tetw targeted otc qnrb4 and qnrs targeted cip only two args tetx targeted otc and mpha targeted cla decreased from 1 62 10 2 and 7 45 10 3 to 3 74 10 4 and 9 3 10 5 respectively metataxonomic analysis showed a decrease in the relative abundance of anammox bacteria genera candidatus brocadia candidatus jettenia in each tested reactor and a significant increase of nitrospira regarded as a comammox microorganism the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of trace concentration of three commonly detected antibiotics otc cip cla in wastewater on the anammox process furthermore cip and cla have never been investigated relative to the anammox process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anammox antibiotics antibiotics resistance genes functional genes epss 1 introduction environmental contamination with antibiotics has been an important issue for decades especially for wastewater treatment antibiotics exist in many types of wastewaters including municipal wastewaters 1 landfill leachates livestock 2 hospital and pharmaceutical industry wastewaters 3 4 the concentration of selected antibiotics in various wastewater types ranged from a few ng l 1 to a few μg l 1 5 the concentrations of ciprofloxacin cip and norfloxacin nor in hospital wastewaters reached 26 μg l 1 and 37 μg l 1 3 respectively and 0 82 147 ng l 1 and 11 1 964 ng l 1 in municipal wastewaters 6 however the concentration of cip in wastewater may reach even 6 453 μg l 1 5 moreover the concentrations of sulfonamides and macrolides were measured as 22 07 and 85 1 μg kg 1 dry weight respectively in sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps the occurrence of antibiotics in wastewater systems may negatively impact microorganisms with short term effects 7 moreover long term exposure of antibiotics towards microorganisms even at sub inhibitory concentrations can cause chronic toxicity 8 with that in mind the presence of antibiotics in wastewater has become a challenge for biological treatment systems another problem connected with the release of antibiotics into wastewater relates to the development of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb 5 wastewater provides a fertile environment for args transfer and hosting args into the environment therefore the problem with args requires attention 9 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox became one of the more promising options for ammonia rich wastewater treatment because of its high nitrogen removal efficiency combined with significant cost savings for aeration dosing external organic carbon and production of less sludge 10 anammox bacteria convert ammonium into nitrogen gas using nitrite as electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions 11 however anammox bacteria are sensitive to various substances present in wastewater and may inhibit the anammox process therefore the sensitivities of anammox bacteria to different wastewater contaminants have restricted implementing anammox treatments in wwtps and anammox inhibition has been previously reported in a short term test fernandez et al 12 showed that 250 mg l 1 of chloramphenicol reduced anammox activity by 20 within 24 h in a long term test oxytetracycline otc at 2 mg l 1 decreased nitrogen removal efficiency by 60 for 120 days 13 however the effects of antibiotics on anammox bacteria abated when the microorganisms produce extracellular polymers epss that have a protective function 14 occurrence of antibiotics in wastewater is related to the development of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which become risk for human healthcare system 5 moreover the presence of antibiotic resistance inducing genes in the bacterial genome allows bacteria to protect themselves against negative antibiotic actions despite the fact that there are a few studied investigated development of args in the anammox system during antibiotic stress 23 27 the knowledge about the transfer of args between bacteria in the wastewater treatment system is still poor therefore clarifying the behavior of args in anammox system is essential the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of three antibiotics oxytetracycline otc ciprofloxacin cip and clarithromycin cla on the effectiveness of the implemented anammox process in a sequencing batch reactor sbr and a microbiological community structure and formation of antibiotic resistance in an anammox system under environmentally relevant antibiotic concentrations 0 001 mg l 1 otc cip and cla were selected because they are widely used in medicine animal breeding and as a growth promoter for animals a previous study reported that otc strongly suppressed anammox behavior however its effect was tested at concentrations above 1 mg l 1 significantly higher than concentrations observed in municipal wastewaters 13 15 from previous data cip 0 2 2 0 mg l 1 reduced nitrogen removal efficiency during nitrification denitrification by 10 6 15 3 16 however there is a lack of information regarding cip and cla on the anammox process furthermore to account for the reaction of anammox bacteria to antibiotic stresses short term and long term experiments were conducted a batch test and in an sbr respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and analytical methods experiments were conducted in four 1 l sbrs and placed in a thermostatic chamber at 35 c as shown in fig 1 each reactor was operated on 1 cycle per day for 30 day with 2 days of hydraulic retention time hrt and replacement rate 50 and do concentration was below 0 1 mg l 1 the first reactor control was carried out without adding antibiotics while 0 001 mg l 1 of otc cip and cla were added to the other three reactors r otc r cip and r cla respectively each reactor was inoculated with an equal amount of biomass and volatile suspended solids vss 1 2 0 6 g vss l 1 suspended anammox biomass used in this experiment was taken from a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr a volume of 20 l previously inoculated with anammox sludge from a full scale deamonification sbr in germany the anammox process was performed as described previously by ziembińska buczyńska et al 17 antibiotics were fed to the sbrs along with a mineral medium based on van de graaf et al 18 that had been adapted to anammox bacteria requirements the concentration of ammonium and nitrite was regulated by adding nh4cl and nano2 respectively the total nitrogen concentration was 230 mg l 1 while other elements

biomass samples in a medium containing antibiotic at concentrations of 0 control and 0 001 mg l 1 for otc cip and cla were prepared in 125 ml anaerobic batch reactors the tests were stirred at 250 rpm initial substrate concentrations were 25 mg n nh4 l 1 and 30 mg n no2 l 1 as nh4cl and nano2 respectively and the average biomass concentration was 0 9 0 2 g vss l 1 the tests were conducted at 35 c and a ph of 7 5 adjusted using 10 hcl or 10 naoh samples from the batch test reactors were collected at 20 120 min intervals for n nh4 and n no2 concentration measurements while n no3 was calculated based on stoichiometry 2 3 epss extraction and determination the biomass samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to extract epss followed by supernatant removal phosphate buffered saline 1 ph

analysis while the remaining precipitate was used to measure vss levels the supernatant was analyzed for epss components including protein pn and polysaccharide ps the amounts of pn and ps were measured using the flint phenol method at 500 nm and the anthrone sulfuric acid method at 625 nm respectively 2 4 qpcr analysis quantitative pcr qpcr detected quantity changes of functional genes of

s test examined variance equalities based on preliminary statistical results the kruskal wallis test examined the significance of the differences between the relative gene abundance change in the presence of antibiotics dunn s test was conducted as a post hoc pairwise multiple comparison test to discern which pairs had significant differences dunn s test was further adjusted by the holm method in addition the shannon and simpson biodiversity index were calculated to examine microbial biodiversity in the collected samples spearman rank correlation was calculated between saas obtained in each reactor all calculations were conducted using ms excel 2013 and statistica 13 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 short term effects of otc cip and cla on the microbial activity short term test results of the anammox process conducted using 0 001 mg l 1 of otc cip and cla are shown in fig 2 relative activity of the anammox process was presented as a percentage of saa relative to the control without antibiotics addition those results showed that otc caused an increase of 7 1 in relative anammox activity while cip and cla caused slight decreases in anammox activity 8 4 and 3 2 respectively reports covering the effects of cip and cla on the anammox process are scarce however one study did investigate the effect of antibiotics in the same class erythromycin ery and norfloxacin nor belong to macrolide and fluoroquinolone classes respectively and were investigated by zhang et al 23 during short term experiments 4 h they observed decreases in anammox activity of 1 7 and 2 2 under ery and nor suppression 0 001 mg l 1 respectively similarly this study reports that cip which belongs to the fluoroquinolone class showed higher suppression of anammox than cla a macrolide sguanci et al 24 reported that doxycycline dox which belongs to the same class as otc had no impact on the anammox process in short term 24 h experiments at 5 and 10 mg l 1 noophan et al 25 reported that otc decreased total nitrogen removal efficiency from 74 73 to 33 48 22 15 at concentrations between 25 and 100 mg l 1 within 7 h moreover the half inhibitory concentration ic50 for otc was calculated as 517 5 mg l 1 in the batch test 26 however this inhibition concentration was several mg l 1 whereas in this study the trace concentration amount was much smaller 0 001 mg l 1 therefore otc inhibited the anammox process at concentrations above several mg l 1 the otc results suggested that suppression by this antibiotic at trace levels could activate some resistance mechanism which induced anammox stimulation zhang et al 27 reported that very low concentrations of sulfamethoxazole smx e g 0 1 mg l 1 stimulated up regulation of anammox functional genes hdh hzsa that suggests that under otc suppression an increase in anammox genes can be observed as a self protective mechanism that increases anammox activity moreover otc adsorbs onto the epss that protect against direct effects of the antibiotic on bacterial cells 27 this mechanism may play an important role in the short term protection of anammox bacteria 3 2 long term effects of otc cip and cla on anammox performance the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox systems suppressed by three antibiotics otc cip cla in 0 001 mg l 1 is shown in fig 3a nitrogen removal efficiency nre and fig 3b specific anammox activity saa all reactors were subjected to a similar nitrogen loading rate nlr with 0 115 kg the stabilities in the control reactor r otc and r cla were disturbed while the r cla reactor operated relatively stable with nre and saa reaching 62 4 6 37 and 0 058 0 06 kg n kg 1 vss d 1 respectively at days 2 9 and 17 in the control reactor r otc and r cla the maximum theoretical anammox nre 90 was reached 86 9 82 56 and 82 52 respectively while the nre in r cip did not exceed 70 15th operating day the deviation in the nitrogen removal efficiency may be associated with biomass adaptation or microbial community remodeling 21 anammox system start ups are characterized by endogenous denitrification which may reflect an increase in the nitrogen removal efficiency at the beginning of the experiment denitrification especially endogenous in anammox systems is characteristic of this process 17 the denitrification contribution is also analogous to the molecular analysis of functional genes the nirs and nirk genes in all reactors showed relatively high abundance during inoculation day 1 and maintained those values after antibiotic suppression day 30 described in section 3 3 comparing saa and nrr from the control reactor with reactors containing otc cip and cla there was no significant correlation p 0 05 between the reactors table s3 therefore implementing the anammox process had a more significant effect on anammox biomass and further adaptation to new conditions than the presence of antibiotics at 0 001 mg l 1 3 3 epss content microorganisms produce epss in response to stress in the presence of antibiotics 27 28 29 and affect biomass characteristics 30 proteins and polysaccharides are viewed as important among all epss components proteins pn and polysaccharides ps are hydrophobic and hydrophilic components within epss respectively lowering the pn ps ratio decreases the hydrophilicity and might reduce the flocculation of activated sludge 31 meng et al 32 suggested the pn ps ratio decrease could lead to sludge settling capacity reductions according to fig 4 the pn ps ratio increased in the control and r otc by 7 9 and 3 35 respectively but decreased in r cip and r cla by 8 0 and 10 5 respectively however the total epss production pn ps slightly decreased in the control by 1 4 while in sbrs with added otc cip and cla increased by 0 6 1 2 and 1 8 respectively it showed that initial exposure of streptomycin belonging to macrolide class stimulated epss production in the sludge 33 similar effects were described by zhang et al 27 where eps levels increased from 11 9 mg g 1 vss to 317 3 mg g 1 vss at treatment levels of 0 5 mg l 1 otc thus the production of epss was viewed as an important self protection mechanism against antibiotics moreover epss are the first barrier for a bacterial cell that directly contacts and interacts with antibiotics in activated sludge 29 the epss component responsible for antibiotic sorption is pn it provides an adsorption binding site via functional groups such as amine carboxyl hydroxyl group and hydrophobic regions 30 as previously reported by zhang et al 27 the presence of 0 5 mg l 1 otc increased the adsorption sites and was related to the pn ps ratio stronger hydrophobicity and greater adsorption site availability contributed to the higher pn ps ratio 27 30 and was observed in the current study for r otc thus sorption onto the pn fraction of epss may be an important part of the protective mechanism against antibiotics especially otc 3 4 variation of functional genes abundance the relative abundance of functional genes responsible for nitrogen transformation amoa nxra nirk nirs and hzo genes and integron 1 class inti1 were determined via qpcr using bacterial dna as a template all qpcr reactions were conducted at least in triplicate with efficiencies close to 1 0 the results are presented as the ratio of the specific reference gene to 16s rrna gene relative abundance gene the significance of the difference between relative genes abundance changes in the presence of these antibiotics was revealed by statistical methods table 2 as shown in fig 5 changes in amoa and nxra genes showed similar trends during the trials on day 1 the abundance of amoa and nxra in almost all reactors fed with antibiotics was higher compared to the control reactor amoa in the r otc reactor was the exception after the experiments concluded the abundance of both amoa and nxra genes in each reactor decreased moreover the abundances of amoa were higher than nxra in the operating sbrs reactor indicating a significant role of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob in the anammox biomass the occurrence of aob in anammox systems closely related to anammox bacteria has been previously confirmed 17 34 the presence of aob in anammox biomass is explained in two ways aob protects anammox bacteria against oxygen and produces nitrite or aob performs some anaerobic metabolism 17 35 36 however the relatively high abundance of the amoa gene commonly attributed to aob in wastewater treatment is also present in the nitrospira genus which undergoes complete nitrification in one step called comammox under anaerobic conditions 37 moreover nitrospira contains a full set of ammonium converting gene encoding enzymes ammonium monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr 37 therefore an abundance of amoa and nxra genes result in the occurrence of nitrospira in these systems and confirmed in metataxonomic analysis section 3 3 where the relative abundance of this genus in each reactor increased levels of hzo genes were the lowest of all investigated genes this was caused by inoculation to sbrs and anammox adaptation as shown in fig 5 the abundance of the hzo gene in the reactors fed with antibiotics decreased during the experimental period the abundance increased in the control reactor the difference in the change of hzo gene abundance in the control reactors and reactors with antibiotics addition was statistically significant p 0 05 table 3 these results suggest the presence of 0 001 mg l 1 otc cip and cla may suppress anammox bacteria which showed low enzymatic activity during the adaptation period zhang et al 27 compared the effects of otc and smx from 0 to 1 mg l 1 on anammox functional genes hzsa hdh and reported that both genes were more sensitive on smx than otc from 0 1 0 5 mg l 1 however they also proved that hdh was sensitive to a low otc dose 0 1 mg l 1 rather than a higher dose this suggested that trace concentrations of otc 0 001 mg l 1 may have an adverse effect on the hzo gene other studies showed that macrolide spiramycin at 1 5 mg l 1 did not lead to significant changes in the abundance of hzsa hdh and metabolic processes of anammox bacteria were not disturbed by long term exposure 38 the abundances of nirk and nirs were relatively similar order of magnitude on both the first and last day of the experiment in all reactors tested high abundances of both nirk and nirs in anammox systems may be due to using a carbon source derived from the decomposition of dead biomass by denitrifiers in a process called endogenous denitrification as shown in fig 5 nirs present a higher abundance than nirk this result suggested that denitrifiers in the biomass preferred the nirs pathway over nirk similar results in anammox systems have been previously reported by banach wiśniewska et al 39 the prevalence of the nirs gene abundance over nirk may be attributed to fact that nirk is cu copper dependent while nirs is cytochrome cd 1 containing 40 therefore bacteria utilizing the nirk pathway require cu limited in the laboratory scale anammox system from results obtained for both nirs and nirk the antibiotics used had a negligible impact on denitrification genes integron integrase 1 class gene inti1 has been proposed as a marker for anthropogenic arg pollution mainly due to significant linkage with args and rapid response to diverse environmental stresses 41 moreover a positive correlation was found in the relationship between inti1 and abundance of args in aquatic environments 42 43 which accentuates the need to study inti1 genes relative to args in the present study the control and reactors fed with antibiotics maintained constant levels 1 4 10 4 2 7 10 5 except for r otc which reached 9 7 10 4 towards the end of the experimental period a significant correlation p 0 05 between the abundance of inti1 and genes targeting tetracycline resistance tetc tetx was found in the anammox system suppressed by otc at 2 mg l 1 15 therefore there may be some linkage between inti1 and tet genes on the other hand inti1 integrated and expressed more than 100 types of args by genes cassette 44 though no tet genes were detected in any gene cassette by inti1 45 however previous studies revealed that inti1 coexists with tetc in conjugative plasmid which made them easier to transfer 46 47 3 5 variation of args nine primers were used to detect args in these experiments four primers encoding args for otc tetx tetc tetm tetw three primers for cip resistance qnrb qnrb4 qnrs and two primers for cla resistance mpha mphb moreover all primers were used to detect args in the control reactor as shown in table s4 only six args were detected three of which were targeted to otc tetx tetc tetw two targeted to cip qnrb4 qnrs and one targeted cla mpha as shown in fig 6 the number of each detected gene was expressed as a ratio of the functional genes to the 16s rrna gene relative genes abundance those results show that the relative abundance of each arg targeted otc increased after long term antibiotic feeding while the control reactor saw a decrease excluding tetw which slightly increased each otc args induced a different resistance mechanism efflux pump tetc ribosomal protection protein tetw and enzymatic modification tetx however the dominant resistance mechanism was efflux pump and enzymatic modification furthermore the highest increase was observed in tetc during long term testing zhang et al 38 obtained the overall absolute abundance of tetx which was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than the other otc args tetc tetg and tetm it is worth noting they used a higher concentration of otc 0 1 mg l 1 than in this study similar effects were reported by zhang et al 15 and shi et al 48 where the abundance of tetx far exceeded that of tetc under otc pressure at 1 0 2 0 mg l 1 therefore anammox bacteria use different protective mechanisms depending on the environmental concentration of the antibiotic the relatively low abundance of tetw genes may stem from the anammox process conducted in the laboratory condition using a mineral medium tetw is recognized as a typical marker for tetracycline args and is unique to wwtps and livestock 43 therefore its presence in a laboratory system can be marginal the relative abundances of both qnrb4 and qnrs increased slightly in the reactor fed with cip from 4 4 10 5 to 7 69 10 5 and from 7 4 10 8 to 6 7 10 7 respectively while the abundance in the control reactor decreased from 1 16 10 4 to 3 95 10 6 qnrb4 and from 3 78 10 7 to 3 25 10 8 qnrs which indicated that cip feeding induced qnrb4 and qnrs both qnrb4 and qnrs are protective genes and protect dna gyrase from inhibition by quinolones qnrs has become increasingly prevalent in anthropogenically influenced environments 49 50 the presence of qnrs genes in the laboratory system fed with a mineral medium was validated by ślipko et al 51 where the relative abundance of qnrs fluctuated over time spanning from below 10 5 copies 16s rrna gene to above 10 2 copies 16s rrna gene between 0 0001 and 0 1 mg l 1 of cip however these results were obtained for a conventional nitrification denitrification system in which the microorganisms have a higher growth rate than anammox bacteria 52 therefore the transfer of args can be faster on the other hand the relative abundance of mpha decreased in the reactor fed with cla from 7 45 10 4 to 9 0 10 5 and decreased in the control reactor from 8 9 10 4 to 2 2 10 5 zhang et al 38 suggested that mpha might be more susceptible to macrolide antibiotics in environmental samples due to a resistance mechanism the presence of the mpha gene in the bacteria genome induced ability of bacteria chemical modification of antibiotics caused the degradation or replacement of the active group by synthesis of oxidoreductase 53 therefore a reduction in the relative abundance of this gene was observed zhang et al 23 concluded that it was not easy to induce args by nor in the anammox system although nor at 0 001 mg l 1 suppressed the anammox system they did not detect that genes targeted nor resistance on the other hand this study showed that cip at 0 001 mg l 1 induced development of genes targeted for quinolones resistance therefore these results suggest that cip more readily induces nor resistance to quinolones 3 6 microbial community changes a 16s rdna based high throughput sequencing technique determined the microbial community composition changes during long term exposure of otc cip and cla the sequence numbers otu of the eight samples were 69 027 control 1 76 350 control 30 48 991 r otc 1 70 008 r otc 30 69 311 r cip 1 83 064 r cip 30 48 004 r cla 1 and 75 487 r cla 30 the otu was defined as the sequence with the similarity 95 the same out values co existed in the four samples day 1 and four samples day 30 were 37 and 42 respectively as shown in fig s1 these results indicated a microbial community change occurred under antibiotic suppression based on otus values the shannon and simpson biodiversity indexes were calculated fig s2 for each reactor both indexes slightly decrease at the end of the experiment planctomycetes proteobacteria and bateroidetes were the dominant phyla in this study on day 1 fig 7 similar dominant communities were observed by cheng et al 54 under otc and cu nanoparticle stresses however after day 30 as the main phyla functioned proteobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospira such a high abundance of proteobacteria was similar to conventional nitrification denitrification systems in which this phylum dominates 55 however the occurrence of proteobacteria in this study can traced to the presence of death cells of bacteria in anammox biomass as a result of the implementation period on the other hand it was reported that proteobacteria readily utilizes antibiotics like otc as a carbon source 56 therefore antibiotic addition may improve the conditions for this phylum on day 1 plantomycetes accounted for 21 28 control 19 56 r otc 21 27 r cip and 17 42 r cla in the end significant changes were observed where relative abundances dropped to 4 75 control 9 84 r otc 3 59 r cip and 12 00 r cla during the experiment the third phylum transformed from platomycetes to nitrospira reached 25 27 control 11 33 r otc 33 13 r cip and 13 31 r cla up from 9 01 13 05 13 16 and 14 02 respectively previous studies reported that nitrospira is relatively abundant in anammox systems 17 52 57 chloroflexi was quite abundant in these systems and the abundances of these bacteria increased from 8 1 control 7 9 r otc 7 6 r cip and 8 37 r cla to 9 59 9 6 12 03 and 11 45 chloroflexi exists in technical and lab scale anammox reactors and utilize epss produced by anammox bacteria in anaerobic systems 54 the taxonomic results at the genus level are shown in fig 7 bar chart the major genera of anammox bacteria in each reactor were candidatus brocadia and candidatus jettenia whose abundances dropped during the trial period for candidatus brocadia it dropped from 7 0 control 5 6 r otc 5 9 r cip and 5 7 r cla to 1 1 1 3 0 8 and 2 2 respectively while for candidatus jettenia it dropped from 5 6 control 2 3 r otc 2 6 r cip and 1 0 r cla to 0 2 0 6 0 2 and 0 9 because the highest drop in anammox bacteria was observed in the control reactor it suggested these changes were caused by remodeling of the anammox biomass community after inoculation it is worth noting that previous studies reported that candidatus brocadia adapts to certain antibiotics like sulfamethazine at concentrations below 7 mg l 1 58 this also suggested that some adaptation mechanism may have taken place towards cla which had the lowest decrease of all reactors in candidatus brocadia abundance by 3 5 despite the decrease in anammox bacteria abundance in the control this was the only reactor in which the hzo gene abundance fig 5 increased this may be due to unclassified planctomycetes with an abundance of 11 29 in the control reactor which may exhibit enzymatic activity the role of unclassified planctomycetes in anammox systems was also pointed out by tomaszewski et al 52 as shown in fig s3 the dominant genera were clustered into two main groups where both candidatus brocadia and candidatus jettenia demonstrated a small distance between nodes showing similarity between the data sets obtained for each one significant abundance increases were observed for nitrospira nitrospirae phylum which belongs to nob and converts nitrite into nitrate however in 2015 it was reported that nitrospira performed both stages of nitrification 59 this suggested that nitrospira helps anammox bacteria with nitrogen removal under anaerobic conditions similar results were reported by tomaszewski et al 52 where nitrospira supported anammox bacteria under reduced graphene oxide rgo suppression moreover increasing the abundance of this genus in the system during trials could lead to a suspicion that nitrospira was more resistant to antibiotic suppression than anammox bacteria in contrast zhang et al 60 reported that nitrospira was present in concentrations much lower than anammox bacteria under ery suppression nitrosomonas and denitratisoma representing aob and denitrifiers respectively were detected with lower abundance than primary anammox bacteria genera in the reactors studied moreover both nitrosomonas and denitratisoma were inhibited throughout the experiment zhang et al 60 documented that the presence of these genera had an impact on anammox performance deviation under ery furthermore for nor at 0 001 mg l 1 an increase was observed 0 57 while ery 0 001 mg l 1 caused slight variation 23 4 conclusions short and long term effects on anammox performance including production of epss variation of functional genes and arg abundances as well as community structure were analyzed nitrogen removal performance showed that antibiotics 0 001 mg l 1 had no significant impact on the anammox process each antibiotic decreased the biodiversity of anammox biomass all antibiotics decreased the abundance of the hzo gene both otc and cip increased args tetc and tetw for otc qnrb4 and qnrs for cip in the anammox system while args targeted cla mpha decreased during anammox testing the antibiotics at trace concentrations had negative impacts on anammox at the gene level and had negligible effects on nitrogen removal mainly due to co existing with other nitrogen cycle bacteria in the biomass furthermore the antibiotics induced development of anammox bacteria resistance via production of eps and increased args abundance further studies involving the effects of otc cip and cla on the anammox process should focus on elucidating the mechanism of resistance gene transfer in the anammox biomass and investigating all the protective mechanisms of anammox bacteria including regulation of gene expression and production

graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords calcium alginate dairy wastewater biocatalyst lipase protease 1 introduction the dairy industry involves wastewater with high amounts of organic compounds such as protein and lipid 1 the characterization of the dairy wastewater depends on the production process and raw dairy materials for example wastewater generated from milk processing and cheese production have a chemical oxygen demand cod of 3000 and 50 000 mg l 1 respectively 2 generally treatment of the dairy wastewaters have some problems with a high level of proteins and lipids resulting in a change in ph value and high amounts of cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod 4 different technologies have been proposed for dairy wastewater treatment such as coagulation flocculation membrane treatment electrochemical and adsorption 4 7 unfortunately the proposed techniques have some drawbacks such as production of high operating cost large volume of sludge the high consumption of materials and low treatment efficiency on the other hand the biological dairy wastewater treatments have been proposed as a suitable technique concerning their cost and environmentally friendly characterization in the biological wastewater treatment the microorganisms with high enzyme activities can quickly decompose organic material into their basic structure and make it available to microorganisms 8 in this aim some microorganisms can produce efficient enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions for the bioremediation or production of various products 9 the lipase and protease have an essential role in the dairy wastewater treatment processes 10 various microorganisms such as fungi yeast and bacteria could be produced lipase and protease 11 lipase and protease are classified as a biocatalyst that could cause cleavage lipids and protein to readily biodegradable compounds such as fatty acids glyceride and amino acids in recent years the microbial electrochemical system is presented as an applied technology for simultaneous wastewater treatment and production of electricity 7 in the microbial electrochemical system applying a direct electric current could stimulate the microorganisms and enhance enzyme production 12 13 in these processes an adequate distance creates between the microorganisms and the electron source utilizing of free bacteria and enzymes as biocatalysts sometimes present some drawbacks such as limitation in the multiple reuses low stability in the field application and unwanted byproducts productions the immobilization of enzymes or microorganisms is a solution for the solving of the problem 14 moreover immobilization has been presented as an efficient method to promote some enzyme properties such as activity stability selectivity specificity and resistance to inhibitors 15 immobilized cells have been used in many processes such as degradation of toxic substances biotransformation biosensors and production of extracellular enzymes and antibiotics 14 15 also the microorganism immobilization presents some advantages in the bioremediation process compared to suspended microbial cells such as fewer problem in the biomass separation higher efficiency improved resistance to environmental stresses the inhibitory effect of toxic compounds and the reduced spread of microorganisms in the environment the polymer of calcium alginate is commonly used for microencapsulation and immobilization technique 16 generally cross linking between divalent cations such as calcium and α l guluronic acid of the alginate provides a solid for supporting media the main reason for its wide use is lower cost for using as a supporting matrix easier handling easier cell separation non toxic properties higher operational stability and simple preparation 16 the characterization of immobilized biocatalyst on supports such as ca alginate depends on various operating factors and it need some optimization 17 according to the literature review there are no references in the scientific literature that specifically examine the effect of immobilized bacteria in the calcium alginate beads to improve protease and lipase production as the main biocatalysts for dairy wastewater treatment using a microbial electrochemical system hence the objective of present study was to investigate the performance of immobilized

alginate in this study we were immobilized pseudomonas aeruginosa on the calcium alginate to improve the dairy wastewater treatment in the microbial electrochemical system generally the cell immobilization is proposed to obtain higher biodegradation efficiency improve enzyme production enhance tolerance of microorganism to environmental stresses and the inhibitory effect of toxic compounds 23 24 according to the obtained results by immobilization of bacteria on the calcium alginate lipase and protease production increases the optimal values of 47 89 and 193 81 were obtained using 40 volume of calcium alginate pseudomonas aeruginosa for lipase and protease activities respectively fig 2 the optimum value percentage of calcium alginate in the bioreactor were obtained 40 fig 3 moreover the cod removal rates of 95 67 69 54 and 45 16 were obtained for calcium alginate pseudomonas aeruginosa pseudomonas aeruginosa and calcium alginate using 500 mg l 1 initial cod concentration of the dairy wastewater the lipase and protease enzymes are multi component including some subunits containing fe s cluster s and active cofactors heme s they contain a pyrroloquinoline quinone prosthetic group or a flavin adenine dinucleotide the substrate reacts with the provided sites the cofactors are parts which play important role in the transfer of electrons to an electron acceptor compound from a prosthetic groups such as ubiquinone in a bacterial membrane the enzyme is provided a channel that transfer the electrons in the system 25 various types of bacteria produce electrical currents due to the periplasmic enzymes catalytic action for specific substrates such as fructose glucose nicotinic acid and glycerol and ethanol 25 it has been evidenced that immobilization of bacteria could be decreased the start up time of bioelectrochemical systems 26 the immobilization of bacteria could decrease the electrochemical resistance because higher transfer of electrons from the bacterial cells to the electrode one of the main advantages of immobilization in a microbial electrochemical system is improving the anode potential for energy during intracellular electron transfer 27 it was reported that the pseudomonas sp could be a strong and suitable strain for bioremediation of various wastewaters such as dairy wastewater 28 in this regard the dairy wastewater acts as a source including a large amount of protein rich material that can be biologically bio remediated into lower biodegradable products immobilized pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced the dairy wastewater treatment time using the microbial electrochemical system from 12 h to 4 h the lipase enzyme activity was increased from 30 17 to 47 89 iu l and the protease enzyme activity was increased from 165 iu l to 193 81 umol ml in the presence of 40 v v immobilized pseudomonas aeruginosa fig 2 calcium alginate can increase the rate of active bacterial alginate bead has been proposed for immobilization because of the good separation non toxic material high stability simple handling and low cost moreover the alginate beads as a high performance immobilization media were reported by various researchers 29 the obtained results show that in the immobilized cells enzyme production is higher compared to suspended bacteria because immobilization presents higher activities the main advantages of immobilization are high stability reusability the possibility of regeneration and scale up 30 32 it was reported that immobilization of pseudomonas sp klm9 at the sodium alginate could improve the l glutaminase production in immobilization the fermentation time was decreased to 36 h 33 it was shown that calcium alginate immobilized bacteria have 21 enzyme production 34 in this study the lipase productions were obtained 138 and 47 89 iu l 1 using industrial and synthetic wastewaters respectively with similar results the proteases in synthetic and industrial wastewaters were 57 66 and 193 81 umol ml 1 respectively 3 2 effect of initial ph and reaction time among the operating parameters ph value play an essential role in microorganisms physiological activities and the release of their enzymes in this study the initial ph of 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were considered we investigated the effects of the initial ph values at a cod concentration of 1200 mg l 1 and different currents of 4 10 ma fig 4 shows the protease and lipase activites and final ph in the bioreactor under various initial ph values the protease and lipase activities increased from ph 5 0 to 6 0 as the obtained results show 193 71 iu ml 1 and 47 89 u ml 1 protease and lipase were produced at ph 6 0 8 ma induced current and 1200 mg l 1 cod respectively at the ph 6 0 maximum lipase and protease activities were achieved and then with increase in ph to 8 0 the enzyme activities decreased moreover the final ph shows that the bio electrochemical system can cause increase in ph however as shown in fig 4 initial ph adjusted to 6 was better than other ph because the enzyme activities are maximum and the best treatment has obtained suganthi was reported that the best protease production occurred at ph 8 0 35 similarly ph 7 0 was reported for the protease production from bacillus snr01 36 the bacillus spp the protease enzyme produced the protease enzyme at the optimum ph from 7 0 to 11 34 as shown in fig 4a and b the lipase and protease activity increased and then decreased with increasing time the highest enzyme production time was obtained at 4 h the variation of ph value during in the experiments were presented in table 2 generally each bacterium has an optimal ph value for better physiological activities the ph of the environment significantly affects microbial cells because some microorganisms have no mechanism for adjusting their internal ph value the decrease or increase in ph value could be affected by microbial growth moreover ph plays a role in enzyme activity the ph could be affected by ionic and hydrogen bonds which are important to enzyme shape and enzyme activity by ionizing amino acids in a protein the shape of the three dimensional proteins changes and the enzymes are inactivated moreover due to the substrate s charge properties the substrate cannot bind to the active sites and cannot be catalyzed some reasons have been proposed for the effect of ph on bacteria such as effect on the distribution of carbon dioxide availability of carbon as an energy source for the bacteria and directly affect on the physiological characters of cells and variation in the trace metals availability generally ph value in the cathode electrode increases and the anode electrode decreases in the electrochemical reactor that may lead to the increased hydrogen ion concentration in the anode electrode and the increase of hydroxyl ion concentration in the cathode electrode hence the anodic region is acidic and the catholic region is alkaline generally the electrical conductivity represents the ability of electron transfer in an aqueous media the increasing of ion concentrations in aqueous solutions under the effect of the electric field leads to an increase in conductivity with time and it could change the ph value 37 3 3 effect of electrical current the optimum electrical current has positive effects on the physiology and behavior of bacteria and their enzymatic activity 36 this study showed that the lipase and protease enzymes activity increased in the microbial electrochemical system with increasing of the applied initial electrical current from 4 to 8 ma and decreased at the 10 ma fig 5 presents the relationship between lipase and protease activities and the applied current the protease and lipase activities were reached to 193 81 umol ml and 47 89 iu l in the 8 ma electrical current at 4 h respectively moreover the cod removal rates of 95 67 89 67 and 75 87 were obtained for 500 mg l 1 750 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 initial cod concentrations respectively the enzyme activities were decreased with increasing of the electrical current upper than 8 ma we have similar results for lipase activities in our last reported studies 20 it was shown that induced current is an effective parameter on laccase production using graphite electrode they were reported that utilizing a direct current of 8 ma has significant effects on the laccase enzyme activity the laccase activity was increase in the anodic electrode but at the same time it was suppress in the cathode the electric charge surface of laccase was subsitute when exposed to an electric field at this condition some laccases transfer to the anode 3 4 morphology studies the micrographs obtained from calcium alginate pseudomonas aeruginosa have presented bacteria s spatial location and proliferation in the calsium alginate the fesem micrographs of immobilized pseudomonas aeruginosa are shown in fig 6 the results show that the uniform dispersion of bacteria in the calcium alginate beads were obtained sem micrographs of the calcium alginate beads were used to determine the arrangement of bacteria in the alginate beads the pseudomonas aeruginosa were found in beds uniformly dispersed within the matrix fig 6 based on the obtained micrographs there was evidence of uniform dispersion of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the cesium alginate bead in the virgin alginate beads large voids in the beads were observed and the bacteria dispersed on the surface of the voids 4 conclusions the combination of immobilized pseudomonas aeruginosa on the calcium alginate bead and electrical current in the microbial electrochemical system can improve the efficiency of protease and lipase enzyemes for dairy wastewater treatment this study offers a new attempt to extend enzyme activities the results showed that with the increase in the applied initial current from 4 to 8 ma enzymes activity increased in microbial electrochemical system while higher than 8 ma enzymes activity declined immobilization of pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced enzyme time of production from 12 to 4 h moreover the studies suggested that the application of bio electro reactors include immobilized bacteria could be used for reduction and oxidation treatments dairy wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

various researchers 29 the obtained results show that in the immobilized cells enzyme production is higher compared to suspended bacteria because immobilization presents higher activities the main advantages of immobilization are high stability reusability the possibility of regeneration and scale up 30 32 it was reported that immobilization of pseudomonas sp klm9 at the sodium alginate could improve the l glutaminase production in immobilization the fermentation time was decreased to 36 h 33 it was shown that calcium alginate immobilized bacteria have 21 enzyme production 34 in this study the lipase productions were obtained 138 and 47 89 iu l 1 using industrial and synthetic wastewaters respectively with similar results the proteases in synthetic and industrial wastewaters were 57 66 and 193 81 umol ml 1 respectively 3 2 effect of initial ph and reaction time among the operating parameters ph value play an essential role in microorganisms physiological activities and the release of their enzymes in this study the initial ph of 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were considered we investigated the effects of the initial ph values at a cod concentration of 1200 mg l 1 and different currents of 4 10 ma fig 4 shows the protease and lipase activites and final ph in the bioreactor under various initial ph values the protease and lipase activities increased from ph 5 0 to 6 0 as the obtained results show 193 71 iu ml 1 and 47 89 u ml 1 protease and lipase were produced at ph 6 0 8 ma induced current and 1200 mg l 1 cod respectively at the ph 6 0 maximum lipase and protease activities were achieved and then with increase in ph to 8 0 the enzyme activities decreased moreover the final ph shows that the bio electrochemical system can cause increase in ph however as shown in fig 4 initial ph adjusted to 6 was better than other ph because the enzyme activities are maximum and the best treatment has obtained suganthi was reported that the best protease production occurred at ph 8 0 35 similarly ph 7 0 was reported for the protease production from bacillus snr01 36 the bacillus spp the protease enzyme produced the protease enzyme at the optimum ph from 7 0 to 11 34 as shown in fig 4a and b the lipase and protease activity increased and then decreased with increasing time the highest enzyme production time was obtained at 4 h the variation of ph value during in the experiments were presented in table 2 generally each bacterium has an optimal ph value for better physiological activities the ph of the environment significantly affects microbial cells because some microorganisms have no mechanism for adjusting their internal ph value the decrease or increase in ph value could be affected by microbial growth moreover ph plays a role in enzyme activity the ph could be affected by ionic and hydrogen bonds which are important to enzyme shape and enzyme activity by ionizing amino acids in a protein the shape of the three dimensional proteins changes and the enzymes are inactivated moreover due to the substrate s charge properties the substrate cannot bind to the active sites and cannot be catalyzed some reasons have been proposed for the effect of ph on bacteria such as effect on the distribution of carbon dioxide availability of carbon as an energy source for the bacteria and directly affect on the physiological characters of cells and variation in the trace metals availability generally ph value in the cathode electrode increases and the anode electrode decreases in the electrochemical reactor that may lead to the increased hydrogen ion concentration in the anode electrode and the increase of hydroxyl ion concentration in the cathode electrode hence the anodic region is acidic and the catholic region is alkaline generally the electrical conductivity represents the ability of electron transfer in an aqueous media the increasing of ion concentrations in aqueous solutions under the effect of the electric field leads to an increase in conductivity with time and it could change the ph value 37 3 3 effect of electrical current the optimum electrical current has positive effects on the physiology and behavior of bacteria and their enzymatic activity 36 this study showed that the lipase and protease enzymes activity increased in the microbial electrochemical system with increasing of the applied initial electrical current from 4 to 8 ma and decreased at the 10 ma fig 5 presents the relationship between lipase and protease activities and the applied current the protease and lipase activities were reached to 193 81 umol ml and 47 89 iu l in the 8 ma electrical current at 4 h respectively moreover the cod removal rates of 95 67 89 67 and 75 87 were obtained for 500 mg l 1 750 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 initial cod concentrations respectively the enzyme activities were decreased with increasing of the electrical current upper than 8 ma we have similar results for lipase activities in our last reported studies 20 it was shown that induced current is an effective parameter on laccase production using graphite electrode they were reported that utilizing a direct current of 8 ma has significant effects on the laccase enzyme activity the laccase activity was increase in the anodic electrode but at the same time it was suppress in the cathode the electric charge surface of laccase was subsitute when exposed to an electric field at this condition some laccases transfer to the anode 3 4 morphology studies the micrographs obtained from calcium alginate pseudomonas aeruginosa have presented bacteria s spatial location and proliferation in the calsium alginate the fesem micrographs of immobilized pseudomonas aeruginosa are shown in fig 6 the results show that the uniform dispersion of bacteria in the calcium alginate beads were obtained sem micrographs of the calcium alginate beads were used to determine the arrangement of bacteria in the alginate beads the pseudomonas aeruginosa were found in beds uniformly dispersed within the matrix fig 6 based on the obtained micrographs there was evidence of uniform dispersion of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the cesium alginate bead in the virgin alginate beads large voids in the beads were observed and the bacteria dispersed on the surface of the voids 4 conclusions the combination of immobilized pseudomonas aeruginosa on the calcium alginate bead and electrical current in the microbial electrochemical system can improve the efficiency of protease and lipase enzyemes for dairy wastewater treatment this study offers a new attempt to extend enzyme activities the results showed that with the increase in the applied initial current from 4 to 8 ma enzymes activity increased in microbial electrochemical system while higher than 8 ma enzymes activity declined immobilization of pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced enzyme time of production from 12 to 4 h moreover the studies suggested that the application of bio electro reactors include immobilized bacteria could be used for reduction and oxidation treatments dairy wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13134,in a context of increasing water scarcity it is essential to ensure an integrated watershed management savings in the consumption of water as a finite resource and improve the performance of wastewater treatment plants to guarantee the quality of treated effluents therefore advanced technologies for tertiary wastewater treatment have been widely studied in recent decades these treatments have been reviewed over the years mainly providing comparisons from a technical perspective however there is a lack of a holistic evaluation considering environmental and economic aspects together with the aforementioned technical aspects in this review treatment alternatives for micropollutant and pathogen abatement have been identified based on technologies implemented on a large scale ozonation ultraviolet treatment adsorption on activated carbon or membrane filtration as well as those treatments in the process of implementation such as electrochemical fenton based or photocatalytic techniques thus a systematic bibliographic search was performed considering works applying pilot and full scale equipment leaving lab scale results out of the analysis the description of each process allowed the identification of the technical feasibility operating costs and associated environmental impacts providing a comparative assessment that will help decision making in the development and application of the different technologies the benchmarking results reveal that the selected treatment should be chosen based on the source and specific pollutants present in the wastewater as there is no single solution for the treatment of micropollutants and pathogens in addition recommendations are presented for the publication of reliable process related data to facilitate comparison between different technologies and treatment scenarios keywords review tertiary treatment lca economic evaluation emerging pollutants 1 introduction population growth implies an increasing demand for natural resources such as water energy and food 1 in this context one of the most serious problems to be faced is the increasing water scarcity 2 this concept is defined as the imbalance between water demand and availability and is related to unbalanced consumption of water reserves declining quality of drinking water due to contamination or saline intrusion of surface waters and aquifers and increased periods of drought 3 the importance of access to safe drinking water and sanitation is highlighted and embedded in goal 6 of the united nations sustainable development goals 4 in order to address the problems related to water pollution large investments have been made in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 5 although wwtps are capable of removing organic matter and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous the occurrence of organic micropollutants omps such as personal care products pesticides endocrine disrupting chemicals or pharmaceuticals in different environmental compartments requires changes in the design and operation of wastewater facilities to ensure their removal and the quality of the treated effluents 6 7 as part of the implementation of the water framework directive the european union defined a list of priority substances that could pose a risk to the environment and human health the watch list reported in 2015 included two pharmaceuticals natural hormones three macrolide antibiotics pesticides an ultraviolet filter and an antioxidant subsequently three additional substances were added in 2018 an insecticide and two antibiotics with the primary objective of omps removal some tertiary treatment technologies such as membrane filtration or adsorption on activated carbon allow the retention of omps from the wastewater stream however the concentrated flow and the spent adsorbent have to be conveniently managed in a downstream process increasing the complexity of these techniques 8 the possibility of implementing advanced oxidation processes aops based on non specific oxidation mechanisms 9 such as ozonation or uv radiation are options that have had variable success since their large scale operation involves high operating costs due to their high energy requirements or lower kinetic rates beyond organic micropollutants special attention should be also paid to contamination by heavy metals which are generally classified as inorganic micropollutant as they are present in treated effluents in trace concentrations contamination due to heavy metals can occur naturally caused by the entrainment of geological material into surface waters although most heavy metal pollution has been determined to be anthropogenic deriving from the use of pesticides and fungicides as or pigments as cd cr cu pb ni as well as from the metallurgical as cd hg petrochemical cd pb or pyrotechnical as sectors 10 in this review pathogen removal is also considered for benchmarking since tertiary treatments are widely used as methods for pathogen abatement 11 the presence of pathogens is especially relevant in urban hospital livestock and agricultural wastewater since the release of microorganisms into water bodies contributes to the spread of pathogens and antibiotic resistances several review articles have recently been published on the benefits and drawbacks of advanced tertiary treatments for wastewater polishing mainly focusing on the technological aspects of treatments for instance experts from nereus cost action analyzed the best available technologies for water reuse for crop irrigation considering ozonation activated carbon adsorption chemical disinfectants uv radiation advanced oxidation processes and membrane filtration 12 the conclusion of the expert group is that a single advanced treatment method is not sufficient to minimize the release of chemicals of emerging concern and antibiotic resistant microorganisms luo et al analyzed the removal efficiency of the selected micropollutants in 14 countries and regions analyzing different tertiary systems such as coagulation flocculation activated carbon adsorption advanced oxidation processes nanofiltration reverse osmosis and membrane bioreactors 13 rizzo et al analyzed consolidated versus new tertiary treatment methods concluding that the lack of comparative research between the two categories complicates the evaluation of the most suitable and cost effective solution for the treatment of emerging contaminants 14 bui et al performed a multicriteria assessment of advanced treatment technologies for micropollutants removal including very brief references to environmental considerations and only including some of the available tertiary treatments i e adsorption ozonation uv h2o2 membrane processes and membrane bioreactors 15 the analyzed reviews are mainly focused on the technical aspects lacking the economic and environmental perspectives the search for new technological alternatives must meet the following objectives technological feasibility in the construction and operation of the equipment operational efficiency and reliability and reduction of environmental impacts and costs based on the score in each of the aforementioned sections decision making will be better supported by evidence and contrastable data 16 in accordance with european directives environmental and socioeconomic factors including consideration of human health must be considered in the assessment of advanced technologies in this sense the environmental impacts associated with tertiary treatments can be elucidated using the internationally standardized life cycle assessment lca methodology considering the environmental approach pesqueira et al conducted a literature review solely on the application of lca in tertiary wastewater treatment however the scope of the review focuses on the removal of priority substances and pollutants of emerging concern mentioned in european legislation including a total of 18 papers 17 in this study the focus was further extended to a total of 40 papers dealing with lca in tertiary treatments in consequence the main objective of this keyword based literature review is to perform a holistic analysis of the main technological developments in tertiary treatments from a sustainability perspective including not only efficiency variables but also environmental impacts and cost estimation the key aspects of the technologies were identified and evaluated for pilot and full scale studies considering technical and sustainability approaches concluding that the combination of multiple treatment processes is essential to meet the effluent requirements moreover the use of lca methodology as a powerful tool for decision making can highlight specific hotspots of the technologies complementing the information provided by economical and technological evaluation accordingly the main challenge is to emphasize the key data of each technology considering a joint technical environmental and economic approach providing useful information about the main drawbacks of present studies and desirable targets for future research 2 bibliographic search methodology the literature search was performed using the search tool provided by the scopus database in march 2021 the selection of manuscripts addressing the efficiency of tertiary wastewater treatments for the removal of micropollutants under technological economic and environmental criteria was conducted considering the scope of the review the search was limited to the technologies applied to wastewater treatment including the keywords wastewater treatment or waste water treatment in the search string in addition since the goal of tertiary treatments is the removal of micropollutants heavy metals and pathogens these words and their relevant abbreviations were considered in the formulation of search parameters by including their respective keywords for this purpose the search procedure used in the literature review is summarized in fig 1 along with the specific keywords and boolean operators tertiary treatments were classified into seven distinct groups to facilitate the search process i e ozonation ultraviolet catalyst based pressure driven activated carbon adsorption electrochemical and irradiation treatments moreover the results were filtered and reduced considering their publication after 2010 written in english and in a final step of publication the obtained results applying each step are presented in the table s1 in the electronic support material esm 1 the analysis of environmental indicators estimated by the lca methodology have been also analyzed performing a complementary search using specific keywords as life cycle or lca tertiary treatments were classified into seven distinct groups to facilitate the search process i e ozonation ultraviolet catalyst based pressure driven activated carbon adsorption electrochemical and irradiation treatments moreover the results were filtered and reduced considering their publication after 2010 written in english and in a final step of publication the obtained results applying each step are presented in the table s1 in the electronic support material esm 1 the analysis of environmental indicators estimated by the lca methodology have been also analyzed performing a complementary search using specific keywords as life cycle or lca the results of the bibliographic search are compiled in esm 2 and esm 3 in the supplementary information esm 2 includes the bibliographic information of all studies analyzed after the second refining step along with their basic bibliographic data while esm 3 presents a standardized table with the technoeconomic data extracted from the selected studies focusing in micropollutant removal and operational conditions the results of the bibliographic search are compiled in esm 2 and esm 3 in the supplementary information esm 2 includes the bibliographic information of all studies analyzed after the second refining step along with their basic bibliographic data while esm 3 presents a standardized table with the technoeconomic data extracted from the selected studies focusing in micropollutant removal and operational conditions 3 bibliometric analysis the bibliometric analysis includes all the results after the manual refinement obtained from scopus using the methodology explained above these papers have been taken into account for the technological and economic analysis performed during this review and the keywords were extracted and analyzed according to their occurrence and relationships as shown in fig 2 to clarify the data and homogenize the results the substitution of keywords by synonyms or abbreviations was conducted considering the formation of clusters involving keywords with high similarity esm 4 the bibliometric analysis includes all the results after the manual refinement obtained from scopus using the methodology explained above these papers have been taken into account for the technological and economic analysis performed during this review and the keywords were extracted and analyzed according to their occurrence and relationships as shown in fig 2 to clarify the data and homogenize the results the substitution of keywords by synonyms or abbreviations was conducted considering the formation of clusters involving keywords with high similarity esm 4 in view of the results the keywords can be classified into four groups considering the main topic addressed i generic keywords this group formed by wastewater treatment tertiary treatments wastewater reuse and domestic wastewater terms that represent the target of the findings and the definition of the field of study ii target compound the most repeated keywords were pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps organic micropollutants omps compounds of emerging concern cecs and antibiotics abs and represent the main target compounds evaluated iii technologies this group encompasses the different technologies used for tertiary wastewater treatment such as filtration ozonation uv or aops and iv treatment effectiveness this group includes the methods carried out for the evaluation of the technologies such as removal removal efficiency by products identification or toxicity fig 2 allows tertiary treatments to be classified between large scale applied technologies and more innovative processes and these trends are represented in the diagram focusing on the wastewater treatment circle and its relationships this keyword usually appears together with adsorption techniques as granulated activated carbon or powdered activated carbon gac pac ozonation filtration and uv indicating that the technologies most applied as advanced treatments for the removal of ppcps and omps are those mentioned above on the other hand there is an evident relationship between tertiary treatment and titania photocatalysis and solar treatment as well as a growing interest in pathogen removal this keyword appears related to others such as disinfection or presence in water of antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs and antibiotic resistance genes args showing the current concerns regarding thetransfer of antibiotic resistance to pathogens in the environment another issue to highlight is the close relationship between electrochemical methods and heavy metals hms showing the preferences for the use of this type of processes for the treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals adsorption techniques such as gac pac and filtration based treatments to remove contaminants were usually studied together as can be seen by the proximity of points and width of the relation line in general low presence of cross sectional keywords as economic assessment was observed considering the significance criteria only words with an occurrence of more than 3 were considered for the study as a result although some articles incorporate the economic evaluation of the technology the analysis from the environmental point of view is missing 4 technological aspects of tertiary treatments 4 1 ozone based treatments ozonation o₃ is a heterogeneous process applied for the oxidative treatment of drinking water and more recently for wastewater conversely to fully water miscible oxidants e g h₂o₂ mass transfer optimization from the gaseous to the aqueous phase must be considered typically bubble column reactors are used to contact the ozone with the water stream fig 3a ozonation has been studied mainly in continuous processes whereas batch operation is the setup of choice at pilot scale to optimize reaction conditions 18 20 most of the reviewed studies considered the application of ozonation to effluents from conventional secondary treatment plants however since ozonation uses non specific oxidation pathways to transform target compounds the versatility of this process allows its wide application such as for the removal of pollutants from surface groundwaters 21 23 as well as other types of wastewaters e g industrial effluents 24 25 or reject streams from ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis units 26 70 of the reviewed studies were located in europe whereas none of them was in africa as depicted in fig 3c the typical temperature of ozonation treated effluents ranges from 10 to 30 c depending on climatic conditions and wwtp location high temperatures can lead to volatilization of compounds facilitated by gas bubbling in general a ph above 8 favors ozone decomposition mediated by hydroxyl anions but this condition is not met in most wastewaters the ph values in the selected studies vary in the range of 6 0 to 10 5 respectively to a much greater extent than hydroxyl anions dissolved organic matter e g phenols and amines induces the formation of hydroxyl radicals through different pathways 27 28 it should be noted that the efficiency of the process can be hampered by high loadings of radical scavenging species such as carbonates halogen ions or nitrogen oxides 29 30 consequently the abundance of these species implies not only a reduction of the treatment efficiency but also the formation of toxic oxidation products when halogen ions are present in the reaction matrix bromate formation in a typical configuration relatively short removal times to achieve micropollutant removal vary from 5 to 30 min but can extend to longer periods as is the case for nonylphenol or bisphenol a with treatment times up to 100 min 31 in the case of organic matter removal it has been established that the ozone dose varies depending on the stream flow to be treated between values of 1 to 200 mg o₃ l 1 the typical parameters of ozonation are presented in fig 3b the electrophilic character of ozone and its high oxidation potential e0 2 07 v enhance its reactivity towards compounds with low oxidation state such as deprotonated amines sulfides and aromatic rings with electron donor groups 29 32 33 in addition to direct oxidation there are indirect oxidation pathways in which reactive oxygen species ros most notably oh radicals are produced 29 30 leading to the decomposition of water pollutants due to their high oxidation potential e0 2 80 v as seen in fig 3d 34 the studied pollutant concentrations are in the range of 0 1 ng l 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 for pharmaceuticals and pesticides and from 1 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 for the combination of ozonation with an electrochemical method 25 although most authors focus their research on ozone mediated micropollutant removal some works have studied degradation pathways as well as the consequences of treatment on the treated effluent in terms of toxicity estrogenicity or mutagenicity 31 35 36 different species have been considered for in vivo studies on the potential mutagenicity and toxicity of the treatment in particular using daphnia magna 37 aliivibrio fischeri 37 38 and potamopyrgus antipodarum 39 furthermore the formation of intermediates 40 or the influence of ozonation on args and arbs 38 41 have been studied as a special case the application of this process alone or in combination with gac and sand filter against inactivation of microorganisms provided reductions of up to 4 3 log removal value lrv for enterococci and escherichia coli bacteria 41 43 unlike in chlorination the formation of by products affecting water quality such as haloalkanes is prevented 44 to improve its efficiency and pollutant removal performance ozonation can be combined with uv irradiation 23 45 and hydrogen peroxide 26 37 uv light at wavelengths up to 310 nm provokes the dissociation of o3 into an oxygen molecule and hydrogen peroxide similarly the peroxone process o₃ h₂o₂ combines the oxidizing power of ozone with the decomposition of h₂o₂ to enhance the generation of oh radicals and has been shown to be effective in reducing ozone resistant micropollutants 27 one of the most important factors to consider in the peroxone process is the ratio of o₃ to h₂o₂ which governs the reaction rate however the high capacity of h2o2 regarding the degradation of omps allows kinetic improvements even when present in trace amounts 46 the h₂o₂ mediated generation of oh can consume up to half the amount of available o₃ 47 therefore the h₂o₂ o₃ ratio is generally set between 0 5 and 1 0 at pilot and full scale the reaction is often carried out in gas liquid reactors with a configuration similar to ozone bubbling columns alternatively the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in presence of uv irradiation leads the formation of additional oh radicals 23 48 catalytic ozonation o₃ cat makes use of a catalyst to promote the decomposition of ozone and the subsequent formation of ros although many homogeneous catalysts based on transition metal ions preferably bivalent have been investigated precipitation or lack of retention systems have prevented their large scale application 49 in the late 1990s the first pilot plants applied heterogeneous catalysts to improve ozonation efficiency in leachate treatment 50 applicable materials are iron flakes metal metal oxide coated ceramic membranes or clay minerals such as montmorillonite 49 51 the application of alumina based catalysts showed a significant enhancement of micropollutant removal compared to ozonation alone 52 in contrast the application of iron based catalysts for the removal of sulfamethoxazole showed no improvement compared to the results with the results obtained for conventional ozonation 53 on the other hand the possibility of integrating ozonation with electrochemical methods aims at the coagulation of dissolved metals 25 and will be applicable for wastewaters of high content in heavy metals the combination of ozonation with different types of activated carbon such as gac 54 55 biological activated carbon bac 56 57 biofiltration 38 55 or sand filtration 43 58 has been successfully applied as an example östman et al 59 reported the improvement in benzothiazole removal from 30 to 82 by incorporating a gac unit after the ozonation stage however in this study the application of sand filtration to this effluent did not show a significant effect 56 58 59 on the other hand the use of biological filters has been studied by knopp et al 55 and ternes et al 38 showing similar results to those obtained by the application of ozonation 4 2 ultraviolet treatments ultraviolet uv irradiation is commonly applied as disinfection step after biological treatment uv units for disinfection usually consist of cylindrical borosilicate modules housing mercury pressure lamps immersed in the wastewater stream fig 4a both low pressure lp lamps with a sharp emission peak at about 254 nm and medium pressure mp lamps with a broader emission spectrum in the uv c region 200 600 nm are applied the flow capacity of these full scale modules can be up to 3000 m3 h 1 60 in single pass mode for a residence time of less than 1 min the influent treated in the revised studies was characterized by a ph in the range of 7 0 7 6 and a temperature ranging between 18 and 24 c and comparably low tss and doc values fig 4b most of the considered studies were performed in europe with a concentration to the mediterranean area while the largest plants regarding treated flow were located in china only one study was in brazil focusing on pathogen removal pathogen removal by uv light typically ranges between 5 and 7 lrv at irradiance levels of 70 w m 2 these high removal values are necessary to mitigate the effect of bacterial regrowth after uv treatment 61 this possibility is of particular concern when reclaimed wastewater is stored in buffer tanks prior to use for agricultural purposes it should be noted that certain species of bacteria show resistance to uv treatment while the most commonly investigated e coli bacteria are effectively removed even within a short residence time pseudomonas strains are frequently detected in effluent from uv disinfection units 42 regarding the elimination of genetic patterns relevant to the evolution of antibiotic resistances several studies reported that uv treatment only selectively eliminates args and reported removals of dna or gene fragments was lower than for pathogens esm 6 60 62 pathogen removal by uv light typically ranges between 5 and 7 lrv at irradiance levels of 70 w m 2 these high removal values are necessary to mitigate the effect of bacterial regrowth after uv treatment 61 this possibility is of particular concern when reclaimed wastewater is stored in buffer tanks prior to use for agricultural purposes it should be noted that certain species of bacteria show resistance to uv treatment while the most commonly investigated e coli bacteria are effectively removed even within a short residence time pseudomonas strains are frequently detected in effluent from uv disinfection units 42 regarding the elimination of genetic patterns relevant to the evolution of antibiotic resistances several studies reported that uv treatment only selectively eliminates args and reported removals of dna or gene fragments was lower than for pathogens esm 6 60 62 although many authors have studied omp removal in full scale modules designed for disinfection 63 these approaches only lead to slight removal efficiencies for applied irradiances up to 500 mj cm 2 even an irradiance of 4000 mj cm 2 only resulted in a removal of 0 77 lrv of micropollutants 64 similar removal percentages for endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs were reported by cédat et al 65 at irradiance of 1000 mj cm 2 it was also shown that estrogenicity could not be satisfactorily removed even though the parent compounds were partially transformed 66 regardless of the lamp intensity in the photolysis process it is required that the target omps absorb the uv radiation in the range of the lamp spectrum to be abated however only a few organic micropollutants present in wastewater undergo photolysis at the applied wavelength of 245 nm these are for example sulfamethoxazole with a removal efficiency between 22 and 70 67 depending on the applied irradiance 63 68 69 and diclofenac between 45 and 100 61 68 fig 4d even if the target molecule is not susceptible to photolysis it may undergo secondary radical transformation promoted by light induced excitation of electrons from compounds present in the matrix generally the studies reviewed were operated at dissolved organic carbon doc values below 15 mg l 1 with few exceptions still most of the investigated omps are only degraded to a negligible extent 70 or even with negative removal efficiencies 71 72 this may be related to several factors such as photolysis of coupling products towards the original compounds errors in quantitative measurements due to matrix interference or desorption of residual particulate matter 66 none of the investigated studies consider the fate of heavy metals during uv treatment as uv irradiation is known to have no effect on their removal uv treatment combined with hydrogen peroxide uv h₂o₂ produces reactive hydroxyl radicals as light with wavelengths 254 nm induces photodissociation of h₂o₂ 70 resulting in enhanced micropollutant removal 73 75 typically a h₂o₂ dose of 10 mg l 1 is applied in photoreactors equipped with dosing mixing systems that are already commercially available for large scale applications 65 76 various reactor geometries have been evaluated to maximize mixing and irradiation 68 however the benefits of combining sunlight or uv with hydrogen peroxide are less prominent for antibiotic removal and disinfection 67 although h2o2 is the most used oxidant it has been shown that the use of other oxidants considerably minimizes bacterial regrowth compared to uv treatment alone 61 regarding omp removal efficiencies are highly dependent on the type of contaminants so variable energy efficiency values were obtained ranging from 0 16 18 kw m 3 for ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin respectively 10 it is therefore necessary to evaluate and model the degradation kinetics of the expected micropollutants both in laboratory and at pilot scale 66 67 77 other oxidants such as ozone chlorine chlorine dioxide and persulfate in combination with uv treatment have been also investigated for omp removal 73 75 compared to oh radicals cl and so₄ radicals have been reported to be less prone to deactivation by matrix constituents such as hco₃ or no₃ and to have less affinity towards natural organic matter 61 77 the underlying mechanisms of radical formation and reaction with omp are described in detail elsewhere 78 79 4 3 adsorption on activated carbon although advanced materials such as zeolites or carbon nanotubes are gaining interest as adsorbents in wastewater polishing activated carbon is used as the predominant material depending on the grain size as powdered activated carbon pac or granular activated carbon gac powdered activated carbon is applied in grain sizes of 50 100 μm with a bet surface area between 900 and 1300 m2 g 1 80 pac is usually added to the effluent of the biological treatment stage in a 81 83 loading range between 10 and 20 mg l 1 one of the constraints in the design of different process configurations must ensure the retention of spent pac 84 achieved by 1 the implementation of a sedimentation unit 85 86 or by 2 sand anthracite or expanded shale bed filter columns or in some cases by 3 membrane filtration units fig 5a in the latter two options pac recycling can be achieved by backwashing to maximize the carbon usage rate however in the first case it is necessary to improve pac retention by coagulation flocculation which requires the addition of fe3 based coagulants 83 in some cases an anionic polymer is additionally applied as a flocculant 85 alternatives where pac is directly applied in membrane bioreactors mbr may pose problems in sludge management 87 as spent pac is mixed with the sludge matrix and cannot be regenerated after use a promising advance in process simplification is the development of μgac which is coarser and thus easier to separate and regenerate 88 89 gac units are mainly applied continuously in packed bed filter columns fig 5a which have to be replaced after the breakthrough threshold is reached several columns are applied in series or in parallel while each configuration has drawbacks and advantages 90 91 the same applies to the filtration direction either downflow or upflow which results in different head loss profiles while the removal efficiency was reported only slightly higher in the upflow configuration 90 in all cases regular backwashing is required to impede pressure buildup and can increase the operation time of the filter columns based on experience during one year of pilot scale operation kårelid et al 87 estimated the maintenance time to be 30 60 min per day the most critical factors of the wastewater matrix that affect the stable performance of gac filters are doc and ph value these values are between 6 and 11 mg l 1 q1 q3 and 7 0 7 6 q1 q3 respectively tss are considered to have a minor effect on the removal performance of gac filters but high levels require increased backwashing and range from 3 to 6 mg l 1 q1 q3 in the reviewed studies 40 92 fig 5b fig 5c shows the geographical distribution of the revised studies based on activated carbon indicating a focus of implementation in central and western europe and the usa this is explainable by the stricter legislation regarding the presence of omp in wwtp effluents implemented in switzerland and local initiatives as in some german federal states north rhine westphalia and baden wurttemberg both pac and gac can be considered as a strong barrier against most micropollutants 87 93 due to the numerous gac products available variable wastewater composition and complex interaction mechanisms a quantitative prediction of treatment capacity and gac breakthrough values is not straightforward and must be performed on a case by case basis 89 another factor that adds complexity to the description of gac processes and modeling of breakthrough behavior is the development of a biofilm in the gac bed over a prolonged operating time which ultimately turns them into bac filters 55 while adsorption related removal efficiency will decrease during microbial evolution biodegradation becomes more relevant 40 94 95 as expected in relation to the larger surface area a smaller gac particle size is usually favorable for omp removal 59 the data obtained from the revised studies indicates that the gac process can achieve higher maximal removals for all selected indicator compounds but the data is more scattered than in the pac process most critical compounds were diazepam valsartan acesulfame k and sulfamethoxazole while atenolol bezafibrate and metoprolol were removed 80 in most studies fig 5d in particular higher pka values and hydrophobicity of omp favor adsorption onto negatively charged activated carbon 22 94 depending on the treatment goals and quality of treated water gac processes can be integrated into treatment trains e g gac is often used as a polishing step after ozone aop treatment combining the benefit of low doc content and the efficient removal of ozonation oxidation byproducts 4 4 pressure driven membrane filtration treatments in reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf processes water is pumped through a variable set of pressurized membrane elements yielding a treated permeate stream and a concentrated retentate stream the percentage of the permeate flux regarding the influent flux is defined as recovery ranging between 50 and 90 18 high recoveries can be achieved by applying two consecutive stages feeding the second stage with retentate from the first stage while higher permeate quality can be reached by a second pass through another stage fig 6a the most commonly applied polymeric membranes have a lifetime of about 5 years depending on the quality of the treated water 96 recently ceramic membranes are gaining interest despite higher manufacturing costs due to their longer lifetime which can reach a duration 20 years 97 98 in the reviewed studies the operation of spiral wound polymeric modules in crossflow configuration is preferred over flat sheet configuration while membrane areas between 2 2 and 14 0 m2 for pilot scale 99 100 and between 1000 and 3000 m2 for full scale were investigated in both nf and ro processes pressures in the range of 7 15 bar are applied necessary to overcome the membrane resistance and the osmotic pressure between permeate and concentrate 18 pressure must be carefully monitored as its sudden decrease reflects membrane damage while continuous increase in pressure indicates membrane fouling scaling due to the deposition of salts colloids and organic matter clogging the pores 101 103 despite some exceptions where tss concentrations were up of 1800 mg l 1 for pharmaceutical effluents 104 and 390 mg l 1 for primary treated municipal wastewaters 105 tss and doc levels are lower with maximum concentrations of 15 mg l 1 96 and 30 mg l 1 106 respectively considering the susceptibility to fouling ro and nf systems are usually preceded by an ultrafiltration uf module or a membrane bioreactor mbr high water temperatures 30 c usually lead to a decrease in membrane performance 107 108 fig 6b despite the limitations imposed by influent quality the implementation of ro nf as an alternative to secondary biological treatment has already been applied as a decentralized treatment solution to produce high quality effluent 105 nevertheless the main application at large scale is water reclamation in the range of 150 000 450 000 m3 d 1 in regions with high water scarcity 109 the studies considered in this review were performed at smaller scale plants which ranged from 50 to 180 l h 1 pilot 96 110 and 24 168 m3 d 1 full scale 105 111 a relevant share 39 of the studies reviewed in our work were conducted in spain while studies were distributed worldwide including studies from south africa brazil and india fig 6c focusing on the group of target contaminants the most studied compounds in the reviewed publications are carbamazepine cbz caffeine caf diclofenac dfc ibuprofen ibu and sulfamethoxazole smx are presented in fig 6d the removal efficiency for both technologies is similar for the analyzed pollutants except for carbamazepine for which ro proved more effective retention of omp is mainly governed by size exclusion however several factors such as hydrophobicity surface loading of contaminants or biofilm formation can positively influence retention 111 although most studies report excellent removal of omp e g sulfamethoxazole diclofenac ibuprofen and atenolol below the detection limit this is not the case for some compounds especially of small molecular weight 112 for example the small endocrine disruptor bisphenol a or nitrosamines such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and other ozonation aop byproducts are frequently found in ro permeates 111 113 in this regard it may be beneficial to apply ro nf stages prior to aop processes as it has been shown that ndma precursors such as ranitidine can be efficiently removed by nf and ro 114 it should be noted that lower concentrations of omp are more difficult to remove possibly due to slower reaction rates and or matrix effects 112 which also emphasizes the need for investigations at environmental concentrations in order not to overestimate the efficiency of the process research studies rarely focus on pathogen removal by ro and nf stages as they are usually preceded by an ultrafiltration unit to avoid biofilm growth although ultrafiltration membranes are a sufficient barrier against bacteria viruses and omps are only sufficiently retained by nf and ro membranes 96 115 nf and ro are also effective for heavy metal removal but this feature is only relevant in special applications e g highly contaminated landfill leachate or construction site effluents 116 117 since heavy metals in municipal effluents are mostly successfully retained in secondary biological treatment 4 5 catalyst based processes instead of directly using photon energy to decompose micropollutant structures ros are formed during photocatalytic processes using materials with semiconducting properties or based on light driven decomposition of hydrogen peroxide photo fenton due to the higher energy requirements of uv light compared to solar light recent work focuses on the search for new materials capable of exploiting the advantages of this type of irradiation with a focus on reducing energy consumption resulting in greater technological feasibility for large scale implementation fig 7a in photocatalysis processes approximately half of the studies have used solar light and provide irradiance between 20 and 40 w m 2 in lower latitude areas 118 120 the most applied technologies were pilot raceway pond reactors rpr or compound parabolic reactors cpr while the studied rpr reactors have an illuminated area of less than 0 5 m2 and a depth of 5 to 15 cm to cope with a working volume of about 20 100 l 120 122 the largest pilot cpc plants for wastewater treatment have a treatment capacity around 100 l in batch operating mode 123 125 the most frequent parameters studied with these techniques were depicted in fig 7b heterogeneous photocatalysts pc in wastewater treatment are based on the use of solid state metal oxides with semiconducting properties in these materials the valence and conduction bands vb and cb are separated by an energy band gap upon irradiation of photons with an energy equal to or higher than this energy electrons in the vb are promoted to the cb the formation of electron hole pairs provides sites for the generation of ros by oxidation and reduction reactions acting as direct oxidant when an organic molecule serves as an electron donor or as indirect oxidant by generation of oh which in turn attacks organic molecules 126 in theory organic micropollutants could be completely mineralized as the radical reactions are non specific and are capable of degrading a wide range of compounds however the generation of by products in the intermediate steps must be assessed 127 the most widely applied photocatalyst in large scale wastewater treatment is tio2 since it can be applicable for solar light absorption directly due to its absorption wavelengths 128 however modification of semiconductors by doping their structure with other metals has been studied to improve photo efficiency 129 although the use of zno based materials are potential candidates due to their higher electron mobility and similar properties compared to tio2 the undesired high electron hole recombination is the main drawback for their application 130 furthermore zno is more susceptible to photo corrosion than tio2 the generated zn2 ions can increase the toxicity of the effluent 131 materials with a narrower band gap and lower charge recombination rate have been developed to increase the share of usable solar spectrum one of the main drawbacks of heterogeneous photocatalysis is the limitation of reaction rates due to low mass transfer kinetics between phases the use of nanostructured materials increases the surface to volume ratio and electron hole pairs are more exposed to the surface where they can act as a reactive center another challenge is that in most photocatalytic materials the rapid electron hole recombination process causes 90 of the active sites generated by photon absorption to be depleted before they can act as a catalytic site this phenomenon can be partially avoided by the inclusion of certain components in the crystal structures known as dopants which improve catalytic efficiency 132 in order to ensure efficient catalyst separation numerous options have been evaluated such as immobilization on supports like biopolymers 133 magnetite nanocomposites 134 glass plates 135 polymeric support materials 136 or membranes 137 hydroxyl radicals generated in photocatalytic systems enable pathogen elimination through non specific mechanisms which trigger the destruction of cell membranes and damage to genetic material 138 in fenton based methods ros are generated by reductive and oxidative decomposition of h₂o₂ by fe2 and fe3 species at acidic ph respectively the limiting step in this process is the regeneration of fe3 to fe2 by irradiation with light of wavelength 580 nm the regeneration of the catalyst by photochemical pathways is enhanced conventional fenton f and photo fenton pf reactions produce a considerable amount of iron sludge the increased turbidity caused by the abundance of fe3 can further limit efficiency as light transmission decreases 70 the fact that fenton based reactions require an acidic ph implies subsequent neutralization of treated waters and increased salt concentration 14 this can be minimized by the application of ligands that increase iron solubility even at circumneutral ph moreover the photo induced regeneration of fe2 species reduces iron consumption and precipitation of iron oxides thus increasing the stability of photocatalyst 139 another way to stabilize catalysts at circumneutral ph values is the use of heterogeneous catalysts iron oxides can be applied as magnetite which also allows the magnetic separation of the catalyst 261 in this case the use of nanostructured materials has the same advantages and disadvantages as in semiconductor photocatalysis in this context the homogeneous photo fenton process is the most studied photocatalytic technology using fe ii sulfate as catalyst at ph around 3 fig 7c alternatively a larger range between 6 and 8 has been considered stabilizing the solubilized iron with ligands such as ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds 140 141 humic acid 140 or citrate 106 for circumneutral ph values for both acidic and neutral conditions the fenton based processes provided high removal percentages for most of the studied compounds for reaction times up to one hour following the same trends as the ozonation process the most studied compounds were sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine followed by n acetil 4 aminoantipyrine and trimethoprim in most cases the lowest removal percentages were obtained for sulfamethoxazole pathogen removal was also evaluated with studies focusing on the degradation of escherichia coli 118 142 and enterococcus species 123 143 reaching inactivation of 3 0 to 4 5 lrv typical catalyst concentrations range from 1 to 20 mg l 1 iron although the most common concentration is 5 mg l 1 and hydrogen peroxide is in the range of 10 100 mg l 1 121 123 144 in contrast in semiconductor based catalysis the catalyst loadings are higher between 100 and 1000 mg l 1 the different catalyst loadings are due to the type of reaction as heterogeneous catalysis rates are governed by the interaction between the dissolved substances and the surface furthermore the reaction times required for similar degradation percentages are significantly longer being in the range of 1 to 7 h 47 145 146 modification of the tio₂ catalyst using graphitic carbon nitrides 146 supports as poly methyl methacrylate 136 or metals 99 provided better results that the bare ones considering the results obtained with solar simulators 122 146 147 variable irradiance depending on weather conditions latitude and solar incidence poses a challenge for reactor efficiency and process regulation since irradiation energy is closely related to compound degradation some authors report removal rates by comparing the results versus the total energy input to the system for solar processes where irradiance is a function of time of day 47 106 141 although the number of studies focused on the influence of degradation parameters in wwtp effluents is extensive fewer studies focus on other types of waters such as industrial effluents with specific pollutants 145 148 149 or ro nf concentrates 106 in addition the combination of these catalytic techniques with precipitation units 149 or electrochemical processes 141 146 has been studied for specific purposes such as metal removal however it is reported that drinking water resources contaminated with heavy metals of geogenic or industrial origin as well as waters containing omp are not sufficiently removed with solar photocatalysis 150 4 6 electrochemical treatments the classification of electrochemical treatments encompasses a wide number of methods grouped around the use of electrochemistry under different typologies and characteristics as they can be used as a single stage or in combination with other techniques for the techno economic assessment information was sought on eight distinct treatments see table s1 electrooxidation electroreduction including cathodic deposition electrocoagulation electrodialysis fenton based methods photo electrocatalysis sono electrochemical and electroperoxone techniques electrochemical wastewater treatments were originally proposed to remove heavy metals from mining wastewater by cathodic deposition two examples focus on the recovery of nickel and copper from pickling and electroplating wastewaters 149 151 but there are not many examples of full scale experiments for the removal of micropollutants in wastewater see table s1 since electrochemical methods comprise a wide variety of techniques the number of publications per category is limited thus electrocoagulation electrodialysis and fenton based electrochemical methods are the techniques with more publications with 11 9 and 6 respectively as depicted in fig 8 electrocoagulation ec is particularly effective in the removal of heavy metals and is applied in the treatment of effluents from the mining metallurgical and paper industries or landfill leachate 24 25 152 154 during electrocoagulation the sacrificial anodic material e g iron or aluminum releases metal ions that from hydroxides in the reaction medium these species lead to neutralization of the surface charges of particulate organic or inorganic matter subsequently aggregation occurs due to van der waals interactions and the generated flocs can be removed by sedimentation or filtration 155 156 for example ec treatment resulted in up to 7 lrv of microorganisms and several pharmaceuticals such as sulfamethoxazole 59 or iopromide 31 from tertiary treated wastewater 157 in addition to standard iron or aluminum electrodes magnesium electrodes also demonstrated their technical feasibility at pilot scale obtaining a removal efficiency of 65 85 for cephalosporin based antibiotics 158 ec accomplished arsenic removal from contaminated groundwater with a removal efficiency of 128 4 μg l 1 per kwh in a plant operated for 2 years with iron electrodes 159 ec has also been used in combination with ozonation or h₂o₂ to treat groundwater resulting in an effective removal of arsenic chromium nickel and copper below detection limits 25 160 electrodialysis ed is an electrochemically assisted separation technique used to transport ions from solution across ion exchange membranes usually alternating compartments separated by cation and anion exchange membranes aided by an external electric field the technique has high selectivity and is considered cost effective as it reduces the need for chemical consumption in addition it can be used for product recovery from waste streams ed is implemented on an industrial scale but is mainly applied to desalinate brackish water guerreri et al 161 provided an excellent review of the fundamentals of the electrodialysis process along with a detailed description of its practical applications for wastewater treatment and resource recovery shen et al 162 studied the recovery of 2 amino 1 propanol sulfate an intermediate for the pharmaceutical industry at pilot scale obtaining up to 98 recovery and a 15 reduction in operating cost compared to the conventional recovery procedure however the pilot scale plants found in the literature are only intended to treat water contaminated with heavy metals for example a 200 l plant installed in an electroplating wastewater treatment plant allowed reducing heavy metal concentration and conductivity 163 electrodialysis was also used for the treatment of municipal solid waste incineration residues in water suspension to reduce leaching of heavy metals 164 165 and for recycling contaminated wastewater for reuse in agriculture 166 although there are no pilot scale experiments the use of electrodialysis could be useful for the separation of pharmaceuticals and emerging contaminants however transport across membranes is reported to depend on hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions between contaminants and ed membranes 167 fenton based processes are also widely studied in combination with electrochemistry for instance fenton and photo fenton processes can be upgraded to electro fenton ef and photoelectro fenton pef enabling the on line electro generation of hydrogen peroxide using a gas diffusion electrode as the cathode by o2 reduction additionally fe3 can be regenerated at the cathode from the reduction of fe2 thus reducing the amount of sludge production there are several approaches to the process as fe ions can be produced by a sacrificial iron anode or if a heterogeneous fenton process is used the anodic process can be integrated with elox electrodes to foster a synergistic oxidation potential among other approaches solar photoelectro fenton spef is gaining much attention because it uses solar radiation instead of artificial light reducing energy consumption and associated treatment costs more information on fenton process and its different approaches can be found elsewhere 168 169 the mineralization of chloramphenicol by ef and spef was studied in a 10 l pilot plant spef was much more efficient than ef using the same conditions resulting in 89 and 45 of the antibiotic degradation respectively however spef presented an elevated energy consumption of 30 8 kwh m 3 with a current efficiency of 36 170 furthermore the authors note that the use of bdd anodes resulted in a much more efficient oxidation of chloramphenicol based on previous experiments in a lab scale stirred reactor complete mineralization of levofloxacin was achieved using a pre pilot flow plant consisting of a filter press reactor coupled to a photoreactor with very low specific energy consumption 171 an electro fenton filtration system based on iron nanoparticles attached to carbon felt electrodes achieved only up to 85 degradation of diclofenac but at neutral ph and low electrical conductivity 172 additionally a pef type process based on the substitution of h₂o₂ by hclo and uv light for fe2 regeneration achieved complete sulfamethoxazole degradation at relatively low current densities and without the generation of toxic chloro organics 170 electrooxidation elox has the potential to remove a broad range of omp and is especially promising in the abatement of perfluorocarboxylic acids which are recalcitrant to other aops 173 as the oxidation takes place at the surface of the anode mass transfer limitations due to low pollutant concentration in wastewater streams may reduce the efficiency of the process therefore it is preferable to use this technology in pre concentrated streams e g for leachate treatment from hospitals industries or landfills or membrane filtration retentates heavy metals can be removed by electrodeposition on the cathode however this process can also lead to passivation 174 the removal of 12 emerging contaminants from wwtp secondary effluents was evaluated in a pilot system to study the application of elox from reverse osmosis concentrate reporting excellent results with degradation values between 94 and 97 except for ibuprofen for which only 70 abatement was achieved 175 salmerón et al compared different fenton based technologies at natural ph using a complexing agent to keep iron in solution with anodic oxidation approaches for the treatment of nanofiltration retentates 141 solar assisted elox outperformed ef and spef due to the high chloride concentrations of the retentate achieving a total degradation of 80 however a high concentration of chlorate was detected in the treated effluents another promising application is the enhancement of ozone treatment with the electrochemical generation of h₂o₂ the so called electro peroxone process although only one pilot scale example was found in the literature 23 in this paper the authors report the removal of 90 of selected pharmaceuticals at a flow rate of 113 l h 1 requiring an ozone dose of 9 3 mg l 1 and an electrical energy input of 0 135 kwh m 3 furthermore the electro peroxone process has been shown to reduce bromate formation in bench and pilot scale operations due to reduced o3 lifetimes and h₂o₂ mediated quenching of relevant intermediates 23 176 electrochemical coupled photocatalytic or ultrasonic techniques for pollutant degradation have not seen much use out of laboratory scale photo electrocatalysis pec improves the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation by increasing the lifetime of the electron hole pairs created in the semiconductor there are no pilot or large scale investigations of photo electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants in the literature however there is reasonable potential for large scale treatment of water streams using the pec process as stable continuous operation at a 50 ml lab scale reactor achieving more than 80 degradation of tetracycline 146 sonoelectrochemical techniques include several methods such as sonoelectrolysis or sonoelectro fenton which have been successfully studied at laboratory scale 177 as in the case of pec no examples of micropollutant removal at pilot or larger scale have been found in the literature review 4 7 irradiation treatments the classification of irradiation techniques comprises ultrasonic and electromagnetic radiation application to treat contaminated waters in the case of ultrasonic irradiation sonochemical treatments use high power ultrasound in three different approaches formation of hydroxyl radicals pyrolytic decomposition or supercritical water oxidation 178 regarding electromagnetic irradiation two techniques have been used to some extent i electron beam treatments that produce highly reactive species formed from water radiolysis 179 and ii microwave treatments that degrade organic molecules mainly via thermal effects caused by rapid heating at the molecular level 180 the literature search shows the limited application of this group of techniques in the field of wastewater treatment from the 169 initial results in the initial search see table s1 the number was reduced to 2 manuscripts in the selected papers exploring the combination of ozone with ultrasound 181 and ultrasonic assisted uv treatment 182 therefore the technological status of this group of treatment techniques is still far from actual pilot and real scale implementation 5 environmental aspects of tertiary treatments as lca is an internationally standardized method to identify environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a technology it can provide excellent insight into the environmental strengths and weaknesses of the different technologies and complement the technical and economic indicators of the systems under study the publications assessing the environmental profile of tertiary water treatment plants are summarized in the supplementary information esm 5 together with some relevant data such as location wastewater origin functional unit or assessment methods among others close to 50 of the manuscripts refer to lab scale operation despite the idea that lca is a methodology that is mostly applied to mature technologies as there is a paradigm shift in which lca is used prospectively to support decision making in the early phase of research and technology development to compare novel processes with existing commercial alternatives however there are some methodological and practical difficulties that need to be addressed such as lack of data uncertainty and how to deal with the extrapolation of laboratory data to full scale process 183 most of the studies analyzing the environmental impacts of tertiary treatments include uv techniques and ozonation which account for more than 50 of the selected publications in order of relevance activated carbon units stand out accounting for 25 of the total number of manuscripts among the innovative treatments fenton based methods represent 25 of the publications with solar photo fenton being the most evaluated approach surprisingly reverse osmosis and nanofiltration which are widely used tertiary treatment and drinking water purification technologies are hardly studied using the lca approach most of the reports have been conducted in europe there is limited evidence from central and south america as well as from the african and asian continents in terms of the scope of lcas the operational phase is the most studied as the main environmental impact is assumed to occur in this phase as the construction and decommissioning phases are considered non significant 8 184 in contrast the impact of the construction phase of the primary and secondary stages of a wwtp is widely studied 185 therefore the construction phase of tertiary treatment is slowly starting to see more inclusion within the system boundaries in recent years 186 187 as lca is an internationally standardized method to identify environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a technology it can provide excellent insight into the environmental strengths and weaknesses of the different technologies and complement the technical and economic indicators of the systems under study the publications assessing the

contrast the impact of the construction phase of the primary and secondary stages of a wwtp is widely studied 185 therefore the construction phase of tertiary treatment is slowly starting to see more inclusion within the system boundaries in recent years 186 187 tertiary treatments were considered in many cases as an additional step for conventional wwtp effluents either to reuse water or to improve effluent quality as environmental benefits of water reuse through tertiary treatment in real wwtps are identified 188 190 filtration techniques are already implemented for wastewater treatment either alone or in combination with other techniques in this context awad et al 191 studied a basic tertiary treatment based on chemical coagulation followed by sand filtration which improved global impact categories such as abiotic depletion acidification eutrophication or global warming the key to impact reduction was water reuse without increasing energy consumption within the water reuse approach another study was conducted in tehran in which 20 different configurations were considered including established treatments such as uv uf or ro however the publication focuses more on the development of a method to aid decision making on the type of water reuse irrigation industrial parks etc and the configuration and associated costs of the technologies to choose for each case 192 in france several types of treatment trains combining different types of filtration with uv treatments and disinfection were evaluated to reuse water and comply with french legislation 193 in this case sand filtration with uv was the best alternative since it entailed the lowest energy consumption while still complying with quality regulations ultraviolet treatments are commonly used in combination with oxidizing species or other treatment techniques to synergistically improve the efficiency foteinis et al 194 analyzed different light driven processes such as solar and uv photolysis in combination with h₂o₂ and concluded that the main impact was due to electricity consumption and that chemicals did not affect negatively due to their low dosage however other studies reported environmental problems due to the addition of oxidants to uv treatments for example the removal of micropollutants in hospital wastewater treated by uv irradiation technology combined with h₂o₂ showed that the addition of peroxide has a great influence on the environmental impact due to its production process furthermore it was shown that low pressure lamps have a significantly lower impact than medium pressure uv lamps 195 furthermore a uv unit was applied to remove these contaminants followed by the addition of sulfate based oxidants apart from the promising economic data the production of oxidizing agents is the main hot spot of these systems which increases the impacts in several categories 196 uv radiation was also combined with an electrochemical oxidation system to treat textile wastewater this system demonstrated its technological feasibility and good environmental performance compared to conventional biological and tertiary treatment although the salts used as electrolyte had the greatest impact on the system the addition of a reconstitution step to reuse water and salts proved to be beneficial to the process 197 the environmental impacts of ozonation were less studied than those of uv but there are studies reporting that ozonation impacts are reduced when compared to uv treatments 184 198 while others point out in the opposite direction reporting high environmental impacts for ozonation when compared to uv treatments 199 however when compared to nanofiltration or adsorption on activated carbon ozonation is less favored due to its inability to remove heavy metals and the production of harmful by products 200 ozonation was also evaluated at laboratory scale to remove micropollutants in wwtp effluents noting that the amount of ozone applied and the type of columns play an important role for the environmental assessment the toxicity of residual ozone in the effluent has to be taken into account as there is a trade off between the reduction of micropollutant toxicity and greenhouse gases ghg emissions from ozone production 201 the environmental impacts of activated carbon adsorption technologies were evaluated in several investigations for instance different ac approaches were evaluated in a large scale pilot fluidized bed the results showed better performance of μgac compared to pac obtaining a similar outcome of gac for a fixed bed in previous studies the μgac technology also showed better environmental performance than regular gac generating impacts that are about ten times lower than bibliographic results 202 thompson et al evaluated wood biochar as an alternative material to activated carbon in the removal of micropollutants 187 a priori it appears that wood biochar is more environmental friendly than activated carbon however the impacts were distributed between activated charcoal and biochar since the data were obtained through a laboratory scale operation the use of ac produced from local waste biomass in a large scale wwtp was found to have a lower environmental impact for the removal of micropollutants compared to conventional ac 203 however it is reported that poorly designed systems and pre treatment drying of feedstocks could result in worse environmental footprints than conventional carbon 204 li et al 205 compared ozonation gac and ro technologies with the main objective to remove micropollutants in domestic wastewater while all technologies showed good micropollutant removal reverse osmosis performed significantly worse when energy consumption is considered in this study the authors did not perform an lca comparison for the different scenarios to obtain the alternative with the best environmental performance rahman et al 206 207 conducted a comparative study between these treatments including the additional consideration of uv h₂o₂ in terms of ecotoxicity and human toxicity gac and ozonation showed the best results while again the worst results were obtained for the ro process however the advantage of ac adsorption compared to ozonation was found to be negligible although it could be significant depending on the profile of the electricity mix 202 the electrical energy demand for gac processes in wwtps is 2 4 times lower compared to ozonation but when cumulative energy demands e g production and transport are considered the gac process consumes 30 more energy and emits more ghgs than ozonation 59 208 ghg emissions can be reduced by 80 if spent carbon is recycled although transport and dewatering costs and mass losses of 5 15 per regeneration cycle must be taken into account recycling of spent carbon requires less energy and is more economical than producing fresh gac due to shorter pyrolysis times 209 moreover benstoem et al could not observe an advantage of using virgin carbon over reused carbon in a meta analysis 210 fenton based processes are by far the most studied among those considered innovative tertiary treatments especially when coupled to solar light despite the proven efficiency of solar photo fenton or photoelectro fenton solar photo fenton was more environmentally friendly in terms of energy than photoelectro fenton 211 212 following these studies rodríguez et al also considered the evaluation of heterogeneous and homogeneous fenton processes at laboratory scale but using real wastewater of a pharmaceutical industry 213 although both configurations had acceptable efficiencies for micropollutant removal the homogeneous fenton had higher environmental impacts caused mainly by sludge production and higher operating temperature than the heterogeneous fenton which had problems related to chemical consumption ioannou ttofa et al 186 evaluated the solar fenton method in a pilot plant considering all system inputs including the operational phase and the construction phase the sustainability of this technology is very promising since its carbon footprint is only 8 7 kg co2 per cubic meter of treated wastewater the environmental impact of fenton based removal processes was also compared with established tertiary technologies such as ozonation or nanofiltration arzate et al 214 compared ozonation which is considered as an energy demanding process with solar photo fenton which a priori is considered a sustainable technology the photo fenton process performed worse than ozonation due to the amount of chemicals required and the ph requirements in addition continuous operation is hampered by non uniform irradiation for example additional storage technology would need to be installed to harvest solar energy for night time operation gallego schmid et al 215 evaluated solar photo fenton at different ph and with and without the incorporation of a nanofiltration technology the results of arzate et al 214 showed a similar trend in which solar photo fenton had the worst impacts in most of the environmental categories analyzed furthermore tarpani and azapagic 200 included more technologies in the comparison and analyzed the abovementioned processes ozonation solar photo fenton and nanofiltration and gac as in the previous publications solar photo fenton followed by ozonation had the most negative effects while the nf unit was the best for between 13 and 18 impact categories the photo fenton process also showed a negative impact compared to other solar based aops this negative environmental impact was confirmed by pesqueira et al 216 on the outcomes of the experiments conducted for pilot scale treatments based on solar energy photolysis photocatalysis and photo fenton it is concluded that the negative impact of the photo fenton process is caused by the acid ph required to avoid fe precipitation and the consequent need for neutralization of the treated effluent the negative environmental impact due to the use of chemicals in solar photo fenton was confirmed in the evaluation of a semi industrial solar collector plant 217 surprisingly in a study comparing heterogeneous photocatalysis and homogeneous photo fenton by muñoz et al 218 the solar photo fenton presents a lower environmental impact mainly due to the larger size of the solar collector field required for the photocatalytic process beyond fenton based technologies there are a couple of publications that evaluate the impacts of photocatalysis and electrooxidation giménez et al 219 compared photocatalysis and photo fenton processes at laboratory scale focusing on the removal of metoprolol photocatalysis showed a worse environmental impact related to energy consumption in this study electricity was disregarded for comparison and this can be considered problematic when extrapolating the results costamagna et al 220 evaluated the degradation of phenol with photocatalysts based on zinc oxide doped with rare earth compounds zinc concentrations were modified to observe how they affect the environmental impact although the results related to pollutant removal were very promising the process has issues related to the impact of zinc and electricity the environmental impacts of the electrooxidation process were not compared with other tertiary processes but in combination with other systems to improve its environmental profile the intensification of the elox process with ultrasound and uv was evaluated in a bench scale system with synthetic water with the elox uv system being the option with the least impacts due to its lower energy requirements 221 as the main problem related to electrochemical technologies is energy consumption the coupling of electrochemical systems with renewable energy sources is being investigated for example elox has been coupled to wind and photovoltaic energy devices showing an improvement of the impacts related to energy consumption since it is estimated that 90 of the impact is caused by the associated fossil energy consumption 222 the environmental evaluation of established tertiary technologies is also compared with several treatment methods outside the scope of the review but the authors considered it relevant to look at the big picture in environmental comparisons of different treatment methods for instance foglia et al 223 compared the mbr technology with established treatments such as chemical and uv disinfection showing better environmental performance in all impact categories except for freshwater eutrophication on the other hand holloway et al 224 reported that mbr treatment coupled with ro and uf have greater impacts than a treatment sequence composed of microfiltration ro and uv for the generation of reclaimed water the established treatments were also compared with other innovative non abiotic methods such as algae growth 225 reporting 75 88 of efficiency in micropollutant removal and better environmental indicators than uv ozonation or gac due to the energy efficiency of algae other innovative techniques such as the application of bioaugmentation to sand filters 226 or the use of enzyme coated membranes 227 were also compared to gac adsorption showing potential environmental and economic advantages 6 economic aspects of tertiary treatments the implementation costs of advanced treatment technologies are composed of capital costs capex which include land purchase construction and decommissioning costs and operating costs opex which are mainly influenced by energy and chemical consumption and the labor required for operation and maintenance 228 even when the technological parameters of a treatment technology are well studied at laboratory or even pilot scale it is challenging to apply these results for cost estimation of new plants due to region specific costs and variable wastewater characteristics and treatment goals the economic data for the ozonation process in the reviewed studies are heterogeneous and incomplete this is because energy consumption is variable over a range of five orders of magnitude due to the complex interrelationships of individual rate constants matrix composition and operating configuration however miklos et al 229 found in a meta analysis that ozonation has lowest median energy consumption values compared to other aop processes being lower than 1 kw m 3 prieto rodríguez et al 47 reported an operational cost of 0 560 m 3 obtaining complete removal of bisphenol a ibuprofen and diclofenac among other compounds for a flow of 900 l h 1 however liu et al 230 reported much lower operation costs considering 90 of abatement of trace organic contaminants obtaining a total cost without pretreatment of 0 0179 m 3 these costs can be modified by applying this treatment on a large scale achieving values of 0 158 m 3 even if the ozonation is applied together with uv radiation 231 and diminishing the value to 0 068 m 3 when the process is applied before a ceramic membrane filtration for the removal of azithromycin 232 on the other hand only one of the studied works provides a value for pac o₃ uv treatment between 0 655 and 0 677 m 3 d 1 depending on the ozone concentration 231 regarding the energy consumption for omp removal in uv based technologies it has been reported that the application of mercury lp lamps is about 50 more effective than mercury mp lamps 70 195 assessed the costs of omp removal based on pilot scale data the authors also made a projection of the reactor volume needed to operate at full scale with a daily discharge volume of 110 000 m3 however these projections have to carefully assess the number of additional lamps to maintain similar uv irradiance 65 solar light does not achieve competitive removal compared to uv based processes although it has been shown to remove toxicity more efficiently 67 the most decisive figure of merit for comparing the efficiency of light based treatment processes is the indication of the cumulative energy per treated volume to achieve a certain amount of target compound removal if the lamp efficacy is known the electrical energy per order can be calculated 233 however most of the uv based publications reviewed only give the irradiance w m 2 from which the above mentioned figure of merit can only be calculated when the reactor geometry is given but also the flow rate which is not the case in many publications to obtain the accumulated energy in solar reactors suspected of irradiance fluctuations the irradiance can be integrated over time 127 for uv h₂o₂ and combinations with in situ generated chlorine and sulfate radicals the energy demand was reported to be less than 1 kw m 3 and operational costs in the range of 0 12 0 16 m 3 were indicated 65 70 229 based on pilot scale data sbardella et al 196 reported even lower costs for a uv sulfate radical based treatment showing a successful removal higher than 80 of micropollutants and a treatment cost of 0 088 m 3 reina et al 234 studied the operational and construction costs of photo fenton technology the total costs ranged between 0 76 m 3 and 1 39 m 3 depending on the uv irradiance and the amount of iron on the other hand both capex and opex were evaluated by sánchez pérez et al 120 for solar photo fenton process at pilot scale providing a capex of 0 067 m 3 d 1 and an opex of 0 582 m 3 for the process conducted at ph 3 when the process is performed at circumneutral ph costs are reduced to 0 033 m 3 d 1 and 0 206 m 3 respectively moreover solar photo fenton was compared with the ozonation process the economic comparison operational and construction costs showed that solar photo fenton has higher costs 0 51 0 92 m 3 than ozonation 0 24 0 64 m 3 due to the large amount of chemicals consumed in the operational phase 235 however prieto rodríguez et al 47 studied the same treatments and their conclusion was exactly the opposite solar photo fenton was valued about 0 188 0 358 m 3 whereas 0 450 0 560 m3 were the values for ozonation this means that costs can change and must be carefully determined the main function of the plant in terms of removal of micropollutants can change the costs for or against the technology strictly speaking a comparison can only be made if the matrix composition and removal rate constants are similar however by comparing a sufficiently large data set these uncertainties lose weight and general assumptions can be made about the efficiency of different treatments miklos et al 229 found that reported energy consumption values for photo fenton and electro aop were in the range of 1 100 kw m 3 point of use solar disinfection sodis of drinking water is an option for developing countries with high solar irradiance 236 as capital costs are mainly associated with the need for large irradiation areas and buffer tanks for downtime storage detailed energy and cost evaluations for ozonation gac and pac adsorption based on full scale and pilot scale plants in germany have been presented in the literature 12 208 the capex values for ozonation and pac adsorption are around 0 05 m 3 while ozonation accounts for higher machinery costs ozone generator civil and electrical works are cheaper compared to the pac process the establishment of the gac adsorption processes accounts only for 0 035 m 3 provided that a filtration unit is already in place the operating costs of the three treatment processes ranged around 0 04 m 3 with different shares of individual contributors while ozonation had highest electrical energy costs pac had the highest maintenance and personnel costs while gac techniques resulted in the highest and most variable material costs this is also reflected in studies from other countries reporting variable process costs ek et al 91 estimated the cost of gac adsorption accounting the cost for the adsorbent to be around 0 14 m 3 these costs could be decreased to 0 11 m 3 when regenerated carbon was considered for application the total system costs were estimated to be 0 31 m 3 at the present stage of development ozone treatment and activated carbon adsorption techniques with subsequent filtration steps are considered the most economically viable on a large scale in central europe and are increasingly applied in switzerland to comply with the current legislation 237 conversely to the abovementioned technologies pressure driven membrane filtration techniques account for significantly higher investment and operational costs due to expensive membranes and the high demand for pumping energy respectively margot et al 83 compared the influence of nanofiltration and sand filtration as alternative post treatments to a pac process showing that the process costs with the implementation of nanofiltration comprised 0 80 m 3 while sand filtration accounted only for 0 16 m 3 echevarría et al 238 reported an opex of 0 31 m 3 for a plant size of 15 000 m3 d 1 while assuming a membrane lifetime of 6 years and energy consumption of 1 3 kwh m 3 the capex accounted for 662 m 3 d 1 translating to 0 044 m 3 at peak flow when treatment goals are less stringent a common option for cost reduction is to divert the flow of wastewater mixing with ro treated water by producing a 50 blend the opex could be reduced to 0 18 m 3 on the expense that removal of selected omp is reduced to 50 furthermore since the energy demand of pumping scales almost linearly with membrane area and applied pressure the size of the plant does not significantly reduce operating costs garcia et al 96 calculated opex reaching 0 24 m 3 while capex decreased from 0 48 0 31 m 3 comparing treatment capacities between 1 and 1000 ml d 1 conversely hube et al 239 argued that the rather simple configuration of membrane filtration can lead to low capital costs compared to other treatments thirty nine percent of the reviewed studies investigating membrane treatments were conducted in spain while the rest of the studies were distributed worldwide including publications from south africa brazil and india in contrast only one pilot scale study was presented for germany 240 this can be explained by the discrepant energy costs 241 as in 2020 household electric energy prices were 0 08 kwh 1 in india the price in germany was 0 38 kwh 1 recently the possibility of using energy intensive but flexible processes such as reverse osmosis as a buffer in energy grids increasingly based on extractable energy has been proposed flexible operation patterns of wwtps could compensate for the fluctuating production capacity of wind and solar energy 242 electrochemical treatments are usually regarded as energy intensive treatments although electrochemical treatments such as electrooxidation present high energy consumptions 76 the use of electrochemical assisted techniques presents competitive operational costs to be implemented in wwtps the use of electrodialysis is optimized by its extensive use in desalination and can be an effective method to remove heavy metals for instance a pilot plant with a productivity of 285 m3 h 1 integrating electrodialysis in a treatment train with ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis attained excellent reduction of copper concentration with an estimated total cost of 0 3 0 4 per m3 of treated water 243 the use of electrochemical technologies for the electrogeneration of h2o2 is also reported to reduce the costs compared to dosage for instance wang et al 100 estimate that the energy required for the in situ generation of h₂o₂ accounts for additional costs of between 0 4 and 0 8 usd kg 1 while the dosage of h₂o₂ involves costs of 1 2 1 5 usd kg 1 for other innovative treatments there is a lack of available data for cost calculations as only laboratory scale data are available the energy consumption of uv photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave photocatalysis treatments have been reported to exceed even 100 kw m 3 however calculations on this basis tend to overestimate energy consumption and thus costs 229 increasing energy efficiency with increasing plant size is a common concept in studies considering primary or secondary treatment plants in the short term perspective these treatment options have potential to be further applied and investigated for the treatment of highly contaminated industrial wastewater landfill leachate and ro nf retentates for example the higher overall treatment costs of landfill leachate even with conventional treatments and the typically lower volumes treated open up more options for the application of innovative treatment processes in terms of the costs and impacts of each technology users and regulators must carefully balance the amount of investment both economic and environmental to achieve the goal of safer water resources muñoz et al 244 propose an integrated approach to assess the eco efficiency of a technology by weighing environmental and economic burdens based on their reasoning ozonation was less favorable than photo fenton or solar photo fenton treatment however the costs assumed in this study were almost ten orders of magnitude higher than in the studies reviewed above the centralized and distributed application of tertiary treatments was also studied for several established technologies according to the results centralized treatment is preferred for the disposal of pharmaceuticals 184 but more research would be needed to confirm this in addition social aspects will play a considerable role in the final steps of decision making in switzerland the public supported the decision to legally oblige wwtps to guarantee the removal of certain indicator pollutants at 80 this measure will increase treatment costs by 6 across the country in addition energy consumption is estimated to increase by around 0 1 with the most advanced technologies 237 245 however developing countries will not have the resources to implement such programs in the near future as the prior objective is still to provide at least adequately disinfected water despite this difficult situation the lack of infrastructure networks could also lead to the development of simple decentralized treatment options based on renewable energy sources more quickly than in developed countries 7 benchmarking of the technologies as far as safe water reuse strategies are concerned the tertiary treatment processes applied must fulfil several framework conditions the treatment trains must be adaptable in size to the wastewater flow and pollutant load at the respective application site while operation has to be reliable and provide redundancy in case of failure of individual units therefore reproducible measurement schedules for indicator substances should be supported by fast online monitoring techniques such as fluorescence excitation emission matrices feem as well as by effect based assays on acute toxicity estrogenicity mutagenicity or antibiotic susceptibility 246 the integration of reasonable and standardized protocols in a whole effluent approach is currently an important research topic 247 a sound assessment of the avoided risks of each technology is the basis of a comprehensive lca study furthermore regionalization of characterization factors was suggested as a key issue to represent an accurate toxicity impact in local environments 248 it is also reported that the currently used assessment methods could provide different results and may not include some micropollutant factors 249 in the following we summarize and qualitatively discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of each advanced treatment technology under technological environmental and economic points of view based on the findings of the studies selected the technologies reviewed can be classified into advanced oxidation processes and physical retention treatments while oxidation processes comprise traditional ozone treatment and emerging ancillary technologies conventional uv treatment and enhancement technologies as well as electrochemical treatments physical treatments include adsorption processes mainly based on activated carbon and membrane filtration table 1 one of the main drawbacks of ozonation is that due to its high reactivity and instability ozone must be generated on site from oxygen by electrical discharge with a yield of about 10 which leads to high electrical energy consumption in the plant in addition to the low ozone yield the effectiveness of ozone treatment is limited by its slow dissolution rate and rapid decomposition however modifications to air diffusers that form micro nano bubbles increase the treatment efficiency 46 furthermore the high toxicity of ozone requires the design of ozone destruction units which remove unreacted ozone from the exhaust gas stream after treatment 250 trained personnel and strict safety protocols are necessary to minimize the risk of accidental release in addition the formation of toxic by products such as bromates which are potential human carcinogens has been associated with this process 251 increased effluent toxicity after ozone treatment was reported by several studies and contributed to worsen environmental impacts from an lca perspective despite these drawbacks disinfection capacity and low operational costs are the main advantages of ozonation 252 the detrimental effects of induced toxicity can be circumvented when an additional filtration adsorption step is applied after ozonation in terms of applicability to wastewater matrix conditions doc is the most critical constituent that needs to be controlled prior to ozonation while other characteristics such as tss or turbidity have a minor influence as they are not related to doc the lowest removal rates were obtained for ibuprofen oxazepam and sucralose and their removal could be analyzed in the evaluation of operational conditions to increase the sensitivity of the method further research should focus on investigating effluent toxicity elimination of antibiotic resistance genes and decision making based on operational costs and environmental impact conventional uv treatment for pathogen removal requires irradiances of 500 mj cm 2 and short residence times resulting in relatively low cumulative energy doses that minimize operating costs however these configurations are not efficient for omp removal not only because of the low transferred energies but also because of the intrinsic recalcitrance of most omps to direct uv photolysis the first obstacle has been overcome with the development of high intensity photoreactor modules to address the second problem the dosing of additional oxidants has proven effective while hydrogen peroxide in combination with high intensity uv treatment is already applied on a large scale persulfate and chlorine dioxide are still under investigation especially regarding the formation of toxic by products in addition the environmental impact of their production and the possible risks associated with their unintentional release must be considered all uv based processes require water with low turbidity to maximize transmittance so uv is usually applied after a clarification filtration step among the catalyst based technologies fenton based methods are the most studied however there is agreement that the working ph of fenton based methods is a clear drawback as chemicals are used both for acidification of the effluent and for ph correction before discharge or reuse this drawback should be solved by improving the reaction at neutral ph to see its real use in wwtps from an environmental point of view although the operational phase has worse impacts fenton based methods could have less impacts if the construction phase is considered heterogeneous processes are favorable compared to homogeneous processes due to the easy recovery of the catalyst and the avoidance of changes in water composition in addition research focused on the development of new materials capable of improving light utilization combined with a reusable catalyst operating under circumneutral conditions should be the main priority for further research work in this field in relation to the high environmental impact of mercury pressure lamp manufacturing alternative irradiation sources should be investigated although uv led irradiation is promising 253 it does not yet reach the energy efficiency of conventional lamps and cannot yet be considered an economically viable alternative moreover according to available data direct use of sunlight is more likely to remain a prospect for decentralized plants in the medium term however the indirect use of solar energy through photovoltaic plants could be an alternative worthy of consideration in remote areas 254 both gac and pac adsorption stages are effective against organic micropollutants however they do not achieve reliable removal of heavy metals pathogens and args in direct comparison of gac with ro a similar range of omp was removed by gac but ro was more efficient in removing heavy metals and volatile organic compounds 115 in terms of on site energy demand gac systems are preferable compared to energy intensive processes such as membrane filtration and ozonation however when production is included in the assessment gac can be more energy intensive than ozonation especially when adequate recycling systems are not applied end of life scenarios also have a high environmental impact 256 depending on the treatment goals gac processes can be integrated into treatment trains to efficiently exploit the benefits of this treatment stage for example when targeting higher omp removal in secondary effluents with high doc loading gac can be used as a polishing step after ozone aop treatment 40 92 in the case of pac recycling of spent adsorbent is currently not possible in most applications in terms of improving the economic and environmental impact of pac not only efficient recirculation and recycling schemes need to be further investigated but the materials applied must be renewable and not of fossil origin in the short term recycling of industrial waste such as fly ash from coal plants could also be a possibility 257 spent activated carbon sludge must be properly handled to prevent soil and surface water contamination researchers are currently investigating the factors influencing omp removal by activated carbon processes as well as the application of control strategies in order to increase the reliability of these processes reverse osmosis and nanofiltration processes an efficient barrier to retain most omp pathogens including args and heavy metals depending on the configuration desalination can be achieved which is an important treatment objective especially in reuse applications and results in a clear benefit of this technology compared to others under review from which only electrodialysis is a considerable alternative for salt removal the produced water can be provided with a reliable high quality provided that a proper control and maintenance protocol is applied maintenance ensures the preservation of the expensive membrane modules against fouling and scaling but requires backwashing procedures with antifoulants and antiscalants which contributes negatively to the environmental impact although the ro nf process is well established in regions with high water stress and comparatively low energy costs from an lca perspective reverse osmosis is not recommended by any of the articles reviewed in this study as the high energy consumption strongly impacts environmental indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions research should be directed towards the development of more durable and efficient membranes this could lead to lower membrane and energy costs as well as lower consumption of cleaning agents and thus lower environmental impact furthermore the generation of a waste stream in the range of 10 20 of the originally treated stream increases the environmental burden and decreases the treated water yield 258 possible solutions for the management of retentate are its recirculation to wwtp headworks evaporation ponds or aop treatments 259 for smaller volumes and higher intrinsic conductivity electrochemical oxidation seems a promising approach 141 electrochemical methods have great potential to reduce the environmental impacts associated with micropollutant removal as they mainly use electricity which can be considered as a clean chemical however pilot scale research is still scarce and the different technologies need to reach larger scales of implementation in a significant number of publications to consolidate this potential as highlighted in the lca section energy and chemical production are responsible for most of the environmental impacts in tertiary treatment electrochemical treatments could therefore be one of the keys in the quest to reduce chemical consumption for example electrooxidation does not use any chemical reagents while electro fenton processes produce h₂o₂ by electroreduction of oxygen as for energy consumption electrochemical systems can be easily combined with renewable energy sources but more studies are required to optimize the coupling 260 the integration of renewable energy sources in combination with electrochemical wastewater treatments is proven to reduce the environmental impacts produced by energy consumption 222 8 concluding remarks one of the drawbacks of the presented study is that peer reviewed research articles are a limited source of operational data given their specific focus and basic process parameters such as unit dimensions critical conventional wastewater parameters and flow rates are not always reported regarding the rapidly evolving research on tertiary treatment schemes more effort should be made in publishing reliable process related data in the peer reviewed literature nevertheless the overview presented on the state of the art of tertiary treatments clearly identifies the key points of both full scale processes already operated and innovative treatment processes based on these configurations and presents the solutions currently under development to meet the requirements of water safety standards a combination of different processes multi barrier approach is often essential for each individual case in addition to economic and technological considerations environmental constraints identified by a life cycle assessment must be incorporated into decision making many authors point out that the key issues for most tertiary treatments are the electrical energy and chemicals consumption more effort needs to be devoted to the characterization of the transformation products produced in the treatments to accurately assess the impact of the methods the variability of influent quality needs to be monitored to take advantage of the high adjustability of chemicals and added energy in the aop which will reduce process costs risks to personnel and the environment should be assessed prior to implementation for a complete risk assessment which is necessary for a sound life cycle assessment more attention should be paid to process evaluation based on toxicological data than to degradation efficiency alone however since so far the application of effect based effluent control is still under investigation treatment efficacy is regulated and compared based on indicator substance removal targets many authors argue that the low concentrations of micropollutants and the lack of systematic assessment of their long term effects when released into the environment mean that the environmental impact of new treatment trains outweighs the impacts of micropollutant discharge into the environment faced with this problem more environmental studies are needed to better understand the environmental profiles of tertiary treatments preferably under real wastewater conditions and on a larger scale to optimize construction and operation data especially energy and chemical consumption in addition more work is needed on the analysis of innovative tertiary techniques as the analyzed evaluations provided some contradictory results in parallel the characterization factors of micropollutants need to be revised and validated to improve the accuracy of lca results for effluents containing these pollutants the following are the supplementary data related to this article esm 1 bibliographic search

13134,in a context of increasing water scarcity it is essential to ensure an integrated watershed management savings in the consumption of water as a finite resource and improve the performance of wastewater treatment plants to guarantee the quality of treated effluents therefore advanced technologies for tertiary wastewater treatment have been widely studied in recent decades these treatments have been reviewed over the years mainly providing comparisons from a technical perspective however there is a lack of a holistic evaluation considering environmental and economic aspects together with the aforementioned technical aspects in this review treatment alternatives for micropollutant and pathogen abatement have been identified based on technologies implemented on a large scale ozonation ultraviolet treatment adsorption on activated carbon or membrane filtration as well as those treatments in the process of implementation such as electrochemical fenton based or photocatalytic techniques thus a systematic bibliographic search was performed considering works applying pilot and full scale equipment leaving lab scale results out of the analysis the description of each process allowed the identification of the technical feasibility operating costs and associated environmental impacts providing a comparative assessment that will help decision making in the development and application of the different technologies the benchmarking results reveal that the selected treatment should be chosen based on the source and specific pollutants present in the wastewater as there is no single solution for the treatment of micropollutants and pathogens in addition recommendations are presented for the publication of reliable process related data to facilitate comparison between different technologies and treatment scenarios keywords review tertiary treatment lca economic evaluation emerging pollutants 1 introduction population growth implies an increasing demand for natural resources such as water energy and food 1 in this context one of the most serious problems to be faced is the increasing water scarcity 2 this concept is defined as the imbalance between water demand and availability and is related to unbalanced consumption of water reserves declining quality of drinking water due to contamination or saline intrusion of surface waters and aquifers and increased periods of drought 3 the importance of access to safe drinking water and sanitation is highlighted and embedded in goal 6 of the united nations sustainable development goals 4 in order to address the problems related to water pollution large investments have been made in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 5 although wwtps are capable of removing organic matter and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous the occurrence of organic micropollutants omps such as personal care products pesticides endocrine disrupting chemicals or pharmaceuticals in different environmental compartments requires changes in the design and operation of wastewater facilities to ensure their removal and the quality of the treated effluents 6 7 as part of the implementation of the water framework directive the european union defined a list of priority substances that could pose a risk to the environment and human health the watch list reported in 2015 included two pharmaceuticals natural hormones three macrolide antibiotics pesticides an ultraviolet filter and an antioxidant subsequently three additional substances were added in 2018 an insecticide and two antibiotics with the primary objective of omps removal some tertiary treatment technologies such as membrane filtration or adsorption on activated carbon allow the retention of omps from the wastewater stream however the concentrated flow and the spent adsorbent have to be conveniently managed in a downstream process increasing the complexity of these techniques 8 the possibility of implementing advanced oxidation processes aops based on non specific oxidation mechanisms 9 such as ozonation or uv radiation are options that have had variable success since their large scale operation involves high operating costs due to their high energy requirements or lower kinetic rates beyond organic micropollutants special attention should be also paid to contamination by heavy metals which are generally classified as inorganic micropollutant as they are present in treated effluents in trace concentrations contamination due to heavy metals can occur naturally caused by the entrainment of geological material into surface waters although most heavy metal pollution has been determined to be anthropogenic deriving from the use of pesticides and fungicides as or pigments as cd cr cu pb ni as well as from the metallurgical as cd hg petrochemical cd pb or pyrotechnical as sectors 10 in this review pathogen removal is also considered for benchmarking since tertiary treatments are widely used as methods for pathogen abatement 11 the presence of pathogens is especially relevant in urban hospital livestock and agricultural wastewater since the release of microorganisms into water bodies contributes to the spread of pathogens and antibiotic resistances several review articles have recently been published on the benefits and drawbacks of advanced tertiary treatments for wastewater polishing mainly focusing on the technological aspects of treatments for instance experts from nereus cost action analyzed the best available technologies for water reuse for crop irrigation considering ozonation activated carbon adsorption chemical disinfectants uv radiation advanced oxidation processes and membrane filtration 12 the conclusion of the expert group is that a single advanced treatment method is not sufficient to minimize the release of chemicals of emerging concern and antibiotic resistant microorganisms luo et al analyzed the removal efficiency of the selected micropollutants in 14 countries and regions analyzing different tertiary systems such as coagulation flocculation activated carbon adsorption advanced oxidation processes nanofiltration reverse osmosis and membrane bioreactors 13 rizzo et al analyzed consolidated versus new tertiary treatment methods concluding that the lack of comparative research between the two categories complicates the evaluation of the most suitable and cost effective solution for the treatment of emerging contaminants 14 bui et al performed a multicriteria assessment of advanced treatment technologies for micropollutants removal including very brief references to environmental considerations and only including some of the available tertiary treatments i e adsorption ozonation uv h2o2 membrane processes and membrane bioreactors 15 the analyzed reviews are mainly focused on the technical aspects lacking the economic and environmental perspectives the search for new technological alternatives must meet the following objectives technological feasibility in the construction and operation of the equipment operational efficiency and reliability and reduction of environmental impacts and costs based on the score in each of the aforementioned sections decision making will be better supported by evidence and contrastable data 16 in accordance with european directives environmental and socioeconomic factors including consideration of human health must be considered in the assessment of advanced technologies in this sense the environmental impacts associated with tertiary treatments can be elucidated using the internationally standardized life cycle assessment lca methodology considering the environmental approach pesqueira et al conducted a literature review solely on the application of lca in tertiary wastewater treatment however the scope of the review focuses on the removal of priority substances and pollutants of emerging concern mentioned in european legislation including a total of 18 papers 17 in this study the focus was further extended to a total of 40 papers dealing with lca in tertiary treatments in consequence the main objective of this keyword based literature review is to perform a holistic analysis of the main technological developments in tertiary treatments from a sustainability perspective including not only efficiency variables but also environmental impacts and cost estimation the key aspects of the technologies were identified and evaluated for pilot and full scale studies considering technical and sustainability approaches concluding that the combination of multiple treatment processes is essential to meet the effluent requirements moreover the use of lca methodology as a powerful tool for decision making can highlight specific hotspots of the technologies complementing the information provided by economical and technological evaluation accordingly the main challenge is to emphasize the key data of each technology considering a joint technical environmental and economic approach providing useful information about the main drawbacks of present studies and desirable targets for future research 2 bibliographic search methodology the literature search was performed using the search tool provided by the scopus database in march 2021 the selection of manuscripts addressing the efficiency of tertiary wastewater treatments for the removal of micropollutants under technological economic and environmental criteria was conducted considering the scope of the review the search was limited to the technologies applied to wastewater treatment including the keywords wastewater treatment or waste water treatment in the search string in addition since the goal of tertiary treatments is the removal of micropollutants heavy metals and pathogens these words and their relevant abbreviations were considered in the formulation of search parameters by including their respective keywords for this purpose the search procedure used in the literature review is summarized in fig 1 along with the specific keywords and boolean operators tertiary treatments were classified into seven distinct groups to facilitate the search process i e ozonation ultraviolet catalyst based pressure driven activated carbon adsorption electrochemical and irradiation treatments moreover the results

review and the keywords were extracted and analyzed according to their occurrence and relationships as shown in fig 2 to clarify the data and homogenize the results the substitution of keywords by synonyms or abbreviations was conducted considering the formation of clusters involving keywords with high similarity esm 4 the bibliometric analysis includes all the results after the manual

main topic addressed i generic keywords this group formed by wastewater treatment tertiary treatments wastewater reuse and domestic wastewater terms that represent the target of the findings and the

antibiotics abs and represent the main target compounds evaluated iii technologies this group encompasses the different technologies used for tertiary wastewater treatment such as filtration ozonation uv or aops and iv treatment effectiveness this group includes the methods carried out for the evaluation of the technologies such as removal removal efficiency by products identification or toxicity fig 2 allows tertiary treatments to be classified between large scale applied technologies and more innovative processes and these trends are represented in the diagram focusing on the wastewater treatment circle and its relationships this keyword usually appears together with adsorption techniques as granulated activated carbon or powdered activated carbon gac pac ozonation filtration and uv indicating that the technologies most applied as advanced treatments for the removal of ppcps and omps are those mentioned above on the other hand there is an evident relationship between tertiary treatment and titania photocatalysis and solar treatment as well as a growing interest in pathogen removal this keyword appears related to others such as disinfection or presence in water of antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs and antibiotic resistance genes args showing the current concerns regarding thetransfer of antibiotic resistance to pathogens in the environment another issue to highlight is the close relationship between electrochemical methods and heavy metals hms showing the preferences for the use of this type of processes for the treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals adsorption techniques such as gac pac and filtration based treatments to remove contaminants were usually studied together as can be seen by the proximity of points and width of the relation line in general low presence of cross sectional keywords as economic assessment was observed considering the significance criteria only words with an occurrence of more than 3 were considered for the study as a result although some articles incorporate the economic evaluation of the technology the analysis from the environmental point of view is missing 4 technological aspects of tertiary treatments 4 1 ozone based treatments ozonation o₃ is a heterogeneous process applied for the oxidative treatment of drinking water and more recently for wastewater conversely to fully water miscible oxidants e g h₂o₂ mass transfer optimization from the gaseous to the aqueous phase must be considered typically bubble column reactors are used to contact the ozone with the water stream fig 3a ozonation has been studied mainly in continuous processes whereas batch operation is the setup of choice at pilot scale to optimize reaction conditions 18 20 most of the reviewed studies considered the application of ozonation to effluents from conventional secondary treatment plants however since ozonation uses non specific oxidation pathways to transform target compounds the versatility of this process allows its wide application such as for the removal of pollutants from surface groundwaters 21 23 as well as other types of wastewaters e g industrial effluents 24 25 or reject streams from ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis units 26 70 of the reviewed studies were located in europe whereas none of them was in africa as depicted in fig 3c the typical temperature of ozonation treated effluents ranges from 10 to 30 c depending on climatic conditions and wwtp location high temperatures can lead to volatilization of compounds facilitated by gas bubbling in general a ph above 8 favors ozone decomposition mediated by hydroxyl anions but this condition is not met in most wastewaters the ph values in the selected studies vary in the range of 6 0 to 10 5 respectively to a much greater extent than hydroxyl anions dissolved organic matter e g phenols and amines induces the formation of hydroxyl radicals through different pathways 27 28 it should be noted that the efficiency of the process can be hampered by high loadings of radical scavenging species such as carbonates halogen ions or nitrogen oxides 29 30 consequently the abundance of these species implies not only a reduction of the treatment efficiency but also the formation of toxic oxidation products when halogen ions are present in the reaction matrix bromate formation in a typical configuration relatively short removal times to achieve micropollutant removal vary from 5 to 30 min but can extend to longer periods as is the case for nonylphenol or bisphenol a with treatment times up to 100 min 31 in the case of organic matter removal it has been established that the ozone dose varies depending on the stream flow to be treated between values of 1 to 200 mg o₃ l 1 the typical parameters of ozonation are presented in fig 3b the electrophilic character of ozone and its high oxidation potential e0 2 07 v enhance its reactivity towards compounds with low oxidation state such as deprotonated amines sulfides and aromatic rings with electron donor groups 29 32 33 in addition to direct oxidation there are indirect oxidation pathways in which reactive oxygen species ros most notably oh radicals are produced 29 30 leading to the decomposition of water pollutants due to their high oxidation potential e0 2 80 v as seen in fig 3d 34 the studied pollutant concentrations are in the range of 0 1 ng l 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 for pharmaceuticals and pesticides and from 1 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 for the combination of ozonation with an electrochemical method 25 although most authors focus their research on ozone mediated micropollutant removal some works have studied degradation pathways as well as the consequences of treatment on the treated effluent in terms of toxicity estrogenicity or mutagenicity 31 35 36 different species have been considered for in vivo studies on the potential mutagenicity and toxicity of the treatment in particular using daphnia magna 37 aliivibrio fischeri 37 38 and potamopyrgus antipodarum 39 furthermore the formation of intermediates 40 or the influence of ozonation on args and arbs 38 41 have been studied as a special case the application of this process alone or in combination with gac and sand filter against inactivation of microorganisms provided reductions of up to 4 3 log removal value lrv for enterococci and escherichia coli bacteria 41 43 unlike in chlorination the formation of by products affecting water quality such as haloalkanes is prevented 44 to improve its efficiency and pollutant removal performance ozonation can be combined with uv irradiation 23 45 and hydrogen peroxide 26 37 uv light at wavelengths up to 310 nm provokes the dissociation of o3 into an oxygen molecule and hydrogen peroxide similarly the peroxone process o₃ h₂o₂ combines the oxidizing power of ozone with the decomposition of h₂o₂ to enhance the generation of oh radicals and has been shown to be effective in reducing ozone resistant micropollutants 27 one of the most important factors to consider in the peroxone process is the ratio of o₃ to h₂o₂ which governs the reaction rate however the high capacity of h2o2 regarding the degradation of omps allows kinetic improvements even when present in trace amounts 46 the h₂o₂ mediated generation of oh can consume up to half the amount of available o₃ 47 therefore the h₂o₂ o₃ ratio is generally set between 0 5 and 1 0 at pilot and full scale the reaction is often carried out in gas liquid reactors with a configuration similar to ozone bubbling columns alternatively the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in presence of uv irradiation leads the formation of additional oh radicals 23 48 catalytic ozonation o₃ cat makes use of a catalyst to promote the decomposition of ozone and the subsequent formation of ros although many homogeneous catalysts based on transition metal ions preferably bivalent have been investigated precipitation or lack of retention systems have prevented their large scale application 49 in the late 1990s the first pilot plants applied heterogeneous catalysts to improve ozonation efficiency in leachate treatment 50 applicable materials are iron flakes metal metal oxide coated ceramic membranes or clay minerals such as montmorillonite 49 51 the application of alumina based catalysts showed a significant enhancement of micropollutant removal compared to ozonation alone 52 in contrast the application of iron based catalysts for the removal of sulfamethoxazole showed no improvement compared to the results with the results obtained for conventional ozonation 53 on the other hand the possibility of integrating ozonation with electrochemical methods aims at the coagulation of dissolved metals 25 and will be applicable for wastewaters of high content in heavy metals the combination of ozonation with different types of activated carbon such as gac 54 55 biological activated carbon bac 56 57 biofiltration 38 55 or sand filtration 43 58 has been successfully applied as an example östman et al 59 reported the improvement in benzothiazole removal from 30 to 82 by incorporating a gac unit after the ozonation stage however in this study the application of sand filtration to this effluent did not show a significant effect 56 58 59 on the other hand the use of biological filters has been studied by knopp et al 55 and ternes et al 38 showing similar results to those obtained by the application of ozonation 4 2 ultraviolet treatments ultraviolet uv irradiation is commonly applied as disinfection step after biological treatment uv units for disinfection usually consist of cylindrical borosilicate modules housing mercury pressure lamps immersed in the wastewater stream fig 4a both low pressure lp lamps with a sharp emission peak at about 254 nm and medium pressure mp lamps with a broader emission spectrum in the uv c region 200 600 nm are applied the flow capacity of these full scale modules can be up to 3000 m3 h 1 60 in single pass mode for a residence time of less than 1 min the influent treated in the revised studies was characterized by a ph in the range of 7 0 7 6 and a temperature ranging between 18 and 24 c and comparably low tss and doc values fig 4b most of the considered studies were performed in europe with a concentration to the mediterranean area while the largest plants regarding treated flow were located in china only one study was in brazil focusing on pathogen removal pathogen removal by uv light typically ranges between 5 and 7 lrv at irradiance levels of 70 w m 2 these high removal values are necessary to mitigate the effect of bacterial regrowth after uv treatment 61 this possibility is of particular concern when reclaimed wastewater is stored in buffer tanks prior to use for agricultural purposes it should be noted that certain species of bacteria show resistance to uv treatment while the most commonly investigated e coli bacteria are effectively removed even within a short residence time pseudomonas strains are frequently detected in effluent from uv disinfection units 42 regarding the elimination of genetic patterns relevant to the evolution of antibiotic resistances several studies reported that uv treatment only selectively eliminates args and reported removals of dna or gene fragments was lower than for pathogens esm 6 60 62 pathogen removal by uv light typically ranges between 5 and 7 lrv at irradiance levels of 70 w m 2 these high removal values are necessary to mitigate the effect of bacterial regrowth after uv treatment 61 this possibility is of particular concern when reclaimed wastewater is stored in buffer tanks prior to use for agricultural purposes it should be noted that certain species of bacteria show resistance to uv treatment while the most commonly investigated e coli bacteria are effectively removed even within a short residence time pseudomonas strains are frequently detected in effluent from uv disinfection units 42 regarding the elimination of genetic patterns relevant to the evolution of antibiotic resistances several studies reported that uv treatment only selectively eliminates args and reported removals of dna or gene fragments was lower than for pathogens esm 6 60 62 although many authors have studied omp removal in full scale modules designed for disinfection 63 these approaches only lead to slight removal efficiencies for applied irradiances up to 500 mj cm 2 even an irradiance of 4000 mj cm 2 only resulted in a removal of 0 77 lrv of micropollutants 64 similar removal percentages for endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs were reported by cédat et al 65 at irradiance of 1000 mj cm 2 it was also shown that estrogenicity could not be satisfactorily removed even though the parent compounds were partially transformed 66 regardless of the lamp intensity in the photolysis process it is required that the target omps absorb the uv radiation in the range of the lamp spectrum to be abated however only a few organic micropollutants present in wastewater undergo photolysis at the applied wavelength of 245 nm these are for example sulfamethoxazole with a removal efficiency between 22 and 70 67 depending on the applied irradiance 63 68 69 and diclofenac between 45 and 100 61 68 fig 4d even if the target molecule is not susceptible to photolysis it may undergo secondary radical transformation promoted by light induced excitation of electrons from compounds present in the matrix generally the studies reviewed were operated at dissolved organic carbon doc values below 15 mg l 1 with few exceptions still most of the investigated omps are only degraded to a negligible extent 70 or even with negative removal efficiencies 71 72 this may be related to several factors such as photolysis of coupling products towards the original compounds errors in quantitative measurements due to matrix interference or desorption of residual particulate matter 66 none of the investigated studies consider the fate of heavy metals during uv treatment as uv irradiation is known to have no effect on their removal uv treatment combined with hydrogen peroxide uv h₂o₂ produces reactive hydroxyl radicals as light with wavelengths 254 nm induces photodissociation of h₂o₂ 70 resulting in enhanced micropollutant removal 73 75 typically a h₂o₂ dose of 10 mg l 1 is applied in photoreactors equipped with dosing mixing systems that are already commercially available for large scale applications 65 76 various reactor geometries have been evaluated to maximize mixing and irradiation 68 however the benefits of combining sunlight or uv with hydrogen peroxide are less prominent for antibiotic removal and disinfection 67 although h2o2 is the most used oxidant it has been shown that the use of other oxidants considerably minimizes bacterial regrowth compared to uv treatment alone 61 regarding omp removal efficiencies are highly dependent on the type of contaminants so variable energy efficiency values were obtained ranging from 0 16 18 kw m 3 for ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin respectively 10 it is therefore necessary to evaluate and model the degradation kinetics of the expected micropollutants both in laboratory and at pilot scale 66 67 77 other oxidants such as ozone chlorine chlorine dioxide and persulfate in combination with uv treatment have been also investigated for omp removal 73 75 compared to oh radicals cl and so₄ radicals have been reported to be less prone to deactivation by matrix constituents such as hco₃ or no₃ and to have less affinity towards natural organic matter 61 77 the underlying mechanisms of radical formation and reaction with omp are described in detail elsewhere 78 79 4 3 adsorption on activated carbon although advanced materials such as zeolites or carbon nanotubes are gaining interest as adsorbents in wastewater polishing activated carbon is used as the predominant material depending on the grain size as powdered activated carbon pac or granular activated carbon gac powdered activated carbon is applied in grain sizes of 50 100 μm with a bet surface area between 900 and 1300 m2 g 1 80 pac is usually added to the effluent of the biological treatment stage in a 81 83 loading range between 10 and 20 mg l 1 one of the constraints in the design of different process configurations must ensure the retention of spent pac 84 achieved by 1 the implementation of a sedimentation unit 85 86 or by 2 sand anthracite or expanded shale bed filter columns or in some cases by 3 membrane filtration units fig 5a in the latter two options pac recycling can be achieved by backwashing to maximize the carbon usage rate however in the first case it is necessary to improve pac retention by coagulation flocculation which requires the addition of fe3 based coagulants 83 in some cases an anionic polymer is additionally applied as a flocculant 85 alternatives where pac is directly applied in membrane bioreactors mbr may pose problems in sludge management 87 as spent pac is mixed with the sludge matrix and cannot be regenerated after use a promising advance in process simplification is the development of μgac which is coarser and thus easier to separate and regenerate 88 89 gac units are mainly applied continuously in packed bed filter columns fig 5a which have to be replaced after the breakthrough threshold is reached several columns are applied in series or in parallel while each configuration has drawbacks and advantages 90 91 the same applies to the filtration direction either downflow or upflow which results in different head loss profiles while the removal efficiency was reported only slightly higher in the upflow configuration 90 in all cases regular backwashing is required to impede pressure buildup and can increase the operation time of the filter columns based on experience during one year of pilot scale operation kårelid et al 87 estimated the maintenance time to be 30 60 min per day the most critical factors of the wastewater matrix that affect the stable performance of gac filters are doc and ph value these values are between 6 and 11 mg l 1 q1 q3 and 7 0 7 6 q1 q3 respectively tss are considered to have a minor effect on the removal performance of gac filters but high levels require increased backwashing and range from 3 to 6 mg l 1 q1 q3 in the reviewed studies 40 92 fig 5b fig 5c shows the geographical distribution of the revised studies based on activated carbon indicating a focus of implementation in central and western europe and the usa this is explainable by the stricter legislation regarding the presence of omp in wwtp effluents implemented in switzerland and local initiatives as in some german federal states north rhine westphalia and baden wurttemberg both pac and gac can be considered as a strong barrier against most micropollutants 87 93 due to the numerous gac products available variable wastewater composition and complex interaction mechanisms a quantitative prediction of treatment capacity and gac breakthrough values is not straightforward and must be performed on a case by case basis 89 another factor that adds complexity to the description of gac processes and modeling of breakthrough behavior is the development of a biofilm in the gac bed over a prolonged operating time which ultimately turns them into bac filters 55 while adsorption related removal efficiency will decrease during microbial evolution biodegradation becomes more relevant 40 94 95 as expected in relation to the larger surface area a smaller gac particle size is usually favorable for omp removal 59 the data obtained from the revised studies indicates that the gac process can achieve higher maximal removals for all selected indicator compounds but the data is more scattered than in the pac process most critical compounds were diazepam valsartan acesulfame k and sulfamethoxazole while atenolol bezafibrate and metoprolol were removed 80 in most studies fig 5d in particular higher pka values and hydrophobicity of omp favor adsorption onto negatively charged activated carbon 22 94 depending on the treatment goals and quality of treated water gac processes can be integrated into treatment trains e g gac is often used as a polishing step after ozone aop treatment combining the benefit of low doc content and the efficient removal of ozonation oxidation byproducts 4 4 pressure driven membrane filtration treatments in reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf processes water is pumped through a variable set of pressurized membrane elements yielding a treated permeate stream and a concentrated retentate stream the percentage of the permeate flux regarding the influent flux is defined as recovery ranging between 50 and 90 18 high recoveries can be achieved by applying two consecutive stages feeding the second stage with retentate from the first stage while higher permeate quality can be reached by a second pass through another stage fig 6a the most commonly applied polymeric membranes have a lifetime of about 5 years depending on the quality of the treated water 96 recently ceramic membranes are gaining interest despite higher manufacturing costs due to their longer lifetime which can reach a duration 20 years 97 98 in the reviewed studies the operation of spiral wound polymeric modules in crossflow configuration is preferred over flat sheet configuration while membrane areas between 2 2 and 14 0 m2 for pilot scale 99 100 and between 1000 and 3000 m2 for full scale were investigated in both nf and ro processes pressures in the range of 7 15 bar are applied necessary to overcome the membrane resistance and the osmotic pressure between permeate and concentrate 18 pressure must be carefully monitored as its sudden decrease reflects membrane damage while continuous increase in pressure indicates membrane fouling scaling due to the deposition of salts colloids and organic matter clogging the pores 101 103 despite some exceptions where tss concentrations were up of 1800 mg l 1 for pharmaceutical effluents 104 and 390 mg l 1 for primary treated municipal wastewaters 105 tss and doc levels are lower with maximum concentrations of 15 mg l 1 96 and 30 mg l 1 106 respectively considering the susceptibility to fouling ro and nf systems are usually preceded by an ultrafiltration uf module or a membrane bioreactor mbr high water temperatures 30 c usually lead to a decrease in membrane performance 107 108 fig 6b despite the limitations imposed by influent quality the implementation of ro nf as an alternative to secondary biological treatment has already been applied as a decentralized treatment solution to produce high quality effluent 105 nevertheless the main application at large scale is water reclamation in the range of 150 000 450 000 m3 d 1 in regions with high water scarcity 109 the studies considered in this review were performed at smaller scale plants which ranged from 50 to 180 l h 1 pilot 96 110 and 24 168 m3 d 1 full scale 105 111 a relevant share 39 of the studies reviewed in our work were conducted in spain while studies were distributed worldwide including studies from south africa brazil and india fig 6c focusing on the group of target contaminants the most studied compounds in the reviewed publications are carbamazepine cbz caffeine caf diclofenac dfc ibuprofen ibu and sulfamethoxazole smx are presented in fig 6d the removal efficiency for both technologies is similar for the analyzed pollutants except for carbamazepine for which ro proved more effective retention of omp is mainly governed by size exclusion however several factors such as hydrophobicity surface loading of contaminants or biofilm formation can positively influence retention 111 although most studies report excellent removal of omp e g sulfamethoxazole diclofenac ibuprofen and atenolol below the detection limit this is not the case for some compounds especially of small molecular weight 112 for example the small endocrine disruptor bisphenol a or nitrosamines such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and other ozonation aop byproducts are frequently found in ro permeates 111 113 in this regard it may be beneficial to apply ro nf stages prior to aop processes as it has been shown that ndma precursors such as ranitidine can be efficiently removed by nf and ro 114 it should be noted that lower concentrations of omp are more difficult to remove possibly due to slower reaction rates and or matrix effects 112 which also emphasizes the need for investigations at environmental concentrations in order not to overestimate the efficiency of the process research studies rarely focus on pathogen removal by ro and nf stages as they are usually preceded by an ultrafiltration unit to avoid biofilm growth although ultrafiltration membranes are a sufficient barrier against bacteria viruses and omps are only sufficiently retained by nf and ro membranes 96 115 nf and ro are also effective for heavy metal removal but this feature is only relevant in special applications e g highly contaminated landfill leachate or construction site effluents 116 117 since heavy metals in municipal effluents are mostly successfully retained in secondary biological treatment 4 5 catalyst based processes instead of directly using photon energy to decompose micropollutant structures ros are formed during photocatalytic processes using materials with semiconducting properties or based on light driven decomposition of hydrogen peroxide photo fenton due to the higher energy requirements of uv light compared to solar light recent work focuses on the search for new materials capable of exploiting the advantages of this type of irradiation with a focus on reducing energy consumption resulting in greater technological feasibility for large scale implementation fig 7a in photocatalysis processes approximately half of the studies have used solar light and provide irradiance between 20 and 40 w m 2 in lower latitude areas 118 120 the most applied technologies were pilot raceway pond reactors rpr or compound parabolic reactors cpr while the studied rpr reactors have an illuminated area of less than 0 5 m2 and a depth of 5 to 15 cm to cope with a working volume of about 20 100 l 120 122 the largest pilot cpc plants for wastewater treatment have a treatment capacity around 100 l in batch operating mode 123 125 the most frequent parameters studied with these techniques were depicted in fig 7b heterogeneous photocatalysts pc in wastewater treatment are based on the use of solid state metal oxides with semiconducting properties in these materials the valence and conduction bands vb and cb are separated by an energy band gap upon irradiation of photons with an energy equal to or higher than this energy electrons in the vb are promoted to the cb the formation of electron hole pairs provides sites for the generation of ros by oxidation and reduction reactions acting as direct oxidant when an organic molecule serves as an electron donor or as indirect oxidant by generation of oh which in turn attacks organic molecules 126 in theory organic micropollutants could be completely mineralized as the radical reactions are non specific and are capable of degrading a wide range of compounds however the generation of by products in the intermediate steps must be assessed 127 the most widely applied photocatalyst in large scale wastewater treatment is tio2 since it can be applicable for solar light absorption directly due to its absorption wavelengths 128 however modification of semiconductors by doping their structure with other metals has been studied to improve photo efficiency 129 although the use of zno based materials are potential candidates due to their higher electron mobility and similar properties compared to tio2 the undesired high electron hole recombination is the main drawback for their application 130 furthermore zno is more susceptible to photo corrosion than tio2 the generated zn2 ions can increase the toxicity of the effluent 131 materials with a narrower band gap and lower charge recombination rate have been developed to increase the share of usable solar spectrum one of the main drawbacks of heterogeneous photocatalysis is the limitation of reaction rates due to low mass transfer kinetics between phases the use of nanostructured materials increases the surface to volume ratio and electron hole pairs are more exposed to the surface where they can act as a reactive center another challenge is that in most photocatalytic materials the rapid electron hole recombination process causes 90 of the active sites generated by photon absorption to be depleted before they can act as a catalytic site this phenomenon can be partially avoided by the inclusion of certain components in the crystal structures known as dopants which improve catalytic efficiency 132 in order to ensure efficient catalyst separation numerous options have been evaluated such as immobilization on supports like biopolymers 133 magnetite nanocomposites 134 glass plates 135 polymeric support materials 136 or membranes 137 hydroxyl radicals generated in photocatalytic systems enable pathogen elimination through non specific mechanisms which trigger the destruction of cell membranes and damage to genetic material 138 in fenton based methods ros are generated by reductive and oxidative decomposition of h₂o₂ by fe2 and fe3 species at acidic ph respectively the limiting step in this process is the regeneration of fe3 to fe2 by irradiation with light of wavelength 580 nm the regeneration of the catalyst by photochemical pathways is enhanced conventional fenton f and photo fenton pf reactions produce a considerable amount of iron sludge the increased turbidity caused by the abundance of fe3 can further limit efficiency as light transmission decreases 70 the fact that fenton based reactions require an acidic ph implies subsequent neutralization of treated waters and increased salt concentration 14 this can be minimized by the application of ligands that increase iron solubility even at circumneutral ph moreover the photo induced regeneration of fe2 species reduces iron consumption and precipitation of iron oxides thus increasing the stability of photocatalyst 139 another way to stabilize catalysts at circumneutral ph values is the use of heterogeneous catalysts iron oxides can be applied as magnetite which also allows the magnetic separation of the catalyst 261 in this case the use of nanostructured materials has the same advantages and disadvantages as in semiconductor photocatalysis in this context the homogeneous photo fenton process is the most studied photocatalytic technology using fe ii sulfate as catalyst at ph around 3 fig 7c alternatively a larger range between 6 and 8 has been considered stabilizing the solubilized iron with ligands such as ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds 140 141 humic acid 140 or citrate 106 for circumneutral ph values for both acidic and neutral conditions the fenton based processes provided high removal percentages for most of the studied compounds for reaction times up to one hour following the same trends as the ozonation process the most studied compounds were sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine followed by n acetil 4 aminoantipyrine and trimethoprim in most cases the lowest removal percentages were obtained for sulfamethoxazole pathogen removal was also evaluated with studies focusing on the degradation of escherichia coli 118 142 and enterococcus species 123 143 reaching inactivation of 3 0 to 4 5 lrv typical catalyst concentrations range from 1 to 20 mg l 1 iron although the most common concentration is 5 mg l 1 and hydrogen peroxide is in the range of 10 100 mg l 1 121 123 144 in contrast in semiconductor based catalysis the catalyst loadings are higher between 100 and 1000 mg l 1 the different catalyst loadings are due to the type of reaction as heterogeneous catalysis rates are governed by the interaction between the dissolved substances and the surface furthermore the reaction times required for similar degradation percentages are significantly longer being in the range of 1 to 7 h 47 145 146 modification of the tio₂ catalyst using graphitic carbon nitrides 146 supports as poly methyl methacrylate 136 or metals 99 provided better results that the bare ones considering the results obtained with solar simulators 122 146 147 variable irradiance depending on weather conditions latitude and solar incidence poses a challenge for reactor efficiency and process regulation since irradiation energy is closely related to compound degradation some authors report removal rates by comparing the results versus the total energy input to the system for solar processes where irradiance is a function of time of day 47 106 141 although the number of studies focused on the influence of degradation parameters in wwtp effluents is extensive fewer studies focus on other types of waters such as industrial effluents with specific pollutants 145 148 149 or ro nf concentrates 106 in addition the combination of these catalytic techniques with precipitation units 149 or electrochemical processes 141 146 has been studied for specific purposes such as metal removal however it is reported that drinking water resources contaminated with heavy metals of geogenic or industrial origin as well as waters containing omp are not sufficiently removed with solar photocatalysis 150 4 6 electrochemical treatments the classification of electrochemical treatments encompasses a wide number of methods grouped around the use of electrochemistry under different typologies and characteristics as they can be used as a single stage or in combination with other techniques for the techno economic assessment information was sought on eight distinct treatments see table s1 electrooxidation electroreduction including cathodic deposition electrocoagulation electrodialysis fenton based methods photo electrocatalysis sono electrochemical and electroperoxone techniques electrochemical wastewater treatments were originally proposed to remove heavy metals from mining wastewater by cathodic deposition two examples focus on the recovery of nickel and copper from pickling and electroplating wastewaters 149 151 but there are not many examples of full scale experiments for the removal of micropollutants in wastewater see table s1 since electrochemical methods comprise a wide variety of techniques the number of publications per category is limited thus electrocoagulation electrodialysis and fenton based electrochemical methods are the techniques with more publications with 11 9 and 6 respectively as depicted in fig 8 electrocoagulation ec is particularly effective in the removal of heavy metals and is applied in the treatment of effluents from the mining metallurgical and paper industries or landfill leachate 24 25 152 154 during electrocoagulation the sacrificial anodic material e g iron or aluminum releases metal ions that from hydroxides in the reaction medium these species lead to neutralization of the surface charges of particulate organic or inorganic matter subsequently aggregation occurs due to van der waals interactions and the generated flocs can be removed by sedimentation or filtration 155 156 for example ec treatment resulted in up to 7 lrv of microorganisms and several pharmaceuticals such as sulfamethoxazole 59 or iopromide 31 from tertiary treated wastewater 157 in addition to standard iron or aluminum electrodes magnesium electrodes also demonstrated their technical feasibility at pilot scale obtaining a removal efficiency of 65 85 for cephalosporin based antibiotics 158 ec accomplished arsenic removal from contaminated groundwater with a removal efficiency of 128 4 μg l 1 per kwh in a plant operated for 2 years with iron electrodes 159 ec has also been used in combination with ozonation or h₂o₂ to treat groundwater resulting in an effective removal of arsenic chromium nickel and copper below detection limits 25 160 electrodialysis ed is an electrochemically assisted separation technique used to transport ions from solution across ion exchange membranes usually alternating compartments separated by cation and anion exchange membranes aided by an external electric field the technique has high selectivity and is considered cost effective as it reduces the need for chemical consumption in addition it can be used for product recovery from waste streams ed is implemented on an industrial scale but is mainly applied to desalinate brackish water guerreri et al 161 provided an excellent review of the fundamentals of the electrodialysis process along with a detailed description of its practical applications for wastewater treatment and resource recovery shen et al 162 studied the recovery of 2 amino 1 propanol sulfate an intermediate for the pharmaceutical industry at pilot scale obtaining up to 98 recovery and a 15 reduction in operating cost compared to the conventional recovery procedure however the pilot scale plants found in the literature are only intended to treat water contaminated with heavy metals for example a 200 l plant installed in an electroplating wastewater treatment plant allowed reducing heavy metal concentration and conductivity 163 electrodialysis was also used for the treatment of municipal solid waste incineration residues in water suspension to reduce leaching of heavy metals 164 165 and for recycling contaminated wastewater for reuse in agriculture 166 although there are no pilot scale experiments the use of electrodialysis could be useful for the separation of pharmaceuticals and emerging contaminants however transport across membranes is reported to depend on hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions between contaminants and ed membranes 167 fenton based processes are also widely studied in combination with electrochemistry for instance fenton and photo fenton processes can be upgraded to electro fenton ef and photoelectro fenton pef enabling the on line electro generation of hydrogen peroxide using a gas diffusion electrode as the cathode by o2 reduction additionally fe3 can be regenerated at the cathode from the reduction of fe2 thus reducing the amount of sludge production there are several approaches to the process as fe ions can be produced by a sacrificial iron anode or if a heterogeneous fenton process is used the anodic process can be integrated with elox electrodes to foster a synergistic oxidation potential among other approaches solar photoelectro fenton spef is gaining much attention because it uses solar radiation instead of artificial light reducing energy consumption and associated treatment costs more information on fenton process and its different approaches can be found elsewhere 168 169 the mineralization of chloramphenicol by ef and spef was studied in a 10 l pilot plant spef was much more efficient than ef using the same conditions resulting in 89 and 45 of the antibiotic degradation respectively however spef presented an elevated energy consumption of 30 8 kwh m 3 with a current efficiency of 36 170 furthermore the authors note that the use of bdd anodes resulted in a much more efficient oxidation of chloramphenicol based on previous experiments in a lab scale stirred reactor complete mineralization of levofloxacin was achieved using a pre pilot flow plant consisting of a filter press reactor coupled to a photoreactor with very low specific energy consumption 171 an electro fenton filtration system based on iron nanoparticles attached to carbon felt electrodes achieved only up to 85 degradation of diclofenac but at neutral ph and low electrical conductivity 172 additionally a pef type process based on the substitution of h₂o₂ by hclo and uv light for fe2 regeneration achieved complete sulfamethoxazole degradation at relatively low current densities and without the generation of toxic chloro organics 170 electrooxidation elox has the potential to remove a broad range of omp and is especially promising in the abatement of perfluorocarboxylic acids which are recalcitrant to other aops 173 as the oxidation takes place at the surface of the anode mass transfer limitations due to low pollutant concentration in wastewater streams may reduce the efficiency of the process therefore it is preferable to use this technology in pre concentrated streams e g for leachate treatment from hospitals industries or landfills or membrane filtration retentates heavy metals can be removed by electrodeposition on the cathode however this process can also lead to passivation 174 the removal of 12 emerging contaminants from wwtp secondary effluents was evaluated in a pilot system to study the application of elox from reverse osmosis concentrate reporting excellent results with degradation values between 94 and 97 except for ibuprofen for which only 70 abatement was achieved 175 salmerón et al compared different fenton based technologies at natural ph using a complexing agent to keep iron in solution with anodic oxidation approaches for the treatment of nanofiltration retentates 141 solar assisted elox outperformed ef and spef due to the high chloride concentrations of the retentate achieving a total degradation of 80 however a high concentration of chlorate was detected in the treated effluents another promising application is the enhancement of ozone treatment with the electrochemical generation of h₂o₂ the so called electro peroxone process although only one pilot scale example was found in the literature 23 in this paper the authors report the removal of 90 of selected pharmaceuticals at a flow rate of 113 l h 1 requiring an ozone dose of 9 3 mg l 1 and an electrical energy input of 0 135 kwh m 3 furthermore the electro peroxone process has been shown to reduce bromate formation in bench and pilot scale operations due to reduced o3 lifetimes and h₂o₂ mediated quenching of relevant intermediates 23 176 electrochemical coupled photocatalytic or ultrasonic techniques for pollutant degradation have not seen much use out of laboratory scale photo electrocatalysis pec improves the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation by increasing the lifetime of the electron hole pairs created in the semiconductor there are no pilot or large scale investigations of photo electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants in the literature however there is reasonable potential for large scale treatment of water streams using the pec process as stable continuous operation at a 50 ml lab scale reactor achieving more than 80 degradation of tetracycline 146 sonoelectrochemical techniques include several methods such as sonoelectrolysis or sonoelectro fenton which have been successfully studied at laboratory scale 177 as in the case of pec no examples of micropollutant removal at pilot or larger scale have been found in the literature review 4 7 irradiation treatments the classification of irradiation techniques comprises ultrasonic and electromagnetic radiation application to treat contaminated waters in the case of ultrasonic irradiation sonochemical treatments use high power ultrasound in three different approaches formation of hydroxyl radicals pyrolytic decomposition or supercritical water oxidation 178 regarding electromagnetic irradiation two techniques have been used to some extent i electron beam treatments that produce highly reactive species formed from water radiolysis 179 and ii microwave treatments that degrade organic molecules mainly via thermal effects caused by rapid heating at the molecular level 180 the literature search shows the limited application of this group of techniques in the field of wastewater treatment from the 169 initial results in the initial search see table s1 the number was reduced to 2 manuscripts in the selected papers exploring the combination of ozone with ultrasound 181 and ultrasonic assisted uv treatment 182 therefore the technological status of this group of treatment techniques is still far from actual pilot and real scale implementation 5 environmental aspects of tertiary treatments as lca is an internationally standardized method to identify environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a technology it can provide excellent insight into the environmental strengths and weaknesses of the different technologies and complement the technical and economic indicators of the systems under study the publications assessing the environmental profile of tertiary water treatment plants are summarized in the supplementary information esm 5 together with some relevant data such as location wastewater origin functional unit or assessment methods among others close to 50 of the manuscripts refer to lab scale operation despite the idea that lca is a methodology that is mostly applied to mature technologies as there is a paradigm shift in which lca is used prospectively to support decision making in the early phase of research and technology development to compare novel processes with existing commercial alternatives however there are some methodological and practical difficulties that need to be addressed such as lack of data uncertainty and how to deal with the extrapolation of laboratory data to full scale process 183 most of the studies analyzing the environmental impacts of tertiary treatments include uv techniques and ozonation which account for more than 50 of the selected publications in order of relevance activated carbon units stand out accounting for 25 of the total number of manuscripts among the innovative treatments fenton based methods represent 25 of the publications with solar photo fenton being the most evaluated approach surprisingly reverse osmosis and nanofiltration which are widely used tertiary treatment and drinking water purification technologies are hardly studied using the lca approach most of the reports have been conducted in europe there is limited evidence from central and south america as well as from the african and asian continents in terms of the scope of lcas the operational phase is the most studied as the main environmental impact is assumed to occur in this phase as the construction and decommissioning phases are considered non significant 8 184 in contrast the impact of the construction phase of the primary and secondary stages of a wwtp is widely studied 185 therefore the construction phase of tertiary treatment is slowly starting to see more inclusion within the system boundaries in recent years 186 187 as lca is an internationally standardized method to identify environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a technology it can provide excellent insight into the environmental strengths and weaknesses of the different technologies and complement the technical and economic indicators of the systems under study the publications assessing the

contrast the impact of the construction phase of the primary and secondary stages of a wwtp is widely studied 185 therefore the construction phase of tertiary treatment is slowly starting to see more inclusion within the system boundaries in recent years 186 187 tertiary treatments were considered in many cases as an additional step for conventional wwtp effluents either to reuse water or to improve effluent quality as environmental benefits of water reuse through tertiary treatment in real wwtps are identified 188 190 filtration techniques are already implemented for wastewater treatment either alone or in combination with other techniques in this context awad et al 191 studied a basic tertiary treatment based on chemical coagulation followed by sand filtration which improved global impact categories such as abiotic depletion acidification eutrophication or global warming the key to impact reduction was water reuse without increasing energy consumption within the water reuse approach another study was conducted in tehran in which 20 different configurations were considered including established treatments such as uv uf or ro however the publication focuses more on the development of a method to aid decision making on the type of water reuse irrigation industrial parks etc and the configuration and associated costs of the technologies to choose for each case 192 in france several types of treatment trains combining different types of filtration with uv treatments and disinfection were evaluated to reuse water and comply with french legislation 193 in this case sand filtration with uv was the best alternative since it entailed the lowest energy consumption while still complying with quality regulations ultraviolet treatments are commonly used in combination with oxidizing species or other treatment techniques to synergistically improve the efficiency foteinis et al 194 analyzed different light driven processes such as solar and uv photolysis in combination with h₂o₂ and concluded that the main impact was due to electricity consumption and that chemicals did not affect negatively due to their low dosage however other studies reported environmental problems due to the addition of oxidants to uv treatments for example the removal of micropollutants in hospital wastewater treated by uv irradiation technology combined with h₂o₂ showed that the addition of peroxide has a great influence on the environmental impact due to its production process furthermore it was shown that low pressure lamps have a significantly lower impact than medium pressure uv lamps 195 furthermore a uv unit was applied to remove these contaminants followed by the addition of sulfate based oxidants apart from the promising economic data the production of oxidizing agents is the main hot spot of these systems which increases the impacts in several categories 196 uv radiation was also combined with an electrochemical oxidation system to treat textile wastewater this system demonstrated its technological feasibility and good environmental performance compared to conventional biological and tertiary treatment although the salts used as electrolyte had the greatest impact on the system the addition of a reconstitution step to reuse water and salts proved to be beneficial to the process 197 the environmental impacts of ozonation were less studied than those of uv but there are studies reporting that ozonation impacts are reduced when compared to uv treatments 184 198 while others point out in the opposite direction reporting high environmental impacts for ozonation when compared to uv treatments 199 however when compared to nanofiltration or adsorption on activated carbon ozonation is less favored due to its inability to remove heavy metals and the production of harmful by products 200 ozonation was also evaluated at laboratory scale to remove micropollutants in wwtp effluents noting that the amount of ozone applied and the type of columns play an important role for the environmental assessment the toxicity of residual ozone in the effluent has to be taken into account as there is a trade off between the reduction of micropollutant toxicity and greenhouse gases ghg emissions from ozone production 201 the environmental impacts of activated carbon adsorption technologies were evaluated in several investigations for instance different ac approaches were evaluated in a large scale pilot fluidized bed the results showed better performance of μgac compared to pac obtaining a similar outcome of gac for a fixed bed in previous studies the μgac technology also showed better environmental performance than regular gac generating impacts that are about ten times lower than bibliographic results 202 thompson et al evaluated wood biochar as an alternative material to activated carbon in the removal of micropollutants 187 a priori it appears that wood biochar is more environmental friendly than activated carbon however the impacts were distributed between activated charcoal and biochar since the data were obtained through a laboratory scale operation the use of ac produced from local waste biomass in a large scale wwtp was found to have a lower environmental impact for the removal of micropollutants compared to conventional ac 203 however it is reported that poorly designed systems and pre treatment drying of feedstocks could result in worse environmental footprints than conventional carbon 204 li et al 205 compared ozonation gac and ro technologies with the main objective to remove micropollutants in domestic wastewater while all technologies showed good micropollutant removal reverse osmosis performed significantly worse when energy consumption is considered in this study the authors did not perform an lca comparison for the different scenarios to obtain the alternative with the best environmental performance rahman et al 206 207 conducted a comparative study between these treatments including the additional consideration of uv h₂o₂ in terms of ecotoxicity and human toxicity gac and ozonation showed the best results while again the worst results were obtained for the ro process however the advantage of ac adsorption compared to ozonation was found to be negligible although it could be significant depending on the profile of the electricity mix 202 the electrical energy demand for gac processes in wwtps is 2 4 times lower compared to ozonation but when cumulative energy demands e g production and transport are considered the gac process consumes 30 more energy and emits more ghgs than ozonation 59 208 ghg emissions can be reduced by 80 if spent carbon is recycled although transport and dewatering costs and mass losses of 5 15 per regeneration cycle must be taken into account recycling of spent carbon requires less energy and is more economical than producing fresh gac due to shorter pyrolysis times 209 moreover benstoem et al could not observe an advantage of using virgin carbon over reused carbon in a meta analysis 210 fenton based processes are by far the most studied among those considered innovative tertiary treatments especially when coupled to solar light despite the proven efficiency of solar photo fenton or photoelectro fenton solar photo fenton was more environmentally friendly in terms of energy than photoelectro fenton 211 212 following these studies rodríguez et al also considered the evaluation of heterogeneous and homogeneous fenton processes at laboratory scale but using real wastewater of a pharmaceutical industry 213 although both configurations had acceptable efficiencies for micropollutant removal the homogeneous fenton had higher environmental impacts caused mainly by sludge production and higher operating temperature than the heterogeneous fenton which had problems related to chemical consumption ioannou ttofa et al 186 evaluated the solar fenton method in a pilot plant considering all system inputs including the operational phase and the construction phase the sustainability of this technology is very promising since its carbon footprint is only 8 7 kg co2 per cubic meter of treated wastewater the environmental impact of fenton based removal processes was also compared with established tertiary technologies such as ozonation or nanofiltration arzate et al 214 compared ozonation which is considered as an energy demanding process with solar photo fenton which a priori is considered a sustainable technology the photo fenton process performed worse than ozonation due to the amount of chemicals required and the ph requirements in addition continuous operation is hampered by non uniform irradiation for example additional storage technology would need to be installed to harvest solar energy for night time operation gallego schmid et al 215 evaluated solar photo fenton at different ph and with and without the incorporation of a nanofiltration technology the results of arzate et al 214 showed a similar trend in which solar photo fenton had the worst impacts in most of the environmental categories analyzed furthermore tarpani and azapagic 200 included more technologies in the comparison and analyzed the abovementioned processes ozonation solar photo fenton and nanofiltration and gac as in the previous publications solar photo fenton followed by ozonation had the most negative effects while the nf unit was the best for between 13 and 18 impact categories the photo fenton process also showed a negative impact compared to other solar based aops this negative environmental impact was confirmed by pesqueira et al 216 on the outcomes of the experiments conducted for pilot scale treatments based on solar energy photolysis photocatalysis and photo fenton it is concluded that the negative impact of the photo fenton process is caused by the acid ph required to avoid fe precipitation and the consequent need for neutralization of the treated effluent the negative environmental impact due to the use of chemicals in solar photo fenton was confirmed in the evaluation of a semi industrial solar collector plant 217 surprisingly in a study comparing heterogeneous photocatalysis and homogeneous photo fenton by muñoz et al 218 the solar photo fenton presents a lower environmental impact mainly due to the larger size of the solar collector field required for the photocatalytic process beyond fenton based technologies there are a couple of publications that evaluate the impacts of photocatalysis and electrooxidation giménez et al 219 compared photocatalysis and photo fenton processes at laboratory scale focusing on the removal of metoprolol photocatalysis showed a worse environmental impact related to energy consumption in this study electricity was disregarded for comparison and this can be considered problematic when extrapolating the results costamagna et al 220 evaluated the degradation of phenol with photocatalysts based on zinc oxide doped with rare earth compounds zinc concentrations were modified to observe how they affect the environmental impact although the results related to pollutant removal were very promising the process has issues related to the impact of zinc and electricity the environmental impacts of the electrooxidation process were not compared with other tertiary processes but in combination with other systems to improve its environmental profile the intensification of the elox process with ultrasound and uv was evaluated in a bench scale system with synthetic water with the elox uv system being the option with the least impacts due to its lower energy requirements 221 as the main problem related to electrochemical technologies is energy consumption the coupling of electrochemical systems with renewable energy sources is being investigated for example elox has been coupled to wind and photovoltaic energy devices showing an improvement of the impacts related to energy consumption since it is estimated that 90 of the impact is caused by the associated fossil energy consumption 222 the environmental evaluation of established tertiary technologies is also compared with several treatment methods outside the scope of the review but the authors considered it relevant to look at the big picture in environmental comparisons of different treatment methods for instance foglia et al 223 compared the mbr technology with established treatments such as chemical and uv disinfection showing better environmental performance in all impact categories except for freshwater eutrophication on the other hand holloway et al 224 reported that mbr treatment coupled with ro and uf have greater impacts than a treatment sequence composed of microfiltration ro and uv for the generation of reclaimed water the established treatments were also compared with other innovative non abiotic methods such as algae growth 225 reporting 75 88 of efficiency in micropollutant removal and better environmental indicators than uv ozonation or gac due to the energy efficiency of algae other innovative techniques such as the application of bioaugmentation to sand filters 226 or the use of enzyme coated membranes 227 were also compared to gac adsorption showing potential environmental and economic advantages 6 economic aspects of tertiary treatments the implementation costs of advanced treatment technologies are composed of capital costs capex which include land purchase construction and decommissioning costs and operating costs opex which are mainly influenced by energy and chemical consumption and the labor required for operation and maintenance 228 even when the technological parameters of a treatment technology are well studied at laboratory or even pilot scale it is challenging to apply these results for cost estimation of new plants due to region specific costs and variable wastewater characteristics and treatment goals the economic data for the ozonation process in the reviewed studies are heterogeneous and incomplete this is because energy consumption is variable over a range of five orders of magnitude due to the complex interrelationships of individual rate constants matrix composition and operating configuration however miklos et al 229 found in a meta analysis that ozonation has lowest median energy consumption values compared to other aop processes being lower than 1 kw m 3 prieto rodríguez et al 47 reported an operational cost of 0 560 m 3 obtaining complete removal of bisphenol a ibuprofen and diclofenac among other compounds for a flow of 900 l h 1 however liu et al 230 reported much lower operation costs considering 90 of abatement of trace organic contaminants obtaining a total cost without pretreatment of 0 0179 m 3 these costs can be modified by applying this treatment on a large scale achieving values of 0 158 m 3 even if the ozonation is applied together with uv radiation 231 and diminishing the value to 0 068 m 3 when the process is applied before a ceramic membrane filtration for the removal of azithromycin 232 on the other hand only one of the studied works provides a value for pac o₃ uv treatment between 0 655 and 0 677 m 3 d 1 depending on the ozone concentration 231 regarding the energy consumption for omp removal in uv based technologies it has been reported that the application of mercury lp lamps is about 50 more effective than mercury mp lamps 70 195 assessed the costs of omp removal based on pilot scale data the authors also made a projection of the reactor volume needed to operate at full scale with a daily discharge volume of 110 000 m3 however these projections have to carefully assess the number of additional lamps to maintain similar uv irradiance 65 solar light does not achieve competitive removal compared to uv based processes although it has been shown to remove toxicity more efficiently 67 the most decisive figure of merit for comparing the efficiency of light based treatment processes is the indication of the cumulative energy per treated volume to achieve a certain amount of target compound removal if the lamp efficacy is known the electrical energy per order can be calculated 233 however most of the uv based publications reviewed only give the irradiance w m 2 from which the above mentioned figure of merit can only be calculated when the reactor geometry is given but also the flow rate which is not the case in many publications to obtain the accumulated energy in solar reactors suspected of irradiance fluctuations the irradiance can be integrated over time 127 for uv h₂o₂ and combinations with in situ generated chlorine and sulfate radicals the energy demand was reported to be less than 1 kw m 3 and operational costs in the range of 0 12 0 16 m 3 were indicated 65 70 229 based on pilot scale data sbardella et al 196 reported even lower costs for a uv sulfate radical based treatment showing a successful removal higher than 80 of micropollutants and a treatment cost of 0 088 m 3 reina et al 234 studied the operational and construction costs of photo fenton technology the total costs ranged between 0 76 m 3 and 1 39 m 3 depending on the uv irradiance and the amount of iron on the other hand both capex and opex were evaluated by sánchez pérez et al 120 for solar photo fenton process at pilot scale providing a capex of 0 067 m 3 d 1 and an opex of 0 582 m 3 for the process conducted at ph 3 when the process is performed at circumneutral ph costs are reduced to 0 033 m 3 d 1 and 0 206 m 3 respectively moreover solar photo fenton was compared with the ozonation process the economic comparison operational and construction costs showed that solar photo fenton has higher costs 0 51 0 92 m 3 than ozonation 0 24 0 64 m 3 due to the large amount of chemicals consumed in the operational phase 235 however prieto rodríguez et al 47 studied the same treatments and their conclusion was exactly the opposite solar photo fenton was valued about 0 188 0 358 m 3 whereas 0 450 0 560 m3 were the values for ozonation this means that costs can change and must be carefully determined the main function of the plant in terms of removal of micropollutants can change the costs for or against the technology strictly speaking a comparison can only be made if the matrix composition and removal rate constants are similar however by comparing a sufficiently large data set these uncertainties lose weight and general assumptions can be made about the efficiency of different treatments miklos et al 229 found that reported energy consumption values for photo fenton and electro aop were in the range of 1 100 kw m 3 point of use solar disinfection sodis of drinking water is an option for developing countries with high solar irradiance 236 as capital costs are mainly associated with the need for large irradiation areas and buffer tanks for downtime storage detailed energy and cost evaluations for ozonation gac and pac adsorption based on full scale and pilot scale plants in germany have been presented in the literature 12 208 the capex values for ozonation and pac adsorption are around 0 05 m 3 while ozonation accounts for higher machinery costs ozone generator civil and electrical works are cheaper compared to the pac process the establishment of the gac adsorption processes accounts only for 0 035 m 3 provided that a filtration unit is already in place the operating costs of the three treatment processes ranged around 0 04 m 3 with different shares of individual contributors while ozonation had highest electrical energy costs pac had the highest maintenance and personnel costs while gac techniques resulted in the highest and most variable material costs this is also reflected in studies from other countries reporting variable process costs ek et al 91 estimated the cost of gac adsorption accounting the cost for the adsorbent to be around 0 14 m 3 these costs could be decreased to 0 11 m 3 when regenerated carbon was considered for application the total system costs were estimated to be 0 31 m 3 at the present stage of development ozone treatment and activated carbon adsorption techniques with subsequent filtration steps are considered the most economically viable on a large scale in central europe and are increasingly applied in switzerland to comply with the current legislation 237 conversely to the abovementioned technologies pressure driven membrane filtration techniques account for significantly higher investment and operational costs due to expensive membranes and the high demand for pumping energy respectively margot et al 83 compared the influence of nanofiltration and sand filtration as alternative post treatments to a pac process showing that the process costs with the implementation of nanofiltration comprised 0 80 m 3 while sand filtration accounted only for 0 16 m 3 echevarría et al 238 reported an opex of 0 31 m 3 for a plant size of 15 000 m3 d 1 while assuming a membrane lifetime of 6 years and energy consumption of 1 3 kwh m 3 the capex accounted for 662 m 3 d 1 translating to 0 044 m 3 at peak flow when treatment goals are less stringent a common option for cost reduction is to divert the flow of wastewater mixing with ro treated water by producing a 50 blend the opex could be reduced to 0 18 m 3 on the expense that removal of selected omp is reduced to 50 furthermore since the energy demand of pumping scales almost linearly with membrane area and applied pressure the size of the plant does not significantly reduce operating costs garcia et al 96 calculated opex reaching 0 24 m 3 while capex decreased from 0 48 0 31 m 3 comparing treatment capacities between 1 and 1000 ml d 1 conversely hube et al 239 argued that the rather simple configuration of membrane filtration can lead to low capital costs compared to other treatments thirty nine percent of the reviewed studies investigating membrane treatments were conducted in spain while the rest of the studies were distributed worldwide including publications from south africa brazil and india in contrast only one pilot scale study was presented for germany 240 this can be explained by the discrepant energy costs 241 as in 2020 household electric energy prices were 0 08 kwh 1 in india the price in germany was 0 38 kwh 1 recently the possibility of using energy intensive but flexible processes such as reverse osmosis as a buffer in energy grids increasingly based on extractable energy has been proposed flexible operation patterns of wwtps could compensate for the fluctuating production capacity of wind and solar energy 242 electrochemical treatments are usually regarded as energy intensive treatments although electrochemical treatments such as electrooxidation present high energy consumptions 76 the use of electrochemical assisted techniques presents competitive operational costs to be implemented in wwtps the use of electrodialysis is optimized by its extensive use in desalination and can be an effective method to remove heavy metals for instance a pilot plant with a productivity of 285 m3 h 1 integrating electrodialysis in a treatment train with ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis attained excellent reduction of copper concentration with an estimated total cost of 0 3 0 4 per m3 of treated water 243 the use of electrochemical technologies for the electrogeneration of h2o2 is also reported to reduce the costs compared to dosage for instance wang et al 100 estimate that the energy required for the in situ generation of h₂o₂ accounts for additional costs of between 0 4 and 0 8 usd kg 1 while the dosage of h₂o₂ involves costs of 1 2 1 5 usd kg 1 for other innovative treatments there is a lack of available data for cost calculations as only laboratory scale data are available the energy consumption of uv photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave photocatalysis treatments have been reported to exceed even 100 kw m 3 however calculations on this basis tend to overestimate energy consumption and thus costs 229 increasing energy efficiency with increasing plant size is a common concept in studies considering primary or secondary treatment plants in the short term perspective these treatment options have potential to be further applied and investigated for the treatment of highly contaminated industrial wastewater landfill leachate and ro nf retentates for example the higher overall treatment costs of landfill leachate even with conventional treatments and the typically lower volumes treated open up more options for the application of innovative treatment processes in terms of the costs and impacts of each technology users and regulators must carefully balance the amount of investment both economic and environmental to achieve the goal of safer water resources muñoz et al 244 propose an integrated approach to assess the eco efficiency of a technology by weighing environmental and economic burdens based on their reasoning ozonation was less favorable than photo fenton or solar photo fenton treatment however the costs assumed in this study were almost ten orders of magnitude higher than in the studies reviewed above the centralized and distributed application of tertiary treatments was also studied for several established technologies according to the results centralized treatment is preferred for the disposal of pharmaceuticals 184 but more research would be needed to confirm this in addition social aspects will play a considerable role in the final steps of decision making in switzerland the public supported the decision to legally oblige wwtps to guarantee the removal of certain indicator pollutants at 80 this measure will increase treatment costs by 6 across the country in addition energy consumption is estimated to increase by around 0 1 with the most advanced technologies 237 245 however developing countries will not have the resources to implement such programs in the near future as the prior objective is still to provide at least adequately disinfected water despite this difficult situation the lack of infrastructure networks could also lead to the development of simple decentralized treatment options based on renewable energy sources more quickly than in developed countries 7 benchmarking of the technologies as far as safe water reuse strategies are concerned the tertiary treatment processes applied must fulfil several framework conditions the treatment trains must be adaptable in size to the wastewater flow and pollutant load at the respective application site while operation has to be reliable and provide redundancy in case of failure of individual units therefore reproducible measurement schedules for indicator substances should be supported by fast online monitoring techniques such as fluorescence excitation emission matrices feem as well as by effect based assays on acute toxicity estrogenicity mutagenicity or antibiotic susceptibility 246 the integration of reasonable and standardized protocols in a whole effluent approach is currently an important research topic 247 a sound assessment of the avoided risks of each technology is the basis of a comprehensive lca study furthermore regionalization of characterization factors was suggested as a key issue to represent an accurate toxicity impact in local environments 248 it is also reported that the currently used assessment methods could provide different results and may not include some micropollutant factors 249 in the following we summarize and qualitatively discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of each advanced treatment technology under technological environmental and economic points of view based on the findings of the studies selected the technologies reviewed can be classified into advanced oxidation processes and physical retention treatments while oxidation processes comprise traditional ozone treatment and emerging ancillary technologies conventional uv treatment and enhancement technologies as well as electrochemical treatments physical treatments include adsorption processes mainly based on activated carbon and membrane filtration table 1 one of the main drawbacks of ozonation is that due to its high reactivity and instability ozone must be generated on site from oxygen by electrical discharge with a yield of about 10 which leads to high electrical energy consumption in the plant in addition to the low ozone yield the effectiveness of ozone treatment is limited by its slow dissolution rate and rapid decomposition however modifications to air diffusers that form micro nano bubbles increase the treatment efficiency 46 furthermore the high toxicity of ozone requires the design of ozone destruction units which remove unreacted ozone from the exhaust gas stream after treatment 250 trained personnel and strict safety protocols are necessary to minimize the risk of accidental release in addition the formation of toxic by products such as bromates which are potential human carcinogens has been associated with this process 251 increased effluent toxicity after ozone treatment was reported by several studies and contributed to worsen environmental impacts from an lca perspective despite these drawbacks disinfection capacity and low operational costs are the main advantages of ozonation 252 the detrimental effects of induced toxicity can be circumvented when an additional filtration adsorption step is applied after ozonation in terms of applicability to wastewater matrix conditions doc is the most critical constituent that needs to be controlled prior to ozonation while other characteristics such as tss or turbidity have a minor influence as they are not related to doc the lowest removal rates were obtained for ibuprofen oxazepam and sucralose and their removal could be analyzed in the evaluation of operational conditions to increase the sensitivity of the method further research should focus on investigating effluent toxicity elimination of antibiotic resistance genes and decision making based on operational costs and environmental impact conventional uv treatment for pathogen removal requires irradiances of 500 mj cm 2 and short residence times resulting in relatively low cumulative energy doses that minimize operating costs however these configurations are not efficient for omp removal not only because of the low transferred energies but also because of the intrinsic recalcitrance of most omps to direct uv photolysis the first obstacle has been overcome with the development of high intensity photoreactor modules to address the second problem the dosing of additional oxidants has proven effective while hydrogen peroxide in combination with high intensity uv treatment is already applied on a large scale persulfate and chlorine dioxide are still under investigation especially regarding the formation of toxic by products in addition the environmental impact of their production and the possible risks associated with their unintentional release must be considered all uv based processes require water with low turbidity to maximize transmittance so uv is usually applied after a clarification filtration step among the catalyst based technologies fenton based methods are the most studied however there is agreement that the working ph of fenton based methods is a clear drawback as chemicals are used both for acidification of the effluent and for ph correction before discharge or reuse this drawback should be solved by improving the reaction at neutral ph to see its real use in wwtps from an environmental point of view although the operational phase has worse impacts fenton based methods could have less impacts if the construction phase is considered heterogeneous processes are favorable compared to homogeneous processes due to the easy recovery of the catalyst and the avoidance of changes in water composition in addition research focused on the development of new materials capable of improving light utilization combined with a reusable catalyst operating under circumneutral conditions should be the main priority for further research work in this field in relation to the high environmental impact of mercury pressure lamp manufacturing alternative irradiation sources should be investigated although uv led irradiation is promising 253 it does not yet reach the energy efficiency of conventional lamps and cannot yet be considered an economically viable alternative moreover according to available data direct use of sunlight is more likely to remain a prospect for decentralized plants in the medium term however the indirect use of solar energy through photovoltaic plants could be an alternative worthy of consideration in remote areas 254 both gac and pac adsorption stages are effective against organic micropollutants however they do not achieve reliable removal of heavy metals pathogens and args in direct comparison of gac with ro a similar range of omp was removed by gac but ro was more efficient in removing heavy metals and volatile organic compounds 115 in terms of on site energy demand gac systems are preferable compared to energy intensive processes such as membrane filtration and ozonation however when production is included in the assessment gac can be more energy intensive than ozonation especially when adequate recycling systems are not applied end of life scenarios also have a high environmental impact 256 depending on the treatment goals gac processes can be integrated into treatment trains to efficiently exploit the benefits of this treatment stage for example when targeting higher omp removal in secondary effluents with high doc loading gac can be used as a polishing step after ozone aop treatment 40 92 in the case of pac recycling of spent adsorbent is currently not possible in most applications in terms of improving the economic and environmental impact of pac not only efficient recirculation and recycling schemes need to be further investigated but the materials applied must be renewable and not of fossil origin in the short term recycling of industrial waste such as fly ash from coal plants could also be a possibility 257 spent activated carbon sludge must be properly handled to prevent soil and surface water contamination researchers are currently investigating the factors influencing omp removal by activated carbon processes as well as the application of control strategies in order to increase the reliability of these processes reverse osmosis and nanofiltration processes an efficient barrier to retain most omp pathogens including args and heavy metals depending on the configuration desalination can be achieved which is an important treatment objective especially in reuse applications and results in a clear benefit of this technology compared to others under review from which only electrodialysis is a considerable alternative for salt removal the produced water can be provided with a reliable high quality provided that a proper control and maintenance protocol is applied maintenance ensures the preservation of the expensive membrane modules against fouling and scaling but requires backwashing procedures with antifoulants and antiscalants which contributes negatively to the environmental impact although the ro nf process is well established in regions with high water stress and comparatively low energy costs from an lca perspective reverse osmosis is not recommended by any of the articles reviewed in this study as the high energy consumption strongly impacts environmental indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions research should be directed towards the development of more durable and efficient membranes this could lead to lower membrane and energy costs as well as lower consumption of cleaning agents and thus lower environmental impact furthermore the generation of a waste stream in the range of 10 20 of the originally treated stream increases the environmental burden and decreases the treated water yield 258 possible solutions for the management of retentate are its recirculation to wwtp headworks evaporation ponds or aop treatments 259 for smaller volumes and higher intrinsic conductivity electrochemical oxidation seems a promising approach 141 electrochemical methods have great potential to reduce the environmental impacts associated with micropollutant removal as they mainly use electricity which can be considered as a clean chemical however pilot scale research is still scarce and the different technologies need to reach larger scales of implementation in a significant number of publications to consolidate this potential as highlighted in the lca section energy and chemical production are responsible for most of the environmental impacts in tertiary treatment electrochemical treatments could therefore be one of the keys in the quest to reduce chemical consumption for example electrooxidation does not use any chemical reagents while electro fenton processes produce h₂o₂ by electroreduction of oxygen as for energy consumption electrochemical systems can be easily combined with renewable energy sources but more studies are required to optimize the coupling 260 the integration of renewable energy sources in combination with electrochemical wastewater treatments is proven to reduce the environmental impacts produced by energy consumption 222 8 concluding remarks one of the drawbacks of the presented study is that peer reviewed research articles are a limited source of operational data given their specific focus and basic process parameters such as unit dimensions critical conventional wastewater parameters and flow rates are not always reported regarding the rapidly evolving research on tertiary treatment schemes more effort should be made in publishing reliable process related data in the peer reviewed literature nevertheless the overview presented on the state of the art of tertiary treatments clearly identifies the key points of both full scale processes already operated and innovative treatment processes based on these configurations and presents the solutions currently under development to meet the requirements of water safety standards a combination of different processes multi barrier approach is often essential for each individual case in addition to economic and technological considerations environmental constraints identified by a life cycle assessment must be incorporated into decision making many authors point out that the key issues for most tertiary treatments are the electrical energy and chemicals consumption more effort needs to be devoted to the characterization of the transformation products produced in the treatments to accurately assess the impact of the methods the variability of influent quality needs to be monitored to take advantage of the high adjustability of chemicals and added energy in the aop which will reduce process costs risks to personnel and the environment should be assessed prior to implementation for a complete risk assessment which is necessary for a sound life cycle assessment more attention should be paid to process evaluation based on toxicological data than to degradation efficiency alone however since so far the application of effect based effluent control is still under investigation treatment efficacy is regulated and compared based on indicator substance removal targets many authors argue that the low concentrations of micropollutants and the lack of systematic assessment of their long term effects when released into the environment mean that the environmental impact of new treatment trains outweighs the impacts of micropollutant discharge into the environment faced with this problem more environmental studies are needed to better understand the environmental profiles of tertiary treatments preferably under real wastewater conditions and on a larger scale to optimize construction and operation data especially energy and chemical consumption in addition more work is needed on the analysis of innovative tertiary techniques as the analyzed evaluations provided some contradictory results in parallel the characterization factors of micropollutants need to be revised and validated to improve the accuracy of lca results for effluents containing these pollutants the following are the supplementary data related to this article esm 1 bibliographic search
