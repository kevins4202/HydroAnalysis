5970,the hydrogeological functioning of four different areas in a complex evaporite karst unit of predominantly aquitard behavior in s spain was investigated environmental dating tracers 3h 3he 4he cfc 12 sf6 and hydrochemical data were determined from spring samples to identify and characterize groundwater flow components of different residence times in the media results show a general geochemical evolution pattern from higher recharge areas to lower positions discharge areas in which mineralization rises as well as the value of the rcl so4 2 evidencing longer water rock interaction ne values show degassing of most of the samples favored by the high salinity of groundwater and the development of karstification so that the concentration of all the considered gases were corrected according to the difference between the theoretical and the measured ne the presence of modern groundwater in every sample was proved by the detection of 3h and cfc 12 at the opposite the higher amount of radiogenic 4he in most samples also indicates that they have an old component the 3h 3he dating method does not give reliable ages as a consequence of degassing and the large uncertainty of the 3he 4he ratios of the sources for the radiogenic helium the large sf6 concentrations suggest terrigenic production related to halite and dolomite binary mixing and free shape models were created based on 3h and cfc 12 data to interpret the age distribution of the samples two parameters ga50 and 70 were proposed as an indicator of that distribution as they provide further information than the mean age particularly ga50 is derived from the median groundwater age and is presented as a new way of interpreting mixed groundwater age data a greater fraction of old groundwater 3h and cfc 12 free was identified in discharge areas while the proportion and estimated infiltration date of the younger fractions in recharge areas were higher and more recent respectively the application of different approaches has been useful to corroborate previous theoretical conceptual model proposed for the study area and to test the applicability of the used environmental tracer in dating brine groundwater and karst springs keywords groundwater dating evaporite karst brine spring free shape models 1 introduction reaching an adequate understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of groundwater in a specific system requires a good knowledge of its geological characteristics e g lithology stratigraphy structure as well as of the hydraulic parameters of the hosting rocks thus understanding the groundwater flow dynamics in settings with complex geology is challenging more even if the available information about the characteristics of the media is scarce zhou and li 2011 which is often the case in low permeability formations that are rarely investigated owed to their limited productivity cherry et al 2006 the performance of hydraulic tests in this kind of media is limited as they would require too much time which makes it considerably difficult hart et al 2006 mejías et al 2009 neuzil 1986 rowe and nadarajah 1993 besides when permeability data are obtained from local field surveys they cannot be extrapolated to the rest of the aquitard formation konikow and neuzil 2007 in which secondary porosity i e fractures and conduits plays a key role on groundwater flow dynamics andreo et al 2016 cherry et al 2006 goldscheider et al 2010 kreitler 1989 as a consequence groundwater flow dynamics in low permeability settings is normally inferred using hydrochemical and isotopic tools cherry et al 2006 complementary the development of dating techniques makes it possible to investigate groundwater residence times within this type of media in which regional gravity driven flows are involved cardenas and jiang 2010 gassiat et al 2013 during the second half of the 20th century many research works chebotarev 1955 jankowski and jacobson 1989 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 randal 1967 schwartz and domenico 1973 tóth 1999 demonstrated that groundwater in such contexts evolves towards greater concentrations of dissolved solids and higher temperature values while the hydrochemical facies transition from bicarbonate to chloride going through sulfate recent studies beyer et al 2016 gerber et al 2017 mcmahon et al 2010 van engelen et al 2018 xu et al 2018 have also exposed the relationship between groundwater age and mineralization by jointly using hydrochemical and dating tools each tracer is suitable to analyze a specific age range so if tracer ages are generated for time intervals where they are not suitable tracers ages differ corcho alvarado et al 2007 kralik et al 2014 solomon et al 2010 sültenfuss et al 2011 waugh et al 2003 for instance the use of 3h 3he cfc or 85kr would give the same age in the interval 0 50 years under piston flow conditions the mixing of flow components with different residence time in a given sample also affects the estimation of ages if the analyzed groundwater sample contains fractions older than those datable with a certain tracer it may lead to a bias towards lower ages even more in heterogeneous media gardner et al 2015 that normally occurs near the surface particularly in springs or in long filtered wells where several flow lines converge each one with a characteristic concentration of tracers delbart et al 2014 stolp et al 2010 suckow 2014 thomas et al 2003 lumped parameter models lpms are normally used to integrate and quantitatively interpret the tracer data in hydrological systems jódar et al 2014 maloszewski and zuber 1982 solomon et al 2010 turnadge and smerdon 2014 however they require a good knowledge of the groundwater flow dynamics to be meaningful besides the combination of flow components with very dissimilar ages complicate the use of lpms which in such circumstances are rarely effective solomon et al 2010 stanton et al 2007 as they do not achieve to estimate the age distribution of all the groundwater fractions that are present in the sample torgersen and stute 2013 more recently visser et al 2013 have developed mixing models based on the discretization of groundwater age distribution that means that natural tracer data are used to calculate the contribution i e percentage of a given age range to the sample as a whole the application of this kind of models is simpler and it does not require the estimation of any hydraulic parameter on the other hand the transport of environmental tracer is not ideal since they can be affected by physical dispersion gas exchange dilution decay and chemical degradation exchange with unknown reservoirs processes that may modify their concentration and therefore they produce a bias in their apparent ages cook and solomon 1997 iaea 2006 degassing can substantially change the concentration of gas in groundwater particularly in karst aquifers delbart et al 2014 where gases could possibly exchange with air in the conduit network of unknown composition as salinity changes the gas solubilities this in additional factor for uncertainty to take into account when groundwater is brine gerber et al 2017 in both cases the information derived from environmental tracers must be jointly interpreted with hydrogeochemical information the goal of this work is to test the applicability of the combined use of groundwater dating 3h 3he 4he cfc 12 sf6 and hydrochemical tools to reach a better understanding of groundwater flow dynamics and residence times in geologically complex aquitard formations with scarce knowledge of their inner structure and the hydraulic parameters of the host rock the applicability of some groundwater dating tools in karst settings and brine groundwater are also discussed as pilot sites four different areas have been selected within the so called chaotic subbetic complex csc an evaporite karst unit in southern spain fig 1 a with a predominant aquitard behavior but with significant local development of second porosity due to karstification based on environmental tracer data binary mixing and free shape models have been created as well as some lumped parameter models some describing parameters derived from them have been proposed to investigate the age distribution of the springs draining the studied system particularly the median groundwater age ga50 and the percentage of old groundwater 70 the results derived from environmental tracers jointly analyzed with hydrochemical data has confirmed a theoretical hydrogeological conceptual model previously proposed for the csc andreo et al 2016 which has proved the usefulness of the multiapproach considered here additionally some practical recommendations dealing with degassing are presented with the aim of being helpful in future works carried out in similar settings worldwide 2 geographical and hydrogeological settings the chaotic subbetic complex vera and martín algarra 2004 is a large olistostromic unit located in andalusia s spain that extends along the southern border of guadalquivir foreland basin in a wide 300 km long band with se ne direction fig 1a the csc is mainly formed by evaporites anhydrite gypsum and halite and multi colored clays and sandstones of upper triassic keuper age although other lithologies are also present sandstones marls limestones and dolomites from triassic to miocene ages normally as olistoliths this geological unit is very folded and brecciated which conferred the csc a disorganized and chaotic structure thus the csc can be defined as a megabreccia of triassic clayey evaporite matrix where different kinds of blocks are embedded halite is not present at the surface due to its high solubility although its existence at depth can be inferred from groundwater hydrochemistry and boreholes drilled in evaporite outcrops calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 carrasco 1986 traditionally csc materials have been considered impervious due to the abundance of triassic clays marls and sandstones however the high solubility of evaporite rocks favors the development of second porosity through dissolution and karstification as a consequence highly unstable cavities and conduits are formed which lead to a fast geomorphological evolution calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 gutiérrez et al 2008 and result in the formation of endokarst and exokarst features such as dolines uvalas swallow holes and speleological networks that are characteristic of karst aquifers ford and williams 2007 white 1988 thus the abundance of evaporite rocks plays a key role in the hydrogeological functioning of csc outcrops allowing a local karst functioning where the evaporite formations are more continuous gil márquez et al 2017a however the predominance of low permeability materials clays sandstones dolomite blocks which function as aquitards confers the whole csc a high hydrogeological complexity the most common landforms in the csc are karst depressions some of which are naturally drained through karst swallow holes that become active during rainfall episodes keeping the bottom of endorheic areas dry or slightly flooded during short periods andreo et al 2016 in contrast where no swallow holes exist dolines and karst depressions remain flooded longer or even permanently such areas are considered as wetlands whose genesis and natural hydric dynamic are related to evaporite karst they are very diverse with a high range of water mineralization and hydrochemical facies as well as hydroperiods of diverse length rodríguez rodríguez et al 2010 in addition to karst development and wetland areas the presence of springs wells and boreholes also evidences the existence of groundwater flows within the csc the springs often drain brine groundwater with na cl facies especially those located at lower elevations andreo et al 2016 explained the hydrogeological complexity found in the csc in a hydrogeological conceptual model inspired by toth s gravity driven regional groundwater flow model gdrgf toth 1963 tóth 1970 the proposed approach explains the hydrodiversity hydrochemistry hydro period of wetlands and springs based on their geological hydrogeological contexts as several authors have also done in other areas worldwide euliss et al 2004 lissey 1971 winter 1999 in general terms springs found at lower positions of csc outcrops drain brine and warm groundwater as they would be linked to long regional and ascending groundwater flows of great residence time within the media discharge wetlands located in the same context would continuously receive groundwater inputs normally of high salinity leading to long lasting or even permanent flooding on the other hand at the highest location wetlands are located above the phreatic level and they constitute recharge features of the aquifers recharge wetlands they normally have ephemeral flooding and low mineralized water owing to their meteoric origin or to sporadic groundwater inputs related to short local flows similarly small springs and leakages found in high areas also drain groundwater with low salinity that would have had a short residence time within the aquifer lastly in intermediate positions between discharge and recharge areas there are springs and transit wetlands that do not constitute the final destination of groundwater flows which would instead go towards discharge areas groundwater drained through such springs and wetlands present variable mineralization as a consequence of variable contribution of groundwater flows with different residence times but also due to the lithological heterogeneity of the media the theoretical conceptual model of andreo et al 2016 is appropriate to describe the general hydrodiversity and the hydrogeological context of wetlands located in the csc however this model is not completely replicated in every evaporitic karst area due to their specific geological and geomorphological particularities consequently four different study areas have been considered in this work which are located in different provinces of andalusia fig 1 the jarales area in the cordoba province western los hoyos and eastern sectors of the trias of antequera area in the málaga province and the brujuelo area in the jaén province 2 1 jarales area the jarales area fig 1b is a plateau 80 km2 surrounded by genil river sw and its tributary anzur river ne the central part of the area rises 350 440 m a s l and has smooth relief with a poorly define drainage network and numerous endorheic areas some of which often host wetlands as a result of hydraulic interactions with the water table while some others are naturally drained through swallow holes recharge occurs by the direct entrance of runoff through swallow holes by means of water infiltration through permeable exposures and likely through the bottom of wetlands groundwater flows in a radial and centrifugal way from the central part of the plateau towards its borders fig 1b where the main outlets are located the most important discharge points are lower anzur spring j1 247 m a s l to the north salinillas spring j2 253 m a s l by genil river and upper anzur spring j3 300 m a s l eastwards fig 1b all of them draining brine water lower anzur spring j1 is hydrogeologically connected to some karst swallow holes as proved by a multi injection dye tracer test gil márquez et al 2017a allowing rapid and abundant arrival of recently infiltrated water 2 2 trias de antequera area the trias de antequera ta area fig 1c is an elongated csc outcrop of ene wsw direction located in the northern part of malaga province it is one of the most remarkable evaporite karst in spain with numerous examples of exokarst dolines collapses karstic canyons and endokarst caves features whose appearance is conditioned by the uplifting of the ground due to halokinetic processes calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 the hydrogeological functioning of the ta is highly influenced by preferential infiltration forms related to karst dynamic there are also important wetlands in this area such as the complexes of wetlands of campillos antequera and archidona fig 1c groundwater discharge takes place towards some of these wetlands almécija 1997 linares 1990 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2006 but also through springs the outlets are mainly distributed in the borders of some diapiric structures calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 in this research two sectors within the ta area were separately treated the western sector nearby guadalhorce reservoir and the east sector also called los hoyos area fig 1c the most important discharge zone in the eastern ta is meliones spring by guadalhorce river the brine groundwater that it drains leads to the salinization of the downstream water resources particularly gualdahorce reservoir several outlets appear by said reservoir hereby called meliones 1 t1 345 m a s l and meliones 2 t2 350 m a s l they are normally submerged below the reservoir water level except for short periods so they are rarely accessible other significant discharge points in the eastern sector are cañaveralejo spring t3 400 m a s l south of campillos wetland complex and saladilla t4 450 m a s l east of antequera city fig 1c los hoyos area fig 1c is one of several diapiric structures appearing at the ta area calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 it covers 20 km2 and rises to 700 900 m a s l approximately 50 m above the surrounding zones the landscape is full of karst landforms mainly dolines of different typology but also sinkholes swallow holes and small surfaced depressions which favor water recharge those dolines located at the central part of the study area above 800 m a s l are normally smaller and they may present flooding for short periods as the groundwater table is located below their bottom towards the edges of the diapiric structure closed depressions present greater size and their hydroperiod are longer two of them are wetlands of great environmental value grande and chica lakes rodríguez rodríguez et al 2007 near grande lake there is a spring whose direct hydrogeological connection with the wetland seems unlikely despite it is located 787 m a s l below the wetland water surface gil márquez et al 2016 on the opposite part of los hoyos area near fuente camacho village discharge takes place at a lower altitude 725 748 m a s l by several brine outlets two of those points were sampled during this study fuente camacho i h1 and fuente camacho ii h2 2 3 brujuelo area lastly brujuelo area is located 12 km north of the city of jaen in a relatively high plain west of a tributary of guadalquivir river salado stream fig 1d this area does not have abundant exokarst features except for some small depressions and few surface collapses the two biggest karst depressions are occupied by brujuelo and cirueña wetlands with seasonal and ephemeral hydroperiods respectively diffuse recharge takes place in the area as suggested by isotopic information gil márquez et al 2017b groundwater flow in a diffuse way from the sw towards salado stream n and e where the main outlets are found san carlos b1 375 m a s l and don benito b3 440 m a s l springs fig 1d other outlets found in the area are in descending order tosquillas b5 490 m a s l and brujuelo b4 450 m a s l leakages and brujuelo spring b2 425 m a s l previous hydrogeochemical work carried out in this area gil márquez et al 2017b evidences a progressive enhancement of mineral dissolution and increase of water temperature toward lower positions which could be related to a greater contribution of long and deep groundwater flows with greater residence time within the media as proposed by andreo et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 theoretical basis tritium 3h is the radioactive isotope of hydrogen and is naturally formed in the atmosphere its presence in groundwater mainly comes from precipitation as part of water molecules 3h is the only tracer that can be used to date groundwater directly clark and fritz 1997 the atmospheric concentration of 3h increased markedly between 1955 and 1963 due to thermonuclear tests reaching values that were three orders of magnitude above natural background especially in the northern hemisphere e g solomon and cook 2000 however the abundance of atmospheric 3h is nowadays similar to that before nuclear testing as most of the remaining released 3h is in the ocean or the subsurface e g han et al 2006 in any case the presence of 3h in a groundwater sample indicates that at least part of it has a modern origin meaning that it was infiltrated after 1953 the joint determination of 3h and 3he its decay product permits to quantify the time elapsed between isolation from the atmosphere after recharge and sampling of the modern fraction post 1953 of a water sample and it has been broadly applied cook and solomon 1997 poreda et al 1988 stolp et al 2010 torgersen et al 1978 the application of the 3h 3he dating method also requires 4he and ne measurements in order to distinguish between different sources of 3he in groundwater equilibrium excess air tritiogenic radiogenic more details regarding the 3h 3he technique can be found in literature e g solomon and cook 2000 sültenfuss et al 2011 part of 4he concentration in groundwater samples can be attributable to underground production derived from the u and th decay series and it is called radiogenic 4he 4herad assuming that the 4herad produced within minerals is liberated to groundwater at a constant rate and homogeneously in space its concentration would increase proportionally to groundwater travel time solomon 2000 thus 4herad can be used as a dating tool as long as other sources of 4he are substantially lower than the radiogenic origin torgersen and stute 2013 however the utilization of 4herad for groundwater dating is challenging in settings where there is no knowledge about the proportion of u and th in the rocks as the accumulation rate of 4herad can largely vary between different geological formations from 5 8 10 12 nml g of h2o wei et al 2015 to 1 9 10 9 nml g of h2o beyerle et al 1999 the 4herad technique has been applied with relative success in many studies although 4herad ages normally divert from the ages of other long scale tracers such as 14c berger 2008 lippmann et al 2003 müller et al 2016 torgersen and clarke 1985 in any case even if quantitative dating is not possible 4herad determination provide qualitative information about long timescale groundwater residence times gardner and heilweil 2014 sültenfuss et al 2011 wei et al 2015 the use of 4he in groundwater dating is thoroughly discussed in solomon 2000 and torgersen and stute 2013 in this study 14c has not been considered as the presence of carbonate in the media overwhelms atmospheric 14c inducing some uncertainties that prohibit reliable ages iaea 2013 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are synthetic gases that were used for industrial purposes and release into the atmosphere during the second half of the 20th century iaea 2006 they were restricted by the montreal protocol of 1987 due to their effect on the ozone layer depletion unep 1987 as these gases show almost inert behavior in the atmosphere the evolutions of the atmospheric concentration of cfcs describe distinct functions on the other hand the use of other halogenated gases such as sulfur hexafluoride sf6 still continues and their atmospheric concentrations are currently rising the nearly monotone evolution of the cfc and sf6 mixing ratios in the atmosphere can be used for groundwater dating assuming that the atmosphere is the only source in the aquifer cfcs are affected by degradation in anoxic conditions cook et al 2006 and heavy local contaminations kralik et al 2014 although no evident signs of degradation or retention have been reported for sf6 busenberg and plummer 2000 han et al 2006 in situ production was found in various studies akesson et al 2015 friedrich et al 2013 harnisch and eisenhauer 1998 besides this the temperature for gas exchange at the water atmosphere interface must be known by about 1 k cook et al 2006 these trace gases are also affected by the contribution of bubble inclusion so called excess air as well as salinity during recharge wanninkhof et al 1991 warner and weiss 1985 further information about groundwater dating techniques using cfc and sf6 can be found in iaea 2006 darling et al 2012 and chambers et al 2018 3 2 measurement and sampling procedures during four years september 2013 september 2017 field campaigns for the physicochemical monitoring were carried out in the four study areas in situ measurements of electrical conductivity ec and water temperature wtw conductivimeter thermometer 3310 were performed in the main springs and water samples were collected for subsequent major ion determination flow rate measurements were also made in most of the outlets ott c2 flow meter data accuracy was 1 μs cm for ec 0 1 c for temperature and 10 for flow rate sampling and measurement periodicities varied from daily to monthly depending on the hydrodynamic conditions additionally some samples were taken for groundwater dating purposes 3h and he isotopes sampling was mainly performed during three campaigns september 2014 towards the end of the dry period of the 2013 14 hydrogeological year one month later october 2014 after the first precipitation episodes of 2014 15 and summer 2015 july september additionally two other samples were taken in anzur bajo spring j1 during two flooding periods april 5 2016 and december 11 2016 samples for noble gases were also taken with duplicates in the mentioned campaigns excepting the first one sampling for cfc 12 analysis was mainly carried out between april and june 2016 although one sample was previously collected april 2015 samples for major components and tritium analysis were directly taken in 125 ml amber glass bottles and 1 l pet bottles respectively for he and ne determination spring water was collected into duplicate clamped off copper cylinders through a transparent tube using a 12v submersible pump waterra tempest following the protocol of bremen university sültenfuss et al 2011 visser et al 2013 samples for cfc and sf6 analysis were collected in 500 ml steel ampoules similar to those described by jaunat et al 2012 and labasque et al 2014 by means of a peristaltic pump hach sigma 900 portable sampler which has been successfully used in springs with low flow iaea 2006 and reference therein to avoid contamination viton tubing was used from the spring to the ampoules a transparent hose was used as water outlet from the pump which permitted to check for bubbles that could indicate induced degassing once the steel ampoules were sealed they were shook to detect any possible noise caused by the involuntary formation of a headspace 3 3 analytical methods major elements were determined in the laboratory of the centre of hydrogeology of university of malaga cehiuma hco3 was measured by volumetric titration with 0 02 n h2so4 to ph 4 45 major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 analysis were conducted by ionic chromatography metrohm compact 930 ic flex for cations and compact 881 ic pro for anions with 2 accuracy due to high salinity most samples were diluted to 1 ms cm and then inline filtered before being introduced into the analytic system determination of 3h he isotopes ne cfc 12 and sf6 was performed at the department of oceanography of the institute of environmental physics university of bremen he isotopes and ne were extracted from samples and then separated from other gases by means of a cryogenic system afterward they were determined in the mass spectrometric facility described by sültenfuß et al 2009 the 3h analysis was based on the 3he ingrowth method clarke et al 1976 500 g of water samples were degassed and stored in gas free glass bulbs for 3he 3h decay product production and accumulation after 4 6 months of storage 3he was determined with the mass spectrometric system cfc 12 and sf6 concentrations were detected with a micro electron capture detector mounted on a gas chromatograph agilent gc6890n with a capillary column as described in bulsiewicz et al 1998 cfc data were calibrated according to the sio scale 2005 bullister and tanhua 2010 the specific radioactive activity of 3h is expressed in tritium units tu 0 119 bq kg of h2o and noble gas concentrations are referred to ccstp kg of h2o cfc 12 and sf6 values were determined as pmol kg of h2o and afterward converted to atmospheric mixing ration pptv based on recharge conditions temperature pressure and salinity most samples were brine but solute content is supposed to be low at the time and location of recharge thus the concentration of every tracer determined was corrected to be expressed as concentration in freshwater according to the density of each sample which was calculated based on their chemical composition using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 3 4 data treatment for hydrological interpretation recharge temperatures were assumed to be 15 c in accordance with the average air temperature of the study areas during recharge periods october to may calculated for the period 1973 74 2015 16 gil márquez 2018 atmospheric pressure was adjusted to the main altitude in each study area 400 m above sea level m a s l in jarales 500 m a s l in brujuelo and western trias of antequera and 850 m a s l in los hoyos based on previous knowledge of the study areas all samples were supposed to be infiltrated as freshwater thus salinity would not have affect equilibrium solubility before entering the saturated zone sz the reason for that assumption is discussed in section 4 2 2 in order to check the effect of changes of salinity and temperature on the tracer concentrations and ages table 1 variations of 2 k and 10 have been jointly considered the effect of altitude has not been checked as the study areas are relatively plain after calculating solubility equilibrium fractions for all tracers and each sample potential contributions of excess air or degassing were quantified based on δne values mayer et al 2014 schlosser et al 1989 meaning the difference between the determined ne contents and its solubility equilibrium concentration neeq expressed in percentage thus the degassing corrected concentration of a given gas tracer ccorr can be obtained from the measured concentration cs by applying the aeschbach hertig et al 1999 degassing equations based on the diffusion coefficient of the gases for low solubility gases e g ne he the correction approaches to the following equation 1 c corr c s n e eq n e eq δ n e note that δ ne 0 for degassed samples the 3h activity and the corrected cfc 12 and sf6 concentrations were compared to their respective atmospheric input functions the cfc 12 and sf6 atmospheric mixing ratio in precipitations for northern hemisphere atmosphere was obtained from usgs 2018 referred to sio 2005 scale bullister and tanhua 2010 because of a higher solubility of cfc 12 compared to he ne and sf6 corrections of cfc 12 data are overestimated by this simple approach a specific tritium input function from andalusia was generated using the available data from 5 gnip stations in s spain and gibraltar iaea wmo 2018 those within a 150 km radius from the study areas the 3h input curve was created by the correlation between that data and the tritium in precipitation record of gnip vienna station as 3h is a radioactive isotope part of the 3h recharged from 1953 has already decayed thus a decayed input function scaled to 2016 was created based on the radioactive decay law and the 3h decay constant of 0 05626 yr 1 ln 2 12 32 yr cfc 12 and 3h decayed input functions were used to develop binary mixing models bmm shape free models sfm and lumped parameter models lpm that could explain the observed tracer concentrations and permit quantifying the amount of old groundwater i e tritium and cfc free in each sample fold approximating 3h and cfc 12 mean ages of the modern fraction fyoung and defining its groundwater age distribution in this study fold is considered to be infiltrated before the 1940 s decade previously to the anthropogenic release of both 3h and cfc 12 the use of bmm is widely extended in literature akesson et al 2015 bohlke and denver 1995 katz et al 2009 koh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2003 michel 2004 solomon et al 2010 stanton et al 2007 as a simplification proxy that easily helps to interpret the variation of chemical components in a set of samples of a given hydrological system plummer et al 2006 bmm assume a binary mixture of young and old water in which fyoung is transported via piston flow the tracer concentration in each sample cs is given by 2 c s c young f young f old c old where cyoung and cold are the tracer concentrations in fyoung and fold respectively the use of sfm in groundwater dating is a more novel approach massoudieh et al 2014 mccallum et al 2017 visser et al 2013 this is an extension of the bmm that describe groundwater age distribution by a histogram of n bins with a uniform age distribution within each bin visser et al 2013 and contrary to lpm does not made any assumption about the groundwater flow dynamics then cs is the summation of the products of the fractions of groundwater sample in each bin fi and their mean tracer concentration ci 3 c s i 1 n f i c i with the aim of having a more detailed insight of the age distribution of the samples 3 bins were used in this study to fit the observed data tracer concentrations considering time lapses of 30 years the first and second bins have average ages of 15 0 30 and 45 30 60 years respectively the last one has an average age of 75 years between 60 and 90 years and it has a very low cfc 12 and 3h concentration similar to that of fold i e 3h and cfc free using solver add in in excel each bin fraction was calculated adopting as constrains the cfc 12 and 3h piston flow concentrations of the selected ranges of ages lumped parameters model have been used for many authors during the last three decades e g beyer et al 2016 suckow 2014 visser et al 2013 waugh et al 2003 they define the age distribution of groundwater in a sample at time t using a convolution integral that sum up all concentrations ci at each time t 4 c s t t c i t g t t e λ t t d t where g t t is the weight function that determine the importance of each age in the total groundwater age and e λ t t account for the decay of those radioactive tracers the main advantage of lpm is that they only require two of three parameters one of which is the mean residence time while the other define the weight function based on the characteristics of the study only the exponential piston model epm and the dispersion model dm have been considered the epm describes piston flow transport followed by exponential mixing which conceptually would occur in areas where there is no recharge nearby the sampled point thus the weight function is condition by the epm ratio which is the length of the area not receiving recharge by the area doing it cook and böhlke 2000 on the other hand the dm is based on the advection dispersion equation and can describe the age distribution for many aquifer configurations jurgens et al 2012 it uses de dispersion parameter dp which is the ratio of dispersion coefficient to the outlet position and the velocity detailed

composition of spring water samples is summarized in table 2 groundwater exhibits a wide range of mineralization from brackish waters to brines average ec values vary from 1 7 ms cm in b5 to 215 5 ms cm in h1 and the mean water temperature of springs are comprised between 15 9 c in b4 and 22 2 c in b3 table 2 in general terms the brine springs exhibit different grade of positive thermal anomaly up to 4 5 c in b3 respect to the mean air temperature of each study area 16 5 17 7 c fig 2 on the contrary the less mineralized outlets b4 b5 h3 t4 drain groundwater with temperature values close to the atmospheric values the measured flow rates present a wide range of values from less than 1 l s to nearly 100 l s table 2 j1 spring presents the greatest discharge variations as it indicates by the calculated coefficient of variability cv that is due to the existence of a well developed karst network that connects concentrated recharge areas to the spring gil márquez et al 2017a the most abundant ions in the analyzed water samples are cl and na with concentrations up to 191 g l and 115 g l respectively h1 table 2 aguileras spring h3 samples are the only ones with calcium sulfated hydrofacies although the greater concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 8 3 and 3 6 g l respectively are reached in lower anzur spring j1 overall groundwater mineralization increases toward lower positions in each study area as ec boxplot shows fig 2 except for don benito spring b3 which is located in a different flow line than the rest of the studied points in brujuelo area fig 1d gil márquez et al 2017b such a trend is basically due to the rising of solutes derived from the dissolution of halite na cl and to a lesser extent gypsum so4 2 ca2 contrary to cl so4 2 concentration do not keep growing towards the spring located at lower altitudes of each study area but it rather stabilizes around 6 g l when groundwater has ec values higher than 100 ms cm fig 2 hence although most of the springs drain na cl type water the proportion of cl respect to so4 2 also increases towards lower positions as the rcl so4 2 boxplot of fig 2 shows 4 2 groundwater dating tracers 4 2 1 tritium the 3h activity in the rain samples taken from september 2014 to june 2016 varies from 1 76 to 3 23 the estimated activities of 3h in the precipitation of the study areas from 2012 to 2017 range between 2 and 4 tu castaño and rodríguez arévalo 2019 based on estimation made from data retrieved from the gnip all spring samples contain 3h table 3 and their values range from 1 10 tu j1 to 3 06 b2 the variation of 3h concentrations found in a same spring is below 0 23 tu except for lower anzur spring j1 where 3h content varies between 1 10 and 2 59 tu table 3 most samples except b2 had 3h concentrations below the decay corrected input function which had little variations for the last 30 years fig 3 many samples present values comprised between 2 and 3 5 tu red lines in fig 3 which are similar to rain that recharged after 1980 and therefore they basically have a modern origin on the contrary h1 h2 t3 and two samples of j1 and b3 had 3h activities below 2 tu thus they must have a proportion of tritium free groundwater infiltrated before 1953 when the atmospheric 3h started to grow fig 3 lower anzur spring j1 case is quite particular as its water shows a great variability of 3h concentration table 3 fig 3 that reflects a more complex hydrogeological functioning in which the groundwater age distribution could vary notably depending on the flow conditions the system drained through lower anzur spring is markedly karstic gil márquez et al 2017c gil márquez et al 2019 and the outlet shows great hydrochemical and hydrodynamic variability table 3 during spring floods water cooling and mineralization decrease were observed as a consequence of the arrival of recently infiltrated water through karst swallow holes while depletion waters presented higher temperature and salinity rises of mineralization and water temperature frequently appear at the beginning of floods in j1 which is related to a piston flow effect gil márquez et al 2019 such term is used in karst hydrology to describe the drainage of groundwater previously stored in the system as a consequence of the pressure transfer provoked by recharge e g chiesi et al 2010 frank et al 2019 gunn 2004 hunkeler and mudry 2007 the study of the flow rate hydrochemical and isotopic variations in j1 spring during four years permitted to reach a good understanding of its functioning gil márquez et al 2019 the highest 3h value 2 59 tu table 3 was obtained during a chemical dilution dec 2016 understood as mineralization decreased which reflects the influence of recent recharge on the natural response of the spring on the other hand the lowest 3h concentrations coincided with a piston flow effect 1 95 tu and with the depletion of 2015 1 10 tu the value of 1 95 tu would have been provoked by the mobilization of deeper groundwater flows due to the recharge boost which suggests that groundwater coming from deeper regions would have less or no 3h and therefore they would be older the value of 1 1 tu would be related to the diminishing of recent recharge contribution the contribution of old groundwater must be high in such conditions since the 3h value of that sample was very low compared to precipitation concentration table 3 4 2 2 noble gases ne concentrations in all samples are lower than equilibrium values δne calculated for freshwater at recharge conditions see section 3 4 except for t4 and one sample of h3 table 3 that means that sampled waters are degassed between 16 and 66 δne nonetheless the degassing signatures were reproduced in the duplicate samples thus sampling from these springs is reliable and the loss of gas must have occurred before in order to calculate 3hetrit concentration 3h 3he ages and the proportion of 4he with a radiogenic origin 4herad it is necessary to assess the time when the degassing happened between recharge and sampling sültenfuss et al 2011 the effect of salinity over noble gas concentration is approximately of 0 42 for he and 0 48 for ne aeschbach hertig et al 1999 typical values of 4he and ne at several temperatures representing different recharge conditions are displayed in fig 4 only the samples with higher δne t4 and h3 are close to the equilibrium conditions with the atmosphere the rest of the samples which are degassed had lower ne values but greater 4he concentrations than the atmospheric equilibrium ne and he equilibrium values of the samples have been calculated according to their salinity following weiss equations 1971 the estimated equilibrium concentrations for saline samples of ne for b3 h2 and t3 are similar to those found in the samples although their measured he values are much higher fig 4 the latter also occurs in the rest of the brine samples and is due to 4herad production that leads to the accumulation of this isotope in groundwater since recharge waters reached the saturated zone sz the observed he and ne relationships in the samples could be caused via two different routes 1 blue arrows in fig 4 recharge water is in equilibrium with the atmosphere it enters the sz and gas exchanging with the atmosphere stops groundwater accumulates 4herad along its flowpath while ne concentration remains constant eventually at discharge points or close to them groundwater comes again into contact with the atmosphere and is re equilibrated depending on temperature pressure and salinity the presence of high salt concentration leads to the reduction of gas solubility which favors degassing 2 red arrows in fig 4 infiltrated water dissolves minerals throughout the unsaturated zone uz and reaches salinity values similar to those found in the spring samples thus before groundwater reaches the sz gas exchange is also possible which favors lower ne equilibrium concentrations once in the sz 4herad rises due to its underground production salt rock is absent at surface and it has not been found in any speleological survey performed within the csc aljama martínez 2017 calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 previous works carried out in the study areas andreo et al 2016 calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 carrasco 1986 gil márquez et al 2017b reveal that spring salinity is linked to the presence of halite at depth which is absent at the surface but has appeared in deep boreholes therefore the amount of nacl needed to explain the observed δne hardly could have been dissolved within the uz besides fuente camacho outlets samples h1 and h2 in los hoyos area are aligned around the degassing blue arrow in fig 4 that is more evident when looking at the position in the plot fig 4 of a h1 sample that was discarded due to extremely high degassing δne 96 such degassing pattern would indicate proportional loss of 4he and ne assuming the same starting concentrations sültenfuss et al 2011 for all these reasons assumption 1 is considered to be closer to reality consequently noble gases concentrations in table 3 were obtained from the values determined in the water samples and their δne assuming that degassing is proportional to the latter and it occurs at the outlet or nearby ne he and 3he 4he ratios have been evaluated fig 5 with a view of testing the different sources of he isotopes in the samples which allows a preliminary differentiation between young and old groundwater akesson et al 2015 mayer et al 2014 in samples with long residence time radiogenic he has been extensively accumulated and consequently their isotopic composition evolves from equilibrium values to 3he 4he ratios between 2 10 8 ballentine and burnard 2002 and 1 10 7 akesson et al 2015 when ne he approaches 0 he tends to the radioactive decay of 3h present in modern groundwater leads to a vertical shift of the samples in fig 5 from equilibrium values to higher 3he 4he ratios without significant changes in the ne he relation the mixing between 3hetrit and 3herad is detected in those samples that are deviated from the radiogenic he production line towards higher 3he 4he values even inappropriate degassing corrections do not affect the noble gas ratios and hence the decomposition of young and old waters in fig 5 only t4 is displayed close to atmospheric equilibrium conditions so it would be basically recently infiltrated groundwater h3 shows some tritiogenic production as well as a certain amount of radiogenic he the rest of the samples are scattered close to the radiogenic production lines and they have ne he values lower than 1 which shows large accumulation of herad and indicates long residence time within the media normally tritiogenic 3he is not found in samples with such low ne he and 3he 4he ratios as they are normally related to groundwater infiltrated previously to 1953 therefore they could not be dated by means of the 3h 3he method massmann et al 2008 mayer et al 2014 schlosser et al 1988 however the present case is rather particular since 3h has been detected in all the samples even those with high 4he concentration table 3 nevertheless dating this type of groundwater using the 3h 3he technique comes with some limitations mainly related to the choice of the regression line defining the radiogenic production of he that is a source of error for 3herad quantification and consequently for the determination of tritiogenic 3he this issue barely affects samples with high ne he values where the two drawn lines are close but it leads to an important bias towards lower ne he ratios like the ones observed in this cases fig 5 therefore it has come to the conclusion that this dating technique is not suitable for the kind of samples considered with high 4he concentration and unknown recharge conditions despite the above mentioned explanation 3h 3he ages of the samples were calculated table 3 for qualitative analysis the considered 3he 4he underground production ratio was 2 10 8 red line in fig 5 due to the fact that noble gases contents of the samples taken in brujuelo area b2 and b3 cannot be explained by higher values fig 5 the younger 3h 3he ages which correspond to t4 2 years and h3 15 21 years are more reliable as they have short radiogenic evolution low ne he and are not too affected by degassing δne 16 table 3 on the other hand the oldest samples t3 have 3h 3he ages up to 80 years such result is an artifice without an actual physical meaning since 3h releasing to the atmosphere started 61 years before the sample was taken and it is a result of the uncertainties previously discussed that make 3hetrit estimation and 3h 3he dating unreliable degassing high radiogenic he values in the samples and an unknown 3he 4he radiogenic production ratio in fig 3 3h 3he ages are represented against the 3h concentration of samples together with the input function in general most recently infiltrated samples h3 t3 b2 and b3 had 3h values in accordance with their ages while samples with 3h 3he infiltration dates older than 1980 j1 j2 h1 and h2 are clearly scattered below the input function which would indicate that their 3h concentration was diluted by tritium free groundwater old component or that the estimated 3hetrit is too large 4herad is present in most samples within a range of 8 0 10 6 ccstp kg in h3 to 1 1 10 3 cc stp kg in j3 most of the samples has considerably large 4he values 10 4 ccstp kg that are indication of a long water rock interaction and the subsequent radiogenic accumulation on the other hand in t4 the amount of 4herad is below the detection limit 10 6 ccstp kg since that sample does not present degassing δne 0 the absent of 4herad must be due to short residence time as the 3h 3he age pointed out in general terms higher 4herad concentrations are measured in springs placed at lower heights even considering the combined effect of salinity and temperature on the calculated concentrations of 4herad which assuming an error of 10 and 2 k in the infiltration conditions is less than 5 4 2 3 cfc 12 and sf6 all samples had cfc 12 with concentrations ranging from 0 1 pmol kg b3 to 1 3 pmol kg h3 which are comparable to atmospheric mixing ratios of 28 and 314 pptv respectively assuming the infiltration of freshwater sf6 values vary between 0 3 fmol kg b2 and 14 fmol kg j1 whose respective atmospheric concentrations are equal to 0 9 and 45 pptv the degassing correction performed is based on the δne values aeschbach hertig et al 1999 and it considerably modifies the original cfc 12 and sf6 contents fig 6 except for aguileras spring h3 that does not show significant degassing cfc 12 corrected concentrations rise to values between 0 2 and 1 6 pmol kg that are equivalent to atmospheric mixing ratios of 55 and 401 pptv table 3 corrected sf6 concentrations are comprised between 0 7 and 24 fmol kg equal to 2 4 and 79 pptv the effect of a change in the infiltration conditions of 2 k of temperature and 10 of salinity can substantially modify the calculated mixing ratio up to 20 table 3 assuming piston flow conditions infiltration dates of the original cfc 12 values vary from 1957 b3 to 1980 h4 dating values using δne corrections result in more modern ages fig 6 with recharge dates ranging from 1963 in b3 sample to 1986 in the sample taken in lower anzur spring j1 during the flood of april 2016 thus corrected cfc 12 ages range between 30 and 53 years table 3 sf6 dating only provides coherent recharge dates for b2 j1 and t3 springs as well as for h2 without degassing corrections fig 6 the rest of the samples had tracer concentrations much higher than the atmospheric input function infiltration dates obtained from sf6 values 1980 2000 are more modern than cfc 12 ones fig 6 dating derived from excess air corrected sf6 contents from δne provide even younger ages as young as 8 years table 3 despite the large variations of the calculated cfc 12 and sf6 mixing ratios due to the combine effect of the considered salinity and temperature the largest variations on the respective ages are of 4 years that is due to the steep rise of the atmospheric concentrations of cfc 12 from 1970 to 1990 and sf6 from 1980 to the present the divergence between both tracer ages could be due to mixing between several groundwater flow components of different residence time plummer et al 2006 to tracer degradation or retention within the media or to the existence of additional tracer sources apart from the atmosphere cook et al 2006 the excess of sf6 in several samples respect to the input function fig 6 suggests that the latter explanation is more likely local anthropogenic sources can modify the sf6 concentration in the nearby sectors although it is not frequent han et al 2006 particularly in cultivable lands such as the study areas previous works have revealed that some kind of rocks can produce sf6 and liberate it towards groundwater akesson et al 2015 deeds et al 2008 friedrich et al 2013 koh et al 2007 von rohden et al 2010 halite and dolomite are included among those rocks busenberg and plummer 2000 which are present in the studied formations bratton et al 2004 also found sf6 natural levels in saline groundwater therefore sf6 cannot be used for groundwater dating in this study cfc 12 ages are in most cases older than 3h 3he ones table 3 which can be attributable to a cfc concentration decrease in groundwater at least in the cases where 3h 3he dating was more reliable or to unknown processes in the degassing as cfc 12 concentration is not likely to be affected by sorption and is reduced by microbial degradation only in anoxic conditions cook and solomon 1997 the differences between both dating techniques results could be due to the mixing of diverse groundwater fractions with different ages it must be taken into account that halocarbons are only present in modern groundwater so the contribution of older cfc free water would reduce the tracer concentration at the sample the 3h analysis revealed that groundwater flows of different residence times converge at the outlets therefore cfc 12 dating results must be considered here in an illustrative way and the comparison among the cfc 12 ages of all the samples is only possible if the different mixing fractions young old are assumed to be equal in every case 4 3 mixing and distribution models in fig 7 degassing corrected cfc 12 vs 3h concentrations are presented both salt corrected i e expressed as concentration in freshwater in order to explain the concentrations found in the samples a combined input function of cfc 12 and 3h scaled to 2016 is shown which is equivalent to the temporal evolution of both tracers in unmixed young groundwater fyoung 100 all samples are below the 100 fyoung input function revealing that they also contain a certain amount of fold i e infiltrated before the 1940 s decade j3 b2 and h3 samples as well as j1 during discharge rise show a greater proportion of fyoung 65 while b3 h2 t3 and j1 in depletion conditions would have fold 40 table 4 thus j1 shows a reduction of its fyoung during depletion conditions in order to estimate the amount of fyoung and fold in each sample binary mixing lines were drawn from the origin representing fold to different points in the 100 fyoung function that are associated to specific recharge dates fig 7 as well as to distinct cfc 12 and 3h concentrations however the decay corrected concentration of 3h in precipitation and the atmospheric mixing ratio of cfc 12 show only slight variations since the middle of the 80 s and the early 90 s respectively thus the different fractions of water recharged after that period are hard to estimate using binary mixing models bmm based on 3h and cfc 12 therefore multiple mixing lines were possible when fyoung was recharged after 1985 nonetheless the explained analysis permits to quantify the percentage of both fractions in the bmms and to approximate apparent dates for the fyoung of each sample table 4 according to the bmm results table 4 the spring that drains a greater amount of tracer free groundwater is j1 in depletion conditions 65 of fold the outlets that have water with older fyoung are b3 1970 and t3 1972 the results of t3 b3 h2 and one j1 depletion samples are in the same order on the contrary most of the water 85 in the b2 sample is modern although its recharge date is one of the oldest 1976 similar results are found in j3 and h3 samples in general terms those springs located in the lowest positions of each study area drain greater fold and older fyoung table 4 excepting brujuelo area the latter would be related to the fact that don benito spring b3 is positioned in a different groundwater flowpath than the rest of the sampling points in the area gil márquez et al 2017b fig 1d the effect of salinity and temperature on the estimation of the cfc 12 mixing ratios is shown in fig 7 as error bars the higher the concentration of cfc 12 is the greater error exists however the larger cfc 12 concentrations are found in samples close to the input function on the one hand the error for those samples that plot within mixing lines before 1985 j3 and b2 does not affect the estimated age more than two years as the registered changes of cfc 12 and 3h concentrations in the atmosphere back in that time were significant on the other hand the error of the samples plotting over mixing lines from 1985 to the present j1 and h3 can nearly reach 30 years however as it was explained before the slight variations of the input functions in the last few decades give rise to a similar error in the possible mixing results thus the salinity effect would not change the conclusion obtained from the binary mixing model the groundwater age distribution of all the considered samples could be calculated by applying shape free models sfm table 4 fig 8 the distribution of ages varies notably depending on the case from those samples with a greater proportion of 15 year old groundwater h3 and j1 during flooding to those with a higher fraction of 75 year old groundwater t3 b3 h2 and j1 during depletion in j3 the three bins have similar values while b2 accumulates a high proportion of intermediate age water of 45 years fig 8 the mean ages obtained from the exponential mixing model epm and the dispersion model dm table 4 fig 8 range from 27 years j1 during flooding epm to 100 years j1 during depletion dpm meanwhile the amount of cfc 12 and 3h free groundwater 75 years which is equivalent to fold in the bm and to the oldest bin in the sfm vary from 0 j3 b2 and h3 to 30 44 j1 during depletion b3 h2 and t3 in general terms the dm and the epm mean ages calculated for each sample are similar within 1 9 years margin excepting in j1 during flooding as the older bin of the sfm contains tritium and cfc 12 free groundwater the mean age of the samples cannot be calculated besides mean age is not useful when interpreting mixed groundwater age data as it does not give any information about the groundwater age distribution by itself however the median of the groundwater age distribution hereby ga50 can be easily identified in that bin or age for lpms in which the cumulative fraction reaches or exceeds the 50 which permits to rapidly assess whether the sample is mainly formed by recent or older groundwater fig 8 table 4 ga50 range from 10 years j1 during flooding dm to 75 years or more i e tracer free water in b3 h2 t3 and j1 during depletion 3 bin sfm thus such parameter shows great differences in the groundwater age distribution of j1 depending on its hydrodynamic state indicating a complex hydrogeological functioning of the system that it drains the ga50 of the samples obtained from the sfm and the lpms differ because sfm discretized the groundwater age distribution while the lpms provide continuous functions nonetheless the samples with the higher and the smaller values of ga50 are the same regardless the model excepting j1 finally the percentage of the sample that is 3h and cfc 12 free 75 years vary between 0 and 70 normally the outlets located at higher positions in their respective study area present smaller ga50 and smaller fractions of groundwater older than 75 years suggesting that their drainage is less influenced by regional groundwater flows 5 discussion 5 1 joint interpretation of age tracers and water mineralization the comparison between 3h contents and ec values of spring water samples fig 9 a shows that in general terms the more mineralized the water of brine i e ec 40 ms cm springs is the lower 3h values it contains the inverse relation between ec and 3h is observed in every study area when analyzed individually as well as in the samples taken in anzur bajo j1 don benito b3 and cañaveralejo springs t3 with three or more determinations of 3h table 3 the negative ec 3h relationship suggests that the samples with greater salinity could have a larger contribution of tritium free groundwater flows infiltrated before 1953 such groundwater would have longer residence time within the media and therefore it would have dissolved higher amounts of solutes on the other hand the more recently infiltrated water with 3h would have less dissolved minerals the fact that the obtained correlation degrees are not too high fig 9a could be due to diverse factors the low number of observations the complexity of the 3h input function and its stabilization since the 1980 decade and the lithological and hydrogeological heterogeneity of the studied systems the 3he 4he ratios of the sample vary between 4 4 10 8 and 1 4 10 6 table 3 therefore the presence of 4he coming from the mantle is unlikely as such source could considerably rise the 3he 4he values up to 1 4 10 5 ozima and podosek 1983 and there is no volcanic activity or important outcrops of igneous rocks in the area solomon et al 1996 described high 4herad values in young groundwater of sedimentary aquifers made up of protoliths originated from the denudation of older formations although the geological setting could suit that description the age of the original formation is triassic much younger than the paleozoic rocks described by solomon et al 1996 consequently no significant 4he sources have been considered apart from atmospheric air excess and underground production the 3h activities of aguileras spring h3 are in agreement with the calculated 3h 3he age and the rain data fig 3 and the models results suggest that the degree of mixing with 3h free groundwater is low 0 35 compared to most of the samples table 4 besides the estimation of its 4herad concentration has fewer uncertainties as its water show little degassing table 3 based on all that h3 is the most appropriate spring for evaluating the 4herad production rate in the study areas assuming no mixing with 3h free groundwater it would be necessary an 4he accumulation rate of approximately 5 2 10 10 ccstp g year to reach the observed 4herad values found in h3 in a transit time similar to its 3h 3he age this value is comparable to others found in literature lehmann et al 2003 mahara et al 2009 schlosser et al 1989 solomon et al 1996 4he ages derived from the proposed accumulation rate are included in table 3 and vary from 1 year t4 to more than 4600 years t3 nonetheless such values must be considered carefully as the existence of an old groundwater component containing a large concentration of 4he in the mixing would introduce a considerable uncertainty to the calculated accumulation rate also the 4herad accumulation rates reported in literature vary two order of magnitude from 0 2 10 10 nml g year lehmann et al 2003 to 1 9 10 9 nml g year beyerle et al 1999 in any case if a similar accumulation rates are assumed in each study area the 4he ages of the springs located at lower altitudes would be older except for jarales area where lower anzur spring j1 samples had less 4herad than upper anzur spring j3 degassing corrected 4herad values and proposed 4he ages table 3 also present some relation with ec although it is positive contrary to that observed between 3h and ec fig 9 that suggests that the most mineralized waters would generally have greater 4herad concentrations than those with less solute content therefore groundwater salinity could be somehow related to their residence time within the media as the accumulation of the observed 4herad values requires long lasting water rock interaction iaea 2013 torgersen and clarke 1985 assuming this statement springs draining brine water could be the discharge points of regional groundwater flows nonetheless it must be pointed out that noble gas interpretation was accompanied by many uncertainties mainly due to degassing such physical process is favored by the drop of gas solubility in high salinity groundwater gerber et al 2017 particularly considering that samples were taken from springs once groundwater might has been already in contact with the atmosphere besides the convergence at the spring of a hierarchized groundwater flowpath system with different residence times makes it difficult to quantify the age of the older components of the mixing without the additional information of other long timescale tracers gardner et al 2015 in this study 4he cannot be considered as a quantitative tracer but rather it must be taken into account as a qualitative longtime scale indicator the use of a combination of short filter screen boreholes with different depth near the springs could help in future works to avoid degassing and to determine the groundwater age of different flow components the existence of groundwater flowpaths with different residence time in the media that converge at the springs would make the use of the mean ages in this study inappropriate as groundwater age indicator particularly having mixing fractions older than 75 years table 4 that cannot be properly dated with the used tracers gardner et al 2015 on the contrary the parameters extracted from the fsm and the lpms ga50 75 permit to evaluate whether the sample groundwater age distribution lends towards young or older fractions the positive correlation between ec and ga50 and 75 values table 5 fig 10 a b respectively also suggest that mineralization is related to groundwater residence time the degassing corrected concentration of cfc 12 decreases inversely to ec and more noticeable to ga50 and to the fraction of 75 year old groundwater fig 10c e table 5 thus samples with younger groundwater age distribution normally would have greater concentrations of cfc 12 and lower mineralization on the other hand the samples with greater contribution of older components b3 h2 t3 j1 in depletion would contain less cfc 12 as a consequence of its dilution by a larger fraction of tracer free groundwater which would be related to longer residence time and therefore to longer water rock interaction processes such prolonged interaction would explain the inverse relation between cfc 12 and ec due to greater solute transfer to old groundwater the solubility of gypsum is boosted by the addition of nacl due to the ionic force rising which modifies the equilibrium between the chemical phases of the aqueous solution zen 1965 however over 250 g of nacl l gypsum solubility significantly falls as shown in fig 2 cl concentration of samples constantly grow towards lower elevation while so4 2 contents stabilize between 5 and 6 g l except for h1 and h2 samples which contain lower amounts of so4 2 that is a consequence of its greater concentrations of cl as a result rcl so4 2 ingrowth is not constant nevertheless rcl so4 2 and ec has a great positive correlation r2 0 99 fig 10f for most samples before gypsum solubility descent h2 those samples with older groundwater age distribution i e greater ga50 and 75 years show higher rcl so4 2 fig 10g h as they have undergone longer lasting interaction with the media thus rcl so4 2 could be considered as an indicator of hydrogeochemical evolution for nacl contents below the solubility drop but also of residence time in general terms the explained relations do not work so well if the sample taken during spring flooding in j1 is considered fig 10 as the plots of groundwater age distribution show fig 8 a large fraction of this sample has a recent origin and it would be related to recently infiltrated water flowing through karst conduit on the contrary the older bin in the sfms of j1 which accounts for a higher percentage during depletion would be linked to dispersive groundwater flows the system drained through this outlet has a very complex hydrogeological functioning in which the contribution to the mixing of different groundwater flow components greatly varies partly due to the high development of the karst network gil márquez et al 2019 therefore in high water conditions when conduit flow accounts for much of the discharge rate in the spring the outlet is not comparable with the rest of the samples in which smaller flow rate variations were recorded table 2 5 2 integrating groundwater ages in the hydrogeological conceptual model the evaporite karst setting here studied csc is heterogeneous and complex and its hydrogeological functioning is conditioned by both characteristics however the joint interpretation of chemical information and environmental tracer data has highlighted some similarities between the different study areas in general terms the springs that drain the most mineralized water in each area are located at lower altitudes fig 2 likewise there is some correspondence between the groundwater age distribution of samples and their solute content and their rcl so4 2 fig 10 thus outlets located at a lower altitude normally drain higher proportion of fold table 4 meaning water recharged more than 70 years ago and also have older groundwater age distribution figs 8 and 11 besides some springs show a certain degree of positive temperature anomaly particularly in brujuelo and jarales areas fig 2 all that is in agreement with the hydrogeological conceptual model proposed by andreo et al 2016 hence outlets located in higher positions would be feed by surficial and short groundwater flowpaths on the other hand the springs found in the lowest areas present brine groundwater with low cfc 12 and 3h values as well as high 4he contents fig 11 such outlets are the consequence of the convergence of long groundwater flowpath of great residence time and others infiltrated more recently that is these spring waters are mixtures between groundwater with 3h and cfc 12 contents and groundwater that is free of those tracers but contain high 4he values fig 11 as a result samples collected in those springs have older groundwater age distributions with ga50 values above 50 years and more than 30 of old fractions table 4 fig 8 in an intermediate position springs drain groundwater with high mineralization although lower than those located at the lowest positions as they would receive fewer inflows of long groundwater flowpath of great residence time in the media high 4he and no cfc 12 or 3h therefore their groundwater age distribution is leaned towards younger dates with ga50 30 years and smaller or absent fold fractions table 4 fig 8 11 typically the contribution of older groundwater to this kind of discharge points increases as their geochemical evolution does which is reflected in the amount of 4he their mineralization ec and the rcl so4 2 figs 9 and 10 the conceptual model here discussed is also used by andreo et al 2016 to explain the hydrological functioning of wetlands and their hydrochemical and hydroperiod diversity as a results of their relation with groundwater similarly to other models found in literature euliss et al 2004 lissey 1971 winter 1999 no wetland samples have been analyzed in this work for dating purposes however recent groundwater dating research based in the 14c and 4he methods were performed in fuente de piedra wetland höbig et al 2016 montalván et al 2017 that is considered a discharge wetland kohfahl et al 2008 linares 1990 in the csc fig 1c according to the hydrogeological model explained by andreo et al 2016 results suggested that the oldest groundwater flows in fuente de piedra wetland basin unmixed with modern waters could be in the order of 105 year old the 4he values in the outlets considered in the present research suggest residence times one order of magnitude lower however it must be remembered that different groundwater flows converge in the springs and the 4he concentration is mainly provided by the oldest fractions of samples hence the amount of 4he in the samples is diluted by the modern components with practically no radiogenic 4he therefore the results obtained by höbig et al 2016 and montalván et al 2017 can be considered in agreement with this research and reinforce the idea of the contribution of old groundwater flow components towards discharge areas in the csc nevertheless this hydrogeological conceptual model is not completely replicable in every study area or spring due to the high heterogeneity of the csc unit which is enhanced by karstification in evaporite rocks such is the case of lower anzur spring j1 in that spring the age distribution and the environmental tracer concentration fig 8 and table 3 vary notably depending on the hydrodynamic state of the system that it drains besides the number of samples considered in this study is limited compared to the great extension of the csc so it would be necessary to confirm the drawn conclusions with further analysis in which specific measures must be taken to avoid degassing particularly sampling should be performed in short filter screen boreholes with different depth drilled near the outlets furthermore the determination of 85kr would permit to include more bins in the free shape model that could help to better define the groundwater age distribution of the samples while the use of 39ar would allow investigating a range of age 50 1000 years that the tracers used in this study do not consider 6 conclusions in this research a multi criteria approach coupling hydrochemical data and environmental dating tracers 3h 3he 4he cfc 12 sf6 is presented to investigate the hydrogeological functioning of complex evaporite karst systems in southern spain binary mixing models free shape models and lumped parameter models were created to define the age distribution of groundwater samples collected in springs which contained old and young fractions as proved by the coexistence of high concentrations of 4he together with the presence of cfc 12 and 3h the information extracted from those models combined with hydrogeochemical data has permitted to verify previous hypothesis about the hierarchization of groundwater flows in the considered aquitard formations in which groundwater mineralization rises toward lower altitudes where the groundwater age distribution indicate the drainage of older groundwater two parameters were proposed for describing the age distribution the median age ga50 and the fraction of groundwater free of tritium and cfc 70 particularly ga50 makes it possible to evaluate rapidly whether a sample is biased to younger or older ages and comparing different samples in that way ga50 is presented as an easy way of interpreting mixed groundwater age data the joint use of several groundwater dating tools has allowed to test the applicability of different techniques in unfavorable settings the high salinity of groundwater and the local development of karstification boosted the degassing of the spring water where flowpaths with groundwater of different age converge all that together results in many uncertainties however corrections in environmental tracers have been made according to the salinity and degassing of samples which has permitted to obtain representative information of the studied systems even so the 3h 3he was not valid in this context where the high 4he values impeded to correctly estimate the contribution of different 3he sources on the other hand sensitive analysis were made to test the effect of salinity and temperature variations on the dating results in future works sampling from short filtered boreholes it is highly advisable in order to avoid mixing and degassing particularly if brine groundwater or karst flow are involved but also to identify the different flows with variable groundwater age that mix in springs the inclusion of other environmental tracers such as 85kr and 39ar in the shape free models would also help to precise the groundwater age

5970,the hydrogeological functioning of four different areas in a complex evaporite karst unit of predominantly aquitard behavior in s spain was investigated environmental dating tracers 3h 3he 4he cfc 12 sf6 and hydrochemical data were determined from spring samples to identify and characterize groundwater flow components of different residence times in the media results show a general geochemical evolution pattern from higher recharge areas to lower positions discharge areas in which mineralization rises as well as the value of the rcl so4 2 evidencing longer water rock interaction ne values show degassing of most of the samples favored by the high salinity of groundwater and the development of karstification so that the concentration of all the considered gases were corrected according to the difference between the theoretical and the measured ne the presence of modern groundwater in every sample was proved by the detection of 3h and cfc 12 at the opposite the higher amount of radiogenic 4he in most samples also indicates that they have an old component the 3h 3he dating method does not give reliable ages as a consequence of degassing and the large uncertainty of the 3he 4he ratios of the sources for the radiogenic helium the large sf6 concentrations suggest terrigenic production related to halite and dolomite binary mixing and free shape models were created based on 3h and cfc 12 data to interpret the age distribution of the samples two parameters ga50 and 70 were proposed as an indicator of that distribution as they provide further information than the mean age particularly ga50 is derived from the median groundwater age and is presented as a new way of interpreting mixed groundwater age data a greater fraction of old groundwater 3h and cfc 12 free was identified in discharge areas while the proportion and estimated infiltration date of the younger fractions in recharge areas were higher and more recent respectively the application of different approaches has been useful to corroborate previous theoretical conceptual model proposed for the study area and to test the applicability of the used environmental tracer in dating brine groundwater and karst springs keywords groundwater dating evaporite karst brine spring free shape models 1 introduction reaching an adequate understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of groundwater in a specific system requires a good knowledge of its geological characteristics e g lithology stratigraphy structure as well as of the hydraulic parameters of the hosting rocks thus understanding the groundwater flow dynamics in settings with complex geology is challenging more even if the available information about the characteristics of the media is scarce zhou and li 2011 which is often the case in low permeability formations that are rarely investigated owed to their limited productivity cherry et al 2006 the performance of hydraulic tests in this kind of media is limited as they would require too much time which makes it considerably difficult hart et al 2006 mejías et al 2009 neuzil 1986 rowe and nadarajah 1993 besides when permeability data are obtained from local field surveys they cannot be extrapolated to the rest of the aquitard formation konikow and neuzil 2007 in which secondary porosity i e fractures and conduits plays a key role on groundwater flow dynamics andreo et al 2016 cherry et al 2006 goldscheider et al 2010 kreitler 1989 as a consequence groundwater flow dynamics in low permeability settings is normally inferred using hydrochemical and isotopic tools cherry et al 2006 complementary the development of dating techniques makes it possible to investigate groundwater residence times within this type of media in which regional gravity driven flows are involved cardenas and jiang 2010 gassiat et al 2013 during the second half of the 20th century many research works chebotarev 1955 jankowski and jacobson 1989 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 randal 1967 schwartz and domenico 1973 tóth 1999 demonstrated that groundwater in such contexts evolves towards greater concentrations of dissolved solids and higher temperature values while the hydrochemical facies transition from bicarbonate to chloride going through sulfate recent studies beyer et al 2016 gerber et al 2017 mcmahon et al 2010 van engelen et al 2018 xu et al 2018 have also exposed the relationship between groundwater age and mineralization by jointly using hydrochemical and dating tools each tracer is suitable to analyze a specific age range so if tracer ages are generated for time intervals where they are not suitable tracers ages differ corcho alvarado et al 2007 kralik et al 2014 solomon et al 2010 sültenfuss et al 2011 waugh et al 2003 for instance the use of 3h 3he cfc or 85kr would give the same age in the interval 0 50 years under piston flow conditions the mixing of flow components with different residence time in a given sample also affects the estimation of ages if the analyzed groundwater sample contains fractions older than those datable with a certain tracer it may lead to a bias towards lower ages even more in heterogeneous media gardner et al 2015 that normally occurs near the surface particularly in springs or in long filtered wells where several flow lines converge each one with a characteristic concentration of tracers delbart et al 2014 stolp et al 2010 suckow 2014 thomas et al 2003 lumped parameter models lpms are normally used to integrate and quantitatively interpret the tracer data in hydrological systems jódar et al 2014 maloszewski and zuber 1982 solomon et al 2010 turnadge and smerdon 2014 however they require a good knowledge of the groundwater flow dynamics to be meaningful besides the combination of flow components with very dissimilar ages complicate the use of lpms which in such circumstances are rarely effective solomon et al 2010 stanton et al 2007 as they do not achieve to estimate the age distribution of all the groundwater fractions that are present in the sample torgersen and stute 2013 more recently visser et al 2013 have developed mixing models based on the discretization of groundwater age distribution that means that natural tracer data are used to calculate the contribution i e percentage of a given age range to the sample as a whole the application of this kind of models is simpler and it does not require the estimation of any hydraulic parameter on the other hand the transport of environmental tracer is not ideal since they can be affected by physical dispersion gas exchange dilution decay and chemical degradation exchange with unknown reservoirs processes that may modify their concentration and therefore they produce a bias in their apparent ages cook and solomon 1997 iaea 2006 degassing can substantially change the concentration of gas in groundwater particularly in karst aquifers delbart et al 2014 where gases could possibly exchange with air in the conduit network of unknown composition as salinity changes the gas solubilities this in additional factor for uncertainty to take into account when groundwater is brine gerber et al 2017 in both cases the information derived from environmental tracers must be jointly interpreted with hydrogeochemical information the goal of this work is to test the applicability of the combined use of groundwater dating 3h 3he 4he cfc 12 sf6 and hydrochemical tools to reach a better understanding of groundwater flow dynamics and residence times in geologically complex aquitard formations with scarce knowledge of their inner structure and the hydraulic parameters of the host rock the applicability of some groundwater dating tools in karst settings and brine groundwater are also discussed as pilot sites four different areas have been selected within the so called chaotic subbetic complex csc an evaporite karst unit in southern spain fig 1 a with a predominant aquitard behavior but with significant local development of second porosity due to karstification based on environmental tracer data binary mixing and free shape models have been created as well as some lumped parameter models some describing parameters derived from them have been proposed to investigate the age distribution of the springs draining the studied system particularly the median groundwater age ga50 and the percentage of old groundwater 70 the results derived from environmental tracers jointly analyzed with hydrochemical data has confirmed a theoretical hydrogeological conceptual model previously proposed for the csc andreo et al 2016 which has proved the usefulness of the multiapproach considered here additionally some practical recommendations dealing with degassing are presented with the aim of being helpful in future works carried out in similar settings worldwide 2 geographical and hydrogeological settings the chaotic subbetic complex vera and martín algarra 2004 is a large olistostromic unit located in andalusia s spain that extends along the southern border of guadalquivir foreland basin in a wide 300 km long band with se ne direction fig 1a the csc is mainly formed by evaporites anhydrite gypsum and halite and multi colored clays and sandstones of upper triassic keuper age although other lithologies are also present sandstones marls limestones and dolomites from triassic to miocene ages normally as olistoliths this geological unit is very folded and brecciated which conferred the csc a disorganized and chaotic structure thus the csc can be defined as a megabreccia of triassic clayey evaporite matrix where different kinds of blocks are embedded halite is not present at the surface due to its high solubility although its existence at depth can be inferred from groundwater hydrochemistry and boreholes drilled in evaporite outcrops calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 carrasco 1986 traditionally csc materials have been considered impervious due to the abundance of triassic clays marls and sandstones however the high solubility of evaporite rocks favors the development of second porosity through dissolution and karstification as a consequence highly unstable cavities and conduits are formed which lead to a fast geomorphological evolution calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 gutiérrez et al 2008 and result in the formation of endokarst and exokarst features such as dolines uvalas swallow holes and speleological networks that are characteristic of karst aquifers ford and williams 2007 white 1988 thus the abundance of evaporite rocks plays a key role in the hydrogeological functioning of csc outcrops allowing a local karst functioning where the evaporite formations are more continuous gil márquez et al 2017a however the predominance of low permeability materials clays sandstones dolomite blocks which function as aquitards confers the whole csc a high hydrogeological complexity the most common landforms in the csc are karst depressions some of which are naturally drained through karst swallow holes that become active during rainfall episodes keeping the bottom of endorheic areas dry or slightly flooded during short periods andreo et al 2016 in contrast where no swallow holes exist dolines and karst depressions remain flooded longer or even permanently such areas are considered as wetlands whose genesis and natural hydric dynamic are related to evaporite karst they are very diverse with a high range of water mineralization and hydrochemical facies as well as hydroperiods of diverse length rodríguez rodríguez et al 2010 in addition to karst development and wetland areas the presence of springs wells and boreholes also evidences the existence of groundwater flows within the csc the springs often drain brine groundwater with na cl facies especially those located at lower elevations andreo et al 2016 explained the hydrogeological complexity found in the csc in a hydrogeological conceptual model inspired by toth s gravity driven regional groundwater flow model gdrgf toth 1963 tóth 1970 the proposed approach explains the hydrodiversity hydrochemistry hydro period of wetlands and springs based on their geological hydrogeological contexts as several authors have also done in other areas worldwide euliss et al 2004 lissey 1971 winter 1999 in general terms springs found at lower positions of csc outcrops drain brine and warm groundwater as they would be linked to long regional and ascending groundwater flows of great residence time within the media discharge wetlands located in the same context would continuously receive groundwater inputs normally of high salinity leading to long lasting or even permanent flooding on the other hand at the highest location wetlands are located above the phreatic level and they constitute recharge features of the aquifers recharge wetlands they normally have ephemeral flooding and low mineralized water owing to their meteoric origin or to sporadic groundwater inputs related to short local flows similarly small springs and leakages found in high areas also drain groundwater with low salinity that would have had a short residence time within the aquifer lastly in intermediate positions between discharge and recharge areas there are springs and transit wetlands that do not constitute the final destination of groundwater flows which would instead go towards discharge areas groundwater drained through such springs and wetlands present variable mineralization as a consequence of variable contribution of groundwater flows with different residence times but also due to the lithological heterogeneity of the media the theoretical conceptual model of andreo et al 2016 is appropriate to describe the general hydrodiversity and the hydrogeological context of wetlands located in the csc however this model is not completely replicated in every evaporitic karst area due to their specific geological and geomorphological particularities consequently four different study areas have been considered in this work which are located in different provinces of andalusia fig 1 the jarales area in the cordoba province western los hoyos and eastern sectors of the trias of antequera area in the málaga province and the brujuelo area in the jaén province 2 1 jarales area the jarales area fig 1b is a plateau 80 km2 surrounded by genil river sw and its tributary anzur river ne the central part of the area rises 350 440 m a s l and has smooth relief with a poorly define drainage network and numerous endorheic areas some of which often host wetlands as a result of hydraulic interactions with the water table while some others are naturally drained through swallow holes recharge occurs by the direct entrance of runoff through swallow holes by means of water infiltration through permeable exposures and likely through the bottom of wetlands groundwater flows in a radial and centrifugal way from the central part of the plateau towards its borders fig 1b where the main outlets are located the most important discharge points are lower anzur spring j1 247 m a s l to the north salinillas spring j2 253 m a s l by genil river and upper anzur spring j3 300 m a s l eastwards fig 1b all of them draining brine water lower anzur spring j1 is hydrogeologically connected to some karst swallow holes as proved by a multi injection dye tracer test gil márquez et al 2017a allowing rapid and abundant arrival of recently infiltrated water 2 2 trias de antequera area the trias de antequera ta area fig 1c is an elongated csc outcrop of ene wsw direction located in the northern part of malaga province it is one of the most remarkable evaporite karst in spain with numerous examples of exokarst dolines collapses karstic canyons and endokarst caves features whose appearance is conditioned by the uplifting of the ground due to halokinetic processes calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 the hydrogeological functioning of the ta is highly influenced by preferential infiltration forms related to karst dynamic there are also important wetlands in this area such as the complexes of wetlands of campillos antequera and archidona fig 1c groundwater discharge takes place towards some of these wetlands almécija 1997 linares 1990 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2006 but also through springs the outlets are mainly distributed in the borders of some diapiric structures calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 in this research two sectors within the ta area were separately treated the western sector nearby guadalhorce reservoir and the east sector also called los hoyos area fig 1c the most important discharge zone in the eastern ta is meliones spring by guadalhorce river the brine groundwater that it drains leads to the salinization of the downstream water resources particularly gualdahorce reservoir several outlets appear by said reservoir hereby called meliones 1 t1 345 m a s l and meliones 2 t2 350 m a s l they are normally submerged below the reservoir water level except for short periods so they are rarely accessible other significant discharge points in the eastern sector are cañaveralejo spring t3 400 m a s l south of campillos wetland complex and saladilla t4 450 m a s l east of antequera city fig 1c los hoyos area fig 1c is one of several diapiric structures appearing at the ta area calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 it covers 20 km2 and rises to 700 900 m a s l approximately 50 m above the surrounding zones the landscape is full of karst landforms mainly dolines of different typology but also sinkholes swallow holes and small surfaced depressions which favor water recharge those dolines located at the central part of the study area above 800 m a s l are normally smaller and they may present flooding for short periods as the groundwater table is located below their bottom towards the edges of the diapiric structure closed depressions present greater size and their hydroperiod are longer two of them are wetlands of great environmental value grande and chica lakes rodríguez rodríguez et al 2007 near grande lake there is a spring whose direct hydrogeological connection with the wetland seems unlikely despite it is located 787 m a s l below the wetland water surface gil márquez et al 2016 on the opposite part of los hoyos area near fuente camacho village discharge takes place at a lower altitude 725 748 m a s l by several brine outlets two of those points were sampled during this study fuente camacho i h1 and fuente camacho ii h2 2 3 brujuelo area lastly brujuelo area is located 12 km north of the city of jaen in a relatively high plain west of a tributary of guadalquivir river salado stream fig 1d this area does not have abundant exokarst features except for some small depressions and few surface collapses the two biggest karst depressions are occupied by brujuelo and cirueña wetlands with seasonal and ephemeral hydroperiods respectively diffuse recharge takes place in the area as suggested by isotopic information gil márquez et al 2017b groundwater flow in a diffuse way from the sw towards salado stream n and e where the main outlets are found san carlos b1 375 m a s l and don benito b3 440 m a s l springs fig 1d other outlets found in the area are in descending order tosquillas b5 490 m a s l and brujuelo b4 450 m a s l leakages and brujuelo spring b2 425 m a s l previous hydrogeochemical work carried out in this area gil márquez et al 2017b evidences a progressive enhancement of mineral dissolution and increase of water temperature toward lower positions which could be related to a greater contribution of long and deep groundwater flows with greater residence time within the media as proposed by andreo et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 theoretical basis tritium 3h is the radioactive isotope of hydrogen and is naturally formed in the atmosphere its presence in groundwater mainly comes from precipitation as part of water molecules 3h is the only tracer that can be used to date groundwater directly clark and fritz 1997 the atmospheric concentration of 3h increased markedly between 1955 and 1963 due to thermonuclear tests reaching values that were three orders of magnitude above natural background especially in the northern hemisphere e g solomon and cook 2000 however the abundance of atmospheric 3h is nowadays similar to that before nuclear testing as most of the remaining released 3h is in the ocean or the subsurface e g han et al 2006 in any case the presence of 3h in a groundwater sample indicates that at least part of it has a modern origin meaning that it was infiltrated after 1953 the joint determination of 3h and 3he its decay product permits to quantify the time elapsed between isolation from the atmosphere after recharge and sampling of the modern fraction post 1953 of a water sample and it has been broadly applied cook and solomon 1997 poreda et al 1988 stolp et al 2010 torgersen et al 1978 the application of the 3h 3he dating method also requires 4he and ne measurements in order to distinguish between different sources of 3he in groundwater equilibrium excess air tritiogenic radiogenic more details regarding the 3h 3he technique can be found in literature e g solomon and cook 2000 sültenfuss et al 2011 part of 4he concentration in groundwater samples can be attributable to underground production derived from the u and th decay series and it is called radiogenic 4he 4herad assuming that the 4herad produced within minerals is liberated to groundwater at a constant rate and homogeneously in space its concentration would increase proportionally to groundwater travel time solomon 2000 thus 4herad can be used as a dating tool as long as other sources of 4he are substantially lower than the radiogenic origin torgersen and stute 2013 however the utilization of 4herad for groundwater dating is challenging in settings where there is no knowledge about the proportion of u and th in the rocks as the accumulation rate of 4herad can largely vary between different geological formations from 5 8 10 12 nml g of h2o wei et al 2015 to 1 9 10 9 nml g of h2o beyerle et al 1999 the 4herad technique has been applied with relative success in many studies although 4herad ages normally divert from the ages of other long scale tracers such as 14c berger 2008 lippmann et al 2003 müller et al 2016 torgersen and clarke 1985 in any case even if quantitative dating is not possible 4herad determination provide qualitative information about long timescale groundwater residence times gardner and heilweil 2014 sültenfuss et al 2011 wei et al 2015 the use of 4he in groundwater dating is thoroughly discussed in solomon 2000 and torgersen and stute 2013 in this study 14c has not been considered as the presence of carbonate in the media overwhelms atmospheric 14c inducing some uncertainties that prohibit reliable ages iaea 2013 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are synthetic gases that were used for industrial purposes and release into the atmosphere during the second half of the 20th century iaea 2006 they were restricted by the montreal protocol of 1987 due to their effect on the ozone layer depletion unep 1987 as these gases show almost inert behavior in the atmosphere the evolutions of the atmospheric concentration of cfcs describe distinct functions on the other hand the use of other halogenated gases such as sulfur hexafluoride sf6 still continues and their atmospheric concentrations are currently rising the nearly monotone evolution of the cfc and sf6 mixing ratios in the atmosphere can be used for groundwater dating assuming that the atmosphere is the only source in the aquifer cfcs are affected by degradation in anoxic conditions cook et al 2006 and heavy local contaminations kralik et al 2014 although no evident signs of degradation or retention have been reported for sf6 busenberg and plummer 2000 han et al 2006 in situ production was found in various studies akesson et al 2015 friedrich et al 2013 harnisch and eisenhauer 1998 besides this the temperature for gas exchange at the water atmosphere interface must be known by about 1 k cook et al 2006 these trace gases are also affected by the contribution of bubble inclusion so called excess air as well as salinity during recharge wanninkhof et al 1991 warner and weiss 1985 further information about groundwater dating techniques using cfc and sf6 can be found in iaea 2006 darling et al 2012 and chambers et al 2018 3 2 measurement and sampling procedures during four years september 2013 september 2017 field campaigns for the physicochemical monitoring were carried out in the four study areas in situ measurements of electrical conductivity ec and water temperature wtw conductivimeter thermometer 3310 were performed in the main springs and water samples were collected for subsequent major ion determination flow rate measurements were also made in most of the outlets ott c2 flow meter data accuracy was 1 μs cm for ec 0 1 c for temperature and 10 for flow rate sampling and measurement periodicities varied from daily to monthly depending on the hydrodynamic conditions additionally some samples were taken for groundwater dating purposes 3h and he isotopes sampling was mainly performed during three campaigns september 2014 towards the end of the dry period of the 2013 14 hydrogeological year one month later october 2014 after the first precipitation episodes of 2014 15 and summer 2015 july september additionally two other samples were taken in anzur bajo spring j1 during two flooding periods april 5 2016 and december 11 2016 samples for noble gases were also taken with duplicates in the mentioned campaigns excepting the first one sampling for cfc 12 analysis was mainly carried out between april and june 2016 although one sample was previously collected april 2015 samples for major components and tritium analysis were directly taken in 125 ml amber glass bottles and 1 l pet bottles respectively for he and ne determination spring water was collected into duplicate clamped off copper cylinders through a transparent tube using a 12v submersible pump waterra tempest following the protocol of bremen university sültenfuss et al 2011 visser et al 2013 samples for cfc and sf6 analysis were collected in 500 ml steel ampoules similar to those described by jaunat et al 2012 and labasque et al 2014 by means of a peristaltic pump hach sigma 900 portable sampler which has been successfully used in springs with low flow iaea 2006 and reference therein to avoid contamination viton tubing was used from the spring to the ampoules a transparent hose was used as water outlet from the pump which permitted to check for bubbles that could indicate induced degassing once the steel ampoules were sealed they were shook to detect any possible noise caused by the involuntary formation of a headspace 3 3 analytical methods major elements were determined in the laboratory of the centre of hydrogeology of university of malaga cehiuma hco3 was measured by volumetric titration with 0 02 n h2so4 to ph 4 45 major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 analysis were conducted by ionic chromatography metrohm compact 930 ic flex for cations and compact 881 ic pro for anions with 2 accuracy due to high salinity most samples were diluted to 1 ms cm and then inline filtered before being introduced into the analytic system determination of 3h he isotopes ne cfc 12 and sf6 was performed at the department of oceanography of the institute of environmental physics university of bremen he isotopes and ne were extracted from samples and then separated from other gases by means of a cryogenic system afterward they were determined in the mass spectrometric facility described by sültenfuß et al 2009 the 3h analysis was based on the 3he ingrowth method clarke et al 1976 500 g of water samples were degassed and stored in gas free glass bulbs for 3he 3h decay product production and accumulation after 4 6 months of storage 3he was determined with the mass spectrometric system cfc 12 and sf6 concentrations were detected with a micro electron capture detector mounted on a gas chromatograph agilent gc6890n with a capillary column as described in bulsiewicz et al 1998 cfc data were calibrated according to the sio scale 2005 bullister and tanhua 2010 the specific radioactive activity of 3h is expressed in tritium units tu 0 119 bq kg of h2o and noble gas concentrations are referred to ccstp kg of h2o cfc 12 and sf6 values were determined as pmol kg of h2o and afterward converted to atmospheric mixing ration pptv based on recharge conditions temperature pressure and salinity most samples were brine but solute content is supposed to be low at the time and location of recharge thus the concentration of every tracer determined was corrected to be expressed as concentration in freshwater according to the density of each sample which was calculated based on their chemical composition using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 3 4 data treatment for hydrological interpretation recharge temperatures were assumed to be 15 c in accordance with the average air temperature of the study areas during recharge periods october to may calculated for the period 1973 74 2015 16 gil márquez 2018 atmospheric pressure was adjusted to the main altitude in each study area 400 m above sea level m a s l in jarales 500 m a s l in brujuelo and western trias of antequera and 850 m a s l in los hoyos based on previous knowledge of the study areas all samples were supposed to be infiltrated as freshwater thus salinity would not have affect equilibrium solubility before entering the saturated zone sz the reason for that assumption is discussed in section 4 2 2 in order to check the effect of changes of salinity and temperature on the tracer concentrations and ages table 1 variations of 2 k and 10 have been jointly considered the effect of altitude has not been checked as the study areas are relatively plain after calculating solubility equilibrium fractions for all tracers and each sample potential contributions of excess air or degassing were quantified based on δne values mayer et al 2014 schlosser et al 1989 meaning the difference between the determined ne contents and its solubility equilibrium concentration neeq expressed in percentage thus the degassing corrected concentration of a given gas tracer ccorr can be obtained from the measured concentration cs by applying the aeschbach hertig et al 1999 degassing equations based on the diffusion coefficient of the gases for low solubility gases e g ne he the correction approaches to the following equation 1 c corr c s n e eq n e eq δ n e note that δ ne 0 for degassed samples the 3h activity and the corrected cfc 12 and sf6 concentrations were compared to their respective atmospheric input functions the cfc 12 and sf6 atmospheric mixing ratio in precipitations for northern hemisphere atmosphere was obtained from usgs 2018 referred to sio 2005 scale bullister and tanhua 2010 because of a higher solubility of cfc 12 compared to he ne and sf6 corrections of cfc 12 data are overestimated by this simple approach a specific tritium input function from andalusia was generated using the available data from 5 gnip stations in s spain and gibraltar iaea wmo 2018 those within a 150 km radius from the study areas the 3h input curve was created by the correlation between that data and the tritium in precipitation record of gnip vienna station as 3h is a radioactive isotope part of the 3h recharged from 1953 has already decayed thus a decayed input function scaled to 2016 was created based on the radioactive decay law and the 3h decay constant of 0 05626 yr 1 ln 2 12 32 yr cfc 12 and 3h decayed input functions were used to develop binary mixing models bmm shape free models sfm and lumped parameter models lpm that could explain the observed tracer concentrations and permit quantifying the amount of old groundwater i e tritium and cfc free in each sample fold approximating 3h and cfc 12 mean ages of the modern fraction fyoung and defining its groundwater age distribution in this study fold is considered to be infiltrated before the 1940 s decade previously to the anthropogenic release of both 3h and cfc 12 the use of bmm is widely extended in literature akesson et al 2015 bohlke and denver 1995 katz et al 2009 koh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2003 michel 2004 solomon et al 2010 stanton et al 2007 as a simplification proxy that easily helps to interpret the variation of chemical components in a set of samples of a given hydrological system plummer et al 2006 bmm assume a binary mixture of young and old water in which fyoung is transported via piston flow the tracer concentration in each sample cs is given by 2 c s c young f young f old c old where cyoung and cold are the tracer concentrations in fyoung and fold respectively the use of sfm in groundwater dating is a more novel approach massoudieh et al 2014 mccallum et al 2017 visser et al 2013 this is an extension of the bmm that describe groundwater age distribution by a histogram of n bins with a uniform age distribution within each bin visser et al 2013 and contrary to lpm does not made any assumption about the groundwater flow dynamics then cs is the summation of the products of the fractions of groundwater sample in each bin fi and their mean tracer concentration ci 3 c s i 1 n f i c i with the aim of having a more detailed insight of the age distribution of the samples 3 bins were used in this study to fit the observed data tracer concentrations considering time lapses of 30 years the first and second bins have average ages of 15 0 30 and 45 30 60 years respectively the last one has an average age of 75 years between 60 and 90 years and it has a very low cfc 12 and 3h concentration similar to that of fold i e 3h and cfc free using solver add in in excel each bin fraction was calculated adopting as constrains the cfc 12 and 3h piston flow concentrations of the selected ranges of ages lumped parameters model have been used for many authors during the last three decades e g beyer et al 2016 suckow 2014 visser et al 2013 waugh et al 2003 they define the age distribution of groundwater in a sample at time t using a convolution integral that sum up all concentrations ci at each time t 4 c s t t c i t g t t e λ t t d t where g t t is the weight function that determine the importance of each age in the total groundwater age and e λ t t account for the decay of those radioactive tracers the main advantage of lpm is that they only require two of three parameters one of which is the mean residence time while the other define the weight function based on the characteristics of the study only the exponential piston model epm and the dispersion model dm have been considered the epm describes piston flow transport followed by exponential mixing which conceptually would occur in areas where there is no recharge nearby the sampled point thus the weight function is condition by the epm ratio which is the length of the area not receiving recharge by the area doing it cook and böhlke 2000 on the other hand the dm is based on the advection dispersion equation and can describe the age distribution for many aquifer configurations jurgens et al 2012 it uses de dispersion parameter dp which is the ratio of dispersion coefficient to the outlet position and the velocity detailed descriptions of all the lpm can be found in literature e g jurgens et al 2012 maloszewski and zuber 1982 suckow 2014 4 results and dating interpretation 4 1 groundwater chemistry the chemical composition of spring water samples is summarized in table 2 groundwater exhibits a wide range of mineralization from brackish waters to brines average ec values vary from 1 7 ms cm in b5 to 215 5 ms cm in h1 and the mean water temperature of springs are comprised between 15 9 c in b4 and 22 2 c in b3 table 2 in general terms the brine springs exhibit different grade of positive thermal anomaly up to 4 5 c in b3 respect to the mean air temperature of each study area 16 5 17 7 c fig 2 on the contrary the less mineralized outlets b4 b5 h3 t4 drain groundwater with temperature values close to the atmospheric values the measured flow rates present a wide range of values from less than 1 l s to nearly 100 l s table 2 j1 spring presents the greatest discharge variations as it indicates by the calculated coefficient of variability cv that is due to the existence of a well developed karst network that connects concentrated recharge areas to the spring gil márquez et al 2017a the most abundant ions in the analyzed water samples are cl and na with concentrations up to 191 g l and 115 g l respectively h1 table 2 aguileras spring h3 samples are the only ones with calcium sulfated hydrofacies although the greater concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 8 3 and 3 6 g l respectively are reached in lower anzur spring j1 overall groundwater mineralization increases toward lower positions in each study area as ec boxplot shows fig 2 except for don benito spring b3 which is located in a different flow line than the rest of the studied points in brujuelo area fig 1d gil márquez et al 2017b such a trend is basically due to the rising of solutes derived from the dissolution of halite na cl and to a lesser extent gypsum so4 2 ca2 contrary to cl so4 2 concentration do not keep growing towards the spring located at lower altitudes of each study area but it rather stabilizes around 6 g l when groundwater has ec values higher than 100 ms cm fig 2 hence although most of the springs drain na cl type water the proportion of cl respect to so4 2 also increases towards lower positions as the rcl so4 2 boxplot of fig 2 shows 4 2 groundwater dating tracers 4 2 1 tritium the 3h activity in the rain samples taken from september 2014 to june 2016 varies from 1 76 to 3 23 the estimated activities of 3h in the precipitation of the study areas from 2012 to 2017 range between 2 and 4 tu castaño and rodríguez arévalo 2019 based on estimation made from data retrieved from the gnip all spring samples contain 3h table 3 and their values range from 1 10 tu j1 to 3 06 b2 the variation of 3h concentrations found in a same spring is below 0 23 tu except for lower anzur spring j1 where 3h content varies between 1 10 and 2 59 tu table 3 most samples except b2 had 3h concentrations below the decay corrected input function which had little variations for the last 30 years fig 3 many samples present values comprised between 2 and 3 5 tu red lines in fig 3 which are similar to rain that recharged after 1980 and therefore they basically have a modern origin on the contrary h1 h2 t3 and two samples of j1 and b3 had 3h activities below 2 tu thus they must have a proportion of tritium free groundwater infiltrated before 1953 when the atmospheric 3h started to grow fig 3 lower anzur spring j1 case is quite particular as its water shows a great variability of 3h concentration table 3 fig 3 that reflects a more complex hydrogeological functioning in which the groundwater age distribution could vary notably depending on the flow conditions the system drained through lower anzur spring is markedly karstic gil márquez et al 2017c gil márquez et al 2019 and the outlet shows great hydrochemical and hydrodynamic variability table 3 during spring floods water cooling and mineralization decrease were observed as a consequence of the arrival of recently infiltrated water through karst swallow holes while depletion waters presented higher temperature and salinity rises of mineralization and water temperature frequently appear at the beginning of floods in j1 which is related to a piston flow effect gil márquez et al 2019 such term is used in karst hydrology to describe the drainage of groundwater previously stored in the system as a consequence of the pressure transfer provoked by recharge e g chiesi et al 2010 frank et al 2019 gunn 2004 hunkeler and mudry 2007 the study of the flow rate hydrochemical and isotopic variations in j1 spring during four years permitted to reach a good understanding of its functioning gil márquez et al 2019 the highest 3h value 2 59 tu table 3 was obtained during a chemical dilution dec 2016 understood as mineralization decreased which reflects the influence of recent recharge on the natural response of the spring on the other hand the lowest 3h concentrations coincided with a piston flow effect 1 95 tu and with the depletion of 2015 1 10 tu the value of 1 95 tu would have been provoked by the mobilization of deeper groundwater flows due to the recharge boost which suggests that groundwater coming from deeper regions would have less or no 3h and therefore they would be older the value of 1 1 tu would be related to the diminishing of recent recharge contribution the contribution of old groundwater must be high in such conditions since the 3h value of that sample was very low compared to precipitation concentration table 3 4 2 2 noble gases ne concentrations in all samples are lower than equilibrium values δne calculated for freshwater at recharge conditions see section 3 4 except for t4 and one sample of h3 table 3 that means that sampled waters are degassed between 16 and 66 δne nonetheless the degassing signatures were reproduced in the duplicate samples thus sampling from these springs is reliable and the loss of gas must have occurred before in order to calculate 3hetrit concentration 3h 3he ages and the proportion of 4he with a radiogenic origin 4herad it is necessary to assess the time when the degassing happened between recharge and sampling sültenfuss et al 2011 the effect of salinity over noble gas concentration is approximately of 0 42 for he and 0 48 for ne aeschbach hertig et al 1999 typical values of 4he and ne at several temperatures representing different recharge conditions are displayed in fig 4 only the samples with higher δne t4 and h3 are close to the equilibrium conditions with the atmosphere the rest of the samples which are degassed had lower ne values but greater 4he concentrations than the atmospheric equilibrium ne and he equilibrium values of the samples have been calculated according to their salinity following weiss equations 1971 the estimated equilibrium concentrations for saline samples of ne for b3 h2 and t3 are similar to those found in the samples although their measured he values are much higher fig 4 the latter also occurs in the rest of the brine samples and is due to 4herad production that leads to the accumulation of this isotope in groundwater since recharge waters reached the saturated zone sz the observed he and ne relationships in the samples could be caused via two different routes 1 blue arrows in fig 4 recharge water is in equilibrium with the atmosphere it enters the sz and gas exchanging with the atmosphere stops groundwater accumulates 4herad along its flowpath while ne concentration remains constant eventually at discharge points or close to them groundwater comes again into contact with the atmosphere and is re equilibrated depending on temperature pressure and salinity the presence of high salt concentration leads to the reduction of gas solubility which favors degassing 2 red arrows in fig 4 infiltrated water dissolves minerals throughout the unsaturated zone uz and reaches salinity values similar to those found in the spring samples thus before groundwater reaches the sz gas exchange is also possible which favors lower ne equilibrium concentrations once in the sz 4herad rises due to its underground production salt rock is absent at surface and it has not been found in any speleological survey performed within the csc aljama martínez 2017 calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 previous works carried out in the study areas andreo et al 2016 calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 carrasco 1986 gil márquez et al 2017b reveal that spring salinity is linked to the presence of halite at depth which is absent at the surface but has appeared in deep boreholes therefore the amount of nacl needed to explain the observed δne hardly could have been dissolved within the uz besides fuente camacho outlets samples h1 and h2 in los hoyos area are aligned around the degassing blue arrow in fig 4 that is more evident when looking at the position in the plot fig 4 of a h1 sample that was discarded due to extremely high degassing δne 96 such degassing pattern would indicate proportional loss of 4he and ne assuming the same starting concentrations sültenfuss et al 2011 for all these reasons assumption 1 is considered to be closer to reality consequently noble gases concentrations in table 3 were obtained from the values determined in the water samples and their δne assuming that degassing is proportional to the latter and it occurs at the outlet or nearby ne he and 3he 4he ratios have been evaluated fig 5 with a view of testing the different sources of he isotopes in the samples which allows a preliminary differentiation between young and old groundwater akesson et al 2015 mayer et al 2014 in samples with long residence time radiogenic he has been extensively accumulated and consequently their isotopic composition evolves from equilibrium values to 3he 4he ratios between 2 10 8 ballentine and burnard 2002 and 1 10 7 akesson et al 2015 when ne he approaches 0 he tends to the radioactive decay of 3h present in modern groundwater leads to a vertical shift of the samples in fig 5 from equilibrium values to higher 3he 4he ratios without significant changes in the ne he relation the mixing between 3hetrit and 3herad is detected in those samples that are deviated from the radiogenic he production line towards higher 3he 4he values even inappropriate degassing corrections do not affect the noble gas ratios and hence the decomposition of young and old waters in fig 5 only t4 is displayed close to atmospheric equilibrium conditions so it would be basically recently infiltrated groundwater h3 shows some tritiogenic production as well as a certain amount of radiogenic he the rest of the samples are scattered close to the radiogenic production lines and they have ne he values lower than 1 which shows large accumulation of herad and indicates long residence time within the media normally tritiogenic 3he is not found in samples with such low ne he and 3he 4he ratios as they are normally related to groundwater infiltrated previously to 1953 therefore they could not be dated by means of the 3h 3he method massmann et al 2008 mayer et al 2014 schlosser et al 1988 however the present case is rather particular since 3h has been detected in all the samples even those with high 4he concentration table 3 nevertheless dating this type of groundwater using the 3h 3he technique comes with some limitations mainly related to the choice of the regression line defining the radiogenic production of he that is a source of error for 3herad quantification and consequently for the determination of tritiogenic 3he this issue barely affects samples with high ne he values where the two drawn lines are close but it leads to an important bias towards lower ne he ratios like the ones observed in this cases fig 5 therefore it has come to the conclusion that this dating technique is not suitable for the kind of samples considered with high 4he concentration and unknown recharge conditions despite the above mentioned explanation 3h 3he ages of the samples were calculated table 3 for qualitative analysis the considered 3he 4he underground production ratio was 2 10 8 red line in fig 5 due to the fact that noble gases contents of the samples taken in brujuelo area b2 and b3 cannot be explained by higher values fig 5 the younger 3h 3he ages which correspond to t4 2 years and h3 15 21 years are more reliable as they have short radiogenic evolution low ne he and are not too affected by degassing δne 16 table 3 on the other hand the oldest samples t3 have 3h 3he ages up to 80 years such result is an artifice without an actual physical meaning since 3h releasing to the atmosphere started 61 years before the sample was taken and it is a result of the uncertainties previously discussed that make 3hetrit estimation and 3h 3he dating unreliable degassing high radiogenic he values in the samples and an unknown 3he 4he radiogenic production ratio in fig 3 3h 3he ages are represented against the 3h concentration of samples together with the input function in general most recently infiltrated samples h3 t3 b2 and b3 had 3h values in accordance with their ages while samples with 3h 3he infiltration dates older than 1980 j1 j2 h1 and h2 are clearly scattered below the input function which would indicate that their 3h concentration was diluted by tritium free groundwater old component or that the estimated 3hetrit is too large 4herad is present in most samples within a range of 8 0 10 6 ccstp kg in h3 to 1 1 10 3 cc stp kg in j3 most of the samples has considerably large 4he values 10 4 ccstp kg that are indication of a long water rock interaction and the subsequent radiogenic accumulation on the other hand in t4 the amount of 4herad is below the detection limit 10 6 ccstp kg since that sample does not present degassing δne 0 the absent of 4herad must be due to short residence time as the 3h 3he age pointed out in general terms higher 4herad concentrations are measured in springs placed at lower heights even considering the combined effect of salinity and temperature on the calculated concentrations of 4herad which assuming an error of 10 and 2 k in the infiltration conditions is less than 5 4 2 3 cfc 12 and sf6 all samples had cfc 12 with concentrations ranging from 0 1 pmol kg b3 to 1 3 pmol kg h3 which are comparable to atmospheric mixing ratios of 28 and 314 pptv respectively assuming the infiltration of freshwater sf6 values vary between 0 3 fmol kg b2 and 14 fmol kg j1 whose respective atmospheric concentrations are equal to 0 9 and 45 pptv the degassing correction performed is based on the δne values aeschbach hertig et al 1999 and it considerably modifies the original cfc 12 and sf6 contents fig 6 except for aguileras spring h3 that does not show significant degassing cfc 12 corrected concentrations rise to values between 0 2 and 1 6 pmol kg that are equivalent to atmospheric mixing ratios of 55 and 401 pptv table 3 corrected sf6 concentrations are comprised between 0 7 and 24 fmol kg equal to 2 4 and 79 pptv the effect of a change in the infiltration conditions of 2 k of temperature and 10 of salinity can substantially modify the calculated mixing ratio up to 20 table 3 assuming piston flow conditions infiltration dates of the original cfc 12 values vary from 1957 b3 to 1980 h4 dating values using δne corrections result in more modern ages fig 6 with recharge dates ranging from 1963 in b3 sample to 1986 in the sample taken in lower anzur spring j1 during the flood of april 2016 thus corrected cfc 12 ages range between 30 and 53 years table 3 sf6 dating only provides coherent recharge dates for b2 j1 and t3 springs as well as for h2 without degassing corrections fig 6 the rest of the samples had tracer concentrations much higher than the atmospheric input function infiltration dates obtained from sf6 values 1980 2000 are more modern than cfc 12 ones fig 6 dating derived from excess air corrected sf6 contents from δne provide even younger ages as young as 8 years table 3 despite the large variations of the calculated cfc 12 and sf6 mixing ratios due to the combine effect of the considered salinity and temperature the largest variations on the respective ages are of 4 years that is due to the steep rise of the atmospheric concentrations of cfc 12 from 1970 to 1990 and sf6 from 1980 to the present the divergence between both tracer ages could be due to mixing between several groundwater flow components of different residence time plummer et al 2006 to tracer degradation or retention within the media or to the existence of additional tracer sources apart from the atmosphere cook et al 2006 the excess of sf6 in several samples respect to the input function fig 6 suggests that the latter explanation is more likely local anthropogenic sources can modify the sf6 concentration in the nearby sectors although it is not frequent han et al 2006 particularly in cultivable lands such as the study areas previous works have revealed that some kind of rocks can produce sf6 and liberate it towards groundwater akesson et al 2015 deeds et al 2008 friedrich et al 2013 koh et al 2007 von rohden et al 2010 halite and dolomite are included among those rocks busenberg and plummer 2000 which are present in the studied formations bratton et al 2004 also found sf6 natural levels in saline groundwater therefore sf6 cannot be used for groundwater dating in this study cfc 12 ages are in most cases older than 3h 3he ones table 3 which can be attributable to a cfc concentration decrease in groundwater at least in the cases where 3h 3he dating was more reliable or to unknown processes in the degassing as cfc 12 concentration is not likely to be affected by sorption and is reduced by microbial degradation only in anoxic conditions cook and solomon 1997 the differences between both dating techniques results could be due to the mixing of diverse groundwater fractions with different ages it must be taken into account that halocarbons are only present in modern groundwater so the contribution of older cfc free water would reduce the tracer concentration at the sample the 3h analysis revealed that groundwater flows of different residence times converge at the outlets therefore cfc 12 dating results must be considered here in an illustrative way and the comparison among the cfc 12 ages of all the samples is only possible if the different mixing fractions young old are assumed to be equal in every case 4 3 mixing and distribution models in fig 7 degassing corrected cfc 12 vs 3h concentrations are presented both salt corrected i e expressed as concentration in freshwater in order to explain the concentrations found in the samples a combined input function of cfc 12 and 3h scaled to 2016 is shown which is equivalent to the temporal evolution of both tracers in unmixed young groundwater fyoung 100 all samples are below the 100 fyoung input function revealing that they also contain a certain amount of fold i e infiltrated before the 1940 s decade j3 b2 and h3 samples as well as j1 during discharge rise show a greater proportion of fyoung 65 while b3 h2 t3 and j1 in depletion conditions would have fold 40 table 4 thus j1 shows a reduction of its fyoung during depletion conditions in order to estimate the amount of fyoung and fold in each sample binary mixing lines were drawn from the origin representing fold to different points in the 100 fyoung function that are associated to specific recharge dates fig 7 as well as to distinct cfc 12 and 3h concentrations however the decay corrected concentration of 3h in precipitation and the atmospheric mixing ratio of cfc 12 show only slight variations since the middle of the 80 s and the early 90 s respectively thus the different fractions of water recharged after that period are hard to estimate using binary mixing models bmm based on 3h and cfc 12 therefore multiple mixing lines were possible when fyoung was recharged after 1985 nonetheless the explained analysis permits to quantify the percentage of both fractions in the bmms and to approximate apparent dates for the fyoung of each sample table 4 according to the bmm results table 4 the spring that drains a greater amount of tracer free groundwater is j1 in depletion conditions 65 of fold the outlets that have water with older fyoung are b3 1970 and t3 1972 the results of t3 b3 h2 and one j1 depletion samples are in the same order on the contrary most of the water 85 in the b2 sample is modern although its recharge date is one of the oldest 1976 similar results are found in j3 and h3 samples in general terms those springs located in the lowest positions of each study area drain greater fold and older fyoung table 4 excepting brujuelo area the latter would be related to the fact that don benito spring b3 is positioned in a different groundwater flowpath than the rest of the sampling points in the area gil márquez et al 2017b fig 1d the effect of salinity and temperature on the estimation of the cfc 12 mixing ratios is shown in fig 7 as error bars the higher the concentration of cfc 12 is the greater error exists however the larger cfc 12 concentrations are found in samples close to the input function on the one hand the error for those samples that plot within mixing lines before 1985 j3 and b2 does not affect the estimated age more than two years as the registered changes of cfc 12 and 3h concentrations in the atmosphere back in that time were significant on the other hand the error of the samples plotting over mixing lines from 1985 to the present j1 and h3 can nearly reach 30 years however as it was explained before the slight variations of the input functions in the last few decades give rise to a similar error in the possible mixing results thus the salinity effect would not change the conclusion obtained from the binary mixing model the groundwater age distribution of all the considered samples could be calculated by applying shape free models sfm table 4 fig 8 the distribution of ages varies notably depending on the case from those samples with a greater proportion of 15 year old groundwater h3 and j1 during flooding to those with a higher fraction of 75 year old groundwater t3 b3 h2 and j1 during depletion in j3 the three bins have similar values while b2 accumulates a high proportion of intermediate age water of 45 years fig 8 the mean ages obtained from the exponential mixing model epm and the dispersion model dm table 4 fig 8 range from 27 years j1 during flooding epm to 100 years j1 during depletion dpm meanwhile the amount of cfc 12 and 3h free groundwater 75 years which is equivalent to fold in the bm and to the oldest bin in the sfm vary from 0 j3 b2 and h3 to 30 44 j1 during depletion b3 h2 and t3 in general terms the dm and the epm mean ages calculated for each sample are similar within 1 9 years margin excepting in j1 during flooding as the older bin of the sfm contains tritium and cfc 12 free groundwater the mean age of the samples cannot be calculated besides mean age is not useful when interpreting mixed groundwater age data as it does not give any information about the groundwater age distribution by itself however the median of the groundwater age distribution hereby ga50 can be easily identified in that bin or age for lpms in which the cumulative fraction reaches or exceeds the 50 which permits to rapidly assess whether the sample is mainly formed by recent or older groundwater fig 8 table 4 ga50 range from 10 years j1 during flooding dm to 75 years or more i e tracer free water in b3 h2 t3 and j1 during depletion 3 bin sfm thus such parameter shows great differences in the groundwater age distribution of j1 depending on its hydrodynamic state indicating a complex hydrogeological functioning of the system that it drains the ga50 of the samples obtained from the sfm and the lpms differ because sfm discretized the groundwater age distribution while the lpms provide continuous functions nonetheless the samples with the higher and the smaller values of ga50 are the same regardless the model excepting j1 finally the percentage of the sample that is 3h and cfc 12 free 75 years vary between 0 and 70 normally the outlets located at higher positions in their respective study area present smaller ga50 and smaller fractions of groundwater older than 75 years suggesting that their drainage is less influenced by regional groundwater flows 5 discussion 5 1 joint interpretation of age tracers and water mineralization the comparison between 3h contents and ec values of spring water samples fig 9 a shows that in general terms the more mineralized the water of brine i e ec 40 ms cm springs is the lower 3h values it contains the inverse relation between ec and 3h is observed in every study area when analyzed individually as well as in the samples taken in anzur bajo j1 don benito b3 and cañaveralejo springs t3 with three or more determinations of 3h table 3 the negative ec 3h relationship suggests that the samples with greater salinity could have a larger contribution of tritium free groundwater flows infiltrated before 1953 such groundwater would have longer residence time within the media and therefore it would have dissolved higher amounts of solutes on the other hand the more recently infiltrated water with 3h would have less dissolved minerals the fact that the obtained correlation degrees are not too high fig 9a could be due to diverse factors the low number of observations the complexity of the 3h input function and its stabilization since the 1980 decade and the lithological and hydrogeological heterogeneity of the studied systems the 3he 4he ratios of the sample vary between 4 4 10 8 and 1 4 10 6 table 3 therefore the presence of 4he coming from the mantle is unlikely as such source could considerably rise the 3he 4he values up to 1 4 10 5 ozima and podosek 1983 and there is no volcanic activity or important outcrops of igneous rocks in the area solomon et al 1996 described high 4herad values in young groundwater of sedimentary aquifers made up of protoliths originated from the denudation of older formations although the geological setting could suit that description the age of the original formation is triassic much younger than the paleozoic rocks described by solomon et al 1996 consequently no significant 4he sources have been considered apart from atmospheric air excess and underground production the 3h activities of aguileras spring h3 are in agreement with the calculated 3h 3he age and the rain data fig 3 and the models results suggest that the degree of mixing with 3h free groundwater is low 0 35 compared to most of the samples table 4 besides the estimation of its 4herad concentration has fewer uncertainties as its water show little degassing table 3 based on all that h3 is the most appropriate spring for evaluating the 4herad production rate in the study areas assuming no mixing with 3h free groundwater it would be necessary an 4he accumulation rate of approximately 5 2 10 10 ccstp g year to reach the observed 4herad values found in h3 in a transit time similar to its 3h 3he age this value is comparable to others found in literature lehmann et al 2003 mahara et al 2009 schlosser et al 1989 solomon et al 1996 4he ages derived from the proposed accumulation rate are included in table 3 and vary from 1 year t4 to more than 4600 years t3 nonetheless such values must be considered carefully as the existence of an old groundwater component containing a large concentration of 4he in the mixing would introduce a considerable uncertainty to the calculated accumulation rate also the 4herad accumulation rates reported in literature vary two order of magnitude from 0 2 10 10 nml g year lehmann et al 2003 to 1 9 10 9 nml g year beyerle et al 1999 in any case if a similar accumulation rates are assumed in each study area the 4he ages of the springs located at lower altitudes would be older except for jarales area where lower anzur spring j1 samples had less 4herad than upper anzur spring j3 degassing corrected 4herad values and proposed 4he ages table 3 also present some relation with ec although it is positive contrary to that observed between 3h and ec fig 9 that suggests that the most mineralized waters would generally have greater 4herad concentrations than those with less solute content therefore groundwater salinity could be somehow related to their residence time within the media as the accumulation of the observed 4herad values requires long lasting water rock interaction iaea 2013 torgersen and clarke 1985 assuming this statement springs draining brine water could be the discharge points of regional groundwater flows nonetheless it must be pointed out that noble gas interpretation was accompanied by many uncertainties mainly due to degassing such physical process is favored by the drop of gas solubility in high salinity groundwater gerber et al 2017 particularly considering that samples were taken from springs once groundwater might has been already in contact with the atmosphere besides the convergence at the spring of a hierarchized groundwater flowpath system with different residence times makes it difficult to quantify the age of the older components of the mixing without the additional information of other long timescale tracers gardner et al 2015 in this study 4he cannot be considered as a quantitative tracer but rather it must be taken into account as a qualitative longtime scale indicator the use of a combination of short filter screen boreholes with different depth near the springs could help in future works to avoid degassing and to determine the groundwater age of different flow components the existence of groundwater flowpaths with different residence time in the media that converge at the springs would make the use of the mean ages in this study inappropriate as groundwater age indicator particularly having mixing fractions older than 75 years table 4 that cannot be properly dated with the used tracers gardner et al 2015 on the contrary the parameters extracted from the fsm and the lpms ga50 75 permit to evaluate whether the sample groundwater age distribution lends towards young or older fractions the positive correlation between ec and ga50 and 75 values table 5 fig 10 a b respectively also suggest that mineralization is related to groundwater residence time the degassing corrected concentration of cfc 12 decreases inversely to ec and more noticeable to ga50 and to the fraction of 75 year old groundwater fig 10c e table 5 thus samples with younger groundwater age distribution normally would have greater concentrations of cfc 12 and lower mineralization on the other hand the samples with greater contribution of older components b3 h2 t3 j1 in depletion would contain less cfc 12 as a consequence of its dilution by a larger fraction of tracer free groundwater which would be related to longer residence time and therefore to longer water rock interaction processes such prolonged interaction would explain the inverse relation between cfc 12 and ec due to greater solute transfer to old groundwater the solubility of gypsum is boosted by the addition of nacl due to the ionic force rising which modifies the equilibrium between the chemical phases of the aqueous solution zen 1965 however over 250 g of nacl l gypsum solubility significantly falls as shown in fig 2 cl concentration of samples constantly grow towards lower elevation while so4 2 contents stabilize between 5 and 6 g l except for h1 and h2 samples which contain lower amounts of so4 2 that is a consequence of its greater concentrations of cl as a result rcl so4 2 ingrowth is not constant nevertheless rcl so4 2 and ec has a great positive correlation r2 0 99 fig 10f for most samples before gypsum solubility descent h2 those samples with older groundwater age distribution i e greater ga50 and 75 years show higher rcl so4 2 fig 10g h as they have undergone longer lasting interaction with the media thus rcl so4 2 could be considered as an indicator of hydrogeochemical evolution for nacl contents below the solubility drop but also of residence time in general terms the explained relations do not work so well if the sample taken during spring flooding in j1 is considered fig 10 as the plots of groundwater age distribution show fig 8 a large fraction of this sample has a recent origin and it would be related to recently infiltrated water flowing through karst conduit on the contrary the older bin in the sfms of j1 which accounts for a higher percentage during depletion would be linked to dispersive groundwater flows the system drained through this outlet has a very complex hydrogeological functioning in which the contribution to the mixing of different groundwater flow components greatly varies partly due to the high development of the karst network gil márquez et al 2019 therefore in high water conditions when conduit flow accounts for much of the discharge rate in the spring the outlet is not comparable with the rest of the samples in which smaller flow rate variations were recorded table 2 5 2 integrating groundwater ages in the hydrogeological conceptual model the evaporite karst setting here studied csc is heterogeneous and complex and its hydrogeological functioning is conditioned by both characteristics however the joint interpretation of chemical information and environmental tracer data has highlighted some similarities between the different study areas in general terms the springs that drain the most mineralized water in each area are located at lower altitudes fig 2 likewise there is some correspondence between the groundwater age distribution of samples and their solute content and their rcl so4 2 fig 10 thus outlets located at a lower altitude normally drain higher proportion of fold table 4 meaning water recharged more than 70 years ago and also have older groundwater age distribution figs 8 and 11 besides some springs show a certain degree of positive temperature anomaly particularly in brujuelo and jarales areas fig 2 all that is in agreement with the hydrogeological conceptual model proposed by andreo et al 2016 hence outlets located in higher positions would be feed by surficial and short groundwater flowpaths on the other hand the springs found in the lowest areas present brine groundwater with low cfc 12 and 3h values as well as high 4he contents fig 11 such outlets are the consequence of the convergence of long groundwater flowpath of great residence time and others infiltrated more recently that is these spring waters are mixtures between groundwater with 3h and cfc 12 contents and groundwater that is free of those tracers but contain high 4he values fig 11 as a result samples collected in those springs have older groundwater age distributions with ga50 values above 50 years and more than 30 of old fractions table 4 fig 8 in an intermediate position springs drain groundwater with high mineralization although lower than those located at the lowest positions as they would receive fewer inflows of long groundwater flowpath of great residence time in the media high 4he and no cfc 12 or 3h therefore their groundwater age distribution is leaned towards younger dates with ga50 30 years and smaller or absent fold fractions table 4 fig 8 11 typically the contribution of older groundwater to this kind of discharge points increases as their geochemical evolution does which is reflected in the amount of 4he their mineralization ec and the rcl so4 2 figs 9 and 10 the conceptual model here discussed is also used by andreo et al 2016 to explain the hydrological functioning of wetlands and their hydrochemical and hydroperiod diversity as a results of their relation with groundwater similarly to other models found in literature euliss et al 2004 lissey 1971 winter 1999 no wetland samples have been analyzed in this work for dating purposes however recent groundwater dating research based in the 14c and 4he methods were performed in fuente de piedra wetland höbig et al 2016 montalván et al 2017 that is considered a discharge wetland kohfahl et al 2008 linares 1990 in the csc fig 1c according to the hydrogeological model explained by andreo et al 2016 results suggested that the oldest groundwater flows in fuente de piedra wetland basin unmixed with modern waters could be in the order of 105 year old the 4he values in the outlets considered in the present research suggest residence times one order of magnitude lower however it must be remembered that different groundwater flows converge in the springs and the 4he concentration is mainly provided by the oldest fractions of samples hence the amount of 4he in the samples is diluted by the modern components with practically no radiogenic 4he therefore the results obtained by höbig et al 2016 and montalván et al 2017 can be considered in agreement with this research and reinforce the idea of the contribution of old groundwater flow components towards discharge areas in the csc nevertheless this hydrogeological conceptual model is not completely replicable in every study area or spring due to the high heterogeneity of the csc unit which is enhanced by karstification in evaporite rocks such is the case of lower anzur spring j1 in that spring the age distribution and the environmental tracer concentration fig 8 and table 3 vary notably depending on the hydrodynamic state of the system that it drains besides the number of samples considered in this study is limited compared to the great extension of the csc so it would be necessary to confirm the drawn conclusions with further analysis in which specific measures must be taken to avoid degassing particularly sampling should be performed in short filter screen boreholes with different depth drilled near the outlets furthermore the determination of 85kr would permit to include more bins in the free shape model that could help to better define the groundwater age distribution of the samples while the use of 39ar would allow investigating a range of age 50 1000 years that the tracers used in this study do not consider 6 conclusions in this research a multi criteria approach coupling hydrochemical data and environmental dating tracers 3h 3he 4he cfc 12 sf6 is presented to investigate the hydrogeological functioning of complex evaporite karst systems in southern spain binary mixing models free shape models and lumped parameter models were created to define the age distribution of groundwater samples collected in springs which contained old and young fractions as proved by the coexistence of high concentrations of 4he together with the presence of cfc 12 and 3h the information extracted from those models combined with hydrogeochemical data has permitted to verify previous hypothesis about the hierarchization of groundwater flows in the considered aquitard formations in which groundwater mineralization rises toward lower altitudes where the groundwater age distribution indicate the drainage of older groundwater two parameters were proposed for describing the age distribution the median age ga50 and the fraction of groundwater free of tritium and cfc 70 particularly ga50 makes it possible to evaluate rapidly whether a sample is biased to younger or older ages and comparing different samples in that way ga50 is presented as an easy way of interpreting mixed groundwater age data the joint use of several groundwater dating tools has allowed to test the applicability of different techniques in unfavorable settings the high salinity of groundwater and the local development of karstification boosted the degassing of the spring water where flowpaths with groundwater of different age converge all that together results in many uncertainties however corrections in environmental tracers have been made according to the salinity and degassing of samples which has permitted to obtain representative information of the studied systems even so the 3h 3he was not valid in this context where the high 4he values impeded to correctly estimate the contribution of different 3he sources on the other hand sensitive analysis were made to test the effect of salinity and temperature variations on the dating results in future works sampling from short filtered boreholes it is highly advisable in order to avoid mixing and degassing particularly if brine groundwater or karst flow are involved but also to identify the different flows with variable groundwater age that mix in springs the inclusion of other environmental tracers such as 85kr and 39ar in the shape free models would also help to precise the groundwater age

5971,reactive mass transport is a common phenomenon associated with groundwater pollution in the field of groundwater hydrology for a reactive mass transport problem involving two different porosity regions in which the porosity of the fluid saturated porous medium has a constant distribution in the left region and an exponential distribution in the right region theoretical solutions for both dimensional and dimensionless acid concentrations have been derived mathematically in the left region by using the interface condition substitution strategy the fundamental idea behind this strategy is that the boundary condition at the entrance of the left region and the mathematical governing equation of the right region at the interface location between the left and right regions can be used to determine two independent constants involved in the theoretical solutions for the dimensional and dimensionless acid concentrations in the left region of the reactive mass transport system since both the acid concentration and its first derivative are known at the left boundary i e the interface location of the right region it is possible to derive analytical expressions for the numerical solution e g the finite element solution in the right region by using the point by point marching strategy the related theoretical results have demonstrated that the porosity distribution pattern in the right region of the system can have a significant influence on the dimensionless acid concentration distribution in the whole system so that it affects not only the chemical dissolution front instability but also the reactive mass transport process in an underground water system keywords theoretical solution numerical solution analytical expression reactive mass transport chemical dissolution front porous media 1 introduction reactive mass transport is a commonphenomenon associated with groundwater pollution in the field of groundwater hydrology imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 during the process of industrialization and modernization the living standard of mankind has been significantly improved as a result of the rapid growth of wealth however due to inappropriate and undue releases of industrial wastes a large amount of arable lands have been contaminated by the industrial wastes which are dissolved by rainfall water and transported into the lands by the seepage flow this can cause one kind of reactive mass transport phenomenon that is attributed to groundwater pollution processes since polluted groundwater can severely threaten human health it is necessary to remedy the contaminated lands by removing the residuals of industrial wastes such as non aqueous phase liquids and heavy metals from the porous medium that comprises the contaminated lands imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 towards this end acid and fresh water are injected into the contaminated lands to dissolve and wash away the residuals of industrial wastes in the contaminated lands this can cause another kind of reactive mass transport phenomenon that is attributed to contaminated lands remediation processes imhoff et al 1996 2003 seyedabbasi et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 in this particular case chemical dissolution fronts in the contaminated lands may become unstable in the process of remedying the contaminated lands so that the instability of chemical dissolution fronts in fluid saturated porous media has attracted much research attention in past years chadam et al 1986 1988 ortoleva et al 1987 sherwood 1987 hinch and bhatt 1990 ormond and ortoleva 2000 chen and liu 2002 2004 zhao et al 2008 2017 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2016 in terms of studying the instability of chemical dissolution fronts in fluid saturated porous media in a mathematical manner a theoretical problem in which the problem domain is treated as a full space when a geological timescale is considered chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 or a half space when an engineering timescale is considered zhao et al 2018 2019 is commonly employed to conduct theoretical analyses in this theoretical problem a planar dissolution front is propagating along its perpendicular direction in the full or half space depending on the considered timescale this planar dissolution front may lose its stability if the reactive mass transport system becomes supercritical chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 the core issue associated with dealing with this kind of instability is to establish a theoretical criterion which can be used to judge whether or not the planar dissolution front may become unstable in the process of remedying the contaminated lands to achieve this goal it is necessary to derive the base solutions of the theoretical problem when the considered reactive mass transport system is in a stable state for which the planar dissolution front maintains its planar shape during propagation so that the considered reactive mass transport problem can be mathematically treated as a one dimensional problem chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 this treatment enables the base solutions to be obtained when the porosity in the downstream region relative to the planar dissolution front is a constant chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 or close to a constant zhao et al 2018 2019 however when the porosity in the downstream region varies significantly no base solutions have been available for the reactive mass transport problem up to date this is the main reason why we attempt in this study to develop new strategies for deriving mixed solutions of mathematical and numerical methods for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media the outcome of this study can enable us to further investigate the chemical dissolution front instability phenomenon in a reactive mass transport system in which the porosity of the porous medium varies significantly in the downstream region of the system in recent years heat transfer and mass transport phenomena have also been considered in the problems involving nanofluids which comprise carrier fluids and nanoparticles of numerous metals and their oxides khan et al 2016 2017a b c saba et al 2018a b umavathi et al 2016 2017a b umavathi and sheremet 2017 the primary colloidal composition feature of nanofluids is that the nanoparticles should suspend in the carrier fluids in a stable and consistent manner due to the contribution of nanoparticles the physical property such as heat conductivity and density of the nanofluid may be significantly different from that of the carrier fluid ahmed et al 2017 2019a asadullah et al 2016 mohyud din et al 2017 this can cause a wide range of applications involving pharmaceutical heat exchanger fuel cells microelectronics domestic refrigerator and so forth ahmed et al 2019b in dealing with heat transfer and mass transport problems in cavities the flow of nanofluids was commonly described by navier stokes equations ahmed et al 2017 2019a b mohyud din et al 2017 however in dealing with heat transfer and mass transport problems in soils and rocks the flow of underground water was commonly described by darcy equations imhoff et al 1996 2003 seyedabbasi et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 in the former case it is possible to transform the partial differential equations of the problem into the ordinary differential ones by means of using the similarity transformations in mathematics so that the runge kutta scheme can be used to numerically solve the transformed ordinary differential equations of the problem ahmed et al 2017 2019a 2019b mohyud din et al 2017 however in the latter case it is usually impossible to transform the partial differential equations of the problem into the ordinary differential ones by means of using the similarity transformations in mathematics so that other numerical methods should be commonly used to numerically solve the partial differential equations of the problem chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 more importantly due to very small solubility of non aqueous phase liquids and heavy metals in the underground water the contribution of nanoparticles involved in these non aqueous phase liquids and heavy metals to the physical property of the underground water that is the carrier fluid in this situation can be safely neglected in this study according to above considerations we arrange the specific contents of the forthcoming sections in the paper as follows in section 2 the mathematical governing equations mges are briefly introduced for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media in section 3 an analytical expression has been derived for the mathematical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the left region where the porosity of the porous medium has a constant distribution of a reactive mass transport system by using the interface condition substitute strategy in section 4 an analytical expression has also obtained for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region where the porosity of the porous medium has an exponential distribution of the system by using the point by point marching strategy finally some conclusions are given in section 5 2 statement of the problem as shown in fig 1 the whole problem domain is occupied by two different porous media of remarkably different porosity distributions so that it can be divided into two different regions in the left region the porosity of the porous medium is constant while in the right region the porosity of the porous medium is assumed to have the following form of distribution 1 φ φ 0 φ f φ 0 e α x l 1 in the right region where φ is the porosity of the porous medium φ 0 is the initial porosity of the porous medium in the undissolved portion of the right region φ f is the porosity of the porous medium in the left region l 1 is the interface location between the left and right regions α is a constant to reflect the porosity distribution in the partially dissolved portion of dissolvable materials within the right region as mentioned in the introduction the theoretical problem under consideration can be mathematically treated as a one dimensional problem when the reactive mass transport system is in a stable state chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 2018 when the mineral dissolution ratio or acid dissolution capacity is small which can be justified for many chemical dissolutions taking place in real situations chadam et al 1986 1988 imhoff et al 1996 2003 zhao et al 2013 the reactive mass transport process involved in a reactive mass transport system is essentially independent of time so that the considered reactive mass transport system is in a steady state chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 2018 under these circumstances the corresponding mathematical governing equations mges of the problem are expressed as follows chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 2018 2 u c x φ f d 2 c x 2 in the left region 3 u c x φ d 2 c x 2 d φ x c x k s c in the right region where u is the darcy velocity in the horizontal direction c is the acid concentration with a unit of kmol m 3 d is the acid diffusion coefficient with a unit of m 2 s k is the chemical dissolution reaction rate with a unit of m s s is the reactive surface area per unit volume of the dissolvable materials with a unit of 1 m in the undissolved portion of the right region 4 s s 0 φ φ 0 φ f s 0 φ f ϕ f φ 0 e α x l 1 in the right region where s 0 is the initial value of s with a unit of 1 m by substituting eqs 1 and 4 into eq 3 we can obtain the following equation 5 u c x φ 0 φ f φ 0 e α x l 1 d 2 c x 2 α φ f φ 0 e α x l 1 d c x k s 0 φ f φ f φ 0 e α x l 1 c in the right region the boundary condition of the problem is as follows 6 c x c 0 at x 0 where c 0 is the acid concentration at the left boundary of the left region the interface continuity conditions of mass and mass flux can be expressed as 7 c x x l 1 c x x l 1 at x l 1 8 φ d c x x x l 1 φ d c x x x l 1 at x l 1 with the consideration of eq 1 eq 8 can be rewritten as 9 c x x x l 1 c x x x l 1 2 c x x 2 x l 1 2 c x x 2 x l 1 at x l 1 3 deriving theoretical solutions for the acid concentration in the left region since the porosity of the porous medium in the left region of the considered problem is constant it is possible to derive theoretical solutions for the acid concentration in this left region by using the interface condition substitution strategy the fundamental idea behind the strategy is that since eq 2 is a second order partial differential equation we need two boundary conditions to get the theoretical solution of this equation completely determined although equation 3 is impossible to be solved in a purely mathematical manner its theoretical solution at the interface location i e x l 1 should satisfy eq 3 itself fortunately we can express the theoretical solution of eq 3 at the interface location i e x l 1 by simply using the theoretical solution of eq 2 at this interface location just as demonstrated by eqs 7 and 9 in the following we will illustrate how the proposed strategy works the theoretical solution of eq 2 can be mathematically expressed as 10 c x a e β x b in the left region where a and b are two constants to be determined β is the following parameter 11 β u φ f d the use of the boundary condition expressed in eq 6 yields the following equation 12 a c 0 b consequently eq 10 can be further expressed as 13 c x c 0 e β x 1 e β x b in the left region according to the proposed interface condition substitution strategy we can substitute eq 13 into eq 5 at the interface location i e x l 1 to get constant b determined this treatment leads to the following equation 14 φ f φ 0 d α β c 0 e β l 1 b e β l 1 k s 0 φ f φ 0 φ f c 0 e β l 1 b 1 e β l 1 0 obviously constant b can be determined from eq 14 as 15 b u α k s 0 e β l 1 e β l 1 u α k s 0 e β l 1 e β l 1 1 c 0 substituting eq 15 into eq 12 yields the following expression 16 a c 0 u α k s 0 e β l 1 e β l 1 1 finally the theoretical solution of eq 2 can be mathematically derived as 17 c x c 0 e β x 1 u α k s 0 1 e β l 1 1 u α k s 0 1 e β l 1 u α k s 0 1 e β l 1 1 c 0 in the left region it is interesting to turn eq 17 into a dimensionless form for this purpose we need to define both the peclet number which is used to represent the dynamic characteristic of the left region and the damkohler number steefel and lasaga 1994 ormond and ortoleva 2000 which is used to represent the dynamic characteristic of the right region 18 pe u l 1 φ f d 19 da k s 0 u α where pe is the peclet number da is the damkohler number we also need to define the following two dimensionless quantities 20 c x c x c 0 x x l 1 by using these dimensionless numbers and quantities eq 17 can be turned into the following dimensionless form 21 c x e p e x 1 1 da e pe 1 1 1 da e pe 1 1 da e pe 1 in the left region it is noted that at the interface location i e x 1 between the left and right regions we have the following theoretical solutions 22 c x x 1 1 da e pe 1 1 da e pe 1 at the interface 23 c x x x 1 p e e pe 1 1 da e pe 1 at the interface eqs 22 and 23 indicate that if pe 1 then c x x 1 1 1 d a and c x x x 1 d a p e 1 d a this implies that in the case of pe 1 and a given value of da the dimensionless acid concentration can approach a constant which is dependent on the key parameters of the reactive mass transport system similarly if da 1 then c x x 1 1 and c x x x 1 0 this implies that in the case of da 1 both the dimensionless acid concentration and its first derivative can also approach two different constants which are independent of the key parameters in the reactive mass transport system this recognition is important for us to further investigate the chemical dissolution front instability phenomenon in a reactive mass transport system in which the porosity of the porous medium is not a constant in the right region of the system since da is inversely proportional to parameter α the value of parameter α which is used to reflect the porosity distribution pattern in the right region of a reactive mass transport system can have significant influence on the values of both c x x 1 and c x x x 1 at the interface location between the left and right regions of the reactive mass transport system in terms of investigating chemical dissolution front instability such an interface may be used as a planar reference front in the theoretical analyses zhao et al 2018 2019 the theoretical results shown in figs 2 and 3 further confirm the above mentioned recognition for example for a given value of pe c x x 1 and c x x x 1 can approach constants not only when da approaches zero but also when da approaches a very larger number see fig 2 however for a given value of da only c x x 1 can approach a constant when pe approaches a very larger number see fig 3 4 deriving analytical expressions for numerical solutions of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region by making use of the above defined dimensionless numbers and quantities eq 5 can be turned into the following dimensionless form 24 φ 0 φ f φ 0 e α l 1 x 1 α l 1 φ f 2 c x 2 pe φ f φ 0 φ f e α l 1 x 1 c x peda φ f φ f φ 0 e α l 1 x 1 c 0 in the right region to facilitate the forthcoming mathematical deduction we can rewrite eq 24 in the following form 25 f 1 x 2 c x 2 f 2 x c x f 3 x c 0 in the right region where f 1 x f 2 x and f 3 x are three independent functions of dimensionless spatial variable x and can be expressed as follows 26 f 1 x φ 0 φ f φ 0 e α l 1 x 1 α l 1 φ f 27 f 2 x p e φ f φ 0 φ f e α l 1 x 1 28 f 3 x peda φ f φ f φ 0 e α l 1 x 1 since eq 25 is a second order partial differential equation its theoretical solution if it would be derivable mathematically should involve two independent constants which need to be determined by using the corresponding two boundary conditions as demonstrated previously because both the dimensionless acid concentration and its first derivative i e c x x 1 and c x x x 1 are already known at the left boundary of the right region in the reactive mass transport system eqs 22 and 23 can be also used as the needed two boundary conditions to determine the two independent constants in the process of deriving the theoretical solution within the right region of the problem this means that from the numerical solution point of view it is possible to solve eq 25 from the left boundary of the right region as a starting point in a recurrence manner we can call such a strategy the point by point marching strategy the use of which will be implemented in the finite element method below as shown in fig 4 we can divide the right region of the problem domain into n two node finite elements with n 1 nodal points in total note that in the case of n the entire right region of the problem domain can be geometrically simulated by these two node finite elements if the length of every two node finite element is δ x then we have the following mathematical expressions 29 x n 1 n 1 δ x n 1 2 3 n 30 x nmiddle 1 2 n 1 1 2 δ x n 1 2 3 n where x n is the dimensionless horizontal coordinate of node n x nmiddle is the dimensionless horizontal coordinate at the middle point of element n for a typical two node finite element which is labeled as element n it has two nodal points namely node n and node n 1 the shape functions of this element can be defined as 31 n n x x n 1 x x n 1 x n n 1 2 3 n 32 n n 1 x x n x x n x n 1 n 1 2 3 n where n n x is the shape function of node n in element n n n 1 x is the shape function of node n 1 in element n consequently the shape function matrix of this element can be expressed as follows 33 n n x n n x n n 1 x n 1 2 3 n where n n x is the shape function matrix of element n this enables us to write the dimensionless acid concentration within element n in the following manner 34 c n x n n x n n 1 x c n x c n 1 x n 1 2 3 n where c n x is the dimensionless acid concentration of node n in element n c n 1 x is the dimensionless acid concentration of node n 1 in element n c n x is the dimensionless acid concentration distribution within element n note that from eqs 31 and 32 we are also able to obtain the following mathematical expressions 35 n n x x 1 x n 1 x n 1 δ x n 1 2 3 n 36 n n 1 x x 1 x n x n 1 1 δ x n 1 2 3 n by making use of the galerkin weighted residual method zienkiewicz 1977 lewis and schrefler 1998 zhao et al 2009 it is straightforward to change eq 25 into the following form 37 x n x n 1 n n x t f 1 x 2 c n x x 2 f 2 x c n x x f 3 x c n x d x 0 n 1 2 3 n if we substitute eq 34 into eq 37 then we are able to obtain the following matrix

numerical solutions of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region of the reactive mass transport problem we need to classify finite element nodes into two categories one category is the end node such as node 1 in the finite element mesh while another category is interior nodes in the finite element mesh the primary characteristic of this classification is that an end node involves only one finite element while an interior node involves two finite elements in the finite element mesh according to this characteristic we can express the finite element equation at the end node i e node 1 in this study as 54 k nn j nn g nn c n x k nn 1 j nn 1 g nn 1 c n 1 x p n n 1 obviously this equation can lead to the following analytical expression for the numerical solution of the

proposed point by point marching strategy is that starting from the end node at which both the dimensionless acid concentration and its first derivative are known we are able to derive in a recurrence manner the analytical expressions such as those expressed by eqs 55 and 57 for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration at any interior node in the right region of the reactive mass transport problem fig 5 shows the effect of the damkohler and peclet numbers on the dimensionless acid concentration distribution in both the left and right regions in this figure the dimensionless acid concentration in the left region is calculated by using the mathematical solution expressed in eq 21 while the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region is calculated by using the analytical expression of the finite element solution expressed in eqs 55 and 57 to produce these solutions the following parameters were used in the corresponding calculation φ 0 0 1 φ f 0 3 δ x 0 001 n 4000 l 1 1 0 m and α 0 04 m 1 since both c x x 1 and c x x x 1 are considered to be continuous at the interface between the left and right regions the distribution of the dimensionless acid concentration is continuous and smooth as clearly shown at x 1 in fig 5 it can be observed that both the damkohler and peclet numbers can have significant influences on the dimensionless acid concentration distribution in both the left and right regions for a given value of the peclet number the dimensionless acid concentration decreases remarkably with an increase in the value of the damkohler number similarly for a given value of the damkohler number the dimensionless acid concentration also decreases considerably with an increase in the value of the peclet number since the damkohler number can reflect the comprehensive characteristic of the right region including the porosity distribution characteristic of the right region it implies that the porosity distribution characteristic of the right region can also have a significant effect on the dimensionless acid concentration distribution in both the left and right regions it should be pointed out that the main purpose of this study is first to present both the interface condition substitution strategy and the point by point marching strategy and then to demonstrate how they can be employed to derive the mixed analytical solutions of mathematical and numerical methods for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media since these mixed analytical solutions are obtained in a rigorously mathematical manner they can be used as benchmark solutions to either verify any numerical solutions or predict acid concentration distributions in a porous medium if the physical property of the porous medium is known on the other hand if the acid concentration distribution in a porous medium is measured then we can use these mixed analytical solutions to determine the physical property of the porous medium since analytical solutions of a problem can be served as benchmark solutions of the problem great efforts have been made even though very difficult to derive analytical solutions for scientific and engineering problems in the past many years 5 conclusions mixed analytical solutions of mathematical and numerical methods have been derived for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media the derived mixed analytical solutions comprise the following two parts one is the analytical expression for the mathematical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the left region where the porosity of the porous medium has a constant distribution of the reactive mass transport system while another is the analytical expression for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region where the porosity of the porous medium has an exponential distribution of the system the interface condition substitution strategy has been proposed and used to derive the mathematical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the left region of the reactive mass transport system the fundamental idea behind this strategy is that the boundary condition at the entrance of the left region and the mathematical governing equation of the right region at the interface location between the left and right regions can be used to determine two independent constants involved in the mathematical solutions for both dimensional and dimensionless acid concentrations in the left region of the reactive mass transport system on the other hand the point by point marching strategy has been proposed and used to derive the analytical expression for the numerical solution i e the finite element solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region of the reactive mass transport system the basic idea behind this strategy is that starting from the end node located at the left boundary of the right region at which both the dimensionless acid concentration and its first derivative are known we are able to derive in a recurrence manner the analytical expression for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration at any interior node in the right region of the reactive mass transport system it should be pointed out that the main academic contribution of this study is first to present both the interface condition substitution strategy and the point by point marching strategy and then to demonstrate how they can be employed to derive the mixed analytical solutions of mathematical and numerical methods for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media in

5971,reactive mass transport is a common phenomenon associated with groundwater pollution in the field of groundwater hydrology for a reactive mass transport problem involving two different porosity regions in which the porosity of the fluid saturated porous medium has a constant distribution in the left region and an exponential distribution in the right region theoretical solutions for both dimensional and dimensionless acid concentrations have been derived mathematically in the left region by using the interface condition substitution strategy the fundamental idea behind this strategy is that the boundary condition at the entrance of the left region and the mathematical governing equation of the right region at the interface location between the left and right regions can be used to determine two independent constants involved in the theoretical solutions for the dimensional and dimensionless acid concentrations in the left region of the reactive mass transport system since both the acid concentration and its first derivative are known at the left boundary i e the interface location of the right region it is possible to derive analytical expressions for the numerical solution e g the finite element solution in the right region by using the point by point marching strategy the related theoretical results have demonstrated that the porosity distribution pattern in the right region of the system can have a significant influence on the dimensionless acid concentration distribution in the whole system so that it affects not only the chemical dissolution front instability but also the reactive mass transport process in an underground water system keywords theoretical solution numerical solution analytical expression reactive mass transport chemical dissolution front porous media 1 introduction reactive mass transport is a commonphenomenon associated with groundwater pollution in the field of groundwater hydrology imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 during the process of industrialization and modernization the living standard of mankind has been significantly improved as a result of the rapid growth of wealth however due to inappropriate and undue releases of industrial wastes a large amount of arable lands have been contaminated by the industrial wastes which are dissolved by rainfall water and transported into the lands by the seepage flow this can cause one kind of reactive mass transport phenomenon that is attributed to groundwater pollution processes since polluted groundwater can severely threaten human health it is necessary to remedy the contaminated lands by removing the residuals of industrial wastes such as non aqueous phase liquids and heavy metals from the porous medium that comprises the contaminated lands imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 towards this end acid and fresh water are injected into the contaminated lands to dissolve and wash away the residuals of industrial wastes in the contaminated lands this can cause another kind of reactive mass transport phenomenon that is attributed to contaminated lands remediation processes imhoff et al 1996 2003 seyedabbasi et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 in this particular case chemical dissolution fronts in the contaminated lands may become unstable in the process of remedying the contaminated lands so that the instability of chemical dissolution fronts in fluid saturated porous media has attracted much research attention in past years chadam et al 1986 1988 ortoleva et al 1987 sherwood 1987 hinch and bhatt 1990 ormond and ortoleva 2000 chen and liu 2002 2004 zhao et al 2008 2017 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2016 in terms of studying the instability of chemical dissolution fronts in fluid saturated porous media in a mathematical manner a theoretical problem in which the problem domain is treated as a full space when a geological timescale is considered chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 or a half space when an engineering timescale is considered zhao et al 2018 2019 is commonly employed to conduct theoretical analyses in this theoretical problem a planar dissolution front is propagating along its perpendicular direction in the full or half space depending on the considered timescale this planar dissolution front may lose its stability if the reactive mass transport system becomes supercritical chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 the core issue associated with dealing with this kind of instability is to establish a theoretical criterion which can be used to judge whether or not the planar dissolution front may become unstable in the process of remedying the contaminated lands to achieve this goal it is necessary to derive the base solutions of the theoretical problem when the considered reactive mass transport system is in a stable state for which the planar dissolution front maintains its planar shape during propagation so that the considered reactive mass transport problem can be mathematically treated as a one dimensional problem chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 this treatment enables the base solutions to be obtained when the porosity in the downstream region relative to the planar dissolution front is a constant chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 or close to a constant zhao et al 2018 2019 however when the porosity in the downstream region varies significantly no base solutions have been available for the reactive mass transport problem up to date this is the main reason why we attempt in this study to develop new strategies for deriving mixed solutions of mathematical and numerical methods for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media the outcome of this study can enable us to further investigate the chemical dissolution front instability phenomenon in a reactive mass transport system in which the porosity of the porous medium varies significantly in the downstream region of the system in recent years heat transfer and mass transport phenomena have also been considered in the problems involving nanofluids which comprise carrier fluids and nanoparticles of numerous metals and their oxides khan et al 2016 2017a b c saba et al 2018a b umavathi et al 2016 2017a b umavathi and sheremet 2017 the primary colloidal composition feature of nanofluids is that the nanoparticles should suspend in the carrier fluids in a stable and consistent manner due to the contribution of nanoparticles the physical property such as heat conductivity and density of the nanofluid may be significantly different from that of the carrier fluid ahmed et al 2017 2019a asadullah et al 2016 mohyud din et al 2017 this can cause a wide range of applications involving pharmaceutical heat exchanger fuel cells microelectronics domestic refrigerator and so forth ahmed et al 2019b in dealing with heat transfer and mass transport problems in cavities the flow of nanofluids was commonly described by navier stokes equations ahmed et al 2017 2019a b mohyud din et al 2017 however in dealing with heat transfer and mass transport problems in soils and rocks the flow of underground water was commonly described by darcy equations imhoff et al 1996 2003 seyedabbasi et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 in the former case it is possible to transform the partial differential equations of the problem into the ordinary differential ones by means of using the similarity transformations in mathematics so that the runge kutta scheme can be used to numerically solve the transformed ordinary differential equations of the problem ahmed et al 2017 2019a 2019b mohyud din et al 2017 however in the latter case it is usually impossible to transform the partial differential equations of the problem into the ordinary differential ones by means of using the similarity transformations in mathematics so that other numerical methods should be commonly used to numerically solve the partial differential equations of the problem chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 more importantly due to very small solubility of non aqueous phase liquids and heavy metals in the underground water the contribution of nanoparticles involved in these non aqueous phase liquids and heavy metals to the physical property of the underground water that is the carrier fluid in this situation can be safely neglected in this study according to above considerations we arrange the specific contents of the forthcoming sections in the paper as follows in section 2 the mathematical governing equations mges are briefly introduced for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media in section 3 an analytical expression has been derived for the mathematical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the left region where the porosity of the porous medium has a constant distribution of a reactive mass transport system by using the interface condition substitute strategy in section 4 an analytical expression has also obtained for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region where the porosity of the porous medium has an exponential distribution of the system by using the point by point marching strategy finally some conclusions are given in section 5 2 statement of the problem as shown in fig 1 the whole problem domain is occupied by two different porous media of remarkably different porosity distributions so that it can be divided into two different regions in the left region the porosity of the porous medium is constant while in the right region the porosity of the porous medium is assumed to have the following form of distribution 1 φ φ 0 φ f φ 0 e α x l 1 in the right region where φ is the porosity of the porous medium φ 0 is the initial porosity of the porous medium in the undissolved portion of the right region φ f is the porosity of the porous medium in the left region l 1 is the interface location between the left and right regions α is a constant to reflect the porosity distribution in the partially dissolved portion of dissolvable materials within the right region as mentioned in the introduction the theoretical problem under consideration can be mathematically treated as a one dimensional problem when the reactive mass transport system is in a stable state chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 2018 when the mineral dissolution ratio or acid dissolution capacity is small which can be justified for many chemical dissolutions taking place in real situations chadam et al 1986 1988 imhoff et al 1996 2003 zhao et al 2013 the reactive mass transport process involved in a reactive mass transport system is essentially independent of time so that the considered reactive mass transport system is in a steady state chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 2018 under these circumstances the corresponding mathematical governing equations mges of the problem are expressed as follows chadam et al 1986 1988 zhao et al 2008 2017 2018 2 u c x φ f d 2 c x 2 in the left region 3 u c x φ d 2 c x 2 d φ x c x k s c in the right region where u is the darcy velocity in the horizontal direction c is the acid concentration with a unit of kmol m 3 d is the acid diffusion coefficient with a unit of m 2 s k is the chemical dissolution reaction rate with a unit of m s s is the reactive surface area per unit volume of the dissolvable materials with a unit of 1 m in the undissolved portion of the right region 4 s s 0 φ φ 0 φ f s 0 φ f ϕ f φ 0 e α x l 1 in the right region where s 0 is the initial value of s with a unit of 1 m by substituting eqs 1 and 4 into eq 3 we can obtain the following equation 5 u c x φ 0 φ f φ 0 e α x l 1 d 2 c x 2 α φ f φ 0 e α x l 1 d c x k s 0 φ f φ f φ 0 e α x l 1 c in the right region the boundary condition of the problem is as follows 6 c x c 0 at x 0 where c 0 is the acid concentration at the left boundary of the left region the interface continuity conditions of mass and mass flux can be expressed as 7 c x x l 1 c x x l 1 at x l 1 8 φ d c x x x l 1 φ d c x x x l 1 at x l 1 with the consideration of eq 1 eq 8 can be rewritten as 9 c x x x l 1 c x x x l 1 2 c x x 2 x l 1 2 c x x 2 x l 1 at x l 1 3 deriving theoretical solutions for the acid concentration in the left region since the porosity of the porous medium in the left region of the considered problem is constant it is possible to derive theoretical solutions for the acid concentration in this left region by using the interface condition substitution strategy the fundamental idea behind the strategy is that since eq 2 is a second order partial differential equation we need two boundary conditions to get the theoretical solution of this equation completely determined although equation 3 is impossible to be solved in a purely mathematical manner its theoretical solution at the interface location i e x l 1 should satisfy eq 3 itself fortunately we can express the theoretical solution of eq 3 at the interface location i e x l 1 by simply using the theoretical solution of eq 2 at this interface location just as demonstrated by eqs 7 and 9 in the following we will illustrate how the proposed strategy works the theoretical solution of eq 2 can be mathematically expressed as 10 c x a e β x b in the left region where a and b are two constants to be determined β is the following parameter 11 β u φ f d the use of the boundary condition expressed in eq 6 yields the following equation 12 a c 0 b consequently eq 10 can be further expressed as 13 c x c 0 e β x 1 e β x b in the left region according to the proposed interface condition substitution strategy we can substitute eq 13 into eq 5 at the interface location i e x l 1 to get constant b determined this treatment leads to the following equation 14 φ f φ 0 d α β c 0 e β l 1 b e β l 1 k s 0 φ f φ 0 φ f c 0 e β l 1 b 1 e β l 1 0 obviously constant b can be determined from eq 14 as 15 b u α k s 0 e β l 1 e β l 1 u α k s 0 e β l 1 e β l 1 1 c 0 substituting eq 15 into eq 12 yields the following expression 16 a c 0 u α k s 0 e β l 1 e β l 1 1 finally the theoretical solution of eq 2 can be mathematically derived as 17 c x c 0 e β x 1 u α k s 0 1 e β l 1 1 u α k s 0 1 e β l 1 u α k s 0 1 e β l 1 1 c 0 in the left region it is interesting to turn eq 17 into a dimensionless form for this purpose we need to define both the peclet number which is used to represent the dynamic characteristic of the left region and the damkohler number steefel and lasaga 1994 ormond and ortoleva 2000 which is used to represent the dynamic characteristic of the right region 18 pe u l 1 φ f d 19 da k s 0 u α where pe is the peclet number da is the damkohler number we also need to define the following two dimensionless quantities 20 c x c x c 0 x x l 1 by using these dimensionless numbers and quantities eq 17 can be turned into the following dimensionless form 21 c x e p e x 1 1 da e pe 1 1 1 da e pe 1 1 da e pe 1 in the left region it is noted that at the interface location i e x 1 between the left and right regions we have the following theoretical solutions 22 c x x 1 1 da e pe 1 1 da e pe 1 at the interface 23 c x x x 1 p e e pe 1 1 da e pe 1 at the interface eqs 22 and 23 indicate that if pe 1 then c x x 1 1 1 d a and c x x x 1 d a p e 1 d a this implies that in the case of pe 1 and a given value of da the dimensionless acid concentration can approach a constant which is dependent on the key parameters of the reactive mass transport system similarly if da 1 then c x x 1 1 and c x x x 1 0 this implies that in the case of da 1 both the dimensionless acid concentration and its first derivative can also approach two different constants which are independent of the key parameters in the reactive mass transport system this recognition is important for us to further investigate the chemical dissolution front instability phenomenon in a reactive mass transport system in which the porosity of the porous medium is not a constant in the right region of the system since da is inversely proportional to parameter α the value of parameter α which is used to reflect the porosity distribution pattern in the right region of a reactive mass transport system can have significant influence on the values of both c x x 1 and c x x x 1 at the interface location between the left and right regions of the reactive mass transport system in terms of investigating chemical dissolution front instability such an interface may be used as a planar reference front in the theoretical analyses zhao et al 2018 2019 the theoretical results shown in figs 2 and 3 further confirm the above mentioned recognition for example for a given value of pe c x x 1 and c x x x 1 can approach constants not only when da approaches zero but also when da approaches a very larger number see fig 2 however for a given value of da only c x x 1 can approach a constant when pe approaches a very larger number see fig 3 4 deriving analytical expressions for numerical solutions of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region by making use of the above defined dimensionless numbers and quantities eq 5 can be turned into the following dimensionless form 24 φ 0 φ f φ 0 e α l 1 x 1 α l 1 φ f 2 c x 2 pe φ f φ 0 φ f e α l 1 x 1 c x peda φ f φ f φ 0 e α l 1 x 1 c 0 in the right region to facilitate the forthcoming mathematical deduction we can rewrite eq 24 in the following form 25 f 1 x 2 c x 2 f 2 x c x f 3 x c 0 in the right region where f 1 x f 2 x and f 3 x are three independent functions of dimensionless spatial variable x and can be expressed as follows 26 f 1 x φ 0 φ f φ 0 e α l 1 x 1 α l 1 φ f 27 f 2 x p e φ f φ 0 φ f e α l 1 x 1 28 f 3 x peda φ f φ f φ 0 e α l 1 x 1 since eq 25 is a second order partial differential equation its theoretical solution if it would be derivable mathematically should involve two independent constants which need to be determined by using the corresponding two boundary conditions as demonstrated previously because both the dimensionless acid concentration and its first derivative i e c x x 1 and c x x x 1 are already known at the left boundary of the right region in the reactive mass transport system eqs 22 and 23 can be also used as the needed two boundary conditions to determine the two independent constants in the process of deriving the theoretical solution within the right region of the problem this means that from the numerical solution point of view it is possible to solve eq 25 from the left boundary of the right region as a starting point in a recurrence manner we can call such a strategy the point by point marching strategy the use of which will be implemented in the finite element method below as shown in fig 4 we can divide the right region of the problem domain into n two node finite elements with n 1 nodal points in total note that in the case of n the entire right region of the problem domain can be geometrically simulated by these two node finite elements if the length of every two node finite element is δ x then we have the following mathematical expressions 29 x n 1 n 1 δ x n 1 2 3 n 30 x nmiddle 1 2 n 1 1 2 δ x n 1 2 3 n where x n is the dimensionless horizontal coordinate of node n x nmiddle is the dimensionless horizontal coordinate at the middle point of element n for a typical two node finite element which is labeled as element n it has two nodal points namely node n and node n 1 the shape functions of this element can be defined as 31 n n x x n 1 x x n 1 x n n 1 2 3 n 32 n n 1 x x n x x n x n 1 n 1 2 3 n where n n x is the shape function of node n in element n n n 1 x is the shape function of node n 1 in element n consequently the shape function matrix of this element can be expressed as follows 33 n n x n n x n n 1 x n 1 2 3 n where n n x is the shape function matrix of element n this enables us to write the dimensionless acid concentration within element n in the following manner 34 c n x n n x n n 1 x c n x c n 1 x n 1 2 3 n where c n x is the dimensionless acid concentration of node n in element n c n 1 x is the dimensionless acid concentration of node n 1 in element n c n x is the dimensionless acid concentration distribution within element n note that from eqs 31 and 32 we are also able to obtain the following mathematical expressions 35 n n x x 1 x n 1 x n 1 δ x n 1 2 3 n 36 n n 1 x x 1 x n x n 1 1 δ x n 1 2 3 n by making use of the galerkin weighted residual method zienkiewicz 1977 lewis and schrefler 1998 zhao et al 2009 it is straightforward to change eq 25 into the following form 37 x n x n 1 n n x t f 1 x 2 c n x x 2 f 2 x c n x x f 3 x c n x d x 0 n 1 2 3 n if we substitute eq 34 into eq 37 then we are able to obtain the following matrix

numerical solutions of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region of the reactive mass transport problem we need to classify finite element nodes into two categories one category is the end node such as node 1 in the finite element mesh while another category is interior nodes in the finite element mesh the primary characteristic of this classification is that an end node involves only one finite element while an interior node involves two finite elements in the finite element mesh according to this characteristic we can express the finite element equation at the end node i e node 1 in this study as 54 k nn j nn g nn c n x k nn 1 j nn 1 g nn 1 c n 1 x p n n 1 obviously this equation can lead to the following analytical expression for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration at node 2 in the finite element mesh 55 c n 1 x p n k nn j nn g nn c n x k nn 1 j nn 1 g nn 1 n 1 note that p 1 and c 1 x can be calculated by using eqs 22 23 and 49 similarly we are able to express the finite element equation at the rest of interior nodes as 56 k nn 1 j nn 1 g nn 1 c n 1 x k n 1 n 1 j n 1 n 1 g n 1 n 1 k nn j nn g nn c n x k nn 1 j nn 1 g nn 1 c n 1 x p n 1 p n n 2 3 n 1 consequently eq 56 can result in the following analytical expression for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration at any interior node in the finite element mesh 57 c n 1 x k nn 1 j nn 1 g nn 1 c n 1 x k nn 1 j nn 1 g nn 1 k n 1 n 1 j n 1 n 1 g n 1 n 1 k nn j nn g nn c n x k nn 1 j nn 1 g nn 1 n 2 3 n 1 in summary the fundamental idea behind the proposed point by point marching strategy is that starting from the end node at which both the dimensionless acid concentration and its first derivative are known we are able to derive in a recurrence manner the analytical expressions such as those expressed by eqs 55 and 57 for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration at any interior node in the right region of the reactive mass transport problem fig 5 shows the effect of the damkohler and peclet numbers on the dimensionless acid concentration distribution in both the left and right regions in this figure the dimensionless acid concentration in the left region is calculated by using the mathematical solution expressed in eq 21 while the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region is calculated by using the analytical expression of the finite element solution expressed in eqs 55 and 57 to produce these solutions the following parameters were used in the corresponding calculation φ 0 0 1 φ f 0 3 δ x 0 001 n 4000 l 1 1 0 m and α 0 04 m 1 since both c x x 1 and c x x x 1 are considered to be continuous at the interface between the left and right regions the distribution of the dimensionless acid concentration is continuous and smooth as clearly shown at x 1 in fig 5 it can be observed that both the damkohler and peclet numbers can have significant influences on the dimensionless acid concentration distribution in both the left and right regions for a given value of the peclet number the dimensionless acid concentration decreases remarkably with an increase in the value of the damkohler number similarly for a given value of the damkohler number the dimensionless acid concentration also decreases considerably with an increase in the value of the peclet number since the damkohler number can reflect the comprehensive characteristic of the right region including the porosity distribution characteristic of the right region it implies that the porosity distribution characteristic of the right region can also have a significant effect on the dimensionless acid concentration distribution in both the left and right regions it should be pointed out that the main purpose of this study is first to present both the interface condition substitution strategy and the point by point marching strategy and then to demonstrate how they can be employed to derive the mixed analytical solutions of mathematical and numerical methods for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media since these mixed analytical solutions are obtained in a rigorously mathematical manner they can be used as benchmark solutions to either verify any numerical solutions or predict acid concentration distributions in a porous medium if the physical property of the porous medium is known on the other hand if the acid concentration distribution in a porous medium is measured then we can use these mixed analytical solutions to determine the physical property of the porous medium since analytical solutions of a problem can be served as benchmark solutions of the problem great efforts have been made even though very difficult to derive analytical solutions for scientific and engineering problems in the past many years 5 conclusions mixed analytical solutions of mathematical and numerical methods have been derived for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media the derived mixed analytical solutions comprise the following two parts one is the analytical expression for the mathematical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the left region where the porosity of the porous medium has a constant distribution of the reactive mass transport system while another is the analytical expression for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region where the porosity of the porous medium has an exponential distribution of the system the interface condition substitution strategy has been proposed and used to derive the mathematical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the left region of the reactive mass transport system the fundamental idea behind this strategy is that the boundary condition at the entrance of the left region and the mathematical governing equation of the right region at the interface location between the left and right regions can be used to determine two independent constants involved in the mathematical solutions for both dimensional and dimensionless acid concentrations in the left region of the reactive mass transport system on the other hand the point by point marching strategy has been proposed and used to derive the analytical expression for the numerical solution i e the finite element solution of the dimensionless acid concentration in the right region of the reactive mass transport system the basic idea behind this strategy is that starting from the end node located at the left boundary of the right region at which both the dimensionless acid concentration and its first derivative are known we are able to derive in a recurrence manner the analytical expression for the numerical solution of the dimensionless acid concentration at any interior node in the right region of the reactive mass transport system it should be pointed out that the main academic contribution of this study is first to present both the interface condition substitution strategy and the point by point marching strategy and then to demonstrate how they can be employed to derive the mixed analytical solutions of mathematical and numerical methods for reactive mass transport problems of two different porosity regions in fluid saturated porous media in

5972,multi directional fluid flow and transport dynamics as intrinsic characteristics of hillslope flow regimes can strongly contribute to the quality evolution of groundwater resources and compartmentalization of subsurface ecosystems however their extent and importance in topographic highs groundwater recharge areas is typically less investigated because productive groundwater bodies and thus monitoring activities are frequently lacking in the hainich critical zone exploratory we explored the hydrogeological functioning of the widely distributed setting of thin bedded alternating mixed carbonate siliciclastic bedrock by using basic environmental timeseries up to 8 year records of weather parameters ground temperatures multi depth hydraulic heads and non conservative tracers were exploited applying a scheme for the exploratory analysis of dis continuous groundwater quality data we identified transient multi directional flow dynamics comprising fluctuating perched groundwater localized recharge and groundwater mounding in the aeration zone that modify and partly reverse flow patterns in the phreatic zone this interplay of flow dynamics within the hillslope aeration and phreatic zone causes significant re distribution e g oxygen nitrate that even overcome the protective cover of thick argillaceous strata by supplying surface sourced substances to deep

multi directional exchange of fluids solutes particles and energy within the subsurface compartments of topographic highs is an often observed yet rarely addressed factor for dynamics of bedrock groundwater quality and interdependent subsurface ecosystems generally the quality and ecology of shallow groundwater is controlled to a variable extent by inputs with infiltrating precipitation and seepage lin 2010 by hyporheic zone exchange schmidt and hahn 2012 by fluid rock interactions daniele et al 2013 and biogeochemical cycling lohse et al 2009 the fluid flow pervaded solids and thus transport of matter and energy differ largely between the aeration zone and the zone of permanent saturation the aeration zone harbors variably active flow paths pronk et al 2009 and shows pronounced bypass flow matter re distribution by water level fluctuations legout et al 2007 rouxel et al 2011 but also discontinuous permanently water saturated parts in contrast the phreatic zone that locally contain productive groundwater resources is not underlain by unsaturated zones its depth is controlled by various factors like climate topography bulk rock permeability and the gravity driven organization of groundwater flow tóth 1995 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 that usually cause a large thickness of aeration zones beneath topographic highs salvucci and entekhabi 1995 multi directional highlights the fact that subsurface fluid flow in both zones is characterized by transient variation of generally gravity driven flow regimes whereas in the shallow aeration zone viz the soil mantle variable surface subsurface exchange is well studied with respect to hillslope stream connectivity runoff generation and stream water quality gabrielli et al 2012 fluid flow dynamics within deeper bedrock are scarcely recognized salve et al 2012 rouxel et al 2011 the deep aeration zone however can regularly undergo ascending cross communication as well when rainstorm or snowmelt infiltrations exceeds the local percolation capacity and result in perched groundwater and event scale upwelling flow in the phreatic zone the partitioning of recharge into shallow local to regional flow systems varies with the dynamic phreatic surface goderniaux et al 2013 and cause directions of flow and transport to be transient and even regularly reversed so far the importance of multi directional flow and transport phenomena within topographic recharge areas both in the interacting aeration and phreatic zone for the downgradient resource quality is essentially unknown especially dynamics of flow transport and transformation in the bedrock part of the aeration zone are not in focus of resource management practices since its monitoring in hillslope terrain is challenging gabrielli et al 2012 likewise it is vastly unknown to what extent low permeability strata aquitards take part in hillslope fluid flow we thus explored multi directional flow and exchange dynamics in a hillslope setting of the widely distributed bedrock type westphal 2006 of limestone mudstone alternations by analyzing long term environmental data for subsurface responses to surface and subsurface signals we aimed to answer 1 where and when do conditions of multi directional exchange occur 2 do these conditions significantly affect groundwater quality in general surface signals are filtered retained or eliminated larocque et al 1998 within the subsurface the same holds for superimposing signals of subsurface origin their transformations though offer insights into the subsurface architecture and flow patterns however hydrographs thermographs chemographs and time series of discrete data reveal characteristics of both the surface events and of the connected compartments as a global response kiraly 2003 to the input furthermore in topographic highs aeration zone water that circulates far above the phreatic surface is of predominant meteoric origin so that isotopic water tracers gain no insights we thus systematically analyzed multi year and multi depth time series of water levels and of a large set of non conservative including authigenic tracers to elucidate the hidden aeration zone dynamics and sub regional impacts 2 material and methods 2 1 study site within the hainich critical zone exploratory cze our study site fig 1 is located at the hainich s gently

data from the meteorological station in weberstedt meteogroup deutschland gmbh germany 270 mamsl fig 1 d the growing season was determined as defined in frich et al 2002 a daily climatic water balance cwb also referred to as effective precipitation was calculated as the difference between measured daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration calculated with the penman monteith method according to allen et al 1998 its cumulative form cwbcum depicts soil moisture surpluses and deficits c f steenhuis and van der molen 1986 the linear trend of the cwbcum time series was detrended for hydrograph analysis weather data recorded with our own stations were compared event timing magnitude to weberstedt for the period of simultaneous operation in fact weberstedt underwent precipitation events that happened at the hilltop thus allowing substitutability 2 3 a scheme for classification and analysis of subsurface responses we applied a scheme for classification and analysis of subsurface responses to signals of surface or subsurface origin inherent in groundwater quality data it utilizes the temporal fluctuations of environmental parameters to track cross stratal exchange and to distinguish directions of exchange rather than allow for the identification of signal sources the scheme comprises 1 a classification of subsurface responses 2 exploratory timeseries analyses and a 3 response matrix summarizing dominating responses of a suite of environmental tracers used to unravel the hydrogeological functioning 2 3 1 classification of surface signals and subsurface responses surface signals fig 2 a are generally introduced in the subsurface by variable input of matter and energy by atmospheric forcing e g precipitation surface temperature or interacting surface conditions e g vegetation period tillage the signals can be of episodic and seasonal character or both superimposition subsurface responses fig 2 b c are the event scale or seasonal re distribution of matter incl fluids information and energy hydrographs fig 2 b show the water level fluctuation or hydraulic head of a monitoring well or spring vs time generally hydrographs may show pronounced event scale peaks in topographic recharge areas upslope small contribution areas and under conditions of low aeration zone storage aquifer storativity and or localized recharge conduit fracture flow see smart and hobbs 1986 bakalowicz 2005 whereas delayed i e longer lag i damped as well as superimposed and cumulating responses indicate larger contribution areas downslope discharge areas higher storativity and or diffuse recharge and diffuse retarded flow together with spatiotemporal head data responses of subsurface environmental parameters fig 2 c indicate event scale or seasonal directed exchange of matter and energy the informative value of single parameters of authigenic target zone or external origin may be limited if superimposition of signals and responses occur due to multiple relevant sources thus their utilization is dependent on spatiotemporal conditions therefore requiring alternative environmental parameters if necessary the response types integrate combined and interacting processes and exchange conditions reactive transport phenomena like advection dispersion retardation and degradation control the lag time ii and peak height width simple responses indicate for instance the input of external matter increase or dilution decrease by recharging waters variable responses point to for instance variable importance of the former by variably active composed signal sources or exchange directions dual responses can indicate piston flow phenomena i e replacement of pre event water with minor mixing e g williams 1983 in soil or bedrock multiple responses may be caused by the sequential activity of flow paths and sources within the contribution area see white 2015 2 3 2 exploratory time series analysis descriptive and multi variate statistical analyses and time series analyses were carried out using spss statistics v 25 ibm usa and origin pro v 2018 originlab usa hereinafter seasonality addresses periodic components of time series and episodic refers to irregular occurrence extreme event thresholds for precipitation were determined from long term data 1951 2005 kammerforst abandoned station 270 m amsl solely upon event rarity if rarer than the 99th percentile furthermore we determined extreme subsurface events by the 0 1th and 99 9th percentile of recorded water levels and of the length of groundwater surplus deficit periods besides the irregular and non seasonal water saturation of regularly water unsaturated zones or aeration of saturated zones respectively or any extreme state in local energy matter conditions would represent subsurface extremes the delineation of extreme or even surface subsurface single events the latter occurring only once within a time series generally depends on the length and temporal resolution of the respective records longer time series and higher temporal resolution result in higher thresholds of extreme single events and vice versa short term events that are followed by fast relaxation are defined by their irregularity only and are not detectable based on sparse and short observation periods we applied sliding windows cross correlation swcc delbart et al 2014 for exploring the time variant relation between cwbcum and groundwater level time series that were split into 6 month windows with 4 month overlaps time lags were picked from maxima of the cross correlation function 95 confidence level and plotted against the central dates of the 6 month windows periodicity was determined by periodogram inspection sub annual following spectral analysis with tukey hamming smoothing of daily levels medians average hydrographs season figures were constructed from repeatedly plotted monthly medians subsequently the large set of basic groundwater quality parameters was analyzed we inspected each dis continuous time series of single parameters plotted against the hydrographs and tested the fluctuation of consecutive data i e peak vs late relaxation state for statistical significance by applying the mann whitney u test p 0 05 hereby parameters that show non significant responses fig 2 c though representing important information were excluded from further analysis in relation to each wells hydrograph the reduced set of parameters was then visually analyzed for each parameter s response characteristics comprising the tendency increase decrease timing synchronous delayed fig 2 lag ii and also the fluctuation magnitude and relaxation behavior 2 3 3 response matrix finally dominating response behaviors tendency timing of the groundwater parameters were aggregated in a response matrix whose column arrangement represent a transect within the investigated area in the condensed and easily explorable form predominant parameter responses are highlighted thus facilitating the evaluation of multi depth and multi site observations as the response matrix show characteristics that were required to be reproduced within multi year time series generally suited tracers their informative value and thus the hydrogeological functioning is revealed 3 results 3 1 atmospheric forcing local climate and weather characteristics the mean annual precipitation at kammerforst 1971 2000 is 722 mm extreme event thresholds for precipitation are 21 2 mm d in winter and 30 1 mm d in summer events with interruptions 1 d are referred to as cumulative extremes if exceeding 85 5 mm in winter and 72 9 mm in summer precipitation free periods are qualified extreme after 17 days in winter and 15 days in summer for the monitoring period 2010 2018 in weberstedt the mean annual precipitation was 580 mm and the mean air temperature was 9 1 c the growing season lasted for an average of 237 d from 23 march to 14 november thus the period 1 november to 31 october was set as the hydrological year for data analysis the cwbcum same period not shown shows a negative temporal trend reflecting synclineward water scarcity in weberstedt adding the average surplus median 33 2003 2006 of daily precipitation that kammerforst receives in comparison to weberstedt led to a slight positive trend of the cwbcum not shown as expected for the hilltop areas this site correction also roughly equals out the annual sum differences the de trended sinusoidal cwbcum fig 3 a the surrogate for soil moisture or deep infiltration was found to be more suited than the precipitation

rarity of high frequent or strong temperature fluctuations indicate nearly given groundwater bedrock thermal equilibria however the measurement resolution of our recording devices was generally appropriate for distinguishing surface subsurface signal origin summit to midslope domains exhibit synchronous decreases that propagate down to 50 m depth here cold season infiltrating waters keep the contrast even if weak summer events scarcely result in synchronous warming in summit wells in midslope to footslope positions synchronous increases strongly indicate ascending waters for the deepest

matrix permeabilities of tight mo rocks bulk permeabilities show that fractures do importantly contribute to fluid flow in the motk limestones flow likely occurs preferentially in partially widened even breccia like networks of fractures kohlhepp et al 2017 in the tight mom mudstones and calcimudstones considerable part of the flow is restricted to thinner and lesser connected fractures all hydrographs are lacking instantaneous peaks obviously event scale pressure transfer lischeid et al 2002 is a negligible phenomenon most likely due to high hydraulic diffusivity of carbonate rocks mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 despite the presence of argillaceous strata thus even high soil rock moisture and larger perched groundwater bodies in winter does not impede aeration zone ventilation at the lower midslope where surface flow in intermittent creeks occurs the shallow groundwater thermographs are lacking short term fluctuations and mostly reflect seasonal conductive warming cooling thus multi directional exchange between groundwater and surface water typical for hyporheic zones schmidt and hahn 2012 is at best minor and retarded around the small creeks 4 1 2 atmospheric forcing and the role of surface subsurface extremes snowmelts and subsequent rain events in winter cause maxima of groundwater levels and thus of recharge missing responses to precipitation events e g in oct nov 2015 and delayed maxima highlight the role of antecedent soil moisture and indicate the dominance of diffuse recharge summer responses also depend on antecedent saturation of the aeration zone in general percolation flux to the aquifers decreases during the growing season cwbcum minima monotonic recessions due to higher evapotranspiration losses thus the dormancy period plays a crucial role for groundwater recharge among the surface signals weather signals comprise multiple snowmelts heavy rainstorms wet periods e g anomalous wet may 2013 and precipitation free periods e g spring 2018 the extreme highstands and surplus period after the snowmelt rich spring 2013 demonstrate that episodic events strongly contribute to groundwater highstands and budget subsequently seasonally filled soil storages likely favor recharge even from minor input regarding the anomalous wet seasons in summer 2014 fig 3 a precipitation extremes however do not necessarily enhance infiltration recharge they contribute to the climatic water balance and thus mainly to winter recharge thus multiple snowmelt events most effectively recharge groundwater resources the pronounced surplus period also lastingly prevented levels to drop to minima despite the minimum precipitation in 2015 the driest and warmest calendar year 2018 was remarkably accompanied by 5 to 8 year highstands fig 3 a here groundwater quantity drew on the antecedent wet winter as well however we cannot exclude severe effects for matter quality and exchange throughout the aeration zone the 85 year precipitation record kammerforst showed a trend for increasing winter precipitation and a tendency for decreasing summer precipitation not shown that coincides with climatic studies for central and northern europe beniston et al 2007 because of predominantly winter timed recharge groundwater renewal in the hillslope system might be lesser threatened by these effects of climate change a warming trend may generally increase number of mid winter melts allen et al 2010 however earlier and reduced melts along with reduced summer precipitation may contrarily result in extended recession periods and pronounced low stands eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 allen et al 2010 subsurface extremes fig 3 b accompanied by phases of pronounced highstands or lowstands represent episodic but lasting conditions whereas the aeration zone consequently undergoes harsh environmental changes in terms of water saturation and connectivity the phreatic zone keeps saturated however severely changed heads and thus flow patterns may have also strong impacts for the subsurface ecosystems one example is the lasting impact on the phreatic zone temperatures following the extreme recharge in 2013 14 4 1 3 the topographic high s flow regime overall hco3 type groundwaters characterize a shallow local recharge discharge system mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 water rock interaction indicators e g sr mg ca ratio table 1 point to increasing flow distances or residence times respectively along the transect h1 h5 and between the contrasting strata mom motk continuously recorded ec25 increases revealed surface input in uphill areas but ascending input in footslope domains the simulated pco2 values for the shallow summit well indicate loading in percolated soil and the dominance of diffuse infiltration recharge in the shallow lower midslope high co2 originate rather from microbial cycling in low permeable saturated overburden cf schwab et al 2019 during the summer halfs our transect area generally represent a groundwater recharge area that is widely dominated by descending and downdip or sub lateral flow fig 8 fast rises and slower recessions of hydraulic heads confirm a low permeability fracture network in the upslope aeration zone the frequent level fluctuations coincide with the moderate bulk permeability and low storage coefficients not shown or both sauter 1995 responding with stronger but still short lived peaks to weather events the upper midslope mom well shows its larger contribution area enhanced surface connection and low transmissivity and minimal storativity highest amplitudes of level fluctuation in midslope footslope wells are due to the larger contribution areas resulting in higher groundwater supply and head built up comparatively slow rises are related to higher permeabilities and flow distances slow recessions likely represent regional back flooding and thus point to the permeability barrier for the deepest motk well h51 highest permeability and upward leakage was evident from its necessity for drawdown curve fitting in the footslope domains the motk represents a productive aquifer synclinewards buried and less altered mudstones however contain fine fractures lazar et al 2019 that may even be more permeable than the upslope weathering remains and thus do less impede cross stratal exchange if assuming purely stratiform flow from outcropping high permeability strata i e screen sections to buried footslope domains travel times based on hydraulic gradients see fig 5 b and the permeability data fig 5 c would cause 30 fold higher theoretical time lags for hydrograph responses in turn generally low swcc lag times demonstrate that considerable cross stratal e g vertical flow and recharge occur in the limestone mudstone alternations however in the upslope aeration zone diffuse infiltration feed high permeability strata that store and transmit perched groundwater as indicated by event scale level fluctuations fig 8 a mudstone strata being dense de lithified and plastic here apparently lack fractures thus downdip stratiform flow is likely favored and even produces episodic rushing noise in shoulder wells fast level rises and slower recessions also indicate back flooding likely due to exceedance of vertical and downdip percolation capacity under locally low hydraulic gradients the perched water bodies exist permanently or temporally in the uphill aeration zone yet they seem to be rather patchy and discontinuous in space in the phreatic zone the flow regime fig 8 is subject to gravity driven flow comprising synclineward vertically converging flow as shown by the head reversals fig 4 the conceptual permeability barrier treffurt 1982 fig 1 b c that is characterized by reported lower permeabilities beyond i e lacking productive groundwater resources is however not necessarily the cause for groundwater rise and discharge both the current sub regional flow regime and its developed hydrofacies zonation rather originate from self organization of subsurface flow tóth 1999 and the geologic agency tóth 1995 of groundwater the latter decreases synclinewards due to higher mineralization and additionally reduced flow and thus bequeathed less weathered or karstified strata in the syncline center 4 2 transient patterns of multi directional flow and matter exchange continuous do recordings indicate loading by descending waters at summit fig 3 b and shallow midslope low loaded event waters e g h2 table 1 indicate locally fast bypass flow without pronounced solute redistribution in the aeration zone of the slope shoulder however during seasonal or episodic infiltration recharge perched water bodies form or expand in the aeration zone that fluctuate in the stratiform and or vertical direction fig 8 a those conditions of multi directional flow can efficiently connect neighboring parts of the aeration zone upwelling waters or higher heads would generally allow for mobile matter to be supplied in low permeable also bypassed rock limestone matrices mudstones thus aerated hanging strata likely receive matter input during highstands while laying strata may receive lasting drainage during subsequent recessions in the deep lower midslope well do logging strongly indicated loading by ascending thus mm waters seasonal and episodical abrupt warming and synchronous increases in sulfate indicate ascending flow from laying strata too here in the saturated zone the motk receives oxygen during progressed seasonal highstands fig 8 c the same applies for midslope well h31 during highstand maxima not shown noteworthy dissolved oxygen as surface sourced matter can thus be supplied to oxygen deficient domains by ascending waters that bypassed the tighter oxygen deficient overburden at the lower footslope do is lacking in the continuous record here increases of ca2 sr2 so4 2 and cl point to ascending mm groundwaters decreasing cl responses in h52 i e dilution might additionally point to ultrafiltration of laying percolated argillaceous beds membranes tóth 1999 leading to ion enrichment in single strata interestingly lacking cl input from mm waters to h41 point to depletion due likely to the completed dissolution of mm evaporites in this area agricultural sourced nitrate is transported by descending waters at the upper midslope but likely also by ascending waters in the deep lower midslope higher na concentrations in h4 h5 mom waters and lower levels of ca2 compared to motk point also to ion exchange tóth 1999 on clay mineral rich strata during cross stratal exchange or residence authigenic boron negligible in upslope domains is elevated in footslope mo strata and seasonal decreases also indicate ascending mm waters barium is another likewise conditional indicator of cross stratal exchange it increases in h41 h51 due to input from laying strata and decreases in h52 h53 due to export by ascending flow thus loading by mm waters but also locally high concentrations in mom especially in the upper midslope occur lower silicon concentrations also characterize ascending mm waters in contrast to mom strata due likely to faster passage the aberrant strong level rises of the upper midslope motk well e g autumn 2013 that are accompanied by abrupt strong increases in do no3 and drops in ca so4 2 pco2 may point to extreme event activation of upslope karst input features or abrupt onset of ascending flow due to filled storages in laying strata typical indicators for flow variation in carbonate rocks like carbon parameters and turbidity cf white 2015 pronk et al 2009 were shown to be not suited to understand our retarded flow system due to non significant responses stable isotopes of h2o 18o 2d not shown in this study do not significantly differ between groundwater surface waters and precipitation they are thus irrelevant for the exploration of flow dynamics far above the phreatic surface or of shallow groundwater that is of meteoric dominated origin contrastingly our results demonstrate that large suites of complementary environmental tracers are necessary to reveal cross stratal exchange and multidirectional flow patterns within sub regional flow systems and particularly within mixed lithologies the exploitability of temperature signals and responses that was limited in the deep phreatic zone could be increased by high spatial resolution fibre sensor measurements for continuous tracing of fluid migration 4 2 1 groundwater mounding boosts shallow flow paths taken together the environmental time series environmental tracers and multi depth head measurements further allow for the reconstruction of transient flow patterns within the aeration and phreatic zone different timing of multi depth head responses and lacking responses in superimposed screen sections to sampling induced drawdowns h4 5 point to a rather slow hydraulic equilibration within the stratified but hydraulically continuous bedrock in the phreatic zone thus in the aeration zone we assume downdip runoff in sloping high permeable strata to cause localized recharge and concomitant groundwater mounding such mounds modify the local to sub regional flow patterns fig 8 c as groundwater circulation in short local paths relatively increase with an elevated relief of the phreatic surface goderniaux et al 2013 consequently recharge discharge areas expand or contract seasonally as multiply evidenced by the head reversals and cross stratal breakthrough of matter for instance the oxygenation of the main aquifer by ascending waters the phreatic zone also undergoes transient variation of flow directions and flow intensity 4 3 compartmentalization and nutritional supply of the subsurface ecosystem beneath the topographic high of the hainich low mountain range the important recharge area of downslope used groundwater resources we identified a typically large aeration zone the pronounced stacking of saturated perched and unsaturated zones from summit to midslope positions the configuration of sloping bedrock strata and multi directional flow dynamics both in the aeration zone and phreatic zone jointly control the nutritional supply and exchange between subsurface ecosystems this consequently cause a compartmentalization of the hillslope subsurface regarding surface sourced input and subsurface re distribution we can distinguish different degrees of nutritional supply or isolation see fig 8 c respectively high isolation can be expected in i parts of the aeration zone that are bypassed and not regularly connected by water flow furthermore high isolation is given in saturated zones that only receive cross stratal fluid flow that was filtered by ii thick hanging e g h42 3 or iii laying sequences e g h53 for such isolated although shallow domains schwab et al 2019 recently found that groundwater dispersed microbes also utilize sedimentary carbon and that autotrophic lifestyle is even common due likely to limited input of fresh organic matter except for the shallowest summit wells that show elevated organic carbon table 1 in groundwater neither surface origin nor event scale subsurface exchange was indicated by time series of carbon sums due to non significant fluctuation at the upper midslope the shallow well receive more oxygen and nitrate table 1 fig 3 c by descending waters than the shallow wells of summit or lower midslope here favorable strata lithology weathering fracturing and karst input features likely enhance the surface connection generally higher but variable transfer of surface sourced nutrients takes place in high permeable strata e g motk both in perched water bodies within the aeration zone and in phreatic regions that undergo pronounced cross stratal exchange here the ascend of oxygenated waters into oxygen deficient regions that rather receive only cycled or filtered input during recession periods highlight the interplay of aeration zone dynamics and phreatic flow for the evolution of groundwater quality likewise subsurface sourced sulfate fig 6 c d and surface sourced nitrate not shown can enter the groundwater bodies by ascending flow rather than by downward percolation limited oxygen and nitrate in descending waters is likely caused by microbial turnover accordingly herrmann et al 2017 found diverse denitrifier communities in the hainich groundwater with higher potentials for heterotrophic nitrate reduction in the trochitenkalk fm and high autotrophic potential in groundwater of the tighter hanging strata for the latter kumar et al 2017 reported high anammox activity from anoxically incubated groundwater consequently the hillslope configuration of bedrock and flow exhibit an intrinsic protection against agricultural loading from the footslope cropland because of even adverse aspects nitrate loading by cross stratal exchange the quality of the main aquifer benefit from solely forestry use in the upslope areas for the main aquifer nawaz et al 2018 identified a fungal core genus that also cover potential plant pathogens and thus confirmed a higher surface connectivity independently of our presented flow patterns 5 conclusions our study illustrates the immense value of multi depth exploration and long time series of basic environmental data for elucidating the scarcely addressed role of multi directional flow phenomena beneath topographic highs we improved the understanding of the local muschelkalk flow system mainly by exploring the high responsivity of perched and phreatic groundwater bodies and their groundwater quality to atmospheric forcing and by demonstrating the overall cross stratal exchange and the functional differences of argillaceous strata along a hillslope setting for the first time noteworthy the hillslope interplay of aeration zone dynamics and flow paths of variable temporal activity in the phreatic zone was found to reduce the isolating or protective cover of thick argillaceous strata thus increasing the intrinsic vulnerability and resulted in supply of even deep regions by surface sourced matter regarding limestone mudstone alternations representing a widely distributed bedrock type that hosts important groundwater resources we can conclude multi directional flow phenomena are intrinsic features within multi strata hillslope settings phenomena like expansion contraction of perched groundwater in the aeration zone and transient cross stratal exchange through low permeability strata aquitards in the phreatic zone interact and shape the quality of groundwater resources the hillslope configuration of sloping strata facilitates the formation of discontinuous perched groundwater bodies and of a multiply zoned aeration zone episodic and seasonal multi directional fluid flow patterns and transport contribute both to ecosystem compartmentalization and to the nutritional supply and exchange between subsurface ecosystems the developed scheme for exploratory time series analysis response classification and response matrix helps to systematically exploit indispensable basic and dis continuous groundwater quality data for hydrogeological site investigations in mixed lithologies we suggest large sets of conditional tracers including authigenic signals are required i to explore cross compartment exchange and thus ii to determine the hydrogeological functions of argillaceous strata due to superimposing signals of surface and subsurface origins continuous recording of groundwater quality parameters is generally required for the retrieval of response characteristics of episodic forcings whereas discrete data for instance on a monthly cycle is appropriate for identifying seasonal quality variation in comparable retarded flow systems the extent of matter re distribution by multi directional flow phenomena within topographic highs including dispersal of organisms should be further investigated in detail attributing the microbial diversity of groundwater resources solely on fluid habitat properties i e from single aquifers disregarding cross stratal import export of both microbes and nutrients hampers the predictability for instance of ecosystem services we thus suggest to carefully consider the hillslope multi directional flow and matter

5972,multi directional fluid flow and transport dynamics as intrinsic characteristics of hillslope flow regimes can strongly contribute to the quality evolution of groundwater resources and compartmentalization of subsurface ecosystems however their extent and importance in topographic highs groundwater recharge areas is typically less investigated because productive groundwater bodies and thus monitoring activities are frequently lacking in the hainich critical zone exploratory we explored the hydrogeological functioning of the widely distributed setting of thin bedded alternating mixed carbonate siliciclastic bedrock by using basic environmental timeseries up to 8 year records of weather parameters ground temperatures multi depth hydraulic heads and non conservative tracers were exploited applying a scheme for the exploratory analysis of dis continuous groundwater quality data we identified transient multi directional flow dynamics comprising fluctuating perched

aeration and phreatic zone causes significant re distribution e g oxygen nitrate that even overcome the protective cover of thick argillaceous strata by supplying surface sourced substances to deep

multi directional exchange of fluids solutes particles and energy within the subsurface compartments of topographic highs is an often observed yet rarely addressed factor for dynamics of bedrock groundwater quality and interdependent subsurface ecosystems generally the quality and ecology of shallow groundwater is controlled to a variable extent by inputs with infiltrating precipitation and seepage lin 2010 by hyporheic zone exchange schmidt and hahn 2012 by fluid rock interactions daniele et al 2013 and biogeochemical cycling lohse et al 2009 the fluid flow pervaded solids and thus transport of matter and energy differ largely between the aeration zone and the zone of permanent saturation the aeration zone harbors variably active flow paths pronk et al 2009 and shows pronounced bypass flow matter re distribution by water level fluctuations legout et al 2007 rouxel et al 2011 but also discontinuous permanently water saturated parts in contrast the phreatic zone that locally contain productive groundwater resources is not underlain by unsaturated zones its depth is controlled by various factors like climate topography bulk rock permeability and the gravity driven organization of groundwater flow tóth 1995 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 that usually cause a large thickness of aeration zones beneath topographic highs salvucci and entekhabi 1995 multi directional highlights the fact that subsurface fluid flow in both zones is characterized by transient variation of generally gravity driven flow regimes whereas in the shallow aeration zone viz the soil mantle variable surface subsurface exchange is well studied with respect to hillslope stream connectivity runoff generation and stream water quality gabrielli et al 2012 fluid flow dynamics within deeper bedrock are scarcely recognized salve et al 2012 rouxel et al 2011 the deep aeration zone however can regularly undergo ascending cross communication as well when rainstorm or snowmelt infiltrations exceeds the local percolation capacity and result in perched groundwater and event scale upwelling flow in the phreatic zone the partitioning of recharge into shallow local to regional flow systems varies with the dynamic phreatic surface goderniaux et al 2013 and cause directions of flow and transport to be transient and even regularly reversed so far the importance of multi directional flow and transport phenomena within topographic recharge areas both in the interacting aeration and phreatic zone for the downgradient resource quality is essentially unknown especially dynamics of flow transport and transformation in the bedrock part of the aeration zone are not in focus of resource management practices since its monitoring in hillslope terrain is challenging gabrielli et al 2012 likewise it is vastly unknown to what extent low permeability strata aquitards take part in hillslope fluid flow we thus explored multi directional flow and exchange dynamics in a hillslope setting of the widely distributed bedrock type westphal 2006 of limestone mudstone alternations by analyzing long term environmental data for subsurface responses to surface and subsurface signals we aimed to answer 1 where and when do conditions of multi directional exchange occur 2 do these conditions significantly affect groundwater quality in general surface signals are filtered retained or eliminated larocque et al 1998 within the subsurface the same holds for superimposing signals of subsurface origin their transformations though offer insights into the subsurface architecture and flow patterns however hydrographs thermographs chemographs and time series of discrete data reveal characteristics of both the surface events and of the connected compartments as a global response kiraly 2003 to the input furthermore in topographic highs aeration zone water that circulates far above the phreatic surface is of predominant meteoric origin so that isotopic water tracers gain no insights we thus systematically analyzed multi year and multi depth time series of water levels and of a large set of non conservative including authigenic tracers to elucidate the hidden aeration zone dynamics and sub regional impacts 2 material and methods 2 1 study site within the hainich critical zone exploratory cze our study site fig 1 is located at the hainich s gently

data from the meteorological station in weberstedt meteogroup deutschland gmbh germany 270 mamsl fig 1 d the growing season was determined as defined in frich et al 2002 a daily climatic water balance cwb also referred to as effective precipitation was calculated as the difference between measured daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration calculated with the penman monteith method according to allen et al 1998 its cumulative form cwbcum depicts soil moisture surpluses and deficits c f steenhuis and van der molen 1986 the linear trend of the cwbcum time series was detrended for hydrograph analysis weather data recorded with our own stations were compared event timing magnitude to weberstedt for the period of simultaneous operation in fact weberstedt underwent precipitation events that happened at the hilltop thus allowing substitutability 2 3 a scheme for classification and analysis of subsurface responses we applied a scheme for classification and analysis of subsurface responses to signals of surface or subsurface origin inherent in groundwater quality data it utilizes the temporal fluctuations of environmental parameters to track cross stratal exchange and to distinguish directions of exchange rather than allow for the identification of signal sources the scheme comprises 1 a classification of subsurface responses 2 exploratory timeseries analyses and a 3 response matrix summarizing dominating responses of a suite of environmental tracers used to unravel the hydrogeological functioning 2 3 1 classification of surface signals and subsurface responses surface signals fig 2 a are generally introduced in the subsurface by variable input of matter and energy by atmospheric forcing e g precipitation surface temperature or interacting surface conditions e g vegetation period tillage the signals can be of episodic and seasonal character or both superimposition subsurface responses fig 2 b c are the event scale or seasonal re distribution of matter incl fluids information and energy hydrographs fig 2 b show the water level fluctuation or hydraulic head of a monitoring well or spring vs time generally hydrographs may show pronounced event scale peaks in topographic recharge areas upslope small contribution areas and under conditions of low aeration zone storage aquifer storativity and or localized recharge conduit fracture flow see smart and hobbs 1986 bakalowicz 2005 whereas delayed i e longer lag i damped as well as superimposed and cumulating responses indicate larger contribution areas downslope discharge areas higher storativity and or diffuse recharge and diffuse retarded flow together with spatiotemporal head data responses of subsurface environmental parameters fig 2 c indicate event scale or seasonal directed exchange of matter and energy the informative value of single parameters of authigenic target zone or external origin may be limited if superimposition of signals and responses occur due to multiple relevant sources thus their utilization is dependent on spatiotemporal conditions therefore requiring alternative environmental parameters if necessary the response types integrate combined and interacting processes and exchange conditions reactive transport phenomena like advection dispersion retardation and degradation control the lag time ii and peak height width simple responses indicate for instance the input of external matter increase or dilution decrease by recharging waters variable responses point to for instance variable importance of the former by variably active composed signal sources or exchange directions dual responses can indicate piston flow phenomena i e replacement of pre event water with minor mixing e g williams 1983 in soil or bedrock multiple responses may be caused by the sequential activity of flow paths and sources within the contribution area see white 2015 2 3 2 exploratory time series analysis descriptive and multi variate statistical analyses and time series analyses were carried out using spss statistics v 25 ibm usa and origin pro v 2018 originlab usa hereinafter seasonality addresses periodic components of time series and episodic refers to irregular occurrence extreme event thresholds for precipitation were determined from long term data 1951 2005 kammerforst abandoned station 270 m amsl solely upon event rarity if rarer than the 99th percentile furthermore we determined extreme subsurface events by the 0 1th and 99 9th percentile of recorded water levels and of the length of groundwater surplus deficit periods besides the irregular and non seasonal water saturation of regularly water unsaturated zones or aeration of saturated zones respectively or any extreme state in local energy matter conditions would represent subsurface extremes the delineation of extreme or even surface subsurface single events the latter occurring only once within a time series generally depends on the length and temporal resolution of the respective records longer time series and higher temporal resolution result in higher thresholds of extreme single events and vice versa short term events that are followed by fast relaxation are defined by their irregularity only and are not detectable based on sparse and short observation periods we applied sliding windows cross correlation swcc delbart et al 2014 for exploring the time variant relation between cwbcum and groundwater level time series that were split into 6 month windows with 4 month overlaps time lags were picked from maxima of the cross correlation function 95 confidence level and plotted against the central dates of the 6 month windows periodicity was determined by periodogram inspection sub annual following spectral analysis with tukey hamming smoothing of daily levels medians average hydrographs season figures were constructed from repeatedly plotted monthly medians subsequently the large set of basic groundwater quality parameters was analyzed we inspected each dis continuous time series of single parameters plotted against the hydrographs and tested the fluctuation of consecutive data i e peak vs late relaxation state for statistical significance by applying the mann whitney u test p 0 05 hereby parameters that show non significant responses fig 2 c though representing important information were excluded from further analysis in relation to each wells hydrograph the reduced set of parameters was then visually analyzed for each parameter s response characteristics comprising the tendency increase decrease timing synchronous delayed fig 2 lag ii and also the fluctuation magnitude and relaxation behavior 2 3 3 response matrix finally dominating response behaviors tendency timing of the groundwater parameters were aggregated in a response matrix whose column arrangement represent a transect within the investigated area in the condensed and easily explorable form predominant parameter responses are highlighted thus facilitating the evaluation of multi depth and multi site observations as the response matrix show characteristics that were required to be reproduced within multi year time series generally suited tracers their informative value and thus the hydrogeological functioning is revealed 3 results 3 1 atmospheric forcing local climate and weather characteristics the mean annual precipitation at kammerforst 1971 2000 is 722 mm extreme event thresholds for precipitation are 21 2 mm d in winter and 30 1 mm d in summer events with interruptions 1 d are referred to as cumulative extremes if exceeding 85 5 mm in winter and 72 9 mm in summer precipitation free periods are qualified extreme after 17 days in winter and 15 days in summer for the monitoring period 2010 2018 in weberstedt the mean annual precipitation was 580 mm and the mean air temperature was 9 1 c the growing season lasted for an average of 237 d from 23 march to 14 november thus the period 1 november to 31 october was set as the hydrological year for data analysis the cwbcum same period not shown shows a negative temporal trend reflecting synclineward water scarcity in weberstedt adding the average surplus median 33 2003 2006 of daily precipitation that kammerforst receives in comparison to weberstedt led to a slight positive trend of the cwbcum not shown as expected for the hilltop areas this site correction

reached between march and april and lowstands occur between october and december fig 3 b the highest annual heads correspond to snowmelts or heavy rain events and pronounced head fluctuations occur in winter the fluctuation magnitudes increase from the summit shoulder to the midslope and footslope and range between a few decimeters and more than 25 m per high flow event or seasonal maximum fig 3 b rare saturation in shoulder wells are related to snowmelts spring 2013 fig 3 b or subsequent wet periods midslope wells are highly responsive although the lower motk well lacks responses to summer events midslope to footslope wells exhibited an 8 year maximum in 2013 after multiple snowmelts followed by heavy rains in may in contrast to the pronounced highstands in 2011 not shown and 2018 the 2013 period resulted in an extreme duration of surplus subsequently fast responses to rain events occurred in summer and during the beginning dormancy period the multi depth head monitoring fig 4 revealed a stacking of water unsaturated and saturated zones and covered one seasonal highstand between sites and depths or perched and phreatic groundwater respectively head responses to event scale and seasonal forcings showed different timing besides responsive fluctuation we observed head reversals i e heads of deeper measurement points exceed heads of shallower points in midslope to footslope

30 m bgl and upper midslope wells 20 50 m bgl show only minor variation 0 1 k and cumulative responses that cause seasonal cooling trends fig 6 b contrastingly the lower midslope motk well shows pronounced step shaped temperature increases 0 3 k with commencing head rises fig 6 c at the footslope minimal fluctuations were recorded 0 15 k 88 m bgl motk 0 10 k 69 m bgl mom and 0 05 k 50 m bgl while most shallow wells show no trends the shallow midslope wells show minima in 2014 the deep lower midslope and footslope wells show a lasting cooling 0 1 0 2 k since 2015 fig 6 d generally the rarity of high frequent or strong temperature fluctuations indicate nearly given groundwater bedrock thermal equilibria however the measurement resolution of our recording devices was generally appropriate for distinguishing surface subsurface signal origin summit to midslope domains exhibit synchronous decreases that propagate down to 50 m depth here cold season infiltrating waters keep the contrast even if weak summer events scarcely result in synchronous warming in summit wells in midslope to footslope positions synchronous increases strongly indicate ascending waters for the deepest footslope well temperature recordings were not sufficient for tracing multi directional exchange due to diminished differences in that depth here the cooling trend since 2015 3 2 2 2 hydrochemical

water type from ca mg hco3 to mg ca hco3 the footslope motk well h51 shows distinct maxima of so4 2 cl ca sr and low si and k concentrations the synclineward mom wells are high in na mg k si low in do no3 and show moderate cl concentrations statistically significant fluctuations of basic quality parameters as environmental tracers are classified in the response matrix fig 7 in perched shallow groundwater mainly simple but also dual event scale responses are contained in the continuous record the latter indicate piston like replacement of warmer higher mineralized and oxygen depleted pre event water do ec fig 6 a by infiltration recharge in continuous data of the deeper perched water fig 6 b only simple event scale responses of environmental tracers were recorded in discrete data within the phreatic zone fluctuations cover simple responses to cumulating hydrographs highlighting rather seasonal fluctuation fig 6 c and simple responses to single event peaks fig 6 d if resolved 4 discussion 4 1 the hillslope hydrogeological functioning 4 1 1 the upper muschelkalk flow system the overall head and quality fluctuations showing a strong annual seasonality with response times 5 months characterize the mo strata as responsive and demonstrate the meteoric control infiltration recharge in the topographic high not contradictorily mo strata also represent a retarded flow system white 1969 due to missing conduit flow phenomena that otherwise would cause multiple event scale responses as evident from drilling kohlhepp et al 2017 the hillslope setting of limestone mudstone alternations is lacking epikarst being typical for massive carbonates such a highly karstified zone is usually absent in intrastratal karst and mixed sequences klimchouk 2004 in comparison to the low matrix permeabilities of tight mo rocks bulk permeabilities show that fractures do importantly contribute to fluid flow in the motk limestones flow likely occurs preferentially in partially widened even breccia like networks of fractures kohlhepp et al 2017 in the tight mom mudstones and calcimudstones considerable part of the flow is restricted to thinner and lesser connected fractures all hydrographs are lacking instantaneous peaks obviously event scale pressure transfer lischeid et al 2002 is a negligible phenomenon most likely due to high hydraulic diffusivity of carbonate rocks mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 despite the presence of argillaceous strata thus even high soil rock moisture and larger perched groundwater bodies in winter does not impede aeration zone ventilation at the lower midslope where surface flow in intermittent creeks occurs the shallow groundwater thermographs are lacking short term fluctuations and mostly reflect seasonal conductive warming cooling thus multi directional exchange between groundwater and surface water typical for hyporheic zones schmidt and hahn 2012 is at best minor and retarded around the small creeks 4 1 2 atmospheric forcing and the role of surface subsurface extremes snowmelts and subsequent rain events in winter cause maxima of groundwater levels and thus of recharge missing responses to precipitation events e g in oct nov 2015 and delayed maxima highlight the role of antecedent soil moisture and indicate the dominance of diffuse recharge summer responses also depend on antecedent saturation of the aeration zone in general percolation flux to the aquifers decreases during the growing season cwbcum minima monotonic recessions due to higher evapotranspiration losses thus the dormancy period plays a crucial role for groundwater recharge among the surface signals weather signals comprise multiple snowmelts heavy rainstorms wet periods e g anomalous wet may 2013 and precipitation free periods e g spring 2018 the extreme highstands and surplus period after the snowmelt rich spring 2013 demonstrate that episodic events strongly contribute to groundwater highstands and budget subsequently seasonally filled soil storages likely favor recharge even from minor input regarding the anomalous wet seasons in summer 2014 fig 3 a precipitation extremes however do not necessarily enhance infiltration recharge they contribute to the climatic water balance and thus mainly to winter recharge thus multiple snowmelt events most effectively recharge groundwater resources the pronounced surplus period also lastingly prevented levels to drop to minima despite the minimum precipitation in 2015 the driest and warmest calendar year 2018 was remarkably accompanied by 5 to 8 year highstands fig 3 a here groundwater quantity drew on the antecedent wet winter as well however we cannot exclude severe effects for matter quality and exchange throughout the aeration zone the 85 year precipitation record kammerforst showed a trend for increasing winter precipitation and a tendency for decreasing summer precipitation not shown that coincides with climatic studies for central and northern europe beniston et al 2007 because of predominantly winter timed recharge groundwater renewal in the hillslope system might be lesser threatened by these effects of climate change a warming trend may generally increase number of mid winter melts allen et al 2010 however earlier and reduced melts along with reduced summer precipitation may contrarily result in extended recession periods and pronounced low stands eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 allen et al 2010 subsurface extremes fig 3 b accompanied by phases of pronounced highstands or lowstands represent episodic but lasting conditions whereas the aeration zone consequently undergoes harsh environmental changes in terms of water saturation and connectivity the phreatic zone keeps saturated however severely changed heads and thus flow patterns may have also strong impacts for the subsurface ecosystems one example is the lasting impact on the phreatic zone temperatures following the extreme recharge in 2013 14 4 1 3 the topographic high s flow regime overall hco3 type groundwaters characterize a shallow local recharge discharge system mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 water rock interaction indicators e g sr mg ca ratio table 1 point to increasing flow distances or residence times respectively along the transect h1 h5 and between the contrasting strata mom motk continuously recorded ec25 increases revealed surface input in uphill areas but ascending input in footslope domains the simulated pco2 values for the shallow summit well indicate loading in percolated soil and the dominance of diffuse infiltration recharge in the shallow lower midslope high co2 originate rather from microbial cycling in low permeable saturated overburden cf schwab et al 2019 during the summer halfs our transect area generally represent a groundwater recharge area that is widely dominated by descending and downdip or sub lateral flow fig 8 fast rises and slower recessions of hydraulic heads confirm a low permeability fracture network in the upslope aeration zone the frequent level fluctuations coincide with the moderate bulk permeability and low storage coefficients not shown or both sauter 1995 responding with stronger but still short lived peaks to weather events the upper midslope mom well shows its larger contribution area enhanced surface connection and low transmissivity and minimal storativity highest amplitudes of level fluctuation in midslope footslope wells are due to the larger contribution areas resulting in higher groundwater supply and head built up comparatively slow rises are related to higher permeabilities and flow distances slow recessions likely represent regional back flooding and thus point to the permeability barrier for the deepest motk well h51 highest permeability and upward leakage was evident from its necessity for drawdown curve fitting in the footslope domains the motk represents a productive aquifer synclinewards buried and less altered mudstones however contain fine fractures lazar et al 2019 that may even be more permeable than the upslope weathering remains and thus do less impede cross stratal exchange if assuming purely stratiform flow from outcropping high permeability strata i e screen sections to buried footslope domains travel times based on hydraulic gradients see fig 5 b and the permeability data fig 5 c would cause 30 fold higher theoretical time lags for hydrograph responses in turn generally low swcc lag times demonstrate that considerable cross stratal e g vertical flow and recharge occur in the limestone mudstone alternations however in the upslope aeration zone diffuse infiltration feed high permeability strata that store and transmit perched groundwater as indicated by event scale level fluctuations fig 8 a mudstone strata being dense de lithified and plastic here apparently lack fractures thus downdip stratiform flow is likely favored and even produces episodic rushing noise in shoulder wells fast level rises and slower recessions also indicate back flooding likely due to exceedance of vertical and downdip percolation capacity under locally low hydraulic gradients the perched water bodies exist permanently or temporally in the uphill aeration zone yet they seem to be rather patchy and discontinuous in space in the phreatic zone the flow regime fig 8 is subject to gravity driven flow comprising synclineward vertically converging flow as shown by the head reversals fig 4 the conceptual permeability barrier treffurt 1982 fig 1 b c that is characterized by reported lower permeabilities beyond i e lacking productive groundwater resources is however not necessarily the cause for groundwater rise and discharge both the current sub regional flow regime and its developed hydrofacies zonation rather originate from self organization of subsurface flow tóth 1999 and the geologic agency tóth 1995 of groundwater the latter decreases synclinewards due to higher mineralization and additionally reduced flow and thus bequeathed less weathered or karstified strata in the syncline center 4 2 transient patterns of multi directional flow and matter exchange continuous do recordings indicate loading by descending waters at summit fig 3 b and shallow midslope low loaded event waters e g h2 table 1 indicate locally fast bypass flow without pronounced solute redistribution in the aeration zone of the slope shoulder however during seasonal or episodic infiltration recharge perched water bodies form or expand in the aeration zone that fluctuate in the stratiform and or vertical direction fig 8 a those conditions of multi directional flow can efficiently connect neighboring parts of the aeration zone upwelling waters or higher heads would generally allow for mobile matter to be supplied in low permeable also bypassed rock limestone matrices mudstones thus aerated hanging strata likely receive matter input during highstands while laying strata may receive lasting drainage during subsequent recessions in the deep lower midslope well do logging strongly indicated loading by ascending thus mm waters seasonal and episodical abrupt warming and synchronous increases in sulfate indicate ascending flow from laying strata too here in the saturated zone the motk receives oxygen during progressed seasonal highstands fig 8 c the same applies for midslope well h31 during highstand maxima not shown noteworthy dissolved oxygen as surface sourced matter can thus be supplied to oxygen deficient domains by ascending waters that bypassed the tighter oxygen deficient overburden at the lower footslope do is lacking in the continuous record here increases of ca2 sr2 so4 2 and cl point to ascending mm groundwaters decreasing cl responses in h52 i e dilution might additionally point to ultrafiltration of laying percolated argillaceous beds membranes tóth 1999 leading to ion enrichment in single strata interestingly lacking cl input from mm waters to h41 point to depletion due likely to the completed dissolution of mm evaporites in this area agricultural sourced nitrate is transported by descending waters at the upper midslope but likely also by ascending waters in the deep lower midslope higher na concentrations in h4 h5 mom waters and lower levels of ca2 compared to motk point also to ion exchange tóth 1999 on clay mineral rich strata during cross stratal exchange or residence authigenic boron negligible in upslope domains is elevated in footslope mo strata and seasonal decreases also indicate ascending mm waters barium is another likewise conditional indicator of cross stratal exchange it increases in h41 h51 due to input from laying strata and decreases in h52 h53 due to export by ascending flow thus loading by mm waters but also locally high concentrations in mom especially in the upper midslope occur lower silicon concentrations also characterize ascending mm waters in contrast to mom strata due likely to faster passage the aberrant strong level rises of the upper midslope motk well e g autumn 2013 that are accompanied by abrupt strong increases in do no3 and drops in ca so4 2 pco2 may point to extreme event activation of upslope karst input features or abrupt onset of ascending flow due to filled storages in laying strata typical indicators for flow variation in carbonate rocks like carbon parameters and turbidity cf white 2015 pronk et al 2009 were shown to be not suited to understand our retarded flow system due to non significant responses stable isotopes of h2o 18o 2d not shown in this study do not significantly differ between groundwater surface waters and precipitation they are thus irrelevant for the exploration of flow dynamics far above the phreatic surface or of shallow groundwater that is of meteoric dominated origin contrastingly our results demonstrate that large suites of complementary environmental tracers are necessary to reveal cross stratal exchange and multidirectional flow patterns within sub regional flow systems and particularly within mixed lithologies the exploitability of temperature signals and responses that was limited in the deep phreatic zone could be increased by high spatial resolution fibre sensor measurements for continuous tracing of fluid migration 4 2 1 groundwater mounding boosts shallow flow paths taken together the environmental time series environmental tracers and multi depth head measurements further allow for the reconstruction of transient flow patterns within the aeration and phreatic zone different timing of multi depth head responses and lacking responses in superimposed screen sections to sampling induced drawdowns h4 5 point to a rather slow hydraulic equilibration within the stratified but hydraulically continuous bedrock in the phreatic zone thus in the aeration zone we assume downdip runoff in sloping high permeable strata to cause localized recharge and concomitant groundwater mounding such mounds modify the local to sub regional flow patterns fig 8 c as groundwater circulation in short local paths relatively increase with an elevated relief of the phreatic surface goderniaux et al 2013 consequently recharge discharge areas expand or contract seasonally as multiply evidenced by the head reversals and cross stratal breakthrough of matter for instance the oxygenation of the main aquifer by ascending waters the phreatic zone also undergoes transient variation of flow directions and flow intensity 4 3 compartmentalization and nutritional supply of the subsurface ecosystem beneath the topographic high of the hainich low mountain range the important recharge area of downslope used groundwater resources we identified a typically large aeration zone the pronounced stacking of saturated perched and unsaturated zones from summit to midslope positions the configuration of sloping bedrock strata and multi directional flow dynamics both in the aeration zone and phreatic zone jointly control the nutritional supply and exchange between subsurface ecosystems this consequently cause a compartmentalization of the hillslope subsurface regarding surface sourced input and subsurface re distribution we can distinguish different degrees of nutritional supply or isolation see fig 8 c respectively high isolation can be expected in i parts of the aeration zone that are bypassed and not regularly connected by water flow furthermore high isolation is given in saturated zones that only receive cross stratal fluid flow that was filtered by ii thick hanging e g h42 3 or iii laying sequences e g h53 for such isolated although shallow domains schwab et al 2019 recently found that groundwater dispersed microbes also utilize sedimentary carbon and that autotrophic lifestyle is even common due likely to limited input of fresh organic matter except for the shallowest summit wells that show elevated organic carbon table 1 in groundwater neither surface origin nor event scale subsurface exchange was indicated by time series of carbon sums due to non significant fluctuation at the upper midslope the shallow well receive more oxygen and nitrate table 1 fig 3 c by descending waters than the shallow wells of summit or lower midslope here favorable strata lithology weathering fracturing and karst input features likely enhance the surface connection generally higher but variable transfer of surface sourced nutrients takes place in high permeable strata e g motk both in perched water bodies within the aeration zone and in phreatic regions that undergo pronounced cross stratal exchange here the ascend of oxygenated waters into oxygen deficient regions that rather receive only cycled or filtered input during recession periods highlight the interplay of aeration zone dynamics and phreatic flow for the evolution of groundwater quality likewise subsurface sourced sulfate fig 6 c d and surface sourced nitrate not shown can enter the groundwater bodies by ascending flow rather than by downward percolation limited oxygen and nitrate in descending waters is likely caused by microbial turnover accordingly herrmann et al 2017 found diverse denitrifier communities in the hainich groundwater with higher potentials for heterotrophic nitrate reduction in the trochitenkalk fm and high autotrophic potential in groundwater of the tighter hanging strata for the latter kumar et al 2017 reported high anammox activity from anoxically incubated groundwater consequently the hillslope configuration of bedrock and flow exhibit an intrinsic protection against agricultural loading from the footslope cropland because of even adverse aspects nitrate loading by cross stratal exchange the quality of the main aquifer benefit from solely forestry use in the upslope areas for the main aquifer nawaz et al 2018 identified a fungal core genus that also cover potential plant pathogens and thus confirmed a higher surface connectivity independently of our presented flow patterns 5 conclusions our study illustrates the immense value of multi depth exploration and long time series of basic environmental data for elucidating the scarcely addressed role of multi directional flow phenomena beneath topographic highs we improved the understanding of the local muschelkalk flow system mainly by exploring the high responsivity of perched and phreatic groundwater bodies and their groundwater quality to atmospheric forcing and by demonstrating the overall cross stratal exchange and the functional differences of argillaceous strata along a hillslope setting for the first time noteworthy the hillslope interplay of aeration zone dynamics and flow paths of variable temporal activity in the phreatic zone was found to reduce the isolating or protective cover of thick argillaceous strata thus increasing the intrinsic vulnerability and resulted in supply of even deep regions by surface sourced matter regarding limestone mudstone alternations representing a widely distributed bedrock type that hosts important groundwater resources we can conclude multi directional flow phenomena are intrinsic features within multi strata hillslope settings phenomena like expansion contraction of perched groundwater in the aeration zone and transient cross stratal exchange through low permeability strata aquitards in the phreatic zone interact and shape the quality of groundwater resources the hillslope configuration of sloping strata facilitates the formation of discontinuous perched groundwater bodies and of a multiply zoned aeration zone episodic and seasonal multi directional fluid flow patterns and transport contribute both to ecosystem compartmentalization and to the nutritional supply and exchange between subsurface ecosystems the developed scheme for exploratory time series analysis response classification and response matrix helps to systematically exploit indispensable basic and dis continuous groundwater quality data for hydrogeological site investigations in mixed lithologies we suggest large sets of conditional tracers including authigenic signals are required i to explore cross compartment exchange and thus ii to determine the hydrogeological functions of argillaceous strata due to superimposing signals of surface and subsurface origins continuous recording of groundwater quality parameters is generally required for the retrieval of response characteristics of episodic forcings whereas discrete data for instance on a monthly cycle is appropriate for identifying seasonal quality variation in comparable retarded flow systems the extent of matter re distribution by multi directional flow phenomena within topographic highs including dispersal of organisms should be further investigated in detail attributing the microbial diversity of groundwater resources solely on fluid habitat properties i e from single aquifers disregarding cross stratal import export of both microbes and nutrients hampers the predictability for instance of ecosystem services we thus suggest to carefully consider the hillslope multi directional flow and matter

id 83201 united states this manuscript was handled by huaming guo editor in chief with the assistance of seong taek yun associate editor groundwater geochemistry and 87sr 86sr from spring waters in the spring mountains nv were used to understand how groundwater recharging in the spring mountains influences regional groundwater flow in the death valley regional flow system dvrfs previous researchers hypothesized that groundwater from the spring mountains contributes to the dvrfs an interbasin groundwater flow system igf however the spring mountains are geologically heterogeneous therefore a uniform contribution of groundwater flow across the range is unlikely here we use spring water geochemistry spring water and host rock 87sr 86sr and observations of the surrounding geology to determine what regions of the spring mountains are likely to contribute more flow to the dvrfs based on geochemical and isotopic evidence spring mountains groundwater can be divided into three flow regions with distinct geochemical signals reflecting silicate or carbonate water rock interactions and location relative to major thrust faults the keystone thrust flow region kst has a 87sr 86sr of 0 710 0 711 is recharged by both rain and snow and weathers both mesozoic sandstones and permian and cambrian carbonate central spring mountains csm groundwater has a 87sr 86sr of 0 708 is primarily recharged by snow and weathers permian and cambrian limestones and dolostones the montgomery hills mh flow region has a 87sr 86sr 0 711 0 733 is recharged by both rain and snow and weathers both permian and cambrian carbonates and precambrian siliciclastics groundwater mixing between flow groups occurs along major thrust faults in the study area as evidenced by 87sr 86sr signatures that reflect one flow group and δ18o and δ2h and geochemical signatures that reflect another flow group the combination of geochemical and isotopic results suggest csm groundwater is the most likely to reach death valley because csm groundwater composition reflects the geochemical and isotopic signatures of the highly permeable rocks that connect the spring mountains to death valley flow leaving the

is well established frisbee et al 2016 genereux et al 2013 2002 pacheco 2015 stewart maddox et al 2018 tóth 1999 1995 1963 igf occurs when groundwater flow crosses surface water drainage divides and discharges in an adjacent topographic basin although sedimentary bedrock may be naturally conducive to the occurrence of igf frisbee et al 2016 stewart maddox et al 2018 it can occur in different geologic settings for example igf was observed in watersheds underlain by volcanic bedrock in costa rica genereux et al 2013 2002 in volcanic volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks of the lower rio grande valley in new mexico langman and ellis 2010 and in quaternary sediments in denmark danapour et al 2019 local and intermediate scale flowpaths are interpreted to contribute to regional groundwater flow systems through large faults and contact zones pacheco and van der weijden 2014a recent studies identify igf as an integral component of the death valley regional flow system dvrfs in the deserts of southern nevada and eastern california anderson et al 2006 belcher and sweetkind 2010 nelson et al 2004 nelson and mayo 2014 stetzenbach et al 1999 thomas et al 2013 the dvrfs is an extensive and complex regional set of aquifers in southern nevada and southeastern california belcher and sweetkind 2010 groundwater in the dvrfs is recharged at high elevations in the spring mountains and other central and southern nevada uplands pahranagat range sheep range quinn canyon range etc and supplies flow to high discharge springs in desert basins such as death valley and amargosa valley belcher et al 2009 bushman et al 2010 thomas et al 2013 understanding the magnitude and geographic extent of igf connectivity and spring permanence is important for groundwater management and planning belcher et al 2009 particularly in the arid southwest where high temperatures and low annual recharge limit the presence of surface water additionally climate change is altering recharge patterns in arid regions akiyama et al 2018 love and zdon 2018 mckenna and sala 2018 recharge to the dvrfs is expected to decrease meixner et al 2016 yet desert communities and groundwater dependent ecosystems rely on groundwater as the primary sometimes only source of perennial freshwater klausmeyer et al 2018 patten et al 2008 despite the importance of groundwater in the region the contributing areas to and groundwater fluxes in the dvrfs are still debated anderson et al 2006 belcher et al 2009 belcher and sweetkind 2010 burbey 1997 bushman et al 2010 d agnese et al 1998 hevesi et al 2003 research in the dvrfs region has utilized water chemistry isotopes and various modeling techniques to quantify and delineate groundwater flowpaths that contribute to basin springs as part of the large igf network belcher and sweetkind 2010 bushman et al 2010 peterman et al 1992 thomas et al 2013 ye et al 2016 the spring mountains are the highest range in the dvrfs and receive a relatively large annual precipitation from both winter snow and summer rainfall winograd et al 1998 the spring mountains receive substantial modern recharge that supplements the paleorecharge in storage hershey et al 2016 and provides hydraulic forcing necessary for sustaining flow in the dvrfs indeed previous studies indicate that the spring mountains nv are one of the greatest sources of recharge in the dvrfs belcher et al 2009 belcher and sweetkind 2010 bushman et al 2010 hevesi et al 2003 larsen et al 2001 stetzenbach et al 1999 thomas et al 2013 tiedeman et al

dvrfs are scarce and often lack incorporation of structural controls and applications of environmental tracers which can be used to infer connectivity of flowpaths hershey 1989 hershey et al 2016 hughes 1966 in this study spring mountains groundwater was evaluated as a contributing influence to the dvrfs by use of water stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h general geochemistry and 87sr 86sr of spring water and rock units thought to host flowpaths measured at twelve springs along with observations from published geologic maps and cross sections specifically this project aims to 1 identify recharge areas and potential mixing between groundwater regions 2 characterize the geochemistry of spring mountains springs 3 understand the influence of geology on groundwater flow and 4 identify the region of spring mountains most likely to contribute groundwater to the dvrfs 2 study area the spring mountains are a northwest southeast trending mountain belt in southwestern nevada between the cities of las vegas nv and pahrump nv fig 1 the mountain belt lies in the southern great basin physiographic province and spans more than 80 km in length with over 2200 km2 of mountainous terrain the spring mountains are the highest mountain range in southern nevada mt charleston 3632 masl and exhibit significant relief from adjacent basins pahrump 800 masl las vegas 600 masl 2 1 climate and precipitation the large relief of the spring mountains causes climate patterns to vary with elevation alluvial valleys are arid lowland deserts while high elevations have a climate similar to an alpine tundra hershey 1989 the spring mountains receive significant recharge despite their location in the rain shadow of the sierra nevada hevesi et al 2003 average annual precipitation ranges from 20 cm in the foothills up to greater than 70 cm at mountain crests moreo et al 2014 winograd et al 1998 winograd and thordarson 1975 winograd et al 1998 classify precipitation events into two types 1 low pressure winter storms that originate over the pacific ocean and 2 short and intense summer storms that originate from the gulf of california and the gulf of mexico stable isotope evidence from prior studies springer et al 2016 winograd et al 1998 suggests that both summer and winter storms contribute to groundwater flow however late spring snowmelt constitutes the greatest proportion 90 percent of recharge mean annual air temperatures are also variable particularly across the elevation gradient of the spring mountains the average annual temperature at lee canyon from 2009 to 2017 2414 m was 9 5 c noaa ncdc 2019 in the adjacent southwest basin the average annual temperature of pahrump is 17 3 c with summer highs approaching 40 c noaa ncdc 2019 consequently vegetation also varies with elevation moreo et al 2014 at low elevations desert shrubs dominate the environment as elevation increases vegetation transitions to a juniper pinyon woodland environment and eventually to a coniferous forest and alpine tundra hershey 1989 spring mountains groundwater is an important water resource for local communities and ecosystems and provides freshwater to the nearby cities of las vegas nv las vegas valley water district 2018 and pahrump nv harrill 1986 nye county water district 2018 rainfall and surface water are limited in the southern great basin therefore desert ecosystems are dependent on a stable discharge of groundwater as a reliable source of freshwater indeed spring mountains springs host highly productive groundwater dependent ecosystems kreamer et al 2015 in addition to recharging the underlying aquifer and supplying local springs with groundwater flow the spring mountains conduct mountain front recharge to the basinal aquifer systems to the east and southwest harrill 1986 morgan and dettinger 1994 2 2 geology the spring mountains comprise a sequence of sedimentary strata deposited upon the paleozoic passive margin of western north america these strata have since been displaced by thrust and normal faults uplifted and deeply eroded exposing the regional carbonate aquifer that underlies much of the southern great basin figs 1 and 2 from northwest to southeast strata transition up section from precambrian siliciclastic rocks to paleozoic dolostone and limestone to mesozoic sandstones the sevier orogeny generated folds and northeast southwest trending thrust faults namely the keystone thrust lee canyon thrust and the wheeler pass thrust burchfiel et al 1974 basin and range extension caused northwest southeast trending normal faults to cut existing thrust faults page et al 2005 four major rock types dominate the spring mountains sandstone limestone dolostone and siliciclastic rocks table 3 mesozoic sandstones are present in the eastern spring mountains near the keystone thrust kst and are the youngest rocks in the mountain belt in addition to sandstone evaporite lenses found in mesozoic units are observed to influence groundwater geochemistry where present hershey 1989 limestone and dolostone are abundant at the highest elevations in the central spring mountains csm typically limestone units are younger than down section dolostone units the bird spring formation is commonly surficiallyexposed in the csm and has a maximum exposed thickness of 2355 m suggesting its importance for recharging groundwater page et al 2005 the northwest spring mountains referred to as the montgomery hills mh comprise the oldest rocks in the mountain belt and are located northwest of the wheeler pass thrust the montgomery hills are predominately quartzite but also include siltstone sandstone shale and minor dolostone and limestone beds rocks in the montgomery hills are commonly brecciated two major thrust faults separate the three primary rock regions fig 2 the keystone thrust fault located in the southeastern spring mountains occurs at the contact between the aztec sandstone ja and the bonanza king dolostone cbk there permian and cambrian dolostone and limestone are thrust atop mesozoic sandstones the wheeler pass thrust fault located in the northwest spring mountains places the stirling quartzite zs atop the bird springs formation pmb and marks the stratigraphic transition from permian carbonate to cambrian and precambrian siliciclastic rocks similarly numerous thrust faults such as the lee canyon thrust cut the csm but do not displace different rock types 3 methods observations from geologic maps were combined with strontium isotopes and spring geochemistry and water isotope data to predict groundwater flowpaths for twelve springs and to infer groundwater flow in the rest of the spring mountains geologic structures are important controls on groundwater flow both within the dvrfs al qudah et al 2017 belcher and sweetkind 2010 d agnese et al 1998 and globally dimmen et al 2017 seymour et al 2008 vittecoq et al 2015 in fact dvrfs spring emergences are highly correlated to structural features geologic maps page et al 2005 workman et al 2016 were used to identify structural features and changes in rock types springs along pervasive thrust faults in the spring mountains were used to study how groundwater composition evolves along thrust faults and differs between regions in addition potentiometric surface maps displayed on fig 1 d agnese et al 1998 were used to infer groundwater flow direction dissolved strontium and strontium isotope ratios 87sr 86sr along with general geochemistry are commonly used to better understand potential groundwater flowpaths blum et al 1993 clow et al 1997 négrel et al 2018 pacheco and van der weijden 2014b pu et al 2012 stevenson et al 2018 stewart maddox et al 2018 zieliński et al 2017 as water flows through rocks and soils it accumulates dissolved strontium the 87sr 86sr of the resulting water is a product of the initial 87sr 86sr of the water and the 87sr 86sr of material weathered along the flowpath differences in 87sr 86sr can be attributed to exposure to different mineral sources or to mixing between multiple water types if sources with distinguishable 87sr 86sr exist derivation of flowpaths from 87sr 86sr is limited by the extent of known 87sr 86sr in potential flowpath geology paces et al 2007 we used published 87sr 86sr values from spring mountains units the strontium sea water curve and rock age and leaching experiments from outcrop samples to better constrain the range of potential 87sr 86sr and predict groundwater flowpaths spring geochemistry can also be used to estimate weathering patterns and to predict groundwater flowpaths blum et al 1998 garrels and mackenzie 1967 johnson et al 2000 pretti and stewart 2002 rademacher et al 2001 determining the amount of material weathered in carbonate and dolostone systems such as the spring mountains is difficult because calcite reaches saturation quickly and is easily precipitated however spring geochemistry can be used to identify the weathering of silicate minerals in addition to limestone blum et al 1998 jacobson et al 2002 δ18o and δ2h can be used to estimate the fraction of recharge from snow and to identify different recharge elevations beria et al 2018 penna et al 2014 winograd et al 1998 we used δ18o and δ2h to better constrain potential flowpaths inferred from 87sr 86sr and spring geochemistry 3 1 sampling procedures and analyses spring water samples were collected from eight spring mountains springs in march of 2016 four additional springs were added to increase spatial resolution in july 2017 may 2018 and july 2018 samples were collected using a geotech peristaltic pump with masterflex platinum cured silicone tubing positioned at the spring source or uppermost discharge location field temperature measurements were collected at each spring source whereas ph and conductivity were determined at the new mexico bureau of geology mineral resources analytical chemistry laboratory table 1 at each spring samples for cation and anion analysis were filtered with 0 22 µm polyethersulfone membrane sterivex gp pressure filters and collected in 250 ml high density polyethylene bottles hdpe water to be analyzed for 87sr 86sr was filtered and collected in 125 ml hdpe bottles water δ18o and δ2h samples were collected in 2 ml glass vials with no head space general chemistry and δ18o and δ2h samples were stored cold and all samples were shipped to an analytical lab within six months strontium isotope samples were analyzed at university of illinois urbana champaign using a nu plasma hr multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer stable isotope samples were analyzed at the university of california davis stable isotope facility for δ18o and δ2h using a continuous flow isotope mass spectrometer major cations were measured using an icp oes according to epa method 200 7 and major anions were measured using an ic according to epa method 300 0 at the new mexico bureau of geology mineral resources analytical chemistry laboratory general chemistry 87sr 86sr and water δ18o and δ2h values are reported in table 2 3 2 rock leaching experiments 87sr 86sr as a geochemical tracer rock 87sr 86sr were collected throughout the spring mountains and compared to groundwater 87sr 86sr to better understand rock weathering and groundwater flowpaths however prior to this study only a subset of rocks present in the spring mountains had published 87sr 86sr values paces et al 2007 to fill this gap eighteen total rock samples were selected from sixteen geologic units hypothesized to be significant to groundwater flow based on published cross sections page et al 2005 and dvrfs characterization belcher and sweetkind 2010 rock samples were collected from outcrops in the spring mountains in march 2018 geologic maps by page et al 2005 and workman et al 2016 were used to determine sample locations for each of the sixteen units fresh rock samples typically about 1000 cm3 were collected from each outcrop 87sr 86sr values were determined from leachate water using methods adapted from frisbee et al 2017 rock samples were crushed and sieved with a 0 4 size sieve 4 76 mm at purdue university for each geologic unit 200 mg of crushed rock was added to a 1 l hdpe bottle with deionized water the bottles were capped tightly sealed with electrical tape and stored for 2 months in the laboratory after the allotted time samples were decanted and analyzed at the icmps facility at university of illinois urbana champaign rock leaching results are reported with previously published 87sr 86sr values in table 3 leaching with deionized water provides information on the most easily released sources of strontium in the host rocks however by crushing the rock we aim to increase the mineral surface area and enhance weathering of the more resistant minerals one shortcoming of this technique is that water is essentially stagnant in the bottle unless the bottle is occasionally agitated and does not represent natural conditions where solutes are transported away from the mineral surface by flowing water the paces et al 2007 methodology included powdering whole rocks and leaching them in dilute hydrochloric acid these methods may give slightly different results since there is heterogeneity within the mineralogy of a rock sample and because hydrochloric acid aggressively weathers a broader assemblage of minerals compared to deionized water 3 3 spring mountains recharge spring water δ18o values were utilized to determine the relative importance of snow and rain to groundwater recharge in the study area genereux 1998 liu et al 2004 winograd et al 1998 δ18o values of rain and snow reported in winograd et al 1998 were used to create a weighted average for each precipitation type the calculation only sourced δ18o from winograd et al 1998 because other spring mountains stable isotope studies do not report amount of precipitation for each δ18o observation the fraction of recharge from snow was computed using eq 1 where δ 18 o spring is the measured δ 18 o value for spring water δ 18 o rain is the weighted mean of rain δ 18 o observations and δ 18 o snow is the weighted mean of snow δ 18 o observations from 88 observations of rain n 41 or snow n 47 collected between 1975 and 1978 and 1987 to 1988 winograd et al 1998 eq 1 is a two endmember mixing model that assumes δ18o of snowmelt and rainfall are the only sources of δ18o influencing discharging groundwater beria et al 2018 penna et al 2014 winograd et al 1998 1 f snow δ 18 o spring δ 18 o rain δ 18 o snow δ 18 o rain the certainty of the calculated fraction of recharge from snow is limited by the incomplete precipitation record throughout a nonconsecutive six year period winograd et al 1998 which may bias endmembers isotopes of precipitation vary from storm to storm and from year to year dansgaard 1964 thus increasing the potential for uncertainty due to the incomplete precipitation record in addition rain data were collected at three locations and snow data were collected at five locations limiting the spatial coverage of the record discharging spring water is likely not fully represented by recharge during the six years that data are available for example springer et al 2016 reported stable isotope samples collected from 2011 to 2012 for many of the same springs sampled by hershey 1989 from 1985 to 1987 which are on average 0 61 greater for δ18o and 1 34 greater for δ2h 24 27 years later uncertainty in the fraction of recharge from snow is further increased by the limited spatial extent of sample collection instances of percent snow values greater than 100 are likely due to spatiotemporal limitations of the record used to define endmembers 4 results 4 1 stable isotope observations spring water δ18o and δ2h range from 12 06 to 13 71 0 08 and 86 6 to 99 1 0 83 respectively table 2 fig 3 winograd et al 1998 and hershey 1989 collected rain and snow within the spring mountains for multiple seasons between 1975 and 1988 and our spring water δ18o and δ2h values fall within the historical range for those studies fig 3 δ18o values of rain and snow reported in winograd et al 1998 were used to calculate a weighted average δ18o for rain and snow and were combined with spring water δ18o values in eq 1 to calculate the percentage of recharge from snow for each spring the percentage of snow contributing to spring recharge ranges from 18 to 105 table 2 this estimate is limited by the unevenly distributed data over the 6 year period of record springs emerging along the kst have δ18o and δ2h values ranging between 12 74 and 12 06 0 08 and 92 4 and 86 6 0 83 respectively kst springs are isotopically heavier than the rest of sampled springs and receive between 18 and 54 of their recharge from snow based on 2 end member mixing calculations using snow and rainfall δ18o data from winograd et al 1998 springs discharging in the csm emerge at the highest elevations in the spring mountains and have relatively lighter δ18o and δ2h ranging between 13 71 and 13 18 0 08 and 99 1 4 and 92 9 0 83 respectively csm springs receive more than 77 of their recharge from snow based on mixing analysis using δ18o precipitation data from winograd et al 1998 springs in the mh flow region have intermediate δ18o and δ2h ranging between 13 45 and 13 1 0 08 and 95 2 and 91 9 0 83 respectively mh springs receive between 73 and 91 of their recharge from snow based on δ18o precipitation data from winograd et al 1998 4 2 spring geochemistry sampled spring waters were grouped according to their hydrochemical facies all springs in the study area are either ca hco3 or mg hco3 water fig 4 and are saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite generally the degree of saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite increases from the csm to mh to kst springs in this study exhibit a positive correlation between ca2 mg2 and so4 2 ½ hco3 and follow the expected geochemical trend for dedolomitization as distance from the recharge area increases fig 5 r2 0 989 raines and dewers 1997 dedolomitization occurs as groundwater weathers dolomite and gypsum 50 50 and subsequently supersaturates groundwater with calcite raines and dewers 1997 the mg2 ca2 of spring waters varies from 0 39 to 1 48 throughout the spring mountains high mg2 ca2 1 is more commonly observed in springs discharging at lower elevations below 1700 m and in springs with relatively warmer temperatures 15 c springs discharging along the kst in the southern spring mountains near mountain springs nv ies 001 and ies 002 fig 1 emerge from dolostone bonanza king and nopah formations and exhibit very high mg2 ca2 1 48 and 1 47 respectively springs discharging along the northern portion of the kst near red rock canyon national conservation area ies 063 and ies 065 have lower mg2 ca2 0 67 and 0 86 respectively mg2 ca2 in csm springs ranges from 0 39 0 92 and 0 89 1 14 in the mh spring temperature and mg2 ca2 are positively correlated r2 0 74 fig 6 b ies 001 ies 002 are not included in the temperature relationship as they discharge in low flow pools and have significant diurnal temperature signals the diurnal temperature signal was observed using a long term temperature logger with a sampling interval of 15 min in ies 002 although ies 001 did not have a logger in place it likely also exhibits diurnal temperature fluctuations because of the very low discharge 1 l s 1 in a shallow pool 4 3 strontium spring water and rock leaching experiment results spring water 87sr 86sr range from 0 70831 to 0 73314 0 00005 table 2 springs near the kst include ies 001 002 063 and 065 and their 87sr 86sr range between 0 71038 and 0 71115 0 00005 87sr 86sr data is not available for ies 065 at this time springs in the csm include ies 003 004 006 052 and 064 and have the lowest 87sr 86sr of all measured springs 0 70831 0 70879 0 00005 springs in the mh or northwest of the wheeler pass thrust fault include ies 005 007 and 008 and have a 87sr 86sr of 0 71102 0 73314 0 00005 the highest of all measured springs rock leaching 87sr 86sr range from 0 70823 to 0 72237 0 00005 table 3 we did not conduct leaching experiments on five units present in the spring mountains table 3 because the units are thin dsi dsu oe oes or only observed in the mh zs 87sr 86sr for these five units was supplemented by 87sr 86sr values from paces et al 2007 paces et al 2007 conducted multiple rock leaching experiments on rocks collected throughout southern nevada for many of the geologic units present in the spring mountains many of the rock leaching 87sr 86sr reported in paces et al 2007 were collected from outcrops containing units present in the spring mountains but were collected outside of the spring mountains in other areas of southern nevada 87sr 86sr from rock leaching experiments in our study are within the range of previously published rock leaching data for the same geologic units in the region fig 7 table 3 groundwater 87sr 86sr was compared to nearby rocks using the 87sr 86sr results from rock leaching experiments on spring mountains rocks the footwall of the kst comprises a sequence of mesozoic sandstones whereas the hanging wall is limestone and dolostone mesozoic sandstones in the footwall are the only rocks with 87sr 86sr greater than 0 710 present in the potential flowpaths of kst springs based on d agnese et al 1998 rocks in the hanging wall of the kst have 87sr 86sr of 0 70836 0 70935 0 00005 rocks in the csm are predominately younger limestone units atop older dolostone however thin quartzite beds are also rarely present dolostone and limestone 87sr 86sr in the csm range between 0 70823 and 0 71200 0 00005 only three bonanza king formation nopah formation and the pogonip group of fourteen csm units are greater than 0 70898 87sr 86sr of rocks in montgomery hills 0 71136 0 72237 0 00005 are the highest 87sr 86sr in the region for both rocks and water diagenetic fluids that previously circulated through rubidium rich rocks and deposited radiogenic strontium are likely the cause of the elevated 87sr 86sr present in the region paces et al 2007 5 discussion three distinct but connected flow regions exist in the spring mountains the kst the csm and the mh fig 8 the identification of flow regions is supported by evidence from 1 δ18o and δ2h 2 spring geochemistry and 3 comparison 87sr 86sr from spring water and rock leaching experiments to spring mountains geology 5 1 recharge patterns spring water δ18o and δ2h in the spring mountains vary because of differences in the dominant recharge source rain vs snow the sandstone cliffs in the footwall of the kst are at a lower elevation than mt charleston and thus receive a greater proportion of rain as a result δ18o and δ2h of precipitation along the wilson cliffs fig 1 is heavier than csm precipitation based on modeled spatial variations in isotope values of precipitation across the united states bowen 2019 bowen and revenaugh 2003 kst springs ies 001 ies 002 and ies 065 receive between 18 and 22 of recharge from snow kst spring ies 063 is located at a higher elevation than the southern kst springs ies 001 ies 002 and ies 065 and receives a greater proportion of recharge from snow 54 the relatively light stable isotopic signature of ies 063 suggests that the la madre fault may be a conduit for groundwater flow that is recharged at high elevations in the csm groundwater flows down gradient from the csm recharge area along the la madre fault before discharging at ies 063 d agnese et al 1998 rain recharging the kst also contributes to flow at ies 063 but with a smaller contribution than to southern springs the southern portion of the kst is at a lower elevation and potentiometric gradient and thus groundwater present has a greater potential to accumulate flow derived from rain as kst flowpath length increases springs along the kst are recharged by both rain falling over the sandstone cliffs and by rain and snow that recharges through limestone and dolostone present at higher elevations in the csm with the fraction of recharge by rain in the southern kst csm precipitation falls primarily as snow at high elevations such as mt charleston but also receives some summer rain as evident by the high fraction of recharge by snow 77 105 snowmelt in discharging springs spring waters in the csm are closest to δ18o and δ2h for historical snow observations compared to springs in the kst and mh hershey 1989 winograd et al 1998 fig 3 potentiometric contours developed by d agnese et al 1998 suggest that water recharged at high elevations around mt charleston flows downgradient toward ies springs thus suggesting a pathway for high fractions of snow recharge reaching springs at lower elevations mh δ18o and δ2h values suggest that mh groundwater is recharged by a mixture of rain in the mh and snow from the csm the fraction of recharge by snow 73 91 implies that recharge is primarily sourced from csm snow with a minor local recharge component from warmer lower elevation rains as distance from the csm increases the ratio of recharge by rain increases for example ies 005 has the greatest proportion of recharge by snow compared to ies 007 and 008 and is the closest spring to the csm in the mh flow region 5 2 groundwater weathering patterns and flow depth all springs in this study exhibit the geochemical signature expected for dedolomitization the ratio of the concentrations of ca2 mg2 to so4 2 ½ hco3 of approximately one which represents a 50 50 weathering of dolomite gypsum fig 5 raines and dewers 1997 the positive correlation slope 0 927 r2 0 989 between sampled spring geochemistry and the dedolomitization trend line suggests that all springs weather both dolomite and gypsum and subsequently precipitate calcite dolostone is not common in the mh or in the footwall of the kst but is found throughout the csm however the dedolomitization signature is observed throughout all of the spring mountains which indicates a hydrologic connection from the csm to the kst and mh mg2 ca2 can be used as a proxy for flow depth in the spring mountains because of the stratigraphic order of carbonates typically dolostones are present at depth and limestones near the surface higher ratios of mg2 ca2 indicate deeper flow and lower ratios indicate shallower flow mg2 ca2 values vary throughout the sampled spring mountains spring waters and are a function of both calcite precipitation and dolomite dissolution as recharging waters weather shallow limestone ca2 increases the water flows through deeper dolostones and continues to weather ca2 and mg2 until the water is saturated with respect to ca2 and calcite precipitation begins generally mg2 ca2 increases as spring elevation decreases because most high elevation springs emerge in limestone units that have limestone upgradient thus limiting the possibility of significant flow through dolostone fig 6a groundwater emerging at lower elevations likely travels through deeper dolostone before discharging at the surface and thus has a higher mg2 ca2 the positive correlation between spring water temperature and mg2 ca2 r2 0 74 suggests that springs with higher mg2 ca2 ratios may be sourced by groundwater from greater depths and or were recharged by low elevation rain rather than high elevation snow fig 6b springs emerging along the kst have variable mg2 ca2 table 2 as a result of differing amounts of limestone and dolostone weathering springs with low mg2 ca2 around the kst are likely sourced by shallower flowpaths that have not passed through older and deeper dolostone for example ies 063 emerges in the monte cristo group a young limestone with no dolostones upgradient in contrast springs with high mg2 ca2 along the southwest and lower hydrologic gradient portion of the kst ies 001 and ies 002 are interpreted as being sourced by deeper flowpaths that weather dolostone these springs emerge in dolostones such as the nopah and bonanza king formations down section of the monte cristo group it is difficult to use temperature as a proxy for circulation depth in the kst because many springs emerge in shallow pools with low discharge rates that are likely influenced by ambient air temperatures mg2 ca2 in csm springs suggest that circulation depth in the csm is variable springs with low mg2 ca2 are likely fed by predominantly by shallow flowpaths because upgradient csm strata are limestone while older and deeper units are dolostone table 3 variable flow depths by csm groundwater are further supported by the relationship between spring temperature and mg2 ca2 for example ies 052 mg2 ca2 0 39 emerges at high elevation on mt charleston in the bird springs formation limestone and has the lowest temperature 4 c usgs 2019 of all sampled springs no geologic unit is present upgradient of the bird springs formation in the csm indicating that limestone is the primary control on groundwater geochemistry for ies 052 in contrast ies 004 mg2 ca2 0 92 emerges in the bonanza king formation dolomite and has the highest spring water temperature 15 9 c in the csm snowmelt recharges ies 004 then flows through limestone and deeper dolostone and warms before discharging at the surface typically when groundwater is in contact with dolomite along the flowpath mg2 ca2 is higher and circulation is deeper mg2 ca2 in the mh suggest that discharging groundwater has undergone deep circulation all three mh springs have mg2 ca2 greater than 0 98 indicating significant calcite precipitation deep groundwater circulation is further suggested by spring water temperatures 16 9 19 8 c as mh spring waters are warmer than csm groundwater because of warming by the geothermal gradient after deep circulation however using geothermometers is complicated in this study area because 1 ca2 and mg2 are not conservative such that mg2 concentrations increase and ca2 concentrations decrease as calcite is precipitated during dedolomitization and 2 the mineralogy of the dolomitic rocks do not contain abundant by volume minerals containing silica sodium and potassium thus na k ca and si geothermometers do not provide meaningful estimates of the equilibrium temperature we infer from fig 6b that circulation depth must increase since the temperature of spring waters increase as mg2 ca2 increases 5 3 groundwater flowpaths as inferred from 87sr 86sr and geology springs emerging along the kst have a 87sr 86sr 0 71038 0 71116 higher than the limestone and dolostone east of mt charleston that make up the hanging wall of the kst 0 70836 0 70935 the only sources of higher 87sr 86sr in nearby bedrock are the aztec sandstone 0 71116 and the kayenta formation 0 71102 and both of these units are present in the footwall of the kst the aztec sandstone outcrops as massive sandstone cliffs to the east of sampled springs and is higher in elevation than kst spring emergence locations in addition the aztec sandstone and its correlative equivalents have been documented to have high porosity in southeastern nevada fossen et al 2015 and in utah beitler et al 2005 groundwater travels downgradient from north to south along the kst as it weathers mesozoic sandstones in the hanging wall of the kst fig 9 for example ies 063 1761 m emerges around the northernmost point of the wilson cliffs fig 1 at an elevation higher than other springs along the kst ies 001 1688 m ies 002 1648 m the 87sr 86sr of ies 063 0 71115 suggests that the spring is sourced by flowpaths that originate in mesozoic sandstone as water flows through mesozoic sandstones downgradient and parallel to the kst flowpath length increases and therefore the potential to weather mesozoic sandstones increases groundwater in the southern portion of the kst accumulates an elevated 87sr 86sr from mesozoic sandstone as it flows from north to south groundwater that flows through mesozoic sandstones mixes with csm groundwater along the fault through fractures and areas of greater permeability each of the five springs in the csm flow region has a 87sr 86sr of 0 70831 0 70879 that falls within the range 0 70823 0 71200 and close to the median 0 70883 of geologic units present in the csm comparison of spring 87sr 86sr to 87sr 86sr from rock leaching experiments indicates that spring mountains geology is the primary control on csm geochemistry and that there is little to no flow from other spring mountains locations or regionally topography and published potentiometric contours d agnese et al 1998 also support this conclusion similar to flow along the kst and the csm the elevation gradient and published potentiometric contours d agnese et al 1998 of the mh suggest that groundwater present along the wheeler pass thrust flows from higher elevations at the northern extent of the thrust fault downgradient towards the southern extent of the thrust fault geochemical and isotopic comparisons of ies 005 and ies 064 support these proposed flowpaths ies 005 groundwater is mixed between the csm and mh flow groups the spring emerges just northwest of the same thrust fault wheeler pass thrust fault that ies 064 csm flow group emerges from but has a different geochemical signature and 87sr 86sr ies 064 has a 87sr 86sr of 0 70864 and is a ca hco3 type water that predominately weathers limestones in contrast ies 005 has a 87sr 86sr of 0 71102 and is a mg hco3 type water that weathers both carbonate and silicate minerals as groundwater flows south along the wheeler pass thrust it accumulates a silicate signature as the volume of up gradient silicate rocks increases the bonanza king and carrara formations line the hanging wall of the thrust and facilitate mixing between the two flow groups comparison of ies 063 and ies 005 provides evidence for the importance of major pervasive thrust faults i e kst wheeler pass thrust in facilitating regional groundwater mixing ies 007 and ies 008 are particularly distinct in 87sr 86sr both springs have very elevated 87sr 86sr 0 73 than any of the rocks or springs in the study area we hypothesize that groundwater flows through very radiogenic rocks prior to discharge in the spring and causes the unique chemistry of springs ies 007 and ies 008 5 4 conceptual model for three flow regions 5 4 1 keystone thrust groundwater groundwater discharging in the kst region is a combination of water recharged throughout the csm and locally in the footwall region of the kst fig 9 the evidence of a greater proportion of recharge by rain extensive dedolomitization and the mixed circulation depth signal of the mg ca along with the silicate weathering signature of 87sr 86sr indicate that kst groundwater undergoes significant flow through the mesozoic sandstones in the footwall of the kst the kst serves as a mixing zone between the csm and footwall of the kst groundwater flows downgradient along the kst and accumulates an elevated 87sr 86sr from mesozoic sandstones as it flows from north to south toward death valley 5 4 2 central spring mountains groundwater groundwater discharging in the csm region is sourced by water recharged locally throughout the csm the evidence of a snow dominated recharge extensive dedolomitization and the shallow circulation depth signal of the mg ca along with 87sr 86sr that match local rocks indicate that csm groundwater is recharged and discharges within the csm published potentiometric contours d agnese et al 1998 decrease to the southwest suggesting groundwater in the csm flows downgradient toward death valley major thrust faults such as the lee canyon thrust trend perpendicular to potentiometric contour lines and thus likely serve as conduits to flow because springs emerging at lower elevation on thrust faults undergo more dedolomitization and are high in total dissolved solids 5 4 3 montgomery hills groundwater groundwater discharging in the mh region is a combination of snow recharged throughout the csm and rain locally in the mh fig 10 groundwater in the mh exhibits a dedolomitization signature but also has 87sr 86sr similar to cambrian and pre cambrian siliciclastics fig 5 this flow region is therefore likely weathering both siliciclastic rocks in the mh and limestone and dolostone present in the central spring mountains the wheeler pass thrust fault divides the csm and mh ies 005 at the southwestern end of the fault exhibits a mh 87sr 86sr and mg2 ca2 signature as well as a δ18o and δ2h from snow over the csm suggesting that the wheeler pass thrust acts as a mixing zone between the two flow regions and that groundwater leaving the spring mountains is flowing down gradient toward pahrump and death valley 5 5 implications for recharge to the death valley regional flow system the spring mountains are identified as a recharge area for interbasin groundwater flow in the death valley region belcher et al 2009 belcher and sweetkind 2010 bushman et al 2010 hevesi et al 2003 larsen et al 2001 stetzenbach et al 1999 thomas et al 2013 tiedeman et al 2003 winograd et al 1998 winograd and pearson 1976 groundwater characteristics in the dvrfs were compared to observed spring mountains groundwater to both identify the area of recharge in the spring mountains most likely to contribute to the dvrfs and to predict the geochemistry and 87sr 86sr of groundwater leaving the spring mountains and flowing west towards death valley the regional low the dvrfs contains twenty five hydrogeologic units belcher and sweetkind 2010 the spring mountains hosts strata found in three of the hydrogeologic units the sedimentary rock confining unit scu the lower clastic rock confining unit lccu and the lower carbonate rock aquifer lca the scu consists of cratonic sedimentary rocks with variable hydrogeologic properties and are observed in the footwall of the kst some of the scu units may host groundwater flow but these units are often disconnected or are too small or shallow to be significant contributors belcher and sweetkind 2010 the lccu comprises mesoproterozoic to cambrian siliciclastic rocks and dolostone belcher and sweetkind 2010 the lccu is a low hydraulic conductivity confining unit winograd and thordarson 1975 however the lccu has the potential for shallow groundwater contributions in places where it is highly fractured and brecciated d agnese et al 1998 larsen et al 2001 fractured and brecciated quartzites were observed in the lccu region of the northwest spring mountains while collecting rock samples for 87sr 86sr analysis and these units are important to groundwater flow in the mh the lca is a thick aquifer containing paleozoic carbonate units the lca contains the most permeable rocks in the dvrfs region therefore it is plausible that the lca is a significant conduit groundwater flow the lca contains geologic units present throughout the spring mountains and it hosts the majority of strata in the csm hydrogeologic characterizations such as large hydraulic conductivities belcher and sweetkind 2010 winograd and thordarson 1975 suggest that the lca has the highest potential to transport groundwater from the spring mountains to the death valley region with smaller flow components from the scu and lccu many of the units present in the csm are present in the regional lca these units include ely spring dolomite eureka quartzite pogonip group mississippian and devonian rocks devonian rocks mountain springs formation nopah formation bonanza king formation and the carrara formation belcher and sweetkind 2010 the units are primarily dolostone and limestone springs emerging in the central spring mountains most closely match the expected weathering patterns of the carbonate units as illustrated in fig 5 the lca has the largest spatial extent both at the surface and at depth in the csm as compared to the kst and mh lca units are present either at the surface or at depth across the entire csm in contrast only the carrara nopah and bonanza king formations are present in the mh similarly the nopah and bonanza king formations outcrop across the entire kst thrust faults serve as mixing zones between groundwater regions because two different rock types silicates dolostones are next to one another in zones of fracturing pervasive dolostones at the thrust faults connect water from the silicate rocks to the dvrfs after mixing as indicated by groundwater emerging at thrust faults with 87sr 86sr signatures that reflect silicates in the kst or mh and δ18o and δ2h and geochemical signatures that reflect the csm the bonanza king and nopah formations are present at the contacts between major thrust faults that divide the three flow groups the kst and wheeler pass thrust and at the lee canyon thrust in the csm the elevation of the thrust faults decreases to the southwest implying that faults serve as conduits allowing groundwater to move to the southwest toward death valley some springs ies 001 ies 002 ies 005 emerging along these thrust faults have 87sr 86sr indicative of silicate rocks despite emerging in or near thick regional dolostones geochemical observations from these springs flowing through the kst and mh suggest that these two silicate end members influence the geochemistry of groundwater in the bonanza king and nopah formations and therefore have the potential to influence the geochemistry of groundwater flowing toward death valley by combining observations of spring geochemistry and 87sr 86sr with known hydrogeologic characteristics of the dvrfs we developed a conceptual model that can predict groundwater flowpaths most likely to contribute to the dvrfs groundwater recharging in and around mt charleston and flowing through the csm contributes the greatest amount of flow to the dvrfs recharge along the kst or over the mh can reach the dvrfs after mixing at thrust faults however recharge from the kst and mh flow regions is less than the contribution from the csm we expect water leaving the spring mountains and flowing southwest to have a range from magnesium bicarbonate waters to calcium bicarbonate waters fig 4 6 conclusion spring mountains groundwater was grouped into three flow regions using 87sr 86sr water δ18o and δ2h and general geochemistry groundwater flow regions are distinguished as follows 1 keystone thrust groundwater weathers both silicate and carbonate and has a 87sr 86sr of 0 710 0 711 2 central spring mountains groundwater primarily weathers limestone and dolostone and has a 87sr 86sr of 0 708 3 groundwater in the montgomery hills weathers both siliciclastics and carbonate and has 87sr 86sr 0 711 0 733 groundwater flowing through the csm has the highest potential to contribute to the dvrfs major thrust faults are conduits for groundwater flow and enable groundwater in the kst and mh flow regions to supplement flow from the spring mountains to the dvrfs mixing between groundwater regions occurs as groundwater flows downgradient from northeast to southwest along thrust faults the relative contribution of groundwater from the three flow groups leaving the spring mountains could be more accurately quantified in future work by determining the 87sr 86sr and geochemistry of groundwater in deep wells throughout the pahrump valley and in the tecopa basin and southern death valley that have not interacted with highly soluble basin fill understanding groundwater in arid regions is important for ecosystems and communities that are dependent on groundwater resources for their primary freshwater supply particularly as climate continues to change the classification of recharge areas and groundwater flow direction presented in this paper are applicable to spring mountains ecosystems the las vegas and pahump water supplies and the dvrfs methods used for identification of recharge source and dominant flowpaths have implications both locally and can be more broadly applied to groundwater flow in arid regions worldwide as groundwater in arid landscapes is often the only source of freshwater and subsequently it is difficult to directly observe and predict how freshwater resources are changing due to perturbations in climate and recharge patterns author contributions

the spring mountains nv were used to understand how groundwater recharging in the spring mountains influences regional groundwater flow in the death valley regional flow system dvrfs previous researchers hypothesized that groundwater from the spring mountains contributes to the dvrfs an interbasin groundwater flow system igf however the spring mountains are geologically heterogeneous therefore a uniform contribution of groundwater flow across the range is unlikely here we use spring water geochemistry spring water and host rock 87sr 86sr and observations of the surrounding geology to determine what regions of the spring mountains are likely to contribute more flow to the dvrfs based on geochemical and isotopic evidence spring mountains groundwater can be divided into three flow regions with distinct geochemical signals reflecting silicate or carbonate water rock interactions and location relative to major thrust faults the keystone thrust flow region kst has a 87sr 86sr of 0 710 0 711 is recharged by both rain and snow and weathers both mesozoic sandstones and permian and cambrian carbonate central spring mountains csm groundwater has a 87sr 86sr of 0 708 is primarily recharged by snow and weathers permian and cambrian limestones and dolostones the montgomery hills mh flow region has a 87sr 86sr 0 711 0 733 is recharged by both rain and snow and weathers both permian and cambrian carbonates and precambrian siliciclastics groundwater mixing between flow groups occurs along major thrust faults in the study area as evidenced by 87sr 86sr signatures that reflect one flow group and δ18o and δ2h and geochemical signatures that reflect another flow group the combination of geochemical and isotopic results suggest csm groundwater is the most likely to reach death valley because csm groundwater composition reflects the geochemical and isotopic signatures of the highly permeable rocks that connect the spring mountains to death valley flow leaving the kst and mh also influences the dvrfs after mixing with csm groundwater along major thrust faults abbreviations csm central spring mountains kst keystone thrust lca lower carbonate rock aquifer scu

is well established frisbee et al 2016 genereux et al 2013 2002 pacheco 2015 stewart maddox et al 2018 tóth 1999 1995 1963 igf occurs when groundwater flow crosses surface water drainage divides and discharges in an adjacent topographic basin although sedimentary bedrock may be naturally conducive to the occurrence of igf frisbee et al 2016 stewart maddox et al 2018 it can occur in different geologic settings for example igf was observed in watersheds underlain by volcanic bedrock in costa rica genereux et al 2013 2002 in volcanic volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks of the lower rio grande valley in new mexico langman and ellis 2010 and in quaternary sediments in denmark danapour et al 2019 local and intermediate scale flowpaths are interpreted to contribute to regional groundwater flow systems through large faults and contact zones pacheco and van der weijden 2014a recent studies identify igf as an integral component of the death valley regional flow system dvrfs in the deserts of southern nevada and eastern california anderson et al 2006 belcher and sweetkind 2010 nelson et al 2004 nelson and mayo 2014 stetzenbach et al 1999 thomas et al 2013 the dvrfs is an extensive and complex regional set of aquifers in southern nevada and southeastern california belcher and sweetkind 2010 groundwater in the dvrfs is recharged at high elevations in the spring mountains and other central and southern nevada uplands pahranagat range sheep range quinn canyon range etc and supplies flow to high discharge springs in desert basins such as death valley and amargosa valley belcher et al 2009 bushman et al 2010 thomas et al 2013 understanding the magnitude and geographic extent of igf connectivity and spring permanence is important for groundwater management and planning belcher et al 2009 particularly in the arid southwest where high temperatures and low annual recharge limit the presence of surface water additionally climate change is altering recharge patterns in arid regions akiyama et al 2018 love and zdon 2018 mckenna and sala 2018 recharge to the dvrfs is expected to decrease meixner et al 2016 yet desert communities and groundwater dependent ecosystems rely on groundwater as the primary sometimes only source of perennial freshwater klausmeyer et al 2018 patten et al 2008 despite the importance of groundwater in the region the contributing areas to and groundwater fluxes in the dvrfs are still debated anderson et al 2006 belcher et al 2009 belcher and sweetkind 2010 burbey 1997 bushman et al 2010 d agnese et al 1998 hevesi et al 2003 research in the dvrfs region has utilized water chemistry isotopes and various modeling techniques to quantify and delineate groundwater flowpaths that contribute to basin springs as part of the large igf network belcher and sweetkind 2010 bushman et al 2010 peterman et al 1992 thomas et al 2013 ye et al 2016 the spring mountains are the highest range in the dvrfs and receive a relatively large annual precipitation from both winter snow and summer rainfall winograd et al 1998 the spring mountains receive substantial modern recharge that supplements the paleorecharge in storage hershey et al 2016 and provides hydraulic forcing necessary for sustaining flow in the dvrfs indeed previous studies indicate that the spring mountains nv are one of the greatest sources of recharge in the dvrfs belcher et al 2009 belcher and sweetkind 2010 bushman et al 2010 hevesi et al 2003 larsen et al 2001 stetzenbach et al 1999 thomas et al 2013 tiedeman et al 2003 winograd et al 1998 winograd and pearson 1976 while regional research is abundant detailed hydrogeologic studies focused on the geochemistry of spring mountains groundwater as it relates to the dvrfs are scarce and often lack incorporation of structural controls and applications of environmental tracers which can be used to infer connectivity of flowpaths hershey 1989 hershey et al 2016 hughes 1966 in this study spring mountains groundwater was evaluated as a contributing influence to the dvrfs by use of water stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h general geochemistry and 87sr 86sr of spring water and rock units thought to host flowpaths measured at twelve springs along with observations from published geologic maps and cross sections specifically this project aims to 1 identify recharge areas and potential mixing between groundwater regions 2 characterize the geochemistry of spring mountains springs 3 understand the influence of geology on groundwater flow and 4 identify the region of spring mountains most likely to contribute groundwater to the dvrfs 2 study area the spring mountains are a northwest southeast trending mountain belt in southwestern nevada between the cities of las vegas nv and pahrump nv fig 1 the mountain belt lies in the southern great basin physiographic province and spans more than 80 km in length with over 2200 km2 of mountainous terrain the spring mountains are the highest mountain range in southern nevada mt charleston 3632 masl and exhibit significant relief from adjacent basins pahrump 800 masl las vegas 600 masl 2 1 climate and precipitation the large relief of the spring mountains causes climate patterns to vary with elevation alluvial valleys are arid lowland deserts while high elevations have a climate similar to an alpine tundra hershey 1989 the spring mountains receive significant recharge despite their location in the rain shadow of the sierra nevada hevesi et al 2003 average annual precipitation ranges from 20 cm in the foothills up to greater than 70 cm at mountain crests moreo et al 2014 winograd et al 1998 winograd and thordarson 1975 winograd et al 1998 classify precipitation events into two types 1 low pressure winter storms that originate over the pacific ocean and 2 short and intense summer storms that originate from the gulf of california and the gulf of mexico stable isotope evidence from prior studies springer et al 2016 winograd et al 1998 suggests that both summer and winter storms contribute to groundwater flow however late spring snowmelt constitutes the greatest proportion 90 percent of recharge mean annual air temperatures are also variable particularly across the elevation gradient of the spring mountains the average annual temperature at lee canyon from 2009 to 2017 2414 m was 9 5 c noaa ncdc 2019 in the adjacent southwest basin the average annual temperature of pahrump is 17 3 c with summer highs approaching 40 c noaa ncdc 2019 consequently vegetation also varies with elevation moreo et al 2014 at low elevations desert shrubs dominate the environment as elevation increases vegetation transitions to a juniper pinyon woodland environment and eventually to a coniferous forest and alpine tundra hershey 1989 spring mountains groundwater is an important water resource for local communities and ecosystems and provides freshwater to the nearby cities of las vegas nv las vegas valley water district 2018 and pahrump nv harrill 1986 nye county water district 2018 rainfall and surface water are limited in the southern great basin therefore desert ecosystems are dependent on a stable discharge of groundwater as a reliable source of freshwater indeed spring mountains springs host highly productive groundwater dependent ecosystems kreamer et al 2015 in addition to recharging the underlying aquifer and supplying local springs with groundwater flow the spring mountains conduct mountain front recharge to the basinal aquifer systems to the east and southwest harrill 1986 morgan and dettinger 1994 2 2 geology the spring mountains comprise a sequence of sedimentary strata deposited upon the paleozoic passive margin of western north america these strata have since been displaced by thrust and normal faults uplifted and deeply eroded exposing the regional carbonate aquifer that underlies much of the southern great basin figs 1 and 2 from northwest to southeast strata transition up section from precambrian siliciclastic rocks to paleozoic dolostone and limestone to mesozoic sandstones the sevier orogeny generated folds and northeast southwest trending thrust faults namely the keystone thrust lee canyon thrust and the wheeler pass thrust burchfiel et al 1974 basin and range extension caused northwest southeast trending normal faults to cut existing thrust faults page et al 2005 four major rock types dominate the spring mountains sandstone limestone dolostone and siliciclastic rocks table 3 mesozoic sandstones are present in the eastern spring mountains near the keystone thrust kst and are the youngest rocks in the mountain belt in addition to sandstone evaporite lenses found in mesozoic units are observed to influence groundwater geochemistry where present hershey 1989 limestone and dolostone are abundant at the highest elevations in the central spring mountains csm typically limestone units are younger than down section dolostone units the bird spring formation is commonly surficiallyexposed in the csm and has a maximum exposed thickness of 2355 m suggesting its importance for recharging groundwater page et al 2005 the northwest spring mountains referred to as the montgomery hills mh comprise the oldest rocks in the mountain belt and are located northwest of the wheeler pass thrust the montgomery hills are predominately quartzite but also include siltstone sandstone shale and minor dolostone and limestone beds rocks in the montgomery hills are commonly brecciated two major thrust faults separate the three primary rock regions fig 2 the keystone thrust fault located in the southeastern spring mountains occurs at the contact between the aztec sandstone ja and the bonanza king dolostone cbk there permian and cambrian dolostone and limestone are thrust atop mesozoic sandstones the wheeler pass thrust fault located in the northwest spring mountains places the stirling quartzite zs atop the bird springs formation pmb and marks the stratigraphic transition from permian carbonate to cambrian and precambrian siliciclastic rocks similarly numerous thrust faults such as the lee canyon thrust cut the csm but do not displace different rock types 3 methods observations from geologic maps were combined with strontium isotopes and spring geochemistry and water isotope data to predict groundwater flowpaths for twelve springs and to infer groundwater flow in the rest of the spring mountains geologic structures are important controls on groundwater flow both within the dvrfs al qudah et al 2017 belcher and sweetkind 2010 d agnese et al 1998 and globally dimmen et al 2017 seymour et al 2008 vittecoq et al 2015 in fact dvrfs spring emergences are highly correlated to structural features geologic maps page et al 2005 workman et al 2016 were used to identify structural features and changes in rock types springs along pervasive thrust faults in the spring mountains were used to study how groundwater composition evolves along thrust faults and differs between regions in addition potentiometric surface maps displayed on fig 1 d agnese et al 1998 were used to infer groundwater flow direction dissolved strontium and strontium isotope ratios 87sr 86sr along with general geochemistry are commonly used to better understand potential groundwater flowpaths blum et al 1993 clow et al 1997 négrel et al 2018 pacheco and van der weijden 2014b pu et al 2012 stevenson et al 2018 stewart maddox et al 2018 zieliński et al 2017 as water flows through rocks and soils it accumulates dissolved strontium the 87sr 86sr of the resulting water is a product of the initial 87sr 86sr of the water and the 87sr 86sr of material weathered along the flowpath differences in 87sr 86sr can be attributed to exposure to different mineral sources or to mixing between multiple water types if sources with distinguishable 87sr 86sr exist derivation of flowpaths from 87sr 86sr is limited by the extent of known 87sr 86sr in potential flowpath geology paces et al 2007 we used published 87sr 86sr values from spring mountains units the strontium sea water curve and rock age and leaching experiments from outcrop samples to better constrain the range of potential 87sr 86sr and predict groundwater flowpaths spring geochemistry can also be used to estimate weathering patterns and to predict groundwater flowpaths blum et al 1998 garrels and mackenzie 1967 johnson et al 2000 pretti and stewart 2002 rademacher et al 2001 determining the amount of material weathered in carbonate and dolostone systems such as the spring mountains is difficult because calcite reaches saturation quickly and is easily precipitated however spring geochemistry can be used to identify the weathering of silicate minerals in addition to limestone blum et al 1998 jacobson et al 2002 δ18o and δ2h can be used to estimate the fraction of recharge from snow and to identify different recharge elevations beria et al 2018 penna et al 2014 winograd et al 1998 we used δ18o and δ2h to better constrain potential flowpaths inferred from 87sr 86sr and spring geochemistry 3 1 sampling procedures and analyses spring water samples were collected from eight spring mountains springs in march of 2016 four additional springs were added to increase spatial resolution in july 2017 may 2018 and july 2018 samples were collected using a geotech peristaltic pump with masterflex platinum cured silicone tubing positioned at the spring source or uppermost discharge location field temperature measurements were collected at each spring source whereas ph and conductivity were determined at the new mexico bureau of geology mineral resources analytical chemistry laboratory table 1 at each spring samples for cation and anion analysis were filtered with 0 22 µm polyethersulfone membrane sterivex gp pressure filters and collected in 250 ml high density polyethylene bottles hdpe water to be analyzed for 87sr 86sr was filtered and collected in 125 ml hdpe bottles water δ18o and δ2h samples were collected in 2 ml glass vials with no head space general chemistry and δ18o and δ2h samples were stored cold and all samples were shipped to an analytical lab within six months strontium isotope samples were analyzed at university of illinois urbana champaign using a nu plasma hr multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer stable isotope samples were analyzed at the university of california davis stable isotope facility for δ18o and δ2h using a continuous flow isotope mass spectrometer major cations were measured using an icp oes according to epa method 200 7 and major anions were measured using an ic according to epa method 300 0 at the new mexico bureau of geology mineral resources analytical chemistry laboratory general chemistry 87sr 86sr and water δ18o and δ2h values are reported in table 2 3 2 rock leaching experiments 87sr 86sr as a geochemical tracer rock 87sr 86sr were collected throughout the spring mountains and compared to groundwater 87sr 86sr to better understand rock weathering and groundwater flowpaths however prior to this study only a subset of rocks present in the spring mountains had published 87sr 86sr values paces et al 2007 to fill this gap eighteen total rock samples were selected from sixteen geologic units hypothesized to be significant to groundwater flow based on published cross sections page et al 2005 and dvrfs characterization belcher and sweetkind 2010 rock samples were collected from outcrops in the spring mountains in march 2018 geologic maps by page et al 2005 and workman et al 2016 were used to determine sample locations for each of the sixteen units fresh rock samples typically about 1000 cm3 were collected from each outcrop 87sr 86sr values were determined from leachate water using methods adapted from frisbee et al 2017 rock samples were crushed and sieved with a 0 4 size sieve 4 76 mm at purdue university for each geologic unit 200 mg of crushed rock was added to a 1 l hdpe bottle with deionized water the bottles were capped tightly sealed with electrical tape and stored for 2 months in the laboratory after the allotted time samples were decanted and analyzed at the icmps facility at university of illinois urbana champaign rock leaching results are reported with previously published 87sr 86sr values in table 3 leaching with deionized water provides information on the most easily released sources of strontium in the host rocks however by crushing the rock we aim to increase the mineral surface area and enhance weathering of the more resistant minerals one shortcoming of this technique is that water is essentially stagnant in the bottle unless the bottle is occasionally agitated and does not represent natural conditions where solutes are transported away from the mineral surface by flowing water the paces et al 2007 methodology included powdering whole rocks and leaching them in dilute hydrochloric acid these methods may give slightly different results since there is heterogeneity within the mineralogy of a rock sample and because hydrochloric acid aggressively weathers a broader assemblage of minerals compared to deionized water 3 3 spring mountains recharge spring water δ18o values were utilized to determine the relative importance of snow and rain to groundwater recharge in the study area genereux 1998 liu et al 2004 winograd et al 1998 δ18o values of rain and snow reported in winograd et al 1998 were used to create a weighted average for each precipitation type the calculation only sourced δ18o from winograd et al 1998 because other spring mountains stable isotope studies do not report amount of precipitation for each δ18o observation the fraction of recharge from snow was computed using eq 1 where δ 18 o spring is the measured δ 18 o value for spring water δ 18 o rain is the weighted mean of rain δ 18 o observations and δ 18 o snow is the weighted mean of snow δ 18 o observations from 88 observations of rain n 41 or snow n 47 collected between 1975 and 1978 and 1987 to 1988 winograd et al 1998 eq 1 is a two endmember mixing model that assumes δ18o of snowmelt and rainfall are the only sources of δ18o influencing discharging groundwater beria et al 2018 penna et al 2014 winograd et al 1998 1 f snow δ 18 o spring δ 18 o rain δ 18 o snow δ 18 o rain the certainty of the calculated fraction of recharge from snow is limited by the incomplete precipitation record throughout a nonconsecutive six year period winograd et al 1998 which may bias endmembers isotopes of precipitation vary from storm to storm and from year to year dansgaard 1964 thus increasing the potential for uncertainty due to the incomplete precipitation record in addition rain data were collected at three locations and snow data were collected at five locations limiting the spatial coverage of the record discharging spring water is likely not fully represented by recharge during the six years that data are available for example springer et al 2016 reported stable isotope samples collected from 2011 to 2012 for many of the same springs sampled by hershey 1989 from 1985 to 1987 which are on average 0 61 greater for δ18o and 1 34 greater for δ2h 24 27 years later uncertainty in the fraction of recharge from snow is further increased by the limited spatial extent of sample collection instances of percent snow values greater than 100 are likely due to spatiotemporal limitations of the record used to define endmembers 4 results 4 1 stable isotope observations spring water δ18o and δ2h range from 12 06 to 13 71 0 08 and 86 6 to 99 1 0 83 respectively table 2 fig 3 winograd et al 1998 and hershey 1989 collected rain and snow within the spring mountains for multiple seasons between 1975 and 1988 and our spring water δ18o and δ2h values fall within the historical range for those studies fig 3 δ18o values of rain and snow reported in winograd et al 1998 were used to calculate a weighted average δ18o for rain and snow and were combined with spring water δ18o values in eq 1 to calculate the percentage of recharge from snow for each spring the percentage of snow contributing to spring recharge ranges from 18 to 105 table 2 this estimate is limited by the unevenly distributed data over the 6 year period of record springs emerging along the kst have δ18o and δ2h values ranging between 12 74 and 12 06 0 08 and 92 4 and 86 6 0 83 respectively kst springs are isotopically heavier than the rest of sampled springs and receive between 18 and 54 of their recharge from snow based on 2 end member mixing calculations using snow and rainfall δ18o data from winograd et al 1998 springs discharging in the csm emerge at the highest elevations in the spring mountains and have relatively lighter δ18o and δ2h ranging between 13 71 and 13 18 0 08 and 99 1 4 and 92 9 0 83 respectively csm springs receive more than 77 of their recharge from snow based on mixing analysis using δ18o precipitation data from winograd et al 1998 springs in the mh flow region have intermediate δ18o and δ2h ranging between 13 45 and 13 1 0 08 and 95 2 and 91 9 0 83 respectively mh springs receive between 73 and 91 of their recharge from snow based on δ18o precipitation data from winograd et al 1998 4 2 spring geochemistry sampled spring waters were grouped according to their hydrochemical facies all springs in the study area are either ca hco3 or mg hco3 water fig 4 and are saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite generally the degree of saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite increases from the csm to mh to kst springs in this study exhibit a positive correlation between ca2 mg2 and so4 2 ½ hco3 and follow the expected geochemical trend for dedolomitization as distance from the recharge area increases fig 5 r2 0 989 raines and dewers 1997 dedolomitization occurs as groundwater weathers dolomite and gypsum 50 50 and subsequently supersaturates groundwater with calcite raines and dewers 1997 the mg2 ca2 of spring waters varies from 0 39 to 1 48 throughout the spring mountains high mg2 ca2 1 is more commonly observed in springs discharging at lower elevations below 1700 m and in springs with relatively warmer temperatures 15 c springs discharging along the kst in the southern spring mountains near mountain springs nv ies 001 and ies 002 fig 1 emerge from dolostone bonanza king and nopah formations and exhibit very high mg2 ca2 1 48 and 1 47 respectively springs discharging along the northern portion of the kst near red rock canyon national conservation area ies 063 and ies 065 have lower mg2 ca2 0 67 and 0 86 respectively mg2 ca2 in csm springs ranges from 0 39 0 92 and 0 89 1 14 in the mh spring temperature and mg2 ca2 are positively correlated r2 0 74 fig 6 b ies 001 ies 002 are not included in the temperature relationship as they discharge in low flow pools and have significant diurnal temperature signals the diurnal temperature signal was observed using a long term temperature logger with a sampling interval of 15 min in ies 002 although ies 001 did not have a logger in place it likely also exhibits diurnal temperature fluctuations because of the very low discharge 1 l s 1 in a shallow pool 4 3 strontium spring water and rock leaching experiment results spring water 87sr 86sr range from 0 70831 to 0 73314 0 00005 table 2 springs near the kst include ies 001 002 063 and 065 and their 87sr 86sr range between 0 71038 and 0 71115 0 00005 87sr 86sr data is not available for ies 065 at this time springs in the csm include ies 003 004 006 052 and 064 and have the lowest 87sr 86sr of all measured springs 0 70831 0 70879 0 00005 springs in the mh or northwest of the wheeler pass thrust fault include ies 005 007 and 008 and have a 87sr 86sr of 0 71102 0 73314 0 00005 the highest of all measured springs rock leaching 87sr 86sr range from 0 70823 to 0 72237 0 00005 table 3 we did not conduct leaching experiments on five units present in the spring mountains table 3 because the units are thin dsi dsu oe oes or only observed in the mh zs 87sr 86sr for these five units was supplemented by 87sr 86sr values from paces et al 2007 paces et al 2007 conducted multiple rock leaching experiments on rocks collected throughout southern nevada for many of the geologic units present in the spring mountains many of the rock leaching 87sr 86sr reported in paces et al 2007 were collected from outcrops containing units present in the spring mountains but were collected outside of the spring mountains in other areas of southern nevada 87sr 86sr from rock leaching experiments in our study are within the range of previously published rock leaching data for the same geologic units in the region fig 7 table 3 groundwater 87sr 86sr was compared to nearby rocks using the 87sr 86sr results from rock leaching experiments on spring mountains rocks the footwall of the kst comprises a sequence of mesozoic sandstones whereas the hanging wall is limestone and dolostone mesozoic sandstones in the footwall are the only rocks with 87sr 86sr greater than 0 710 present in the potential flowpaths of kst springs based on d agnese et al 1998 rocks in the hanging wall of the kst have 87sr 86sr of 0 70836 0 70935 0 00005 rocks in the csm are predominately younger limestone units atop older dolostone however thin quartzite beds are also rarely present dolostone and limestone 87sr 86sr in the csm range between 0 70823 and 0 71200 0 00005 only three bonanza king formation nopah formation and the pogonip group of fourteen csm units are greater than 0 70898 87sr 86sr of rocks in montgomery hills 0 71136 0 72237 0 00005 are the highest 87sr 86sr in the region for both rocks and water diagenetic fluids that previously circulated through rubidium rich rocks and deposited radiogenic strontium are likely the cause of the elevated 87sr 86sr present in the region paces et al 2007 5 discussion three distinct but connected flow regions exist in the spring mountains the kst the csm and the mh fig 8 the identification of flow regions is supported by evidence from 1 δ18o and δ2h 2 spring geochemistry and 3 comparison 87sr 86sr from spring water and rock leaching experiments to spring mountains geology 5 1 recharge patterns spring water δ18o and δ2h in the spring mountains vary because of differences in the dominant recharge source rain vs snow the sandstone cliffs in the footwall of the kst are at a lower elevation than mt charleston and thus receive a greater proportion of rain as a result δ18o and δ2h of precipitation along the wilson cliffs fig 1 is heavier than csm precipitation based on modeled spatial variations in isotope values of precipitation across the united states bowen 2019 bowen and revenaugh 2003 kst springs ies 001 ies 002 and ies 065 receive between 18 and 22 of recharge from snow kst spring ies 063 is located at a higher elevation than the southern kst springs ies 001 ies 002 and ies 065 and receives a greater proportion of recharge from snow 54 the relatively light stable isotopic signature of ies 063 suggests that the la madre fault may be a conduit for groundwater flow that is recharged at high elevations in the csm groundwater flows down gradient from the csm recharge area along the la madre fault before discharging at ies 063 d agnese et al 1998 rain recharging the kst also contributes to flow at ies 063 but with a smaller contribution than to southern springs the southern portion of the kst is at a lower elevation and potentiometric gradient and thus groundwater present has a greater potential to accumulate flow derived from rain as kst flowpath length increases springs along the kst are recharged by both rain falling over the sandstone cliffs and by rain and snow that recharges through limestone and dolostone present at higher elevations in the csm with the fraction of recharge by rain in the southern kst csm precipitation falls primarily as snow at high elevations such as mt charleston but also receives some summer rain as evident by the high fraction of recharge by snow 77 105 snowmelt in discharging springs spring waters in the csm are closest to δ18o and δ2h for historical snow observations compared to springs in the kst and mh hershey 1989 winograd et al 1998 fig 3 potentiometric contours developed by d agnese et al 1998 suggest that water recharged at high elevations around mt charleston flows downgradient toward ies springs thus suggesting a pathway for high fractions of snow recharge reaching springs at lower elevations mh δ18o and δ2h values suggest that mh groundwater is recharged by a mixture of rain in the mh and snow from the csm the fraction of recharge by snow 73 91 implies that recharge is primarily sourced from csm snow with a minor local recharge component from warmer lower elevation rains as distance from the csm increases the ratio of recharge by rain increases for example ies 005 has the greatest proportion of recharge by snow compared to ies 007 and 008 and is the closest spring to the csm in the mh flow region 5 2 groundwater weathering patterns and flow depth all springs in this study exhibit the geochemical signature expected for dedolomitization the ratio of the concentrations of ca2 mg2 to so4 2 ½ hco3 of approximately one which represents a 50 50 weathering of dolomite gypsum fig 5 raines and dewers 1997 the positive correlation slope 0 927 r2 0 989 between sampled spring geochemistry and the dedolomitization trend line suggests that all springs weather both dolomite and gypsum and subsequently precipitate calcite dolostone is not common in the mh or in the footwall of the kst but is found throughout the csm however the dedolomitization signature is observed throughout all of the spring mountains which indicates a hydrologic connection from the csm to the kst and mh mg2 ca2 can be used as a proxy for flow depth in the spring mountains because of the stratigraphic order of carbonates typically dolostones are present at depth and limestones near the surface higher ratios of mg2 ca2 indicate deeper flow and lower ratios indicate shallower flow mg2 ca2 values vary throughout the sampled spring mountains spring waters and are a function of both calcite precipitation and dolomite dissolution as recharging waters weather shallow limestone ca2 increases the water flows through deeper dolostones and continues to weather ca2 and mg2 until the water is saturated with respect to ca2 and calcite precipitation begins generally mg2 ca2 increases as spring elevation decreases because most high elevation springs emerge in limestone units that have limestone upgradient thus limiting the possibility of significant flow through dolostone fig 6a groundwater emerging at lower elevations likely travels through deeper dolostone before discharging at the surface and thus has a higher mg2 ca2 the positive correlation between spring water temperature and mg2 ca2 r2 0 74 suggests that springs with higher mg2 ca2 ratios may be sourced by groundwater from greater depths and or were recharged by low elevation rain rather than high elevation snow fig 6b springs emerging along the kst have variable mg2 ca2 table 2 as a result of differing amounts of limestone and dolostone weathering springs with low mg2 ca2 around the kst are likely sourced by shallower flowpaths that have not passed through older and deeper dolostone for example ies 063 emerges in the monte cristo group a young limestone with no dolostones upgradient in contrast springs with high mg2 ca2 along the southwest and lower hydrologic gradient portion of the kst ies 001 and ies 002 are interpreted as being sourced by deeper flowpaths that weather dolostone these springs emerge in dolostones such as the nopah and bonanza king formations down section of the monte cristo group it is difficult to use temperature as a proxy for circulation depth in the kst because many springs emerge in shallow pools with low discharge rates that are likely influenced by ambient air temperatures mg2 ca2 in csm springs suggest that circulation depth in the csm is variable springs with low mg2 ca2 are likely fed by predominantly by shallow flowpaths because upgradient csm strata are limestone while older and deeper units are dolostone table 3 variable flow depths by csm groundwater are further supported by the relationship between spring temperature and mg2 ca2 for example ies 052 mg2 ca2 0 39 emerges at high elevation on mt charleston in the bird springs formation limestone and has the lowest temperature 4 c usgs 2019 of all sampled springs no geologic unit is present upgradient of the bird springs formation in the csm indicating that limestone is the primary control on groundwater geochemistry for ies 052 in contrast ies 004 mg2 ca2 0 92 emerges in the bonanza king formation dolomite and has the highest spring water temperature 15 9 c in the csm snowmelt recharges ies 004 then flows through limestone and deeper dolostone and warms before discharging at the surface typically when groundwater is in contact with dolomite along the flowpath mg2 ca2 is higher and circulation is deeper mg2 ca2 in the mh suggest that discharging groundwater has undergone deep circulation all three mh springs have mg2 ca2 greater than 0 98 indicating significant calcite precipitation deep groundwater circulation is further suggested by spring water temperatures 16 9 19 8 c as mh spring waters are warmer than csm groundwater because of warming by the geothermal gradient after deep circulation however using geothermometers is complicated in this study area because 1 ca2 and mg2 are not conservative such that mg2 concentrations increase and ca2 concentrations decrease as calcite is precipitated during dedolomitization and 2 the mineralogy of the dolomitic rocks do not contain abundant by volume minerals containing silica sodium and potassium thus na k ca and si geothermometers do not provide meaningful estimates of the equilibrium temperature we infer from fig 6b that circulation depth must increase since the temperature of spring waters increase as mg2 ca2 increases 5 3 groundwater flowpaths as inferred from 87sr 86sr and geology springs emerging along the kst have a 87sr 86sr 0 71038 0 71116 higher than the limestone and dolostone east of mt charleston that make up the hanging wall of the kst 0 70836 0 70935 the only sources of higher 87sr 86sr in nearby bedrock are the aztec sandstone 0 71116 and the kayenta formation 0 71102 and both of these units are present in the footwall of the kst the aztec sandstone outcrops as massive sandstone cliffs to the east of sampled springs and is higher in elevation than kst spring emergence locations in addition the aztec sandstone and its correlative equivalents have been documented to have high porosity in southeastern nevada fossen et al 2015 and in utah beitler et al 2005 groundwater travels downgradient from north to south along the kst as it weathers mesozoic sandstones in the hanging wall of the kst fig 9 for example ies 063 1761 m emerges around the northernmost point of the wilson cliffs fig 1 at an elevation higher than other springs along the kst ies 001 1688 m ies 002 1648 m the 87sr 86sr of ies 063 0 71115 suggests that the spring is sourced by flowpaths that originate in mesozoic sandstone as water flows through mesozoic sandstones downgradient and parallel to the kst flowpath length increases and therefore the potential to weather mesozoic sandstones increases groundwater in the southern portion of the kst accumulates an elevated 87sr 86sr from mesozoic sandstone as it flows from north to south groundwater that flows through mesozoic sandstones mixes with csm groundwater along the fault through fractures and areas of greater permeability each of the five springs in the csm flow region has a 87sr 86sr of 0 70831 0 70879 that falls within the range 0 70823 0 71200 and close to the median 0 70883 of geologic units present in the csm comparison of spring 87sr 86sr to 87sr 86sr from rock leaching experiments indicates that spring mountains geology is the primary control on csm geochemistry and that there is little to no flow from other spring mountains locations or regionally topography and published potentiometric contours d agnese et al 1998 also support this conclusion similar to flow along the kst and the csm the elevation gradient and published potentiometric contours d agnese et al 1998 of the mh suggest that groundwater present along the wheeler pass thrust flows from higher elevations at the northern extent of the thrust fault downgradient towards the southern extent of the thrust fault geochemical and isotopic comparisons of ies 005 and ies 064 support these proposed flowpaths ies 005 groundwater is mixed between the csm and mh flow groups the spring emerges just northwest of the same thrust fault wheeler pass thrust fault that ies 064 csm flow group emerges from but has a different geochemical signature and 87sr 86sr ies 064 has a 87sr 86sr of 0 70864 and is a ca hco3 type water that predominately weathers limestones in contrast ies 005 has a 87sr 86sr of 0 71102 and is a mg hco3 type water that weathers both carbonate and silicate minerals as groundwater flows south along the wheeler pass thrust it accumulates a silicate signature as the volume of up gradient silicate rocks increases the bonanza king and carrara formations line the hanging wall of the thrust and facilitate mixing between the two flow groups comparison of ies 063 and ies 005 provides evidence for the importance of major pervasive thrust faults i e kst wheeler pass thrust in facilitating regional groundwater mixing ies 007 and ies 008 are particularly distinct in 87sr 86sr both springs have very elevated 87sr 86sr 0 73 than any of the rocks or springs in the study area we hypothesize that groundwater flows through very radiogenic rocks prior to discharge in the spring and causes the unique chemistry of springs ies 007 and ies 008 5 4 conceptual model for three flow regions 5 4 1 keystone thrust groundwater groundwater discharging in the kst region is a combination of water recharged throughout the csm and locally in the footwall region of the kst fig 9 the evidence of a greater proportion of recharge by rain extensive dedolomitization and the mixed circulation depth signal of the mg ca along with the silicate weathering signature of 87sr 86sr indicate that kst groundwater undergoes significant flow through the mesozoic sandstones in the footwall of the kst the kst serves as a mixing zone between the csm and footwall of the kst groundwater flows downgradient along the kst and accumulates an elevated 87sr 86sr from mesozoic sandstones as it flows from north to south toward death valley 5 4 2 central spring mountains groundwater groundwater discharging in the csm region is sourced by water recharged locally throughout the csm the evidence of a snow dominated recharge extensive dedolomitization and the shallow circulation depth signal of the mg ca along with 87sr 86sr that match local rocks indicate that csm groundwater is recharged and discharges within the csm published potentiometric contours d agnese et al 1998 decrease to the southwest suggesting groundwater in the csm flows downgradient toward death valley major thrust faults such as the lee canyon thrust trend perpendicular to potentiometric contour lines and thus likely serve as conduits to flow because springs emerging at lower elevation on thrust faults undergo more dedolomitization and are high in total dissolved solids 5 4 3 montgomery hills groundwater groundwater discharging in the mh region is a combination of snow recharged throughout the csm and rain locally in the mh fig 10 groundwater in the mh exhibits a dedolomitization signature but also has 87sr 86sr similar to cambrian and pre cambrian siliciclastics fig 5 this flow region is therefore likely weathering both siliciclastic rocks in the mh and limestone and dolostone present in the central spring mountains the wheeler pass thrust fault divides the csm and mh ies 005 at the southwestern end of the fault exhibits a mh 87sr 86sr and mg2 ca2 signature as well as a δ18o and δ2h from snow over the csm suggesting that the wheeler pass thrust acts as a mixing zone between the two flow regions and that groundwater leaving the spring mountains is flowing down gradient toward pahrump and death valley 5 5 implications for recharge to the death valley regional flow system the spring mountains are identified as a recharge area for interbasin groundwater flow in the death valley region belcher et al 2009 belcher and sweetkind 2010 bushman et al 2010 hevesi et al 2003 larsen et al 2001 stetzenbach et al 1999 thomas et al 2013 tiedeman et al 2003 winograd et al 1998 winograd and pearson 1976 groundwater characteristics in the dvrfs were compared to observed spring mountains groundwater to both identify the area of recharge in the spring mountains most likely to contribute to the dvrfs and to predict the geochemistry and 87sr 86sr of groundwater leaving the spring mountains and flowing west towards death valley the regional low the dvrfs contains twenty five hydrogeologic units belcher and sweetkind 2010 the spring mountains hosts strata found in three of the hydrogeologic units the sedimentary rock confining unit scu the lower clastic rock confining unit lccu and the lower carbonate rock aquifer lca the scu consists of cratonic sedimentary rocks with variable hydrogeologic properties and are observed in the footwall of the kst some of the scu units may host groundwater flow but these units are often disconnected or are too small or shallow to be significant contributors belcher and sweetkind 2010 the lccu comprises mesoproterozoic to cambrian siliciclastic rocks and dolostone belcher and sweetkind 2010 the lccu is a low hydraulic conductivity confining unit winograd and thordarson 1975 however the lccu has the potential for shallow groundwater contributions in places where it is highly fractured and brecciated d agnese et al 1998 larsen et al 2001 fractured and brecciated quartzites were observed in the lccu region of the northwest spring mountains while collecting rock samples for 87sr 86sr analysis and these units are important to groundwater flow in the mh the lca is a thick aquifer containing paleozoic carbonate units the lca contains the most permeable rocks in the dvrfs region therefore it is plausible that the lca is a significant conduit groundwater flow the lca contains geologic units present throughout the spring mountains and it hosts the majority of strata in the csm hydrogeologic characterizations such as large hydraulic conductivities belcher and sweetkind 2010 winograd and thordarson 1975 suggest that the lca has the highest potential to transport groundwater from the spring mountains to the death valley region with smaller flow components from the scu and lccu many of the units present in the csm are present in the regional lca these units include ely spring dolomite eureka quartzite pogonip group mississippian and devonian rocks devonian rocks mountain springs formation nopah formation bonanza king formation and the carrara formation belcher and sweetkind 2010 the units are primarily dolostone and limestone springs emerging in the central spring mountains most closely match the expected weathering patterns of the carbonate units as illustrated in fig 5 the lca has the largest spatial extent both at the surface and at depth in the csm as compared to the kst and mh lca units are present either at the surface or at depth across the entire csm in contrast only the carrara nopah and bonanza king formations are present in the mh similarly the nopah and bonanza king formations outcrop across the entire kst thrust faults serve as mixing zones between groundwater regions because two different rock types silicates dolostones are next to one another in zones of fracturing pervasive dolostones at the thrust faults connect water from the silicate rocks to the dvrfs after mixing as indicated by groundwater emerging at thrust faults with 87sr 86sr signatures that reflect silicates in the kst or mh and δ18o and δ2h and geochemical signatures that reflect the csm the bonanza king and nopah formations are present at the contacts between major thrust faults that divide the three flow groups the kst and wheeler pass thrust and at the lee canyon thrust in the csm the elevation of the thrust faults decreases to the southwest implying that faults serve as conduits allowing groundwater to move to the southwest toward death valley some springs ies 001 ies 002 ies 005 emerging along these thrust faults have 87sr 86sr indicative of silicate rocks despite emerging in or near thick regional dolostones geochemical observations from these springs flowing through the kst and mh suggest that these two silicate end members influence the geochemistry of groundwater in the bonanza king and nopah formations and therefore have the potential to influence the geochemistry of groundwater flowing toward death valley by combining observations of spring geochemistry and 87sr 86sr with known hydrogeologic characteristics of the dvrfs we developed a conceptual model that can predict groundwater flowpaths most likely to contribute to the dvrfs groundwater recharging in and around mt charleston and flowing through the csm contributes the greatest amount of flow to the dvrfs recharge along the kst or over the mh can reach the dvrfs after mixing at thrust faults however recharge from the kst and mh flow regions is less than the contribution from the csm we expect water leaving the spring mountains and flowing southwest to have a range from magnesium bicarbonate waters to calcium bicarbonate waters fig 4 6 conclusion spring mountains groundwater was grouped into three flow regions using 87sr 86sr water δ18o and δ2h and general geochemistry groundwater flow regions are distinguished as follows 1 keystone thrust groundwater weathers both silicate and carbonate and has a 87sr 86sr of 0 710 0 711 2 central spring mountains groundwater primarily weathers limestone and dolostone and has a 87sr 86sr of 0 708 3 groundwater in the montgomery hills weathers both siliciclastics and carbonate and has 87sr 86sr 0 711 0 733 groundwater flowing through the csm has the highest potential to contribute to the dvrfs major thrust faults are conduits for groundwater flow and enable groundwater in the kst and mh flow regions to supplement flow from the spring mountains to the dvrfs mixing between groundwater regions occurs as groundwater flows downgradient from northeast to southwest along thrust faults the relative contribution of groundwater from the three flow groups leaving the spring mountains could be more accurately quantified in future work by determining the 87sr 86sr and geochemistry of groundwater in deep wells throughout the pahrump valley and in the tecopa basin and southern death valley that have not interacted with highly soluble basin fill understanding groundwater in arid regions is important for ecosystems and communities that are dependent on groundwater resources for their primary freshwater supply particularly as climate continues to change the classification of recharge areas and groundwater flow direction presented in this paper are applicable to spring mountains ecosystems the las vegas and pahump water supplies and the dvrfs methods used for identification of recharge source and dominant flowpaths have implications both locally and can be more broadly applied to groundwater flow in arid regions worldwide as groundwater in arid landscapes is often the only source of freshwater and subsequently it is difficult to directly observe and predict how freshwater resources are changing due to perturbations in climate and recharge patterns author contributions

5974,in fractured media naturally occurring nuclides are produced by the decay of the natural uranium and thorium present in the rock matrix back diffusion from the matrix into the water bearing fractures and advection along these fractures leads to nuclide concentration values that are representative of groundwater flow and transport processes hence interpretation of measured levels of naturally occurring nuclides might provide valuable information about these underlying processes here we have provided mathematical models for the simulation of generation and transport of naturally occurring nuclides in fractured media the proposed analytical solutions have been applied to study 4 he generation and migration in realistic transport pathways the results of these simulations have shown that in fractured crystalline media steady state conditions are attained after thousands to tens of thousands of years one of the developed analytical solution have also been used to infer typical values of transport resistance i e the ratio between the groundwater residence time and the fracture half aperture in the shallow bedrock at olkiluoto finland the results of this analysis have pointed out the very strong retention capacity of the considered fractured system keywords naturally occurring radionuclides fractured media analytical solutions 1 introduction contaminant transport in fractured media is affected by two coupled processes advection along water bearing fractures and diffusion from the flowing fractures into the matrix i e matrix diffusion thanks to the increasing computational power available and the efficiency of modern parallelised computer codes numerical simulations based on different methods and schemes can be used to assess contaminant fate and transport in such media e g hammond et al 2011 stein et al 2017 iraola et al 2019 nonetheless analytical solutions based on gross simplifications of the fracture matrix geometry are still very relevant as they are free of numerical dispersion and due to their generally lower computational requirements can efficiently be used to carry out sensitivity analyses moreover they are the base of time domain particle based algorithms used to assess radionuclide transport in complex fractured systems painter et al 2008 painter and mancillas 2013 trinchero et al 2016 one of the earliest solutions for contaminant transport in fractured rock was presented by neretnieks 1980 based on an analogy with similar solutions for heat transport carslaw and jaeger 1959 neretnieks solution considers an infinite matrix and neglects in plane dispersion this solution was generalised by tang et al 1981 who accounted for longitudinal dispersion in the fracture and sudicky and frind 1982 who considered a limited extent of the rock matrix other extensions of these solutions were provided by neretnieks 2006 infinite matrix and infinite extent of in plane stagnant water cvetkovic 2010 limited layered matrix mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 limited layered matrix and limited extent of in plane stagnant water and shahkarami et al 2016 limited matrix and limited extent of in plane stagnant water with arbitrary length decay chain all the analytical solutions discussed above were developed with the implicit assumption that solute transport occurs as a consequence of some anthropogenically triggered contamination event e g the spill of a contaminant in the near surface system or the release of radionuclides from a broken canister emplaced in a deep geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel however crystalline rocks might contain a certain amount of uranium and thorium e g trinchero et al 2014 and references therein which due to radioactive decay produces radioisotopes such as radium and radon and stable nuclides e g helium that after being released to the porewater diffuse back to the water bearing fractures measured concentrations of these naturally occurring nuclides in the fractures provide valuable information about underlying hydrogeological processes recently trinchero et al 2019 presented a mathematical framework for groundwater age dating in fractured crystalline rock based on 4 he data the authors showed that under the hypothesis of steady state conditions 4 he transport along the flowing fracture can be decoupled from the diffusion equation and thus a closed form expression for groundwater age can be derived here we provide an extension of that mathematical framework that accounts for the transient evolution of a generic naturally produced nuclide at transient state advective and dispersive processes in the fracture are tightly coupled to matrix diffusion hence the corresponding partial differential equations are here solved in laplace space and the corresponding solutions are inverted using a numerical algorithm a relevant difference with most of the available analytical solutions for transport in fractures which are based on the assumption of a semi infinite medium is that here a finite transport pathway is considered and solutions for two different boundary conditions applied at the fracture outlet are provided the mathematical framework is used to analyse the transient evolution of 4 he production and migration in a realistic set of transport pathways and to evaluate characteristic times when steady state conditions are attained a real case application is also presented where 4 he data is used to infer values of transport resistance representative of the shallow bedrock at olkiluoto finland 2 mathematical development 2 1 modelled domain and assumptions the fractured system considered here is analogous to that presented by sudicky and frind 1982 and consists of a system of parallel fractures due to symmetry the system can be simplified by considering just one half of a single fracture and one half of the adjacent rock matrix where an impervious boundary is applied fractures are here generalised as transport pathways of constant properties and unlike the model presented by sudicky and frind 1982 a finite length of the fracture transport pathway is considered fracture aperture is assumed to be sufficiently small so that complete mixing in the fracture can be considered other assumptions are that the permeability of the rock matrix is small enough to neglect advection i e molecular diffusion is the only transport process in the rock matrix and transport along the fracture transport pathway is much faster than in the matrix these assumptions allows transport in the matrix to be considered in the direction perpendicular to the fracture axis only and thus a two dimensional system reduces to two coupled one dimensional problems this commonly employed model is colloquially denoted as the brush model lege and shao 1996 or is more formally referred to as dual continuum disconnected matrix model dcdmm lichtner 2000 besides advection and dispersion in the fracture and molecular diffusion in matrix other processes considered in our models are i nuclide production in the matrix ii nuclide sorption in the matrix and at the fracture surface and iii radioactive decay decay chain is not considered here 2 2 problem statement the notation of this work follows that of sudicky and frind 1982 apostrophe is used to denote parameters and variables of the matrix the differential equation describing solute transport along a fracture is 1 c t v r c y d r 2 c y 2 λ c q rb 0 0 y l where c m l3 is solute concentration v l t is the groundwater velocity in the water bearing fracture r is the surface retardation factor d l2 t is the in plane longitudinal dispersion coefficient λ 1 t is the radioactive decay constant b l is the half fracture aperture and q m l2t is the diffusive flux perpendicular to the fracture axis the differential equation for the matrix is 2 c t d p r 2 c x 2 λ c f r b x b where d p l2 t is the pore diffusion coefficient compared to sudicky and frind 1982 the only difference here is the production term f ml 3t note that x y is a local coordinate system with direction y being parallel to the flow direction and x being perpendicular to the fracture wall the source sink term q in eq 1 is equal to 3 q ϕ d p c x x b where ϕ is matrix porosity eq 1 can be rewritten as 4 c t v r c y d r 2 c y 2 λ c ϕ d p br c y x b 0 the initial and inlet boundary condition for eq 4 are 5a c y 0 0 5b c 0 t c 0 different outlet boundary conditions will be discussed in the sub sections below the initial and boundary conditions for eq 2 are 6a c x y 0 0 6b c b y t c y t 6c c x b y t 0 note that eq 6c assumes a system of parallel fractures with perfectly symmetric transport conditions 2 3 solution for diffusive fluxes in matrix we start by deriving the laplace transform of eq 2 7 p c d p r d 2 c dx 2 λ c f r p the general solution of eq 7 is the sum of the solution of the complementary equation see sudicky and frind 1982 and the particular solution 8 c c 1 cosh g p b x c 2 sinh g p b x f r p p where c 1 and c 2 are integration coefficients p is the laplace variable and g r d p p p λ boundary condition 6c requires c 2 to be equal to zero the first coefficient can be then determined from the continuity equation eq 6b and thus the resulting solution is 9 c c f r p p cosh g p b x cosh σ p f r p p mass flux at the interface between fracture and matrix is 10 q ϕ d p c f r p p g p tanh σ p with σ g b b 2 4 solution for the fracture and d 0 assuming d 0 eq 1 in laplace space takes the form 11 p c v r d c dy ϕ d p br c x x b 0 by substituting eq 10 into eq 11 we get 12 p c v r d c dy ϕ d p br c f r p p g p tanh σ p 0 which we rewrite as 13 d c dy e 2 c e 1 0 with 14 e 2 rp v ϕ r d p p bv tanh σ p and 15 e 1 f r p p ϕ r d p p bv tanh σ p the solution of eq 13 is 16 c c 3 exp e 2 y e 1 e 2 note that this equation depends on a single integration constant c 3 that can be obtained by applying a single boundary condition at the inlet eq 5b this means that the medium can in this case be considered as semi infinite the resulting solution is 17 c c 0 p e 1 e 2 exp e 2 y e 1 e 2 2 5 solution for the fracture d 0 assuming in plane dispersion and using eq 10 the laplace transform of eq 1 takes the form 18 d 2 c dy 2 v d d c dy e 4 c e 3 with 19 e 3 ϕ bd f p d p pr tanh σ p 20 e 4 r d p ϕ r d p p br tanh σ p the solution of eq 18 is 21 c c 1 exp yr c 2 exp yr e 3 e 4 where 22 r v 2 d 1 1 4 rd v 2 2 ϕ r d p p br tanh σ p p in eq 21 c 1 and c 2 are integration constants that need to be evaluated using proper boundary conditions here for the outlet boundary z l we consider two alternative boundary conditions 23a c 0 23b or dc dy 0 while at the inlet the boundary condition is given by eq 5b eq 23a i e dirichlet boundary condition is suited to model e g rapid degassing at the transport pathway outlet whereas eq 23a neumann boundary condition could simulate e g advective discharge in more conductive quaternary sediments for eq 23a i e dirichlet boundary condition the resulting solution reads 24 c e 3 e 4 1 exp yr exp lr c 0 p e 3 e 4 1 1 exp lr 1 exp lr exp lr 1 exp yr exp lr exp yr exp lr whereas with eq 23b neumann boundary condition the solution takes the form 25 c c 0 p e 3 e 4 r exp lr r exp lr r exp lr r exp lr r exp lr exp yr exp yr e 3 e 4 2 6 steady state solution at steady state interfacial mass fluxes between fracture and matrix can be written in ordinary space as 26 q ϕ d p c f r λ g λ tanh σ λ the resulting solution for the water bearing fractures is 27 c e 3 s e 4 s 1 exp y ν exp l ν c 0 e 3 s e 4 s 1 1 exp l ν 1

the neumann boundary condition eq 23b the coefficients are as follow 29 ν v 2 d 1 1 4 rd v 2 2 ϕ r d p λ br tanh σ λ λ 30 e 3 s ϕ bd f d p λ r tanh σ λ and 31 e 4 s r d λ ϕ r d p λ br tanh σ λ at steady state transport in fracture and in matrix are still coupled through the mass flux term eq 26 the two equations can however be uncoupled for non decaying nuclides λ 0 in this case mass flux at the interface between fracture and matrix can be written as 32 q ϕ f b b eq 32 says that the total nuclide production in the matrix is counterbalanced by out diffusive fluxes from the matrix to the fracture this obvious result is particularly useful when e g steady state nuclide levels are assessed using three dimensional discrete fracture network dfn based models e g trinchero et al 2019 neglecting surface retardation the resulting uncoupled solution in the fracture reads 33 c 2 β θ 1 2 f b b b exp pe θ θ 1 exp pe 1 1 exp pe for the dirichlet boundary condition and 34 c 2 β θ 1 2 f b b b θ exp pe exp θ 1 pe pe for the neumann boundary condition here f b f ϕ ml 3t 1 is the bulk production rate in matrix for convenience the solution is written in terms of dimensionless distance θ x l and peclet number pe vl d note also that both solutions are here expressed as a function of transport resistance β l t at the mid point of the transport pathway transport resistance is a hydrodynamic control parameter for matrix diffusion cvetkovic et al 1999 which is also sometimes denoted as f factor neretnieks 1981 for a transport pathway of constant properties the transport resistance is equal to the ratio between groundwater residence time and fracture half aperture 3 synthetic cases 3 1 results of a simple test case test case 1 we solve here the same validation problem presented in trinchero et al 2019 which consists of a small single fracture of 0 5 m length the parameters of the problem are listed in table 1 the peclet number is set equal to 2 5 pe 2 5 and both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions at the fracture outlet are considered we simulate the infiltration of nuclide free water c 0 0 and the production of a non sorbing non decaying nuclide in the rock matrix these conditions mimic 4 he production and migration the model is implemented in the computer code pflotran lichtner et al 2013 hammond et al 2014 and the results are compared with the corresponding analytical solutions eq 24 and eq 25 laplace inversion is performed using the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 hollenbeck 1998 fig 1 shows the evolution of 4 he concentration in the mid point of the fracture as computed by the analytical solution and pflotran when the neumann boundary condition is used the plateau value is higher than the corresponding result obtained when the dirichlet boundary condition is applied at the fracture outlet the numerical solution for an infinite peclet number i e no dispersion is also shown note that this solution implicitly assumes a semi infinite medium and provides the highest plateau values a generally good agreement between the numerical results and the analytical solution is observed in the semi analytical framework presented by trinchero et al 2019 helium levels were analysed under the assumption that mass fluxes from the matrix to the water bearing fracture are at steady state eq 10 can be used to evaluate the temporal evolution of inter facial mass fluxes and the time scale for steady state conditions fig 2 shows the evolution of interfacial fluxes at the mid point of the fracture mass flux increases linearly in log log scale until reaching the expected plateau value q f b b b after 4 y approximately 3 2 results of large scale models test case 2 test case 2 is sub divided into three sub cases tc1a tc1b and tc1c which are based on the realistic transport pathways used as test cases by sudicky and frind 1982 the transport pathway length of each sub case is set equal to the 1 penetration depth i e the distance along the transport pathway where c 0 01 c 0 being c 0 the injection concentration this distance was computed by sudicky and frind 1982 assuming a decaying radionuclide injected at the pathway inlet and with half life equal to t 1 2 12 35 y note that unlike the models presented here in the simulations of sudicky and frind 1982 radionuclide production in the matrix was not considered tc2a consists of a pathway of length l 71 5 m with a fracture spacing of 0 25 m and a velocity of 0 1 m day in tc2b a smaller fracture spacing is considered 0 1 m of available matrix and the pathway length is set equal to 275 m tc2c has a lower velocity 0 0075 m day and same fracture spacing as tc1a concentration at the fracture inlet and outlet is set to zero and a non decaying nuclide is considered to mimic the production and transport of 4 he three observation points are defined op1 at z l 10 m op2 at z l 4 and op3 at z l 2 all the other parameters are listed in table 2 the evolution of 4 he concentration is shown in fig 3 whereas evolution of interfacial fluxes is shown in fig 4 given the considered boundary conditions mass discharge is controlled by gradients at the boundary of the fracture at early times these gradients are low and thus the transport pathway behaves as a zero order reactor with constant interfacial fluxes hence on a log log plot 4 he concentration values lie on a straight line with unitary slope at late times gradients increase until reaching the steady value of eq 26 in all the considered cases steady state conditions are attained after 20 000 y approximately a sensitivity analysis to different parameters was carried out using tc2a result are here showed for observation point op2 only matrix porosity was increased and decreased by a factor of 10 and the resulting interfacial fluxes are shown in fig 5 as shown in eq 26 at steady state 4 he flux and matrix porosity are linearly related and this is evident from the plots where an increase of matrix porosity by a factor of 10 leads to an increase of the plateau value by the same factor and vice verse the time when steady state flux is attained is also linearly dependent with porosity when porosity is very small the transition from an initial to a final constant value of mass flux is no longer evident red dashed line in fig 5 and this leads to 4 he breakthrough curves that slightly deviate from the unit log log slope discussed above results not shown here pore diffusivity which was increased by a factor of 10 and decreased by a factor of 100 see fig 6 has no influence on the steady state 4 he fluxes and therefore on steady state 4 he levels for the base case calculation i e tc2a and for the simulation with increased diffusivity the matrix system can be considered as reaction limited and this explains why no differences are observed when diffusivity is decreased to a very small value the matrix system becomes diffusion limited and a lower non constant flux is observed at early times as for the case of low values of matrix porosity also in this case the 4 he breakthrough curve shows a slight deviation from the unit log log slope the extent of the available matrix b b was increased and decreased by a factor of 4 see fig 7 changing the size of the matrix does not affect the early time behaviour of the matrix system however steady state 4 he fluxes are linearly dependent on the matrix size and the transition between the initial and final constant 4 he fluxes occurs at later times when a larger size of the matrix is available 4 application to helium data at olkiluoto finland olkiluoto is located in the coast of the gulf of bothnia in southwestern finland and has been selected as the national site for geological disposal of high level radioactive waste spent fuel the two main lithological units of the olkiluoto site are high grade metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks posiva 2009 extensive site characterisation was carried out during the past twenty years posiva 2011 and this included several measurements of helium hydrogen and methane dissolved concentration in the groundwater at depth delos et al 2010 these concentration profiles fig 8 were interpreted by trinchero et al 2014 using diffusive models but the shallow part of the domain i e from surface to 250 m depth was excluded from the analysis as in this zone there are evidence of the predominance of advective processes here the shallow helium profile at olkiluoto orange triangles in fig 8 is interpreted using the analytical framework presented in the previous section given the uncertainty related with initial conditions at olkiluoto the steady state solution is used in this analysis eq 33 this equation assumes that 4 he free water infiltrates for the pathway inlet and dirichlet boundary condition at the pathways outlet is used to mimic rapid 4 he degassing in the very shallow part of the domain field data are mapped into the considered transport pathways using the following expression 35 θ i z max z i j z max z min where θ is the dimensionless distance defined as in eq 24 and 25 z i l is the depth of the considered 4 he measurement z max and z min are respectively the minimum and maximum depth of the considered data set z max 39 5 m and z min 255 6 m and j is a scaling factor from eq 35 it is evident that the inlet boundary coincides with the uppermost data sample this choice is consistent with field observations that show that the very shallow part of the geological system at olkiluoto is constituted by high permeable quaternary sediments and by the very shallow bedrock which has a high fracture intensity relatively high permeability and consequently short residence times it should be noted that the scaling factor j defines the position of the samples relative to the outlet boundary for high peclet numbers helium profiles defined by eq 33 are unaffected by the location of the outlet boundary which means that an equally good fit between the in situ data and the analytical solution can be achieved irrespective of the values of j used but provided that the cumulative transport resistance from inlet to the considered data point is preserved in the calculations presented hereafter j 2 which means that the deepest considered sample is located in the mid point of the transport pathways whereas all the other point are located at θ 0 5 this choice is consistent with the fact that all the sampled boreholes are located in the middle of the olkiluoto island which is a recharge area measurements in the shallow bedrock show different trends which are most probably related to different hydrodynamic conditions very high 4 he concentration at around 250 m depth 4 he 7 10 2 mol m w 3 might be related with very long residence times and or large transport resistances while significantly lower concentrations 4 he 1 2 10 2 mol m w 3 at approximately the same depth might be related to more transmissive flowing pathways thus in this analysis we use three different transport pathways denoted with acronyms ltr low transport resistance pathway mtr mid transport resistance pathway and htr high transport resistance pathway four different test cases have been defined c1 to c4 and the related parameters are listed in table 3 in c1 to c3 matrix thickness is set to 3 m the same value was used in radionuclide transport calculations carried out for the safety assessment study of the planned geological repository of olkiluoto poteri et al 2014 in c4 matrix thickness was increased by a factor of 2 the peclet number was varied from a minimum of 2 5 to a maximum of 100 the value of helium bulk production rate reported by trinchero et al 2014 1 2 10 10 mol m 3 y was used in all the considered cases fig 9 shows the computed helium profiles for the three considered transport pathways and the four case studies these profiles have been visually fitted to the helium field data and the corresponding cumulative transport resistances from inlet to mid point are summarised in table 4 most of the field data show a trend that is well approximated by the ltr pathway and thus an additional plot is provided fig 10 where the fit of this transport pathway can be better assessed from table 4 one can see that for an equally good fit increasing transport resistances are needed when the peclet number is decreased c2 whereas smaller transport resistances are used when a larger extent of matrix is available c4 as discussed earlier there are a few data that show a different trend with significantly higher concentration values these data are reproduced by transport pathways mtr and htr which have transport resistances that are from three to five times higher than the corresponding values of the ltr pathway overall the computed transport resistances are very high and fall within the higher range of cumulative transport resistances computed in crystalline media for transport pathways connecting repository depth to surface selroos and painter 2012 this result points out the very strong radionuclide retention capacity of the olkiluoto bedrock 5 discussion the proposed mathematical models are based on the assumption of a homogeneous pathway matrix system however fractured media are heterogeneous at the scale of a single fracture e g watanabe et al b4 2009 zou et al 2017 as well as at the fracture network scale e g selroos and painter 2012 follin et al 2014 this heterogeneity leads to transport patterns that differ from what is predicted by the advection dispersion equation ade this behaviour is often denoted as anomalous or non fickian neuman and tartakovsky 2009 and references therein matrix diffusion is also a source of anomalous transport carrera et al 1998 therefore this discussion is focused on possible sources of heterogeneity the related uncertainties and how these could be addressed the concentration of a nuclide in the water bearing fracture is a function of the hydrodynamic control parameter β which is in turn dependent on the fracture aperture and is strongly correlated with the groundwater residence time through a shared dependence on the velocity field painter et al 2008 fracture aperture depends on in situ stress conditions and is also a function of structural and geological properties selroos et al 2019 hence in natural conditions β varies on a segment scale a segment is here defined as the part of a pathway that lies in a fracture and is delimited by the intersection with two adjacent fractures segment to segment variability could be accounted by framing the proposed analytical solution in a time domain random walk tdrw scheme e g painter et al 2008 noetinger et al 2016 other analytical solutions for anthropogenically derived contaminants e g tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 cvetkovic 2010 have been previously included in a tdrw computer code using a similar approach painter et al 2008 painter and mancillas 2013 in plane variability i e changes of β at the scale of a single fracture i e of a segment could also be considered by e g using appropriate downscaling algorithms painter and cvetkovic 2005 the production term in eq 2 depends on the content of natural uranium and thorium in the rock matrix which might vary depending on the lithological unit this variability can be accounted for by using different rock types in a tdrw framework selroos and painter 2012 higher uncertainty is related to the amount of produced nuclides that is actually released to the matrix pore water in fact atoms generated by α decay e g radon radium and helium itself recoil and can exit the mineral grain only if they are sufficiently close to the grain surface neretnieks 2013 liu and neretnieks 1996 provided an expression for the evaluation of the fraction of nuclide atoms that are released to the water also denoted as emanation factor the expression is a function of the distance that the specific nuclide atom can travel in mineral and water and of the local porosity around the mineral grain while it is independent of the mineral grain size emanation factors could in principle be used to scale the production term in eq 2 however the aforementioned mathematical expression is based on a rather high level of empiricism which leads to high uncertainty in the associated emanation factors in general low emanation factors are expected for e g radium and radon due to their relatively small travel distances while helium is likely to have higher emanation factors 6 summary and conclusions in fractured crystalline media naturally occurring nuclides are produced by the decay of natural uranium and thorium present in the rock matrix some of these nuclides are stable i e non decaying nuclides while others are unstable i e decaying radioisotopes moreover some elements might interact with the available mineral surface i e sorbing nuclides whereas others behave as passive solutes i e non sorbing nuclides here we have presented mathematical models for the simulation of generation and transport of naturally occurring nuclides in fractured media the proposed analytical solutions extend those recently presented by trinchero et al 2019 by accounting for transient conditions retardation in both matrix and fracture surface and radioactive decay the models have been used to mimic 4 he generation and migration in different fractured systems first a simple test case has been used to validate the analytical solutions by comparing them with the results obtained with numerical calculations a realistic test case in which parameters such as groundwater velocity and fracture spacing have been changed has been used to assess time scales for 4 he production and migration the results have shown that at early times the system behaves as a zero order reactor with constant interfacial fluxes and with 4 he concentration values lying on a straight line with unit slope on a log log plot at late times interfacial fluxes increase until reaching a new constant value which is a function of the bulk 4 he production rate and the matrix extent the time when steady state conditions are attained is of the order of thousands to tens of thousands of years sensitivity to matrix porosity pore diffusivity and matrix extent has also been tested for very low values of porosity or pore diffusivity at early times interfacial fluxes show a slow increase which leads to 4 he early time breakthrough curves that slightly deviate from the unit log log slope one of the analytical solutions has been used to interpret helium data in the shallow bedrock at olkiluoto finland an interesting contribution of this application is to show that the proposed analytical framework can be used to infer typical values of transport resistance i e the ratio between groundwater residence time and fracture half aperture one of the key parameters controlling radionuclide retention in fractured media cvetkovic et al 1999 helium data at olkiluoto show different trends that have been modelled by means of different transport pathways each of them characterised by different transport resistances the computed transport resistances are very high which points out the very strong radionuclide retention capacity of the olkiluoto bedrock declaration of competing

5974,in fractured media naturally occurring nuclides are produced by the decay of the natural uranium and thorium present in the rock matrix back diffusion from the matrix into the water bearing fractures and advection along these fractures leads to nuclide concentration values that are representative of groundwater flow and transport processes hence interpretation of measured levels of naturally occurring nuclides might provide valuable information about these underlying processes here we have provided mathematical models for the simulation of generation and transport of naturally occurring nuclides in fractured media the proposed analytical solutions have been applied to study 4 he generation and migration in realistic transport pathways the results of these simulations have shown that in fractured crystalline media steady state conditions are attained after thousands to tens of thousands of years one of the developed analytical solution have also been used to infer typical values of transport resistance i e the ratio between the groundwater residence time and the fracture half aperture in the shallow bedrock at olkiluoto finland the results of this analysis have pointed out the very strong retention capacity of the considered fractured system keywords naturally occurring radionuclides fractured media analytical solutions 1 introduction contaminant transport in fractured media is affected by two coupled processes advection along water bearing fractures and diffusion from the flowing fractures into the matrix i e matrix diffusion thanks to the increasing computational power available and the efficiency of modern parallelised computer codes numerical simulations based on different methods and schemes can be used to assess contaminant fate and transport in such media e g hammond et al 2011 stein et al 2017 iraola et al 2019 nonetheless analytical solutions based on gross simplifications of the fracture matrix geometry are still very relevant as they are free of numerical dispersion and due to their generally lower computational requirements can efficiently be used to carry out sensitivity analyses moreover they are the base of time domain particle based algorithms used to assess radionuclide transport in complex fractured systems painter et al 2008 painter and mancillas 2013 trinchero et al 2016 one of the earliest solutions for contaminant transport in fractured rock was presented by neretnieks 1980 based on an analogy with similar solutions for heat transport carslaw and jaeger 1959 neretnieks solution considers an infinite matrix and neglects in plane dispersion this solution was generalised by tang et al 1981 who accounted for longitudinal dispersion in the fracture and sudicky and frind 1982 who considered a limited extent of the rock matrix other extensions of these solutions were provided by neretnieks 2006 infinite matrix and infinite extent of in plane stagnant water cvetkovic 2010 limited layered matrix mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 limited layered matrix and limited extent of in plane stagnant water and shahkarami et al 2016 limited matrix and limited extent of in plane stagnant water with arbitrary length decay chain all the analytical solutions discussed above were developed with the implicit assumption that solute transport occurs as a consequence of some anthropogenically triggered contamination event e g the spill of a contaminant in the near surface system or the release of radionuclides from a broken canister emplaced in a deep geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel however crystalline rocks might contain a certain amount of uranium and thorium e g trinchero et al 2014 and references therein which due to radioactive decay produces radioisotopes such as radium and radon and stable nuclides e g helium that after being released to the porewater diffuse back to the water bearing fractures measured concentrations of these naturally occurring nuclides in the fractures provide valuable information about underlying hydrogeological processes recently trinchero et al 2019 presented a mathematical framework for groundwater age dating in fractured crystalline rock based on 4 he data the authors showed that under the hypothesis of steady state conditions 4 he transport along the flowing fracture can be decoupled from the diffusion equation and thus a closed form expression for groundwater age can be derived here we provide an extension of that mathematical framework that accounts for the transient evolution of a generic naturally produced nuclide at transient state advective and dispersive processes in the fracture are tightly coupled to matrix diffusion hence the corresponding partial differential equations are here solved in laplace space and the corresponding solutions are inverted using a numerical algorithm a relevant difference with most of the available analytical solutions for transport in fractures which are based on the assumption of a semi infinite medium is that here a finite transport pathway is considered and solutions for two different boundary conditions applied at the fracture outlet are provided the mathematical framework is used to analyse the transient evolution of 4 he production and migration in a realistic set of transport pathways and to evaluate characteristic times when steady state conditions are attained a real case application is also presented where 4 he data is used to infer values of transport resistance representative of the shallow bedrock at olkiluoto finland 2 mathematical development 2 1 modelled domain and assumptions the fractured system considered here is analogous to that presented by sudicky and frind 1982 and consists of a system of parallel fractures due to symmetry the system can be simplified by considering just one half of a single fracture and one half of the adjacent rock matrix where an impervious boundary is applied fractures are here generalised as transport pathways of constant properties and unlike the model presented by sudicky and frind 1982 a finite length of the fracture transport pathway is considered fracture aperture is assumed to be sufficiently small so that complete mixing in the fracture can be considered other assumptions are that the permeability of the rock matrix is small enough to neglect advection i e molecular diffusion is the only transport process in the rock matrix and transport along the fracture transport pathway is much faster than in the matrix these assumptions allows transport in the matrix to be considered in the direction perpendicular to the fracture axis only and thus a two dimensional system reduces to two coupled one dimensional problems this commonly employed model is colloquially denoted as the brush

matrix other processes considered in our models are i nuclide production in the matrix ii nuclide sorption in the matrix and at the fracture surface and iii radioactive decay decay chain is not considered here 2 2 problem statement the notation of this work follows that of sudicky and frind 1982 apostrophe is used to denote parameters and variables of the matrix the differential equation describing solute transport along a fracture is 1 c t v r c y d r 2 c y 2 λ c q rb 0 0 y l where c m l3 is solute concentration v l t is the groundwater velocity in the water bearing fracture r is the surface retardation factor d l2 t is the in plane longitudinal dispersion coefficient λ 1 t is the radioactive decay constant b l is the half fracture aperture and q m l2t is the diffusive flux

of eq 2 7 p c d p r d 2 c dx 2 λ c f r p the general solution of eq 7 is the sum of the solution of the complementary equation see sudicky and frind 1982 and the particular solution 8 c c 1 cosh g p b

get 12 p c v r d c dy ϕ d p br c f r p p g p tanh σ p 0 which we rewrite as 13 d c dy e 2 c e 1 0 with 14 e 2 rp v ϕ r d p p bv tanh σ p and 15 e 1 f r p p ϕ r d p p bv tanh σ p the solution of eq 13 is 16 c c 3 exp e 2 y e 1 e 2 note that this equation depends on a single integration constant c 3 that can be obtained by applying a single boundary condition at the inlet eq 5b this means that the medium can in this case be considered as semi infinite the resulting solution is 17 c c 0 p e 1 e 2 exp e 2 y e 1 e 2 2 5 solution for the fracture d 0 assuming in plane dispersion and using eq 10 the

rapid degassing at the transport pathway outlet whereas eq 23a neumann boundary condition could simulate e g advective discharge in more conductive quaternary sediments for eq 23a i e dirichlet

steady state transport in fracture and in matrix are still coupled through the mass flux term eq 26 the two equations can however be uncoupled for non decaying nuclides λ 0 in this case mass flux at the interface between fracture and matrix can be written as 32 q ϕ f b b eq 32 says that the total nuclide production in the matrix is counterbalanced by out diffusive fluxes from the matrix to the fracture this obvious result is particularly useful when e g steady state nuclide levels are assessed using three dimensional discrete fracture network dfn based models e g trinchero et al 2019 neglecting surface retardation the resulting uncoupled solution in the fracture reads 33 c 2 β θ 1 2 f b b b exp pe θ θ 1 exp pe 1 1 exp pe for the dirichlet boundary condition and 34 c 2 β θ 1 2 f b b b θ exp pe exp θ 1 pe pe for the neumann boundary condition here f b f ϕ ml 3t 1 is the bulk production rate in matrix for convenience the solution is written in terms of dimensionless distance θ x l and peclet number pe vl d note also that both solutions are here expressed as a function of transport resistance β l t at the mid point of the transport pathway transport resistance is a hydrodynamic control parameter for matrix diffusion cvetkovic et al 1999 which is also sometimes denoted as f factor neretnieks 1981 for a transport pathway of constant properties the transport resistance is equal to the ratio between groundwater residence time and fracture half aperture 3 synthetic cases 3 1 results of a simple test case test case 1 we solve here the same validation problem presented in trinchero et al 2019 which consists of a small single fracture of 0 5 m length the parameters of the problem are listed in table 1 the peclet number is set equal to 2 5 pe 2 5 and both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions at the fracture outlet are considered we simulate the infiltration of nuclide free water c 0 0 and the production of a non sorbing non decaying nuclide in the rock matrix these conditions mimic 4 he production and migration the model is implemented in the computer code pflotran lichtner et al 2013 hammond et al 2014 and the results are compared with the corresponding analytical solutions eq 24 and eq 25 laplace inversion is performed using the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 hollenbeck 1998 fig 1 shows the evolution of 4 he concentration in the mid point of the fracture as computed by the analytical solution and pflotran when the neumann boundary condition is used the plateau value is higher than the corresponding result obtained when the dirichlet boundary condition is applied at the fracture outlet the numerical solution for an infinite peclet number i e no dispersion is also shown note that this solution implicitly assumes a semi infinite medium and provides the highest plateau values a generally good agreement between the numerical results and the analytical solution is observed in the semi analytical framework presented by trinchero et al 2019 helium levels were analysed under the assumption that mass fluxes from the matrix to the water bearing fracture are at steady state eq 10 can be used to evaluate the temporal evolution of inter facial mass fluxes and the time scale for steady state conditions fig 2 shows the evolution of interfacial fluxes at the mid point of the fracture mass flux increases linearly in log log scale until reaching the expected plateau value q f b b b after 4 y approximately 3 2 results of large scale models test case 2 test case 2 is sub divided into three sub cases tc1a tc1b and tc1c which are based on the realistic transport pathways used as test cases by sudicky and frind 1982 the transport pathway length of each sub case is set equal to the 1 penetration depth i e the distance along the transport pathway where c 0 01 c 0 being c 0 the injection concentration this distance was computed by sudicky and frind 1982 assuming a decaying radionuclide injected at the pathway inlet and with half life equal to t 1 2 12 35 y note that unlike the models presented here in the simulations of sudicky and frind 1982 radionuclide production in the matrix was not considered tc2a consists of a pathway of length l 71 5 m with a fracture spacing of 0 25 m and a velocity of 0 1 m day in tc2b a smaller fracture spacing is considered 0 1 m of available matrix and the pathway length is set equal to 275 m tc2c has a lower velocity 0 0075 m day and same fracture spacing as tc1a concentration at the fracture inlet and outlet is set to zero and a non decaying nuclide is considered to mimic the production and transport of 4 he three observation points are defined op1 at z l 10 m op2 at z l 4 and op3 at z l 2 all the other parameters are listed in table 2 the evolution of 4 he concentration is shown in fig 3 whereas evolution of interfacial fluxes is shown in fig 4 given the considered boundary conditions mass discharge is controlled by gradients at the boundary of the fracture at early times these gradients are low and thus the transport pathway behaves as a zero order reactor with constant interfacial fluxes hence on a log log plot 4 he concentration values lie on a straight line with unitary slope at late times gradients increase until reaching the steady value of eq 26 in all the considered cases steady state conditions are attained after 20 000 y approximately a sensitivity analysis to different parameters was carried out using tc2a result are here showed for observation point op2 only matrix porosity was increased and decreased by a factor of 10 and the resulting interfacial fluxes are shown in fig 5 as shown in eq 26 at steady state 4 he flux and matrix porosity are linearly related and this is evident from the plots where an increase of matrix porosity by a factor of 10 leads to an increase of the plateau value by the same factor and vice verse the time when steady state flux is attained is also linearly dependent with porosity when porosity is very small the transition from an initial to a final constant value of mass flux is no longer evident red dashed line in fig 5 and this leads to 4 he breakthrough curves that slightly deviate from the unit log log slope discussed above results not shown here pore diffusivity which was increased by a factor of 10 and decreased by a factor of 100 see fig 6 has no influence on the steady state 4 he fluxes and therefore on steady state 4 he levels for the base case calculation i e tc2a and for the simulation with increased diffusivity the matrix system can be considered as reaction limited and this explains why no differences are observed when diffusivity is decreased to a very small value the matrix system becomes diffusion limited and a lower non constant flux is observed at early times as for the case of low values of matrix porosity also in this case the 4 he breakthrough curve shows a slight deviation from the unit log log slope the extent of the available matrix b b was increased and decreased by a factor of 4 see fig 7 changing the size of the matrix does not affect the early time behaviour of the matrix system however steady state 4 he fluxes are linearly dependent on the matrix size and the transition between the initial and final constant 4 he fluxes occurs at later times when a larger size of the matrix is available 4 application to helium data at olkiluoto finland olkiluoto is located in the coast of the gulf of bothnia in southwestern finland and has been selected as the national site for geological disposal of high level radioactive waste spent fuel the two main lithological units of the olkiluoto site are high grade metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks posiva 2009 extensive site characterisation was carried out during the past twenty years posiva 2011 and this included several measurements of helium hydrogen and methane dissolved concentration in the groundwater at depth delos et al 2010 these concentration profiles fig 8 were interpreted by trinchero et al 2014 using diffusive models but the shallow part of the domain i e from surface to 250 m depth was excluded from the analysis as in this zone there are evidence of the predominance of advective processes here the shallow helium profile at olkiluoto orange triangles in fig 8 is interpreted using the analytical framework presented in the previous section given the uncertainty related with initial conditions at olkiluoto the steady state solution is used in this analysis eq 33 this equation assumes that 4 he free water infiltrates for the pathway inlet and dirichlet boundary condition at the pathways outlet is used to mimic rapid 4 he degassing in the very shallow part of the domain field data are mapped into the considered transport pathways using the following expression 35 θ i z max z i j z max z min where θ is the dimensionless distance defined as in eq 24 and 25 z i l is the depth of the considered 4 he measurement z max and z min are respectively the minimum and maximum depth of the considered data set z max 39 5 m and z min 255 6 m and j is a scaling factor from eq 35 it is evident that the inlet boundary coincides with the uppermost data sample this choice is consistent with field observations that show that the very shallow part of the geological system at olkiluoto is constituted by high permeable quaternary sediments and by the very shallow bedrock which has a high fracture intensity relatively high permeability and consequently short residence times it should be noted that the scaling factor j defines the position of the samples relative to the outlet boundary for high peclet numbers helium profiles defined by eq 33 are unaffected by the location of the outlet boundary which means that an equally good fit between the in situ data and the analytical solution can be achieved irrespective of the values of j used but provided that the cumulative transport resistance from inlet to the considered data point is preserved in the calculations presented hereafter j 2 which means that the deepest considered sample is located in the mid point of the transport pathways whereas all the other point are located at θ 0 5 this choice is consistent with the fact that all the sampled boreholes are located in the middle of the olkiluoto island which is a recharge area measurements in the shallow bedrock show different trends which are most probably related to different hydrodynamic conditions very high 4 he concentration at around 250 m depth 4 he 7 10 2 mol m w 3 might be related with very long residence times and or large transport resistances while significantly lower concentrations 4 he 1 2 10 2 mol m w 3 at approximately the same depth might be related to more transmissive flowing pathways thus in this analysis we use three different transport pathways denoted with acronyms ltr low transport resistance pathway mtr mid transport resistance pathway and htr high transport resistance pathway four different test cases have been defined c1 to c4 and the related parameters are listed in table 3 in c1 to c3 matrix thickness is set to 3 m the same value was used in radionuclide transport calculations carried out for the safety assessment study of the planned geological repository of olkiluoto poteri et al 2014 in c4 matrix thickness was increased by a factor of 2 the peclet number was varied from a minimum of 2 5 to a maximum of 100 the value of helium bulk production rate reported by trinchero et al 2014 1 2 10 10 mol m 3 y was used in all the considered cases fig 9 shows the computed helium profiles for the three considered transport pathways and the four case studies these profiles have been visually fitted to the helium field data and the corresponding cumulative transport resistances from inlet to mid point are summarised in table 4 most of the field data show a trend that is well approximated by the ltr pathway and thus an additional plot is provided fig 10 where the fit of this transport pathway can be better assessed from table 4 one can see that for an equally good fit increasing transport resistances are needed when the peclet number is decreased c2 whereas smaller transport resistances are used when a larger extent of matrix is available c4 as discussed earlier there are a few data that show a different trend with significantly higher concentration values these data are reproduced by transport pathways mtr and htr which have transport resistances that are from three to five times higher than the corresponding values of the ltr pathway overall the computed transport resistances are very high and fall within the higher range of cumulative transport resistances computed in crystalline media for transport pathways connecting repository depth to surface selroos and painter 2012 this result points out the very strong radionuclide retention capacity of the olkiluoto bedrock 5 discussion the proposed mathematical models are based on the assumption of a homogeneous pathway matrix system however fractured media are heterogeneous at the scale of a single fracture e g watanabe et al b4 2009 zou et al 2017 as well as at the fracture network scale e g selroos and painter 2012 follin et al 2014 this heterogeneity leads to transport patterns that differ from what is predicted by the advection dispersion equation ade this behaviour is often denoted as anomalous or non fickian neuman and tartakovsky 2009 and references therein matrix diffusion is also a source of anomalous transport carrera et al 1998 therefore this discussion is focused on possible sources of heterogeneity the related uncertainties and how these could be addressed the concentration of a nuclide in the water bearing fracture is a function of the hydrodynamic control parameter β which is in turn dependent on the fracture aperture and is strongly correlated with the groundwater residence time through a shared dependence on the velocity field painter et al 2008 fracture aperture depends on in situ stress conditions and is also a function of structural and geological properties selroos et al 2019 hence in natural conditions β varies on a segment scale a segment is here defined as the part of a pathway that lies in a fracture and is delimited by the intersection with two adjacent fractures segment to segment variability could be accounted by framing the proposed analytical solution in a time domain random walk tdrw scheme e g painter et al 2008 noetinger et al 2016 other analytical solutions for anthropogenically derived contaminants e g tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 cvetkovic 2010 have been previously included in a tdrw computer code using a similar approach painter et al 2008 painter and mancillas 2013 in plane variability i e changes of β at the scale of a single fracture i e of a segment could also be considered by e g using appropriate downscaling algorithms painter and cvetkovic 2005 the production term in eq 2 depends on the content of natural uranium and thorium in the rock matrix which might vary depending on the lithological unit this variability can be accounted for by using different rock types in a tdrw framework selroos and painter 2012 higher uncertainty is related to the amount of produced nuclides that is actually released to the matrix pore water in fact atoms generated by α decay e g radon radium and helium itself recoil and can exit the mineral grain only if they are sufficiently close to the grain surface neretnieks 2013 liu and neretnieks 1996 provided an expression for the evaluation of the fraction of nuclide atoms that are released to the water also denoted as emanation factor the expression is a function of the distance that the specific nuclide atom can travel in mineral and water and of the local porosity around the mineral grain while it is independent of the mineral grain size emanation factors could in principle be used to scale the production term in eq 2 however the aforementioned mathematical expression is based on a rather high level of empiricism which leads to high uncertainty in the associated emanation factors in general low emanation factors are expected for e g radium and radon due to their relatively small travel distances while helium is likely to have higher emanation factors 6 summary and conclusions in fractured crystalline media naturally occurring nuclides are produced by the decay of natural uranium and thorium present in the rock matrix some of these nuclides are stable i e non decaying nuclides while others are unstable i e decaying radioisotopes moreover some elements might interact with the available mineral surface i e sorbing nuclides whereas others behave as passive solutes i e non sorbing nuclides here we have presented mathematical models for the simulation of generation and transport of naturally occurring nuclides in fractured media the proposed analytical solutions extend those recently presented by trinchero et al 2019 by accounting for transient conditions retardation in both matrix and fracture surface and radioactive decay the models have been used to mimic 4 he generation and migration in different fractured systems first a simple test case has been used to validate the analytical solutions by comparing them with the results obtained with numerical calculations a realistic test case in which parameters such as groundwater velocity and fracture spacing have been changed has been used to assess time scales for 4 he production and migration the results have shown that at early times the system behaves as a zero order reactor with constant interfacial fluxes and with 4 he concentration values lying on a straight line with unit slope on a log log plot at late times interfacial fluxes increase until reaching a new constant value which is a function of the bulk 4 he production rate and the matrix extent the time when steady state conditions are attained is of the order of thousands to tens of thousands of years sensitivity to matrix porosity pore diffusivity and matrix extent has also been tested for very low values of porosity or pore diffusivity at early times interfacial fluxes show a slow increase which leads to 4 he early time breakthrough curves that slightly deviate from the unit log log slope one of the analytical solutions has been used to interpret helium data in the shallow bedrock at olkiluoto finland an interesting contribution of this application is to show that the proposed analytical framework can be used to infer typical values of transport resistance i e the ratio between groundwater residence time and fracture half aperture one of the key parameters controlling radionuclide retention in fractured media cvetkovic et al 1999 helium data at olkiluoto show different trends that have been modelled by means of different transport pathways each of them characterised by different transport resistances the computed transport resistances are very high which points out the very strong radionuclide retention capacity of the olkiluoto bedrock declaration of competing
