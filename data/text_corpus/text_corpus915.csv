4575,saline lakes are characterized by high salinity and limited biological diversity the nutrient cycle directly determines biological diversity many factors including internal loading riverine inflows salinity and or anthropogenic activities affect the nutrient cycle in saline lakes the badain jaran desert bjd is featured by hyper arid climate and by mega sand dune lake landscapes in this study nutrients in groundwater and lake water in the bjd were analyzed to explore the control factors on the nutrient cycle results show that 76 of the lakes are nitrogen limited and the rests are phosphorus limited 56 of lakeside groundwater samples are phosphorus limited and the rests nitrogen limited and most of the well water in the mountain area surrounding the bjd is phosphorus limited the lake water in the bjd is mainly supported by mountain block recharge and local groundwater but nutrients in lake water are mainly supplied by the mountain block recharge and lakebed diffusion lakebed diffusion delivers up to 70 total ammonium and 97 6 total orthophosphate to the lake water while mountain block recharge accounts for about 72 nitrate nitrite and about 73 silicate to the lake water nutrients in local groundwater systems are highly variable due to the complexity of hydrological and hydrogeochemical conditions rainfall precipitation dissolution and redox reaction this study systematically investigates the control factors on the nutrient structure and cycle in groundwater and lake water in the bjd the findings of this study will be constructive to explore the nutrient cycle in saline lakes worldwide with similar hydrogeological conditions keywords desert saline lake nutrients mountain block recharge lakebed diffusion local groundwater flow 1 introduction nutrient cycles in water bodies have been investigated extensively cook et al 2010 liu et al 2018 pasche et al 2009 nutrient cycles are closely related to the degeneration of submerged macrophytes excessive phytoplankton growth and algae blooms wu et al 2017 previous studies have shown that the supply of nitrogen n or phosphorous p is the key factor influencing the autotrophic production of organic matter om koerselman and arthur 1996 moore et al 2013 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 sepehri et al 2020 whether a water body is n or p limited is not only dependent on the nutrient dynamics of the water body but also hydrological and hydrogeological conditions around it arbuckle and downing 2001 mclauchlan et al 2013 stoliker et al 2016 saline lakes are commonplace in endorheic basins or coastal areas studies on the input and the biogeochemical cycle of nutrients in saline lakes are frequently reported canfield and green 1985 macintyre et al 1999 naftz et al 2008 pilati et al 2016 ram√≠rez olvera et al 2009 however the dominant factors on the states and cycles of nutrients in saline lakes are site specific for example mono lake was n limited macintyre et al 1999 and the closed basin lake vanda in the antarctic to be p limited canfield and green 1985 lakebed diffusion and riverine inflows stiller and nissenbaum 1999 lake size guildford et al 1994 waterbird aggregation batanero et al 2017 and loadings from anthropogenic activities reuter et al 1993 all can exert an impact on the dynamics and cycle of nutrients in saline lakes however these studies on saline lakes mainly covered local nutrient sources but did not consider regional nutrient sources the badain jaran desert bjd the second largest desert in china is famous for the tallest stationary sand dune on earth up to 460 m and a unique mega sand dune lake landscape there are over 140 lakes in the inter dune depressions among which 70 lakes are perennial the salinity of these lakes ranges from 0 5 to over 480 g l jiao et al 2015 rioual et al 2013 most of them are saline lakes and only several lakes are fresh there is no river flowing into or out these lakes and these lakes are mainly recharged by groundwater and with minor water input from direct rainfall recharge on the lake surface wang and zhou 2018 these saline lakes support a unique aquatic habitat because of their high salt content environment two invertebrates brine flies ephydra spp and brine shrimp artemia franciscana can survive in saline lakes the brine shrimp is commercially valuable because their eggs can be collected as food for newly hatched fish on the other hand the brine shrimp and flies are also the main food supply for birds the brine shrimp feeds primarily on algae the latter is predominately regulated by nutrient components and dynamics in lake water as shown in the previous study the lakes are mainly recharged by groundwater from local and regional flow zhang et al 2021 both of which are pathways of nutrients delivering to the lakes this study is intended to explore the possible control factors on the nutrient cycle in the bjd twenty one saline lakes are investigated and south sumujaran lake the second largest lake in the bjd is selected as a representative lake for detailed study first physical and chemical properties nutrient concentrations and nutrient limitations of lakeside groundwater well water and lake water are presented then the physical and biogeochemical controls on nutrient concentration are analyzed quantitatively based on spearman correlation analysis finally the possible chemical reactions of each nutrient species are discussed and nutrient fluxes to the south sumujaran lake are quantified 2 description of study site the bjd occupies the western part of the alxa plateau china the desert is bounded by yabulai and heishantou mountain mt in the south fig 1 a the ground elevations decrease from greater than 1600 m in the mountainous areas to 1200 m in the inter dune lake area each lake is sandwiched with mega sand dunes with a height relative to the lake surface from 200 to 460 m the climate is hyper arid with a rainfall rate ranging from 68 to 172 mm a hou et al 2016 and an evaporation rate ranging from 1040 to 1260 mm a yang et al 2017 the local rainfall recharge is far less than the volume of evaporation thus the desert is believed to receive a large amount of water from the mountainous areas to supply the water deficit between local rainfall recharge and evaporation consumption the prevailing wind blows from the northwest to the southeast the compound transverse sand dune is distributed in the direction from the northeast to the southwest generally at right angles with the wind direction dong et al 2013 the bjd is located in one of the basin depressions of alxa tectonic block there are mainly three sedimentary formations in the desert fig 2 the cretaceous sandstones form the deepest aquifer with thickness ranging from 1 000 to 4 000 m wang et al 2014 the overlying unit consists of a semi permeable neogene clay and fine sandstone ma et al 2007 the uppermost unit is quaternary sandy sediment with a depth varying from 100 to 300 m this loose sediment aquifer offers a vast space for groundwater storage the hydraulic conductivity of the quaternary sediment neogene sandstone and cretaceous sandstone is 3 20 0 5 5 0 02 0 2 m d zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2014 the regional groundwater flow is shown in fig 2 the groundwater level decreases from more than 1300 m in the southern mountainous areas to 1000 m in the gulunai wetlands fig 2a and b indicating that the regional groundwater flow direction is generally from the south to the north the thickness of the unsaturated zone inside the mega transverse sand dunes ranges from close to zero near the lakeshore to over 300 m below the peak of the sand dunes these sand dunes play a role in capturing rainfall and storing water moisture the water mound inside the sand dune is significantly different from the surface topography above the regional groundwater flow system local and intermediate groundwater flow systems are developed the local groundwater flow systems are originated from adjacent water mounds inside the sand dunes the recharge from the mountainous area is defined as mountain block recharge markovich et al 2019 and sourced from the yabulai and heishantou mts thus the lake water is mainly supplied by mountain block recharge and local groundwater flow zhang et al 2021 most of the lakes are saline or even brine but fresh groundwater can still be easily found surrounding each lake fresh springs and diffusive seepage faces usually outcrop on the lakeshore and at the lakebed the depth of nearshore fresh groundwater is very shallow so that groundwater can support the growth of the plant in the vicinity around each lake populus euphratica elaeagnus angustifolia tamarix spp phragmites communis achnatherum splendens sophora alopecuroides glycyrrhiza uralensis carex sp are the popular plant species in the lake shore area yang et al 2003 south sumujaran lake n39 7906 e102 4229 is about 50 km away from the yabulai mt fig 1b this lake is about 1 26 km2 and has a maximum depth of 11 m similar to many other lakes in the desert this lake is mainly sustained by mountain block recharge and local groundwater while capturing minor rainfall on the lake surface the latest study found that about one quarter of groundwater was sourced from the local flow systems and the remaining three quarters from mountain block recharge zhang et al 2021 contributions of direct rainfall to the lake surface local groundwater and mountain block recharge are about 1 48 105 2 7 3 7 105 and 1 0 1 1 106 m3 a respectively zhang et al 2021 there are two springs found on the lakeshore fig 1b spring in the southeast of the lake has a large flow rate of about 3 4 l s and its annual discharge rate is comparable to that of the local groundwater thus this spring is the most likely sourced from mountain block recharge in winter when most areas of the lake surface are frozen there is a melting zone with a diameter of about 60 m surrounding this spring whose temperature is 16 spring in the northwest is ephemeral and only active in the spring season and hence it is likely recharged by local rainfall springs were also found in the lakebed as indicated by salinity and temperature anomalies gong et al 2016 3 material and methods 3 1 field sampling lake water in the south sumujaran lake was sampled in july 2018 by a raft with auto motor n1 to n8 were the sampling sites in the lake fig 1b as the lake water depth varies at these sites the number of samples at each site increases with water depth a total of 22 lake water samples were collected in this lake two multilevel sampling systems were installed at the west and east sides of the south sumujaran lake in june 2018 fig 1b and fig 3 zhang et al 2021 each groundwater sampling well consists of several nylon tubes whose water inlets are buried at different depths twenty two and twenty one groundwater samples were collected respectively at the west and east groundwater sampling transects in october 2018 generally the east transect is mainly composed of sand while the west transect composed of sand and black silt the silt content increases towards the lakeshore it is suggested that the vicinity close to the lake is the former lakebed when the lake level was higher than the present eight lakebed pore water samples in two sites fig 1b were also collected using push point samplers m h e co and the groundwater was pumped out with a peristaltic pump luo et al 2016 one spring water sample in the southeast of the lake shoreline was collected besides south sumujaran lake lake water samples in other 20 lakes were also collected in july 2018 about 54 lakeside groundwater in total were sampled most of them were collected using push point samplers some lakeside groundwater samples were pumped out from domestic wells in the southern mountainous areas the groundwater level is usually very deep and a total of 62 groundwater samples were collected from domestic wells all the samples were filtered in situ through a 0 45 Œºm cellulose acetate membrane poisoned with saturated hgcl2 solution and stored in the refrigeration environment 4 3 2 lab analytical methods salinity ph temperature and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured immediately after sample collection with portable multi parameter probes hanna hi 98194 accuracies of these parameters are 0 01 psu for salinity 0 02 for ph 0 15 for temperature and 1 0 mv for orp concentrations of ammonia nh4 nitrate and nitrite together designated as nox orthophosphate hxpo4 3 x and silicon si were measured using flow injection analyzer lachat instruments auickchem 8000 within one month after sampling errors of nutrient analysis are 10 for nh4 8 for nox and 5 for hxpo4 3 x a toc tn analyzer multi n c3000 analytic jena ag germany was used to determine the contents of dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn of the samples errors of analysis of doc and tn are both 3 3 3 statistical analysis correlations between ph orp salinity doc tn and nutrient concentrations were evaluated using spearman correlation in sigmaplot 12 0 curve fittings were generated using sigmaplot 12 0 since the nutrients have concentrations range over several orders of magnitude the nutrient concentrations in the contour plots of the two groundwater transects were presented as log10 values contour plots were drawn using surfer 12 4 results 4 1 nutrient concentrations in groundwater lakebed pore water and spring water of the south sumujaran lake the groundwater of the samples from the east transect are all fresh salinity 0 5 but that of samples in the west transect can be fresh and saline table 1 the water type changes from na hco3 cl in saline groundwater to na cl or na hco3 in fresh groundwater zhang et al 2021 generally fresh groundwater in the east transect is oxidizing with a mean orp value of 31 98 mv while fresh groundwater in the west lake bank is reducing with a mean orp value of 119 54 mv saline groundwater in the west lake bank has a higher ph value and lower orp value table 2 concentrations of si range from 72 5 to 252 2 Œºm in the east transect from 84 2 to 607 7 Œºm in the fresh groundwater of the west transect and from 51 3 to 216 7 Œºm in the saline groundwater of the west transect the spatial distributions of si are shown in fig 4 a1 and a2 in the east transect the dominant form of n is nox while in the west transect fresh groundwater has lower nox and nh4 concentrations and saline groundwater has relatively lower nox concentrations but much higher nh4 concentrations fig 4b1 b2 c1 and c2 the redox conditions in the lakeside aquifer determine the dominant n species concentrations of hxpo4 3 x in saline groundwater are much higher than those in fresh groundwater fig 4d1 and d2 fig 4e1 and e2 show the spatial distributions of ratios of si p and n p in the two transects the mean si p ratio in saline groundwater is 51 6 and much lower than that in fresh groundwater fresh groundwater has a mean si p ratio of 498 54 in the west transect and 260 6 in the east transect fresh groundwater in the east transect has a mean n p ratio to be 1722 6 while both fresh and saline groundwater in the west transect has a mean n p ratio 50 fig 4f1 and f2 concentrations of doc contents in fresh groundwater of the east transect are lower than those in the west transect and much lower than those in saline groundwater table 2 concentrations of si nh4 and hxpo4 3 x in lakebed pore water are the highest among the fresh groundwater saline groundwater and lakebed pore water while concentrations of nox in lakebed pore water are as low as 19 6 8 9 Œºm spring water is characterized by very high concentrations of si and nox 4 2 nutrient concentrations in lake water of south sumujaran the south sumujaran lake has an average salinity of 125 psu in july table 3 the lake water is classified as na cl type zhang et al 2021 table 2 lists the mean value and standard deviation sd of nutrient concentration concentrations of si in lake water are higher than those in groundwater with a mean value of 211 Œºm this lake is p enriched with relatively high p concentrations throughout the water columns the maximum ratio of n p is 4 despite the low n p ratio the doc is highly concentrated in this brine lake and the average concentration is 8 2 mm the vertical distributions of temperature ph orp nh4 nox hxpo4 3 x ratios of si p and n p ratio in the south sumujaran lake are shown in fig 5 based on the temperature distribution the lake water is stratified at a depth of 6 m the ph and nutrient concentrations in the epilimnion and hypolimnion are distinctive the ph values n p ratios and concentrations of si nh4 and nox are generally higher in the hypolimnion the vertical distributions of orp and hxpo4 3 x show no identifiable trend 4 3 nutrient concentrations in other lakes and groundwater in the bjd besides the south sumujaran lake the other 20 lakes in the bjd are all brine lakes with salinity ranging from 59 3 to 393 2 psu similar to the south sumujaran lake they are enriched in doc and hxpo4 3 x but the mean concentrations of nox are much higher than those in the south sumujaran lake table 2 fresh and saline water are also found in the shallow lakeside groundwater and their salinity ranges from 0 3 to 66 7 psu these lakeside groundwater samples are also subject to distinct redox conditions with a wide orp range from 266 to 280 7 mv thus whether the dominant n species is nh4 or nox depends on its redox condition well water samples are generally brackish with a salinity range from 0 2 to 5 8 psu well water with a salinity larger than 1 psu is usually too bitter to drink and often used to feed sheep and camels well water is always exposed to open air during the pumping usage so that orp values in well water are very positive and the dominant n species is nox concentrations of hxpo4 3 x and si in well water and lakeside groundwater are both lower than those in lake water 4 4 nutrient limitation in lake water and groundwater the plots of n p ratios versus the si p ratios in all the water end members in the bjd are shown in fig 6 it shows that all the lake water in south sumujaran lake is n limited fig 6a most fresh groundwater samples are p limited and several of them are n limited saline groundwater is complicated because n p and si limited types are all observed among the 6 samples it demonstrates that when water transfers among lake water fresh groundwater and lake water fresh groundwater mixture its nutrient structure changes significantly spring water is p limited and lakebed pore water is all si limited fig 6b shows that 65 of lake water is n limited and 30 is p limited about 44 of lakeside groundwater is n limited and 56 is p limited a majority of well water is p limited 5 discussion 5 1 physical and biogeochemical controls on nutrient concentrations 5 1 1 lake water and groundwater in south sumujaran lake the groundwater flow direction in the east transect is from the water table below the sand dunes to the lakeshore zhang et al 2021 rainfall input dry deposition and nitrogen fixation in unsaturated soil all contribute nox to groundwater gates et al 2008 post et al 1985 nox in the unsaturated sand is leached downward into groundwater and then nox in the groundwater is increased via nitrification nox is decreased close to the lakeshore as shown in fig 4c2 it may be because of absorption by the plants thus fig 7 a shows that the nox and n p ratios both exhibit a positive relation with sampling depth and the horizontal distance d from the sampling point to the shoreline in the east sampling transect the n p ratios are also positively correlated with orp r2 0 55 p 0 009 and nox r2 0 53 p 0 01 suggesting that nutrient structure in the east transect is not only controlled by the n sources but also the redox conditions concentrations of si and hxpo4 3 x exhibit no significant relation with sampling depth in the west transect the groundwater flows from the water table below the west sand dune and finally discharges to the lake meanwhile saline lake water also intrudes into the lakeside aquifer the hxpo4 3 x and sampling depth are positively correlated in the fresh groundwater of the west transect fig 7b but the two are negatively correlated in the saline groundwater fig 7c in the fresh groundwater the production of hxpo4 3 x is mainly from the dissolution which is ph dependent holtan et al 1988 while in the saline groundwater the production of hxpo4 3 x is mainly from the decomposition of om because om in the lake water can be delivered into the lakeside aquifer along with the lake water intrusion during this process nh4 is produced via the remineralization of om part of nh4 is converted to nox via nitrification that s why some samples have elevated concentrations of nox higher than the fresh groundwater in the west transect and the lake water in fresh groundwater si is mainly produced during the weathering process of si containing minerals e g anorthite struyf et al 2010 however the mean concentrations of si in the saline groundwater are lower than those in the fresh groundwater and lake water indicating that si experiences significant precipitation when the saline lake water interacts with fresh groundwater in the mixing zone the lake water of south sumujaran lake is clearly stratified according to the temperature pattern this stratification may vary seasonally along with climatological changes the correlation analysis shows that nox r2 0 67 p 0 001 and n p ratios r2 0 64 p 0 002 both exhibit a positive relation with water depth fig 7d it suggests that nox can be supplied from the lakebed diffusion to support the consumption in the epilimnion in south sumujaran lake n p ratio is 4 so that this lake is n limited redfield 1963 thus nox and n p ratios are positively correlated r2 0 98 p 0 fig 7d the lake sediments are usually a major source of ammonium to the lake water stiller and nissenbaum 1999 in the south sumujaran lake when the om enriched lake water intrudes into the aquifer the concentrations of nox and nh4 are both elevated fig 4b1 and c1 however the lakebed sediment can also provide nox and nh4 to the lake water but the lake water is dominated by an oxidizing condition leading to the conversion of nh4 to nox via nitrification 5 1 2 other lake water lakeside groundwater and well water in order to explore the control mechanism of the nutrient cycling in the lakes of the bjd data from other 20 lakes are also systematically discussed concentrations of nh4 in these lakes are very low table 2 it is also because groundwater derived nh4 is largely converted to nox in the oxidizing lake water thus nox is the main n species in the lake water the correlation analysis shows that the n p ratio exhibits a positive relation with nox fig 8 a suggesting that the nutrient structure is controlled by the supply of nox si and hxpo4 3 x are positively correlated leading to the negative relations between si p ratio and si or p doc and c n ratios are positively related suggesting that the increase of the om inventory in lake water is dependent on c n ratio nh4 in lakeside groundwater only shows a positive relation with hxpo4 3 x fig 8b it may be because most nh4 and hxpo4 3 x in lakeside groundwater are from the remineralization of om nox is positively correlated with orp n p ratio and c n ratio this suggests that the concentrations of nox in lakeside groundwater is controlled by redox conditions and on the other hand nox can determine the nutrient structure of the water body si and doc are well correlated in the desert doc is mainly sourced from the decomposition of plant detritus in the area where the plant grows plant decomposition associated microbiota can affect the chemical environment of the soil and then increase the weathering rate of the soil conley 2002 drever 1994 moreover si can be also released during the decomposition process the mountainous areas are significant water source regions to the lakes wang and zhou 2018 therefore the nutrient concentrations in these regions deserve to be investigated the groundwater flow direction originates from these mountains towards these lakes in the well water samples from the mountainous areas si exhibits a negative relation with salinity fig 8c different from the relation in lakeside groundwater because the concentrations of si in lakeside groundwater are much higher than those in mountainous well water it is likely that si in the well water is removed from the aqueous environment via intensive evaporation and precipitation the dominant species of n is nox in well water the fact that nox is positively related to nh4 demonstrates that part of nox is converted from nh4 via nitrification in this kind of aqueous environment n p ratio is also dominated by the concentration of nox 5 2 nutrient cycling among lake water groundwater and lakebed pore water the interaction processes between lake water and groundwater include groundwater discharge lake water intrusion and fresh groundwater saline water mixing zhang et al 2020 fresh groundwater is continuously discharged into the lake via springs or diffusive seepage to maintain the existence of the lake nutrients are imported into the lake via groundwater discharge and pore water diffusion to support the growth of phytoplankton the lakes in the bjd receive a large amount of water from mountain block recharge large stable springs in the bjd are believed to be sourced from mountain block recharge thus even though the concentrations of nh4 and si in spring water are slightly higher than those in lake water and hxpo4 3 x lower than those in lake water mountain block recharge may still provide a considerable amount of nutrients to the lake water each nutrient species experiences distinct processes when this nutrient is discharged into the lake 1 since the redox condition changes from the aquifer to the lake most nh4 is converted to nox via nitrification and thus the concentrations of nh4 are the lowest in lake water fig 9 a 2 concentrations of nox in lake water are within the ranges of nox in groundwater fig 9b it is because the lake water is a mixture of the four different kinds of groundwater namely local groundwater from the west and east transects maintain block recharge and lakebed pore water 3 concentrations of hxpo4 3 x are higher in the lake water than those in the fresh groundwater fig 9c in lake water nox and hxpo4 3 x are both utilized by phytoplankton via photosynthesis to support primary production denitrification in the lake water also consumes nox and generates gaseous n2 leading to the decrease of nitrogen inventory in the lake phosphorus is circulated between the organic phase in lakebed sediments and the inorganic phase in lake water in addition hxpo4 3 x can be concentrated via intense evaporation 4 concentrations of si in the lake water are also within the ranges of si in groundwater fig 9d si is similar to hxpo4 3 x and circulated between organic and inorganic phases 5 the different behaviors of nh4 nox and hxpo4 3 x in the lake water lead to the low values of n p in lake water fig 9e 6 c n ratios in the lake water are also within the ranges of those in groundwater when the denser saline lake water intrudes into the lakebed and mixes with fresh groundwater a series of chemical reactions occur 1 nh4 and hxpo4 3 x are produced via remineralization of om fig 9a and c 2 nox is generated from the nitrification of nh4 fig 9b 3 part of si is precipitated though concentrations of si are positively correlated with salinity during the mixing process fig 9c the concentrations of si in fresh groundwater are scattered above the mixing line suggesting significant precipitation removal of si in this process fig 9d the ratios of si p in saline groundwater decreasing during the mixing process further confirm this phenomenon fig 9e 4 due to the input of the fresh groundwater and loadings from hxpo4 3 x from remineralization of om the n p ratio in saline groundwater increases from 4 to as high as 122 fig 9f the south sumujaran lake is n limited fig 6a and the maximum ratio of n p is 4 thus local groundwater spring water lakebed diffusion all can provide n sources to the lake 5 nutrient diffusion from the lakebed sediment is also a significant component affecting the cycling and structure of nutrients in lake water the results in fig 9a c and f show that nutrients in lakebed pore water have high concentrations of nh4 hxpo4 3 x and si than those in lake water a high concentration gradient between pore water and lake water allows the nutrient diffusion to lake water the schematic of the interaction processes of groundwater and lake water is demonstrated in fig 10 it shows that si and hxpo4 3 x in fresh groundwater are mainly from the dissolution of si and p bearing minerals in the oxidizing east transect nox is the dominant n species in this om deficit environment nox is partly removed via denitrification in the reductive west transect nh4 is the dominant n species in the fresh groundwater rainfall leached nox is removed immediately at the cost of consuming om and part of om is remineralized to produce nh4 in the saline groundwater lake water intrusion brings ample om and high ionic strength solution om is decomposed into nh4 and hxpo4 3 x however high ionic strength solution leads to the precipitation of si similar to what has been observed in the saline groundwater of the west transect om accumulated in the lakebed can also provide considerable nh4 and hxpo4 3 x to the overlying lake water groundwater and lakebed diffusion exported nutrients support the growth of phytoplankton brine shrimps then feed on the phytoplankton 5 3 nutrient fluxes to the south sumujaran lake nutrient fluxes directly determine the trophic states and primary productivity in the lake no3 of rainfall in this desert was measured to be ranging from 18 1 to 51 3 Œºm with a mean value of 29 5 Œºm pan 2014 thus rainfall imported nox to the lake is only 4 4 3 2 mol a based on the aforementioned discussion in section 5 2 the groundwater flux and lakebed diffusion flux are the main nutrient sources here the nutrient flux of each nutrient end member into the lake is evaluated nutrient fluxes from the local groundwater flow and mountain block recharge are calculated by multiplying the recharge rate with the corresponding nutrient concentration in each end member here nutrient concentrations in spring are used as the end member of the mountain block recharge and mean concentrations in groundwater of the two transects in south sumujaran lake as the end member of the local groundwater recharge vertical fluxes of nutrients between lakebed sediments and the overlying lake water can be estimated using fick s first law as described by sweerts et al 1991a sweerts et al 1991b 1 f n d s dc dx where f is the nutrient flux mol cm 2 s 1 of nutrient c mol l n the porosity of the lakebed sediments d s the bulk sediment molecular diffusion coefficient in water and dc dx the concentration gradient slope an approximated formula of eq 1 can be employed kelderman 1984 2 f n d s c l c g Œ¥ z where cl and cg are the nutrient concentrations in overlying lake water and lakebed pore water respectively the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer Œ¥z 0 01 m values of d s are given to be 8 5 10 9 m2 s 1 for nox 1 4 10 9 m2 s 1 for nh4 5 0 10 10 m2 s 1 for hxpo4 3 x and 3 3 10 10 m2 s 1 si fanning and pilson 1974 lavery et al 2001 and n is set to be 0 35 wang et al 2014 the chordal diagram in fig s1 and table 4 shows the nutrient fluxes from local groundwater mountain block recharge lakebed diffusion and rainfall it is found that lakebed diffusion provides the dominant supply of nh4 and hxpo4 3 x to the lake while mountain block recharge delivers most of the nox and si to the lake local groundwater recharge provides a minor part of the si and nox to the lake the results highlight the fact that the nutrient cycling in lake water is regulated by in coming water carried nutrients and lakebed diffusion 5 4 nutrient cycle in the bjd and other saline lakes worldwide many studies have found that salinity can have a profound impact on the nutrient cycle in saline lakes yue et al 2019 batanero et al 2017 in the bjd after solutes are exported to the lakes evaporation leads to the increase of solute concentrations concentrations of nh4 can be influenced by a variety of processes e g remineralization nitrification or denitrification thus nh4 exhibits no significant relation with salinity fig 11 a except for nh4 concentrations of nox hxpo4 3 x and si all show an increasing trend with salinity fig 11b c and d lake water lakeside groundwater and well water all have a wide range of ratios of si p and n p fig 11e and f overall ratios of si p and n p ratio both exhibit a decreasing trend from the lakeside groundwater and well water to the lake water cluster analysis is performed for 21 surveyed lakes based on ph orp salinity doc tn and nutrient concentrations fig s2 it shows that the south sumujaran lake and the other 17 lakes can be divided into the same group while the remaining 3 lakes belong to three different groups thus south sumujaran lake is a representative lake to understand the cycling and structure of nutrients in the lakes of the bjd the aforementioned discussions on lake water and lakeside groundwater in the south sumujaran lake are also applicable for lake water and lakeside groundwater in most of the lakes in the desert since about 76 of the 22 explored lakes in the desert are n limited fig 6a and b and mountain block recharge and lakebed diffusion are the main sources of n it can be concluded that mountain block recharge and lakebed diffusion play a dominant role in regulating the nutrient cycling and structure in the lakes studies regarding the nutrient cycle in saline lakes in this study and other relevant studies worldwide are compiled in table 5 nutrients in these lakes can be supported by riverine flux internal loading n2 fixation and anthropogenic activities and consumed by primary production and redox reactions few studies considered the nutrient inputs from groundwater in local and regional scales in this study groundwater flux is partitioned into local groundwater recharge and mountain block recharge regional groundwater is usually more stable in chemistry than shallow groundwater on the contrary nutrients in local groundwater are highly variable due to a series of hydrological and hydrogeological factors e g rainfall leaching lake water groundwater interaction remineralization and dissolution precipitation the above information is useful to understand the nutrient cycle in the water continuum of groundwater lake water in addition this study also found that lakebed diffusion supports a vital part of nutrients to the lakes 6 conclusions based on the high resolution sampling in the south sumujaran lake and regional sampling in the whole bjd the nutrient status and cycle in the desert are investigated the results show that about 76 of the lakes are n limited mountain block recharge and local groundwater flow contribute a dominant amount of water to sustain the existence of the lake water but the nutrients in lake water are mainly supplied by mountain block recharge and lakebed diffusion the nutrients in local groundwater are highly variable and contribute relatively a small part to the nutrient cycling nutrient species present different hydrogeochemical patterns in groundwater the dominant n species in lakeside groundwater is dependent on redox condition and om content hxpo4 3 x originate from the dissolution of solid phase in fresh groundwater while in om enriched environment hxpo4 3 x are mainly produced via remineralization of om si tends to be bounded with solid phase in a saline subsurface environment e g lakebed pore water lakeside groundwater and mountainous well water and exhibits an increasing trend with salinity in lake water in addition this study confirms the impacts of salinity on the nutrient cycle in saline lakes nox hxpo4 3 x and si

4575,saline lakes are characterized by high salinity and limited biological diversity the nutrient cycle directly determines biological diversity many factors including internal loading riverine inflows salinity and or anthropogenic activities affect the nutrient cycle in saline lakes the badain jaran desert bjd is featured by hyper arid climate and by mega sand dune lake landscapes in this study nutrients in groundwater and lake water in the bjd were analyzed to explore the control factors on the nutrient cycle results show that 76 of the lakes are nitrogen limited and the rests are phosphorus limited 56 of lakeside groundwater samples are phosphorus limited and the rests nitrogen limited and most of the well water in the mountain area surrounding the bjd is phosphorus limited the lake water in the bjd is mainly supported by mountain block recharge and local groundwater but nutrients in lake water are mainly supplied by the mountain block recharge and lakebed diffusion lakebed diffusion delivers up to 70 total ammonium and 97 6 total orthophosphate to the lake water while mountain block recharge accounts for about 72 nitrate nitrite and about 73 silicate to the lake water nutrients in local groundwater systems are highly variable due to the complexity of hydrological and hydrogeochemical conditions rainfall precipitation dissolution and redox reaction this study systematically investigates the control factors on the nutrient structure and cycle in groundwater and lake water in the bjd the findings of this study will be constructive to explore the nutrient cycle in saline lakes worldwide with similar hydrogeological conditions keywords desert saline lake nutrients mountain block recharge lakebed diffusion local groundwater flow 1 introduction nutrient cycles in water bodies have been investigated extensively cook et al 2010 liu et al 2018 pasche et al 2009 nutrient cycles are closely related to the degeneration of submerged macrophytes excessive phytoplankton growth and algae blooms wu et al 2017 previous studies have shown that the supply of nitrogen n or phosphorous p is the key factor influencing the autotrophic production of organic matter om koerselman and arthur 1996 moore et al 2013 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 sepehri et al 2020 whether a water body is n or p limited is not only dependent on the nutrient dynamics of the water body but also hydrological and hydrogeological conditions around it arbuckle and downing 2001 mclauchlan et al 2013 stoliker et al 2016 saline lakes are commonplace in endorheic basins or coastal areas studies on the input and the biogeochemical cycle of nutrients in saline lakes are frequently reported canfield and green 1985 macintyre et al 1999 naftz et al 2008 pilati et al 2016 ram√≠rez olvera et al 2009 however the dominant factors on the states and cycles of nutrients in saline lakes are site specific for example mono lake was n limited macintyre et al 1999 and the closed basin lake vanda in the antarctic to be p limited canfield and green 1985 lakebed diffusion and riverine inflows stiller and nissenbaum 1999 lake size guildford et al 1994 waterbird aggregation batanero et al 2017 and loadings from anthropogenic activities reuter et al 1993 all can exert an impact on the dynamics and cycle of nutrients in saline lakes however these studies on saline lakes mainly covered local nutrient sources but did not consider regional nutrient sources the badain jaran desert bjd the second largest desert in china is famous for the tallest stationary sand dune on earth up to 460 m and a unique mega sand dune lake landscape there are over 140 lakes in the inter dune depressions among which 70 lakes are perennial the salinity of these lakes ranges from 0 5 to over 480 g l jiao et al 2015 rioual et al 2013 most of them are saline lakes and only several lakes are fresh there is no river flowing into or out these lakes and these lakes are mainly recharged by groundwater and with minor water input from direct rainfall recharge on the lake surface wang and zhou 2018 these saline lakes support a unique aquatic habitat because of their high salt content environment two invertebrates brine flies ephydra spp and brine shrimp artemia franciscana can survive in saline lakes the brine shrimp is commercially valuable because their eggs can be collected as food for newly hatched fish on the other hand the brine shrimp and flies are also the main food supply for birds the brine shrimp feeds primarily on algae the latter is predominately regulated by nutrient components and dynamics in lake water as shown in the previous study the lakes are mainly recharged by groundwater from local and regional flow zhang et al 2021 both of which are pathways of nutrients delivering to the lakes this study is intended to explore the possible control factors on the nutrient cycle in the bjd twenty one saline lakes are investigated and south sumujaran lake the second largest lake in the bjd is selected as a representative lake for detailed study first physical and chemical properties nutrient concentrations and nutrient limitations of lakeside groundwater well water and lake water are presented then the physical and biogeochemical controls on nutrient concentration are analyzed quantitatively based on spearman correlation analysis finally the possible chemical reactions of each nutrient species are discussed and nutrient fluxes to the south sumujaran lake are quantified 2 description of study site the bjd occupies the western part of the alxa plateau china the desert is bounded by yabulai and heishantou mountain mt in the south fig 1 a the ground elevations decrease from greater than 1600 m in the mountainous areas to 1200 m in the inter dune lake area each lake is sandwiched with mega sand dunes with a height relative to the lake surface from 200 to 460 m the climate is hyper arid with a rainfall rate ranging from 68 to 172 mm a hou et al 2016 and an evaporation rate ranging from 1040 to 1260 mm a yang et al 2017 the local rainfall recharge is far less than the volume of evaporation thus the desert is believed to receive a large amount of water from the mountainous areas to supply the water deficit between local rainfall recharge and evaporation consumption the prevailing wind blows from the northwest to the southeast the compound transverse sand dune is distributed in the direction from the northeast to the southwest generally at right angles with the wind direction dong et al 2013 the bjd is located in one of the basin depressions of alxa tectonic block there are mainly three sedimentary formations in the desert fig 2 the cretaceous sandstones form the deepest aquifer with thickness ranging from 1 000 to 4 000 m wang et al 2014 the overlying unit consists of a semi permeable neogene clay and fine sandstone ma et al 2007 the uppermost unit is quaternary sandy sediment with a depth varying from 100 to 300 m this loose sediment aquifer offers a vast space for groundwater storage the hydraulic conductivity of the quaternary sediment neogene sandstone and cretaceous sandstone is 3 20 0 5 5 0 02 0 2 m d zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2014 the regional groundwater flow is shown in fig 2 the groundwater level decreases from more than 1300 m in the southern mountainous areas to 1000 m in the gulunai wetlands fig 2a and b indicating that the regional groundwater flow direction is generally from the south to the north the thickness of the unsaturated zone inside the mega transverse sand dunes ranges from close to zero near the lakeshore to over 300 m below the peak of the sand dunes these sand dunes play a role in capturing rainfall and storing water moisture the water mound inside the sand dune is significantly different from the surface topography above the regional groundwater flow system local and intermediate groundwater flow systems are developed the local groundwater flow systems are originated from adjacent water mounds inside the sand dunes the recharge from the mountainous area is defined as mountain block recharge markovich et al 2019 and sourced from the yabulai and heishantou mts thus the lake water is mainly supplied by mountain block recharge and local groundwater flow zhang et al 2021 most of the lakes are saline or even brine but fresh groundwater can still be easily found surrounding each lake fresh springs and diffusive seepage faces usually outcrop on the lakeshore and at the lakebed the depth of nearshore fresh groundwater is very shallow so that groundwater can support the growth of the plant in the vicinity around each lake populus euphratica elaeagnus angustifolia tamarix spp phragmites communis achnatherum splendens sophora alopecuroides glycyrrhiza uralensis carex sp are the popular plant species in the lake shore area yang et al 2003 south sumujaran lake n39 7906 e102 4229 is about 50 km away from the yabulai mt fig 1b this lake is about 1 26 km2 and has a maximum depth of 11 m similar to many other lakes in the desert this lake is mainly sustained by mountain block recharge and local groundwater while capturing minor rainfall on the lake surface the latest study found that about one quarter of groundwater was sourced from the local flow systems and the remaining three quarters from mountain block recharge zhang et al 2021 contributions of direct rainfall to the lake surface local groundwater and mountain block recharge are about 1 48 105 2 7 3 7 105 and 1 0 1 1 106 m3 a respectively zhang et al 2021 there are two springs found on the lakeshore fig 1b spring in the southeast of the lake has a large flow rate of about 3 4 l s and its annual discharge rate is comparable to that of the local groundwater thus this spring is the most likely sourced from mountain block recharge in winter when most areas of the lake surface are frozen there is a melting zone with a diameter of about 60 m surrounding this spring whose temperature is 16 spring in the northwest is ephemeral and only active in the spring season and hence it is likely recharged by local rainfall springs were also found in the lakebed as indicated by salinity and temperature anomalies gong et al 2016 3 material and methods 3 1 field sampling lake water in the south sumujaran lake was sampled in july 2018 by a raft with auto motor n1 to n8 were the sampling sites in the lake fig 1b as the lake water depth varies at these sites the number of samples at each site increases with water depth a total of 22 lake water samples were collected in this lake two multilevel sampling systems were installed at the west and east sides of the south sumujaran lake in june 2018 fig 1b and fig 3 zhang et al 2021 each groundwater sampling well consists of several nylon tubes whose water inlets are buried at different depths twenty two and twenty one groundwater samples were collected respectively at the west and east groundwater sampling transects in october 2018 generally the east transect is mainly composed of sand while the west transect composed of sand and black silt the silt content increases towards the lakeshore it is suggested that the vicinity close to the lake is the former lakebed when the lake level was higher than the present eight lakebed pore water samples in two sites fig 1b were also collected using push point samplers m h e co and the groundwater was pumped out with a peristaltic pump luo et al 2016 one spring water sample in the southeast of the lake shoreline was collected besides south sumujaran lake lake water samples in other 20 lakes were also collected in july 2018 about 54 lakeside groundwater in total were sampled most of them were collected using push point samplers some lakeside groundwater samples were pumped out from domestic wells in the southern mountainous areas the groundwater level is usually very deep and a total of 62 groundwater samples were collected from domestic wells all the samples were filtered in situ through a 0 45 Œºm cellulose acetate membrane poisoned with saturated hgcl2 solution and stored in the refrigeration environment 4 3 2 lab analytical methods salinity ph temperature and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured immediately after sample collection with portable multi parameter probes hanna hi 98194 accuracies of these parameters are 0 01 psu for salinity 0 02 for ph 0 15 for temperature and 1 0 mv for orp concentrations of ammonia nh4 nitrate and nitrite together designated as nox orthophosphate hxpo4 3 x and silicon si were measured using flow injection analyzer lachat instruments auickchem 8000 within one month after sampling errors of nutrient analysis are 10 for nh4 8 for nox and 5 for hxpo4 3 x a toc tn analyzer multi n c3000 analytic jena ag germany was used to determine the contents of dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn of the samples errors of analysis of doc and tn are both 3 3 3 statistical analysis correlations between ph orp salinity doc tn and nutrient concentrations were evaluated using spearman correlation in sigmaplot 12 0 curve fittings were generated using sigmaplot 12 0 since the nutrients have concentrations range over several orders of magnitude the nutrient concentrations in the contour plots of the two groundwater transects were presented as log10 values contour plots were drawn using surfer 12 4 results 4 1 nutrient concentrations in groundwater lakebed pore water and spring water of the south sumujaran lake the groundwater of the samples from the east transect are all fresh salinity 0 5 but that of samples in the west transect can be fresh and saline table 1 the water type changes from na hco3 cl in saline groundwater to na cl or na hco3 in fresh groundwater zhang et al 2021 generally fresh groundwater in the east transect is oxidizing with a mean orp value of 31 98 mv while fresh groundwater in the west lake bank is reducing with a mean orp value of 119 54 mv saline groundwater in the west lake bank has a higher ph value and lower orp value table 2 concentrations of si range from 72 5 to 252 2 Œºm in the east transect from 84 2 to 607 7 Œºm in the fresh groundwater of the west transect and from 51 3 to 216 7 Œºm in the saline groundwater of the west transect the spatial distributions of si are shown in fig 4 a1 and a2 in the east transect the dominant form of n is nox while in the west transect fresh groundwater has lower nox and nh4 concentrations and saline groundwater has relatively lower nox concentrations but much higher nh4 concentrations fig 4b1 b2 c1 and c2 the redox conditions in the lakeside aquifer determine the dominant n species concentrations of hxpo4 3 x in saline groundwater are much higher than those in fresh groundwater fig 4d1 and d2 fig 4e1 and e2 show the spatial distributions of ratios of si p and n p in the two transects the mean si p ratio in saline groundwater is 51 6 and much lower than that in fresh groundwater fresh groundwater has a mean si p ratio of 498 54 in the west transect and 260 6 in the east transect fresh groundwater in the east transect has a mean n p ratio to be 1722 6 while both fresh and saline groundwater in the west transect has a mean n p ratio 50 fig 4f1 and f2 concentrations of doc contents in fresh groundwater of the east transect are lower than those in the west transect and much lower than those in saline groundwater table 2 concentrations of si nh4 and hxpo4 3 x in lakebed pore water are the highest among the fresh groundwater saline groundwater and lakebed pore water while concentrations of nox in lakebed pore water are as low as 19 6 8 9 Œºm spring water is characterized by very high concentrations of si and nox 4 2 nutrient concentrations in lake water of south sumujaran the south sumujaran lake has an average salinity of 125 psu in july table 3 the lake water is classified as na cl type zhang et al 2021 table 2 lists the mean value and standard deviation sd of nutrient concentration concentrations of si in lake water are higher than those in groundwater with a mean value of 211 Œºm this lake is p enriched with relatively high p concentrations throughout the water columns the maximum ratio of n p is 4 despite the low n p ratio the doc is highly concentrated in this brine lake and the average concentration is 8 2 mm the vertical distributions of temperature ph orp nh4 nox hxpo4 3 x ratios of si p and n p ratio in the south sumujaran lake are shown in fig 5 based on the temperature distribution the lake water is stratified at a depth of 6 m the ph and nutrient concentrations in the epilimnion and hypolimnion are distinctive the ph values n p ratios and concentrations of si nh4 and nox are generally higher in the hypolimnion the vertical distributions of orp and hxpo4 3 x show no identifiable trend 4 3 nutrient concentrations in other lakes and groundwater in the bjd besides the south sumujaran lake the other 20 lakes in the bjd are all brine lakes with salinity ranging from 59 3 to 393 2 psu similar to the south sumujaran lake they are enriched in doc and hxpo4 3 x but the mean concentrations of nox are much higher than those in the south sumujaran lake table 2 fresh and saline water are also found in the shallow lakeside groundwater and their salinity ranges from 0 3 to 66 7 psu these lakeside groundwater samples are also subject to distinct redox conditions with a wide orp range from 266 to 280 7 mv thus whether the dominant n species is nh4 or nox depends on its redox condition well water samples are generally brackish with a salinity range from 0 2 to 5 8 psu well water with a salinity larger than 1 psu is usually too bitter to drink and often used to feed sheep and camels well water is always exposed to open air during the pumping usage so that orp values in well water are very positive and the dominant n species is nox concentrations of hxpo4 3 x and si in well water and lakeside groundwater are both lower than those in lake water 4 4 nutrient limitation in lake water and groundwater the plots of n p ratios versus the si p ratios in all the water end members in the bjd are shown in fig 6 it shows that all the lake water in south sumujaran lake is n limited fig 6a most fresh groundwater samples are p limited and several of them are n limited saline groundwater is complicated because n p and si limited types are all observed among the 6 samples it demonstrates that when water transfers among lake water fresh groundwater and lake water fresh groundwater mixture its nutrient structure changes significantly spring water is p limited and lakebed pore water is all si limited fig 6b shows that 65 of lake water is n limited and 30 is p limited about 44 of lakeside groundwater is n limited and 56 is p limited a majority of well water is p limited 5 discussion 5 1 physical and biogeochemical controls on nutrient concentrations 5 1 1 lake water and groundwater in south sumujaran lake the groundwater flow direction in the east transect is from the water table below the sand dunes to the lakeshore zhang et al 2021 rainfall input dry deposition and nitrogen fixation in unsaturated soil all contribute nox to groundwater gates et al 2008 post et al 1985 nox in the unsaturated sand is leached downward into groundwater and then nox in the groundwater is increased via nitrification nox is decreased close to the lakeshore as shown in fig 4c2 it may be because of absorption by the plants thus fig 7 a shows that the nox and n p ratios both exhibit a positive relation with sampling depth and the horizontal distance d from the sampling point to the shoreline in the east sampling transect the n p ratios are also positively correlated with orp r2 0 55 p 0 009 and nox r2 0 53 p 0 01 suggesting that nutrient structure in the east transect is not only controlled by the n sources but also the redox conditions concentrations of si and hxpo4 3 x exhibit no significant relation with sampling depth in the west transect the groundwater flows from the water table below the west sand dune and finally discharges to the lake meanwhile saline lake water also intrudes into the lakeside aquifer the hxpo4 3 x and sampling depth are positively correlated in the fresh groundwater of the west transect fig 7b but the two are negatively correlated in the saline groundwater fig 7c in the fresh groundwater the production of hxpo4 3 x is mainly from the dissolution which is ph dependent holtan et al 1988 while in the saline groundwater the production of hxpo4 3 x is mainly from the decomposition of om because om in the lake water can be delivered into the lakeside aquifer along with the lake water intrusion during this process nh4 is produced via the remineralization of om part of nh4 is converted to nox via nitrification that s why some samples have elevated concentrations of nox higher than the fresh groundwater in the west transect and the lake water in fresh groundwater si is mainly produced during the weathering process of si containing minerals e g anorthite struyf et al 2010 however the mean concentrations of si in the saline groundwater are lower than those in the fresh groundwater and lake water indicating that si experiences significant precipitation when the saline lake water interacts with fresh groundwater in the mixing zone the lake water of south sumujaran lake is clearly stratified according to the temperature pattern this stratification may vary seasonally along with climatological changes the correlation analysis shows that nox r2 0 67 p 0 001 and n p ratios r2 0 64 p 0 002 both exhibit a positive relation with water depth fig 7d it suggests that nox can be supplied from the lakebed diffusion to support the consumption in the epilimnion in south sumujaran lake n p ratio is 4 so that this lake is n limited redfield 1963 thus nox and n p ratios are positively correlated r2 0 98 p 0 fig 7d the lake sediments are usually a major source of ammonium to the lake water stiller and nissenbaum 1999 in the south sumujaran lake when the om enriched lake water intrudes into the aquifer the concentrations of nox and nh4 are both elevated fig 4b1 and c1 however the lakebed sediment can also provide nox and nh4 to the lake water but the lake water is dominated by an oxidizing condition leading to the conversion of nh4 to nox via nitrification 5 1 2 other lake water lakeside groundwater and well water in order to explore the control mechanism of the nutrient cycling in the lakes of the bjd data from other 20 lakes are also systematically discussed concentrations of nh4 in these lakes are very low table 2 it is also because groundwater derived nh4 is largely converted to nox in the oxidizing lake water thus nox is the main n species in the lake water the correlation analysis shows that the n p ratio exhibits a positive relation with nox fig 8 a suggesting that the nutrient structure is controlled by the supply of nox si and hxpo4 3 x are positively correlated leading to the negative relations between si p ratio and si or p doc and c n ratios are positively related suggesting that the increase of the om inventory in lake water is dependent on c n ratio nh4 in lakeside groundwater only shows a positive relation with hxpo4 3 x fig 8b it may be because most nh4 and hxpo4 3 x in lakeside groundwater are from the remineralization of om nox is positively correlated with orp n p ratio and c n ratio this suggests that the concentrations of nox in lakeside groundwater is controlled by redox conditions and on the other hand nox can determine the nutrient structure of the water body si and doc are well correlated in the desert doc is mainly sourced from the decomposition of plant detritus in the area where the plant grows plant decomposition associated microbiota can affect the chemical environment of the soil and then increase the weathering rate of the soil conley 2002 drever 1994 moreover si can be also released during the decomposition process the mountainous areas are significant water source regions to the lakes wang and zhou 2018 therefore the nutrient concentrations in these regions deserve to be investigated the groundwater flow direction originates from these mountains towards these lakes in the well water samples from the mountainous areas si exhibits a negative relation with salinity fig 8c different from the relation in lakeside groundwater because the concentrations of si in lakeside groundwater are much higher than those in mountainous well water it is likely that si in the well water is removed from the aqueous environment via intensive evaporation and precipitation the dominant species of n is nox in well water the fact that nox is positively related to nh4 demonstrates that part of nox is converted from nh4 via nitrification in this kind of aqueous environment n p ratio is also dominated by the concentration of nox 5 2 nutrient cycling among lake water groundwater and lakebed pore water the interaction processes between lake water and groundwater include groundwater discharge lake water intrusion and fresh groundwater saline water mixing zhang et al 2020 fresh groundwater is continuously discharged into the lake via springs or diffusive seepage to maintain the existence of the lake nutrients are imported into the lake via groundwater discharge and pore water diffusion to support the growth of phytoplankton the lakes in the bjd receive a large amount of water from mountain block recharge large stable springs in the bjd are believed to be sourced from mountain block recharge thus even though the concentrations of nh4 and si in spring water are slightly higher than those in lake water and hxpo4 3 x lower than those in lake water mountain block recharge may still provide a considerable amount of nutrients to the lake water each nutrient species experiences distinct processes when this nutrient is discharged into the lake 1 since the redox condition changes from the aquifer to the lake most nh4 is converted to nox via nitrification and thus the concentrations of nh4 are the lowest in lake water fig 9 a 2 concentrations of nox in lake water are within the ranges of nox in groundwater fig 9b it is because the lake water is a mixture of the four different kinds of groundwater namely local groundwater from the west and east transects maintain block recharge and lakebed pore water 3 concentrations of hxpo4 3 x are higher in the lake water than those in the fresh groundwater fig 9c in lake water nox and hxpo4 3 x are both utilized by phytoplankton via photosynthesis to support primary production denitrification in the lake water also consumes nox and generates gaseous n2 leading to the decrease of nitrogen inventory in the lake phosphorus is circulated between the organic phase in lakebed sediments and the inorganic phase in lake water in addition hxpo4 3 x can be concentrated via intense evaporation 4 concentrations of si in the lake water are also within the ranges of si in groundwater fig 9d si is similar to hxpo4 3 x and circulated between organic and inorganic phases 5 the different behaviors of nh4 nox and hxpo4 3 x in the lake water lead to the low values of n p in lake water fig 9e 6 c n ratios in the lake water are also within the ranges of those in groundwater when the denser saline lake water intrudes into the lakebed and mixes with fresh groundwater a series of chemical reactions occur 1 nh4 and hxpo4 3 x are produced via remineralization of om fig 9a and c 2 nox is generated from the nitrification of nh4 fig 9b 3 part of si is precipitated though concentrations of si are positively correlated with salinity during the mixing process fig 9c the concentrations of si in fresh groundwater are scattered above the mixing line suggesting significant precipitation removal of si in this process fig 9d the ratios of si p in saline groundwater decreasing during the mixing process further confirm this phenomenon fig 9e 4 due to the input of the fresh groundwater and loadings from hxpo4 3 x from remineralization of om the n p ratio in saline groundwater increases from 4 to as high as 122 fig 9f the south sumujaran lake is n limited fig 6a and the maximum ratio of n p is 4 thus local groundwater spring water lakebed diffusion all can provide n sources to the lake 5 nutrient diffusion from the lakebed sediment is also a significant component affecting the cycling and structure of nutrients in lake water the results in fig 9a c and f show that nutrients in lakebed pore water have high concentrations of nh4 hxpo4 3 x and si than those in lake water a high concentration gradient between pore water and lake water allows the nutrient diffusion to lake water the schematic of the interaction processes of groundwater and lake water is demonstrated in fig 10 it shows that si and hxpo4 3 x in fresh groundwater are mainly from the dissolution of si and p bearing minerals in the oxidizing east transect nox is the dominant n species in this om deficit environment nox is partly removed via denitrification in the reductive west transect nh4 is the dominant n species in the fresh groundwater rainfall leached nox is removed immediately at the cost of consuming om and part of om is remineralized to produce nh4 in the saline groundwater lake water intrusion brings ample om and high ionic strength solution om is decomposed into nh4 and hxpo4 3 x however high ionic strength solution leads to the precipitation of si similar to what has been observed in the saline groundwater of the west transect om accumulated in the lakebed can also provide considerable nh4 and hxpo4 3 x to the overlying lake water groundwater and lakebed diffusion exported nutrients support the growth of phytoplankton brine shrimps then feed on the phytoplankton 5 3 nutrient fluxes to the south sumujaran lake nutrient fluxes directly determine the trophic states and primary productivity in the lake no3 of rainfall in this desert was measured to be ranging from 18 1 to 51 3 Œºm with a mean value of 29 5 Œºm pan 2014 thus rainfall imported nox to the lake is only 4 4 3 2 mol a based on the aforementioned discussion in section 5 2 the groundwater flux and lakebed diffusion flux are the main nutrient sources here the nutrient flux of each nutrient end member into the lake is evaluated nutrient fluxes from the local groundwater flow and mountain block recharge are calculated by multiplying the recharge rate with the corresponding nutrient concentration in each end member here nutrient concentrations in spring are used as the end member of the mountain block recharge and mean concentrations in groundwater of the two transects in south sumujaran lake as the end member of the local groundwater recharge vertical fluxes of nutrients between lakebed sediments and the overlying lake water can be estimated using fick s first law as described by sweerts et al 1991a sweerts et al 1991b 1 f n d s dc dx where f is the nutrient flux mol cm 2 s 1 of nutrient c mol l n the porosity of the lakebed sediments d s the bulk sediment molecular diffusion coefficient in water and dc dx the concentration gradient slope an approximated formula of eq 1 can be employed kelderman 1984 2 f n d s c l c g Œ¥ z where cl and cg are the nutrient concentrations in overlying lake water and lakebed pore water respectively the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer Œ¥z 0 01 m values of d s are given to be 8 5 10 9 m2 s 1 for nox 1 4 10 9 m2 s 1 for nh4 5 0 10 10 m2 s 1 for hxpo4 3 x and 3 3 10 10 m2 s 1 si fanning and pilson 1974 lavery et al 2001 and n is set to be 0 35 wang et al 2014 the chordal diagram in fig s1 and table 4 shows the nutrient fluxes from local groundwater mountain block recharge lakebed diffusion and rainfall it is found that lakebed diffusion provides the dominant supply of nh4 and hxpo4 3 x to the lake while mountain block recharge delivers most of the nox and si to the lake local groundwater recharge provides a minor part of the si and nox to the lake the results highlight the fact that the nutrient cycling in lake water is regulated by in coming water carried nutrients and lakebed diffusion 5 4 nutrient cycle in the bjd and other saline lakes worldwide many studies have found that salinity can have a profound impact on the nutrient cycle in saline lakes yue et al 2019 batanero et al 2017 in the bjd after solutes are exported to the lakes evaporation leads to the increase of solute concentrations concentrations of nh4 can be influenced by a variety of processes e g remineralization nitrification or denitrification thus nh4 exhibits no significant relation with salinity fig 11 a except for nh4 concentrations of nox hxpo4 3 x and si all show an increasing trend with salinity fig 11b c and d lake water lakeside groundwater and well water all have a wide range of ratios of si p and n p fig 11e and f overall ratios of si p and n p ratio both exhibit a decreasing trend from the lakeside groundwater and well water to the lake water cluster analysis is performed for 21 surveyed lakes based on ph orp salinity doc tn and nutrient concentrations fig s2 it shows that the south sumujaran lake and the other 17 lakes can be divided into the same group while the remaining 3 lakes belong to three different groups thus south sumujaran lake is a representative lake to understand the cycling and structure of nutrients in the lakes of the bjd the aforementioned discussions on lake water and lakeside groundwater in the south sumujaran lake are also applicable for lake water and lakeside groundwater in most of the lakes in the desert since about 76 of the 22 explored lakes in the desert are n limited fig 6a and b and mountain block recharge and lakebed diffusion are the main sources of n it can be concluded that mountain block recharge and lakebed diffusion play a dominant role in regulating the nutrient cycling and structure in the lakes studies regarding the nutrient cycle in saline lakes in this study and other relevant studies worldwide are compiled in table 5 nutrients in these lakes can be supported by riverine flux internal loading n2 fixation and anthropogenic activities and consumed by primary production and redox reactions few studies considered the nutrient inputs from groundwater in local and regional scales in this study groundwater flux is partitioned into local groundwater recharge and mountain block recharge regional groundwater is usually more stable in chemistry than shallow groundwater on the contrary nutrients in local groundwater are highly variable due to a series of hydrological and hydrogeological factors

4576,in the past decade techno economic feasibility of using co2 as a working fluid to harvest geothermal energy has been studied and demonstrated in both hot dry rock and deep brine aquifers potential geothermal resources have been suggested by hydrogeological surveys in north oman area many depleting petroleum reservoirs in this area provide excellent candidates as co2 geologic storage

and techno economic analysis for potential co2 sequestration geothermal exploration and utilization in north oman foreland basin and other similar fields keywords petroleum reservoir geothermal energy co2 sequestration fault leakage response surface 1 introduction continuous reliance on fossil fuels as the primary energy sources is facing two key challenges first fossil fuel resources are depleting due to intensive uses in the past 50 years and second there is an ever increasing climate change caused by the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption abas and khan 2014 to meet increasing energy demand and reduce carbon emissions substantial efforts have been made to explore renewable non carbon energy sources such as solar wind geothermal ocean tidal wave etc khan et al 2017 compared to intermittent solar or wind sources geothermal energy is continuous stable and possesses high thermal efficiency another alternative to reduce atmospheric co2 concentration is co2 sequestration in which co2 is injected and stored permanently in widely available deep saline aquifers shaffer 2010 dai et al 2014b chen et al 2020 co2 has been used as an effective working fluid for enhanced oil recovery in petroleum industry and thermal energy extraction from deep hot dry rock by fracking the impermeable rock pruess 2006 in the past decade combination of co2 sequestration in natural permeable saline aquifer and extraction of geothermal energy from the hot brine by circulating co2 has been intensively investigated e g randolph and saar 2011 babaei 2019 this co2 circulated geothermal production system has been demonstrated to be more efficient than the traditional brine circulated system due to thermodynamic advantages of co2 as it has lower viscosity and higher mobility than brine under the common pressure and temperature of deep saline reservoirs leading to efficient advection transport of heat in porous formations garapati et al 2015 more importantly drastic variations of co2 density with changes in pressure and temperature can generate a strong thermosiphon effect through the circulation pathway between the injection and production wells this thermosiphon effect can significantly reduce the demand for pumping power to circulate co2 and hence can greatly improve the system efficiency adams et al 2014 oman has considerable low medium enthalpy geothermal resources which have received little attention partially due to availability of abundant fossil energy reserves and solar energy resources 300 hot springs are distributed in north oman s mountainous regions among which about 50 can be attributed to medium enthalpy geothermal reservoirs with temperature around 100 150 c umar 2018 in northern oman the geothermal gradient ranges between 20 and 40 c km and averaged heat flow is estimated as 47 9 mw m2 sch√ºtz et al 2018 the temperature distribution at a depth of 1500 m in north oman regions fig 1 suggests that areas with higher temperatures 75 c are within the north oman foreland basin where several large oil gas fields such as natih safah and fahud are located terken 1999 decades of oil reservoir characterization efforts show that the geological stratigraphy in these oil fields exhibits a layer cake carbonate sequence droste and van steenwinkel 2004 morettini et al 2005 capped by impermeable nahr umr shale shuaiba limestone formation has been identified as the main oil reservoir extending the entire foreland basin and been partitioned by faults into a lot of isolated blocks with varying dip angle al hadhrami et al 2018 this thin formation is characterized by relatively homogeneous properties with high porosity and low permeability and a combination of both structural and stratigraphic traps bigno et al 2001 horizontal water flooding was implemented and demonstrated as an effective oil recovery method to cope with high depletion in these fields zhang et al 2007 historically only 30 50 of the oil is recovered after secondary recovery and 50 70 of the oil remains in the reservoir further recovery requires more expensive technologies and reservoirs were usually abandoned at this point n√∫√±ez l√≥pez and moskal 2019 considering the existing infrastructure and oil production experience in these well characterized and appropriately capped reservoirs many of the depleted reservoirs are good candidates for integrated co2 sequestration and circulation operations for geothermal energy production since co2 hasn t been used for enhanced oil recovery after secondary water flooded recovery in these oil reservoirs we assume they are saturated by brine initially for simplified model simulations the major purpose of this study is to numerically evaluate the technical feasibility and performance of potential co2 sequestration and subsequent co2 circulated geothermal productions in these fault blocked reservoirs of shuaiba formation with various hydro geothermal properties we also develop a response surfaces rs model between selected key input parameters and the response variables standing for important geothermal reservoir performances rs models such as kriging polynomials neural network gaussian support vector machines and radial basis functions etc razavi et al 2012 can be used as surrogates for the original numerical models for fast response computation in tasks like simulation based optimization and bayesian inference which demand hundreds or thousands of model simulations chen et al 2014 2015 in the past years rs methods were introduced to carbon sequestration modeling to evaluate hydro mechanic performance co2 storage risk assessment and cost estimations etc dai et al 2014a sun et al 2018 zulqarnain et al 2019 raziperchikolaee and mishra 2020 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars a nonparametric regression technique that adaptively construct models in local regions for regression modeling of high dimensional data friedman 1991 has been demonstrated to be more accurate and efficient than other rs methods jin et al 2001 chen et al 2013 in this study a mars model is developed and used to analyze continuous changes of response variables with variation in the input parameters in specified ranges especially with respect to top sensitive parameters according to mars based global sensitivity indices unlike previous sensitivity studies using several discrete model scenarios e g babaei 2019 continuous rs of performance indicators are developed to comprehensively assess mass budget fault leakage risk thermal production and lifespan of the geothermal reservoirs in this study besides few studies have been addressing the particular geothermal reservoir conditions found in north oman foreland basin which can be characterized by an inclined and thin layer partially to fully fault blocked relatively homogeneous and relatively low permeable formation which are suitable for horizontal flooding operations this paper is organized as follows in the methodology section our approach to modeling co2 sequestration and circulation operated by using horizontal wells is described the property ranges of these reservoirs are estimated according to field data at multiple locations of the basin we also describe how mars rss are developed using the training datasets generated from the co2 sequestration circulation model statistical probability distribution global sensitivity and rss of a set of designed geothermal performance indicators are analyzed in section 3 major findings significance and limitations of this study are concluded in section 4 2 modeling methodology 2 1 sequential co2 sequestration and circulation models in line with the purpose of evaluating the operation performance of co2 sequestration and circulation under a variety of conditions of oil reservoirs in north oman a simple homogeneous domain comprising an inclined storage reservoir and a perpendicular fault is assumed as illustrated in fig 2 as the storage reservoir is relatively thin with low permeability a horizontal injection and a production well are employed directly underneath the caprock seal to maximize sweeping area a base case is used to explain how numerical co2 sequestration and subsequent circulation models are developed nuft non isothermal unsaturated saturated flow and transport code developed and maintained by lawrence livermore national laboratory nitao 1998 is used as the numerical simulator the deterministic hydro geothermal properties are given in table 1 and mean values of 8 uncertain parameters are used for the base case table 2 the dimension and initial distribution of pressure and temperature are shown in fig 3 the coordinate system is rotated by 10 clockwise around y axis representing the dip angle of the reservoir layer the domain size is 2000 and 3000 m in x and y directions respectively the 2250 m vertical depth to the left top corner of the reservoir 30 m thickness of the reservoir and the 10 degrees of dip angle yields 2318 m for the domain size in z direction the cubical domain is discretized by 50 100 30 and 50 100 114 m3 cells in the reservoir and overburden respectively leading to a total of 40 30 10 20 36 000 model cells except for the leftmost cells representing the bounding fault plane the 39 30 20 23400 cells of the overburden above the reservoir storage are nullified leading to a 50 m wide fault plane and a 30 m thick reservoir layer as the active model cells fig 3a the top and bottom of the reservoir zone and left and right planes of the fault zone are assumed impermeable the cell volumes of front and back boundaries of both fault and reservoir are multiplied by 500 to represent a partially permeable faults the cell volumes of the right boundary of the reservoir are enlarged 106 times serving as an infinite far field a constant heat flow of 0 05 w m2 is applied upon the bottom boundary as the geothermal source constant pressure 0 2 mpa and temperature 30 c are specified at the top cell of the fault representing a depth of 10 m below water table the initial values of pressure and temperature are calculated according to their top boundary values hydrostatics and vertical geothermal gradient of 35 c km respectively as visualized in fig 3a and 3b to avoid potential re activation of the bounding faults or fracturing of the caprock caused by injection pressure a fixed 10 mpa overpressure is assumed upon the cells of the 1 km long horizontal injection well in the middle region of the domain along y axis at x 100 m beneath caprock fig 4 the temperature of injected co2 is specified as 30 c the entire fault reservoir system is initially saturated by 180 ppt brine under the constant bottom hole pressure bhp of 33 8 mpa 23 8 mpa initial pressure plus 10 mpa overpressure the injected supercritical co2 gradually displaces brine and spreads from the top left to down right region while a small portion of co2 may leak into the fault zone on the left co2 circulation production and re injection starts after 20 years of sequestration driven by constant overpressure at the injection well and extraction rate at the production well the values of model primary variables including pressure saturation concentration and temperature at the end of sequestration are used as initial conditions for the circulation model besides the injection well a 1 km long production well starts to extract fluids and its location is determined by co2 saturation in the end of sequestration stage as illustrated in fig 4 the x coordinates of the production well is the same as that of the farthest bottom layer cell where co2 saturation is 0 01 which is 600 m while y and z coordinates are the same as the injection well while the bhp of the injection well during co2 circulation remains the same as the sequestration stage 33 8 mpa the production rate is linearly increased from 0 to 1 5 times of the injection rate 10 17 kg s in the 20th year of sequestration in the first 1 5 years of circulation that is 15 255 kg s numerical experiments under various reservoir conditions indicate that this method of determining production well location and rate can yield co2 cut of produced fluids co2 and brine high enough 0 94 for surface co2 turbine operation welch and boyle 2009 2 2 development of response surfaces following the procedure illustrated in fig 5 rss using mars algorithm are developed between key reservoir property parameters and reservoir performance indicators response variables for efficient evaluations of co2 sequestration circulation under various reservoir conditions the definitions of input parameters and response variables are given in table 2 and 3 first 1000 samples are obtained from an eight dimensional parameter space constrained by the value range of each parameter using latin hypercube lh sampling mckay et al 1979 the first two parameters permeability of reservoir and fault zone are considered to have log uniform distributions while the other six input parameters are sampled uniformly in their ranges as listed in table 2 the first six inputs including permeability depth thickness dip of the reservoir and vertical geothermal gradient are directly associated with physical properties of the reservoir and hence their ranges are determined according to field data of the reservoirs in the north oman region the last two inputs namely volume factor of front back boundary cell facbndvol and the ratio of circulation to sequestration rate rcir2seq are artificially created facbndvol is used to multiply cell volumes and its value from 1 to 1000 represents an impermeable fault seal to an infinite aquifer on both front and back boundaries of the model domain babaei 2019 used a similar multiplier to enlarge boundary cell volumes by 1000 times to model an open reservoir system in our study facbndvol is designed to investigate the influence of various sealed faults as the front back lateral boundaries on the reservoir pressure fluid migration and geothermal heat extractions rcir2seq which has a value randomly distributed between 1 and 2 is used to calculate production rate during the circulation stage by multiplying the injection rate at the end of sequestration stage furthermore the production rate is linearly increased from 0 to the calculated value in the first rcir2seq years of the circulation stage to avoid abrupt underpressure near the production well for example in the base case discussed in the previous sub section the value of 1 5 as the middle point of rcir2seq s range is used and the calculated production rate is linearly reached in the first 1 5 years and remains constant afterwards during co2 circulation the range of rcir2seq is determined based on tens of numerical modeling experiments under different reservoir conditions to avoid large under pressure at production wells and to maximize co2 circulation and heat extraction the 2nd step is to generate and execute 1000 co2 sequestration models based on the 1000 input samples each of the input samples is incorporated into the nuft input files along with other deterministic parameter values note that the last input parameter rcir2seq is not used here in the sequestration model but solely in developing the circulation models apart from the previously described sampled parameters all the other input parameters are assumed deterministic and the same as the base case in the 1000 model runs the values of the following seven response variables are derived from the outputs of each sequestration model simulation fig 5 accumulated mass of co2 injected and leaked to the fault zone surface leakage percentage and brine mass leaked to the fault and out of the top cell in 20 years of sequestration injection production well determined by co2 saturation fig 4 and production rate determined by injection rate and rcir2seq the last two variable values are also used as inputs to the subsequent circulation model in the 3rd step 1000 co2 circulation models are generated using the same 1000 input samples and the corresponding sequestration model simulation results as the initial values except for the eight sampled input parameters and the derived production rate and well location all the other inputs are the same as those in the base case model a total of 12 response variables are designed with the first five on co2 and brine mass budget and the left seven variables on performance of geothermal extraction for each of the 12 response variables 1000 values are derived from the outputs of the corresponding circulation simulation fig 5 finally based on the 1000 input samples and the corresponding response variable values as the training dataset 19 rss are developed mapping the 8 vector input to each response variable using mars algorithm fig 5 the 7 and 12 response variables from sequestration and circulation models respectively are described in table 3 all rss are validated by a 10 fold cross validation method in which the training dataset is split into 10 subsets and each subset is used as a test set while all the other 9 subsets are used as a training dataset picard and cook 1984 izady et al 2017 using these rss sobol total order indices sti of each response variable to the eight input parameters are efficiently calculated for quantitative sensitivity analysis of the model system sobol 1993 sobol 2003 generally the parameter is considered strongly moderately and slightly sensitive for sti values around 1 0 0 5 and 0 1 respectively for each response variable the top two sensitive input parameters or those with sti 0 1 are identified and gray highlighted in table 4 for in depth rs analysis all the applied algorithms including lh sampling mars fitting cross validation and sti calculating are obtained from psuade the problem solving environment for uncertainty analysis and design exploration tong 2009 an interface written in python scripts is developed to integrate nuft models with psuade algorithms the 1000 co2 sequestration circulation models are distributed to and executed simultaneously in clusters at sultan qaboos university oman the running time of each single sequestration or circulation model varies between 1 and 5 h depending on input sample values 3 results and analysis in this section analysis of the 19 response variables and the corresponding rss are divided into three groups table 3 1 co2 and brine mass budget after 20 years of sequestration 2 co2 and brine mass budget after 20 years of circulation and 3 performance indicators of geothermal reservoirs after 30 years of heat extraction for each response variable the probability density and cumulative distribution functions pdf cdf respectively and the pairwise rss against the most sensitive input parameters are used to analyze fluid mass distribution and geothermal reservoir performance although 8 dimensional rss are developed for each response variable only 2d slices can be readily visualized for all 2 input rs plots other input parameter values are set in the middle point of their ranges 3 1 mass budget during co2 sequestration during the co2 sequestration co2 is injected into the brine filled reservoir and displace brine gradually under the 10 mpa overpressure against the 1 km horizontal well near the left fault boundary most of the injected co2 migrates towards reservoir far field and a small portion is leaked into the left fault zone and continues to move upward along the fault some co2 may leak out to ground surface and atmosphere concurrently brine might be driven into the fault zone and upwards to shallow aquifer fig 6 shows the time series of mass flux injected leaked to the fault stored co2 produced co2 and brine and co2 surface leakage percentage in 20 years of sequestration and 30 years of circulation from the base case model about 10 of the injected co2 is distributed to fault zone and surface leakage is 2 3 during sequestration stage in this subsection the cumulative mass during sequestration from 1000 model simulations will be analyzed 3 1 1 analysis of co2 injection and leakage during sequestration fig 7 gives the statistics of cumulative co2 mass distributions and rs to the two most sensitive input parameters the cumulative injected co2 in 20 years seqco2inj averaged over 1000 models is 6 7 mt among which 0 8 mt migrates into the fault zone seqco2flt leaving 5 9 mt stored in the reservoir averaged 2 31 of total injected co2 escapes from the fault zone to the atmosphere under constant bhp at the injection well the injected amount is dominated by reservoir permeability permstor with sti as high as 0 95 the reservoir thickness thickstor much less sensitive than its permeability is ranked as the 2nd most important parameter the rs of seqco2inj shows the injected co2 increase positively with both reservoir permeability and thickness reaching its highest value at the most permeable and thickest reservoir although the input parameters are uniformly sampled the distribution of seqco2inj is strongly right skewed left leaning according to its cdf curve the probability of the injected co2 5 and 10 mt reach 50 and 80 respectively which is also reflected by corresponding area in the 2d rs fig 7a fig 7b shows the fault zone co2 mass is controlled by and positively correlated to fault permeability sti 0 929 it also increases with the reservoir permeability because of the increase of total injected co2 but their proportion will decrease because more co2 will be stored in the reservoir moreover the increase rate is higher in upper region of permstor 14 2 log m2 than in the lower region according to the rs seqco2leak is mainly controlled by permeability of reservoir sti 0 623 and fault sti 0 466 and slightly affected by fault depth sti 0 127 fig 7c obviously the higher the ratio of the fault reservoir permeability the larger the surface leakage the influence of fault length on the leakage however is somewhat complicated the migration of co2 from the fault bottom to top is controlled not only by darcy s law but also by buoyancy force generated by co2 density difference according to darcy s law co2 flow is positively related to pressure gradient and fault permeability but negatively related to the travel length i e fault depth nevertheless the rs associated with permflt and depthstor shows sepco2leak increase with the fault depth within the major parameter ranges expect for the right bottom corner this might be explained by so called thermosiphon a driving force generated by the substantial co2 density changes with pressures along the fault pathway for the fault with high permeability 15 log m2 and short length 1 5 km darcy force dominates the upward co2 flow along the fault against thermosiphon force according to rs against permstor and depthstor where permflt is set as 15 5 seqco2leak increases with the fault depth in the major area suggesting thermosiphon effect dominates the co2 flow along the fault a comprehensive evaluation of thermosiphon effect for co2 under a variety of reservoir depths and geothermal gradients are available by adams et al 2014 the areas of rss where the values 5 are nullified to show not only a clearer lower leakage distribution but also the reservoir property parameters ranges that should be avoided although some studies suggest up to 2 is acceptable pacala 2003 van der zwaan and gerlagh 2009 the most recognized maximum leakage rate is 1 for co2 geological sequestration kutz and elkamel 2010 shaffer 2010 according to the rs analysis only a combination of higher storage reservoir permeability and lower fault permeability can meet this requirement of 1 leakage 3 1 2 analysis of brine leakage during sequestration during co2 sequestration brine in deep reservoir is primarily driven to right side far field of the storage reservoir and a small portion could be driven into the fault zone by the injected co2 pushed upward and leaked to shallow aquifer the probability distribution of seqbrineflt and the three pairwise rss against the three sensitive input parameters sti 0 1 ranked in sequence as permflt facbndvol and permstor are presented in fig 8 a it is seen that more brine mass will move into the fault as its permeability becomes higher facbndvol sampled between 1 and 1000 is used to magnify the cell volumes on front and back boundary planes which significantly affects pressure propagation and the brine transport to the front and back sides if facbndvol is larger more brine will migrate towards both sides of the reservoir instead of the low permeable fault zone which is the fact in major areas of the two associated rss whereas the maximum seqbrineflt is corresponding to the facbndvol s value of 50 or so instead of the minimum value of 1 one likely explanation is that the front back boundary cells in fault are also magnified by facbndvol and in a range of 1 and 50 it might help to release pressure in the bottom fault zone and induce more brine from the reservoir zone it is interesting that the maximum and minimum seqbrineflt correspond to the highest and lowest permflt respectively but both occur at the highest permstor in other words seqbrineflt changes more substantially with permflt when permstor becomes higher on the one hand higher reservoir permeability allows more co2 injected into the reservoir under fixed injector overpressure and drive more brine into the fault with high permeability but on the other hand it may induce more brine in the fault zone with low permeability into reservoir leading to less net brine into the fault according to the pdf and cdf of seqbrinetop fig 8b 90 of its values is 0 1 mt suggesting that few brine could reach the fault top and in some condition water flow back into the fault from the overlain aquifer instead negative value rs further reveals that the bottom brine can hardly reach the fault top in low permeable faults in high permeable faults log k 15 7 the largest amount of brine leaked out of the fault top happens for short faults and a small amount of water could flow reversely from overburden into the long faults depthstor 2 5 km brine density is far less sensitive to pressure and temperature changes than co2 and thermosiphon effect is negligible the bottom top pressure gradient is not sufficient to support brine s upward migration in long faults as a result the risk of brine leakage to the shallow aquifer is much lower than that of co2 and is negligible for deeper reservoir sequestrations particularly 3 2 well space and production rate for co2 circulation well space and production rate are critically important for a co2 geothermal system operation as they directly determine co2 sweeping area and thermal production and depletion as discussed in section 2 the location of the injection well is fixed for all the models hence well space for each circulation model is derived from the location of production well which is determined by co2 saturation in the 20th year of sequestration using the method illustrated in fig 4 the well space is averaged as 567 m and ranges between 150 and 1500 m the increment of well space is 50 m i e the grid cell size in dimension resulting in a stepwise cdf curve as shown in fig 9 a it is strongly sensitive to reservoir permeability sti 0 989 and slightly affected by reservoir depth sti 0 063 it makes sense since co2 saturation in reservoir is positively correlated to injected co2 which in turn is correlated with reservoir permeability fig 7a cirprodrate is a product of rcir2seq 1 0 2 0 and instantaneous co2 injection rate at the time of 20th year of sequestration varying from 2 84 to 70 76 with a mean of 17 75 kg s co2 injection rate is quite steady after 20 years of sequestration fig 6 under constant bhp and primarily determined by reservoir permeability fig 7a consequently the production rate for co2 circulation is mainly determined by reservoir permeability and the multiplier rcir2seq as shown in the rs fig 9b 3 3 mass budget during co2 circulation following 20 years of co2 sequestration while the 10 mpa overpressure remains in the 1 km long horizontal injection well hot fluid extraction starts from a parallel 1 km horizontal production well the production well location and extraction rate are specified based on co2 saturation and injection rate at the end of sequestration following the aforementioned method under this sink source configuration geothermal energy is extracted to the ground surface through co2 circulation the time series of co2 mass flux for the base case indicates that the co2 injection rate is increased under the constant fluid production though net injection rate and stored rate are reduced in circulation from the sequestration stage fig 6 co2 flux into the fault zone is relatively stable from sequestration to circulation a small portion of brine is also produced along with co2 during circulation in the following subsections five response variables on co2 and brine mass distribution are analyzed under a variety of reservoir conditions although circulation models are simulated to 50 years cumulative fluid masses are calculated after 20 years of co2 circulation in order to compare with those after the same length of co2 sequestration unlike sequestration most of the co2 injected during circulation is produced and the difference co2 injected co2 produced is defined as the response variable circo2net surface co2 leakage cumulated in total 40 years of consecutive sequestration and circulation is termed totco2leak the other response variables stand for the same meanings as those in sequestration stage 3 3 1 analysis of co2 net injection and leakage as shown in fig 10 an average 3 146 mt of co2 is net injected into the reservoir during the first 20 years of circulation from which 1 169 mt flows into the fault zone the average surface leakage in the 40 years of sequestration and circulation is 2 42 the mean circo2net is less than half of seqco2inj since the major portion of injected co2 is produced moreover the minimum circo2net is negative indicating that the produced co2 mass could be more than the injected under some conditions the net injected co2 is sensitive sti 0 1 to 4 input parameters yielding 6 pairwise 2d rss in fig 10a rcir2seq sti 0 489 is the most sensitive parameter for circo2net followed by permstor sti 0 474 circo2net decreases with the increase of rcir2seq and more significantly when permstor is higher the minimum negative value and maximum circo2net corresponds to the largest and smallest rcir2seq respectively at the highest permstor as discussed in the sequestration stage higher permstor leads to larger injection rate and the derived production rate as a product of the two parameters changes more significantly with rcir2seq as the dominant parameter when rcir2seq is small 1 3 circo2net increases monotonically with permstor when it is bigger than 1 3 however circo2net increases first and then decreases with permstor as shown in the rs the other two rss related to permstor sliced at the middle point of rcir2seq 1 5 show that circo2net peaks around 14 of permstor this finding indicates that depending on the objective function an optimal rcir2seq and permstor and the associated production rate exist under a specific set of reservoir conditions circo2net is slightly sensitive to and positively related to thickstor sti 0 168 and permflt sti 0 124 thicker reservoir or larger fault permeability may allow more co2 to be injected into the reservoir or leaked to the fault under the constant production rate yielding larger co2 net injected particularly permflt becomes more sensitive when it is greater than 15 7 as indicated in the three associated rss similar to seqco2flt circo2flt is strongly sensitive to and increases with permflt sti 0 967 the mean of circo2flt 1 169 mt is more than that of seqco2flt 0 821 mt due to the fluid extraction more co2 is injected to maintain the specified overpressure of the injection well causing more co2 transported to the nearby fault zone compared to seqco2flt facbndvol sti 0 073 switches the sensitivity rank with permstor sti 0 061 as the 2nd sensitive parameter for circo2flt and seems positively correlated only when it is 200 fig 10b higher values of facbndvol and permstor may both speed up the injection pressure release and induce more co2 injected and leaked to the fault zone compared to seqco2leak mean totco2leak is slightly increased 2 42 vs 2 31 and the maximum is doubled 28 25 vs 13 95 whereas the probability of 1 viable leakage increases to 50 from 30 as indicated by their cdfs fig 7c and 10c the rss further suggest that with low permeable and shallow storage reservoir and high permeable fault zone a much higher leakage could happen in the circulation than in the sequestration stage under most reservoir conditions however the leakage decreases during the circulation stage as indicated by its pdf and cdf which is also demonstrated by leakage history of base case fig 6 the fault properties including permeability sti 0 915 and depth sti 0 261 dominates the leakage in circulation while reservoir permeability is the most sensitive parameter sti 0 623 in sequestration totco2leak increases with the fault depth in lower permflt region but decrease in higher values the minimum leakage occurs around the middle point of permflt this strongly non linear behavior of leakage with various combinations of fault and reservoir properties is caused by the relative strength of darcy force and thermosiphon effect during co2 migration in the vertical fault plane as mentioned above 3 3 2 analysis of brine leakage the mean amount of brine driven into the fault zone is only 1 3 of its counterpart 0 08 vs 0 239 mt in sequestration and around 5 of its values is negative due to the production of brine with co2 fig 11 a cirbrineflt is strongly sensitive to facbndvol sti 0 821 and moderately sensitive to permflt sti 0 433 and permstor sti 0 420 facbndvol plays a more important role in brine flow to the fault zone during circulation compared to sequestration at the lowest facbndvol negative cirbrineflt suggests that brine may flow from the fault zone to the storage reservoir maximal cirbrineflt occurs at facbndvol 300 and higher values of permflt and in specific diagonal regions of facbndvol permstor brine flow inward and outward of the fault top boundary however is intensified during circulation compared to sequestration fig 11b the mean value of cirbrinetop is double that of seqbrinetop the probability and amount of brine inflow negative cirbrinetop is also increased the amount and direction of brine flow is mainly controlled by fault permeability according to the rs brine flow outwards in high values of permflt and inwards in its middle values in low fault permeability no brine flow can cross the top boundary fault depth affects the brine flow slightly higher depth leads to smaller outflow and larger inflow in high and middle values of permflt respectively the highest possibility for brine to enter overlaid shallow aquifer is in a short and permeable fault as fault permeability is usually heterogeneous and significantly uncertain choosing deeper reservoir may reduce the risk of brine contamination certainly and effectively 3 4 performance of geothermal production geothermal reservoir conditions and performance are evaluated in this section seven response variables on pressure and temperature decline co2 cut among produced fluids thermal production and lifespan are assessed using their probability distribution and rss below 3 4 1 1 pressure and temperature decline and thermal production for the partial fault compartmentalized reservoirs discussed in our study both overpressure and underpressure need to be carefully controlled to avoid possible fault re activation during co2 circulation pressure dropdown at the production well bottom happens mainly in the first 1 2 years when production rate increases from zero to the specified constant the mean and maximal underpressure cirdp pwell in 30 years of circulation are 4 59 and 10 41 mpa respectively corresponding appropriately to the fixed 10 mpa overpressure at the injection well co2 is hence circulated under pressure differences between injection and production wells the sensitive parameters for cirdp pwell are rcir2seq permflt permstor and facbndvol in sequence the six pairwise rss fig 12 a show cirdp pwell is positively correlated to all four parameters the larger rcir2seq yields higher production rate and consequentially higher underpressure the higher permflt permstor or facbndvol is in favor of co2 circulation and hence leads to high underpressure temperature near the production well unlike pressure declines more gradually with the continuous fluid extraction fig 6 the mean and maximal temperature decline in 30 years is 15 and 50 c respectively sensitive parameters for cirdt pwell are ranked in order as depthstor rcir2seq permstor and permflt and six pairwise rss are shown in fig 12b permflt is influential only at its high values 15 7 where a considerable amount of leaked to fault co2 induces more cold co2 injection into the reservoir when permstor increase from 14 6 to 14 4 the increase of circulation rate yields more temperature drops once it is larger than 14 4 the consequential longer well space dominates the influence on temperature decline at production well fig 9a which is reduced with the permstor these combined effects of production rate and well spaces lead to the peak temperature dropdown at 14 4 of permstor similar patterns can be found in permflt and permstor related rss of the associated circo2net fig 10a cirdt pwell increases monotonically with rcir2seq as the multiplier for production rate as the most sensitive parameter it is a little complicated to assess the influence of depthstor on cirdt pwell although the initial reservoir temperature increases linearly with depthstor the decline of temperature at the production well depends primarily on co2 circulation rate and well space hence the reduction of cirdt pwell with the increase of depthstor is mainly because of the increase in well space as revealed by fig 9a the mean produced heat energy in 30 years of operation is 6 7 1015 joules yielding 7 mw of converted thermal capacity thermal production is determined primarily by produced co2 and its temperature the rs suggests that highly permeable and thick reservoirs have higher potential thermal energy capacity fig 12c 3 4 2 2 co2 cut in the produced fluid the mass fraction of co2 to total fluid co2 brine produced namely co2 cut is another important performance indicator of the co2 geothermal system to guarantee appropriate running of co2 turbines co2 cut should be at least 0 94 welch and boyle 2009 it is also argued that it is acceptable for co2 cut to be slightly lower than 0 94 occasionally during co2 circulation garapati et al 2015 fig 12d and 12e presents probability distribution and rss for average and minimal co2 cut in 30 years of circulation respectively the mean values for ciraveco2cut and cirminco2cut are 0 973 and 0 956 respectively both above 0 94 the probability for ciraveco2cut and cirminco2cut below 0 94 is about 5 and 10 according to their cdfs both response variables are sensitive to permstor depthstor and rcir2seq ranked in sequence the rss associated with permstor and depthstor are very similar to those of cirdt pwell suggesting production rate and well space are key control variables affecting co2 cut as discussed in our methodology production rate and well space are carefully specified according to co2 plume and injection rate in the 20th year of sequestration which are determined by reservoir permeability depth and the multiplier rcir2seq high permeable and deep reservoirs along with large rcir2seq could cause co2 cut less than the required 0 94 as shown by white nullified area of rss 3 4 3 temperature and lifespan of geothermal reservoirs initial reservoir temperatures depend on reservoir depth and geothermal gradient after consecutive 20 years of sequestration and 30 years of circulation the two reservoir property parameters namely depthstor sti 0 864 and gradtemp sti 0 089 are still the top two sensitive parameters for cirt pwell fig 12f according to its cdf the probability of cirt pwell being lower than 75 c in the 30th year of circulation is about 30 the white area in the response gives the corresponding ranges of depthstor and gradtemp which should be avoided in choosing feasible geothermal reservoirs cirlifespan is defined as the years of circulation until cirt pwell is below 75 c although system performance is evaluated for 30 years of circulation which is the typical lifespan for a geothermal field nearly half of lifespans are longer than 50 years as shown by the pdf and cdf of cirlifespan fig 12g cirlifespan is controlled by reservoir depth sti 0 902 and slightly affected by the production rate multiplier rcir2seq sti 0 08 suggesting deeper geothermal reservoirs with higher temperatures always benefit reservoir longevity the minimal lifespan considered economically feasible for a co2 geothermal reservoir operation is assumed 15 years as indicated by the rs only a tiny area corresponding to highest rcir2seq and lowest depthstor represents values of cirlifespan 15 years in general lifespan is longer than 40 years for reservoirs deeper than 2 km 3 4 4 analysis of overall sensitivity of input parameters probability distribution of each response variable along with rss corresponding to the top two sensitive input parameters sti might be 0 1 or those with sti 0 1 parameter may be over 2 are analyzed above in this sub section overall sensitivity of each input parameter is analyzed column by column in table 4 in order to reveal their relative importance in the reservoir system the mean sti and the corresponding rank of each input parameter is summarized in the last two rows of table 4 as the no 1 sensitive parameter reservoir permeability strongly affects 7 response variables sti 0 5 high permeable reservoir is in favor of reservoir performance by yielding higher co2 injectivity fewer co2 leakage higher circulation rate larger injection production well space and more thermal production although the risk of co2 cut below required 94 is relatively high it can be overcome by choosing appropriate reservoir depth and production rate multiplier the fault permeability mainly controls the co2 and brine mass distribution to the fault zone subsequent upward migration and risk of surface leakage high permeable fault will substantially increase the risk of fluid leakage to the fault zone co2 leakage to atmosphere and brine contamination of shallow aquifers reservoir depth is ranked as the 3rd important parameter and can be easily determined in contrast to spatially heterogeneous permeability of the reservoir and fault zone deeper reservoirs can significantly reduce brine contamination of shallow aquifer yield high reservoir temperature and longer lifespan the production rate multiplier rcir2seq helps to adjust production rate based on the injection rate of sequestration and is influential to net injected co2 and the pressure dropdown around production well it should be carefully chosen to avoid extremely high underpressure which could cause reactivation of the faults bounding the reservoir the sealing performance of front back lateral faults facbndvol substantially affects brine mass transport to the fault zone generally a closed lateral boundary will drive more brine into the fault the reservoir thickness only slightly affects co2 injectivity and the resultant thermal production the vertical geothermal gradient which partially determines initial reservoir temperature could influence temperature history and lifespan to some degree dip angle is found insensitive to all the 19 response variables with mean sti 0 01 4 summary and conclusions one thousand numerical nuft models are developed to simulate consecutive co2 sequestration and circulation under a suite of reservoir conditions which cover possible hydro geothermal properties of typical thin layered and fault compartmentalized reservoirs in the north oman region nineteen response variables are designed as indicators of co2 and brine mass distribution and leakage and performance of geothermal reservoirs rss of these 19 variables are developed using simulated results from 1000 models as the training dataset global sensitivity indices of the 19 response variables to the eight input parameters are computed efficiently using the rss the probability distributions pdf and cdf of response variables sensitivity indices and rss are then used to comprehensively evaluate performance of co2 sequestration and geothermal production via co2 circulation in typical hydro geothermal reservoirs in north oman the main findings are concluded below under fixed overpressure at injection well reservoir permeability is the most dominant parameter to the system controlling co2 injectivity and hence affects more or less the subsequent mass distribution in the reservoir fault system well placement and circulation rate and thermal productions the mean co2 mass net injected in typical reservoirs in north oman is 0 335 and 0 157 mt year during sequestration and circulation stages respectively the mean thermal energy production capacity of 1000 simulations is 7 mw and it could reach 27 mw for the 40 m thick reservoir with permeability of 20 md the fault permeability controls mass leaked to the fault and subsequent co2 leakage rate to the atmosphere and brine contamination to the shallow aquifers large reservoir depth may eliminate the risk of brine contamination of shallow aquifers but might not effectively reduce co2 surface leakage because of thermosiphon effect on co2 migration in the vertical fault plane the mean co2 leakage to atmosphere is 2 31 and 2 42 of the net injected co2 during the two stages but up to 30 and 50 operations in the two stages can meet the leakage requirement of 1 combination of low fault permeability and high reservoir permeability can effectively control the co2 leakage rate in the acceptable level in general choosing deeper reservoir is favorable to longevity of geothermal reservoir given higher initial reservoir temperatures the mean lifespan of the 1000 geothermal reservoirs is 42 4 years and for half of them it is longer than 50 years for any geothermal reservoirs deeper than 2 km their lifespans are longer than 40 years reservoir thickness ranging 20 40 m and geothermal gradient between 30 and 40 c km are not the primary factors to consider and reservoir dip could be completely ignored during reservoir site selections the sealing property of lateral faults facbndvol mainly affects brine flux between storage reservoir and fault zone which is not the major concern since the fault zone is initially saturated with brine too instead the brine reaching the fault top poses the risk of contamination of shallow water resources and should be carefully evaluated as long as the reservoir depth is large enough the sealing property of lateral faults is negligible to the system the multiplier rcir2seq is very useful to adjust circulation rate to avoid extreme underpressure which could cause faults reactivation while overpressure on injection well is fixed at 10 mpa the resultant maximal and mean underpressure is only 10 41 and 4 59 mpa among all the 1000 operation scenarios thanks to the excellently designed method specifying circulation rates the proposed methods to determine production well placement according to co2 saturation and circulation rate according to co2 sequestration rate can guarantee 95 probability for averaged co2 cut in produced fluid in 30 years mixture of co2 and brine greater than required 0 94 the combination of highest reservoir permeability depth and circulation rate multiplier rcir2seq which could lead to co2 cut lower than 0 94 should be avoided rs analysis indicates that the performance of the system is not monotonically correlated to single or combination of these input parameters due to visualizing limitation only 2 input sliced rss are presented by setting other parameters in the middle point of their ranges complete exploration of full dimensional rss is highly suggested by numerical methods in addition to the visualization numerical optimization using rss of these response variables can avoid intensive computation difficulty during optimization using physical models and provide an efficient alternative to find optimal geothermal reservoir and operational scheme credit authorship

4576,in the past decade techno economic feasibility of using co2 as a working fluid to harvest geothermal energy has been studied and demonstrated in both hot dry rock and deep brine aquifers potential geothermal resources have been suggested by hydrogeological surveys in north oman area many depleting petroleum reservoirs in this area provide excellent candidates as co2 geologic storage and geothermal reservoirs considering well characterized and sealed geological structures and existing on site infrastructure in this study we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of reservoir performances during co2 sequestration and circulation with possible field conditions in north oman foreland basin continuous response surfaces of performance indicators are developed using 1000 co2 sequestration circulation models each model input file is assigned a set of values sampled using latin hypercube method from high dimensional parameter space bounded by ranges of key property parameters of reservoirs including reservoir dip angle depth permeability thickness lateral boundaries bounded fault permeability and geothermal temperature gradient using response surfaces key performance indicators including co2 injection production storage fault leakage well space pressure temperature produced thermal flux and lifespan are quantitatively evaluated corresponding to various reservoir conditions represented by input parameters the findings provide a quantitative guidance on site selection geothermal field development and operation and associated leakage risk assessment and techno economic analysis for potential co2 sequestration geothermal exploration and utilization in north oman foreland basin and other similar fields keywords petroleum reservoir geothermal energy co2 sequestration fault leakage response surface 1 introduction continuous reliance on fossil fuels as the primary energy sources is facing two key challenges first fossil fuel resources are depleting due to intensive uses in the past 50 years and second there is an ever increasing climate change caused by the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption abas and khan 2014 to meet increasing energy demand and reduce carbon emissions substantial efforts have been made to explore renewable non carbon energy sources such as solar wind geothermal ocean tidal wave etc khan et al 2017 compared to intermittent solar or wind sources geothermal energy is continuous stable and possesses high thermal efficiency another alternative to reduce atmospheric co2 concentration is co2 sequestration in which co2 is injected and stored permanently in widely available deep saline aquifers shaffer 2010 dai et al 2014b chen et al 2020 co2 has been used as an effective working fluid for enhanced oil recovery in petroleum industry and thermal energy extraction from deep hot dry rock by fracking the impermeable rock pruess 2006 in the past decade combination of co2 sequestration in natural permeable saline aquifer and extraction of geothermal energy from the hot brine by circulating co2 has been intensively investigated e g randolph and saar 2011 babaei 2019 this co2 circulated geothermal production system has been demonstrated to be more efficient than the traditional brine circulated system due to thermodynamic advantages of co2 as it has lower viscosity and higher mobility than brine under the common pressure and temperature of deep saline reservoirs leading to efficient advection transport of heat in porous formations garapati et al 2015 more importantly drastic variations of co2 density with changes in pressure and temperature can generate a strong thermosiphon effect through the circulation pathway between the injection and production wells this thermosiphon effect can significantly reduce the demand for pumping power to circulate co2 and hence can greatly improve the system efficiency adams et al 2014 oman has considerable low medium enthalpy geothermal resources which have received little attention partially due to availability of abundant fossil energy reserves and solar energy resources 300 hot springs are distributed in north oman s mountainous regions among which about 50 can be attributed to medium enthalpy geothermal reservoirs with temperature around 100 150 c umar 2018 in northern oman the geothermal gradient ranges between 20 and 40 c km and averaged heat flow is estimated as 47 9 mw m2 sch√ºtz et al 2018 the temperature distribution at a depth of 1500 m in north oman regions fig 1 suggests that areas with higher temperatures 75 c are within the north oman foreland basin where several large oil gas fields such as natih safah and fahud are located terken 1999 decades of oil reservoir characterization efforts show that the geological stratigraphy in these oil fields exhibits a layer cake carbonate sequence droste and van steenwinkel 2004 morettini et al 2005 capped by impermeable nahr umr shale shuaiba limestone formation has been identified as the main oil reservoir extending the entire foreland basin and been partitioned by faults into a lot of isolated blocks with varying dip angle al hadhrami et al 2018 this thin formation is characterized by relatively homogeneous properties with high porosity and low permeability and a combination of both structural and stratigraphic traps bigno et al 2001 horizontal water flooding was implemented and demonstrated as an effective oil recovery method to cope with high depletion in these fields zhang et al 2007 historically only 30 50 of the oil is recovered after secondary recovery and 50 70 of the oil remains in the reservoir further recovery requires more expensive technologies and reservoirs were usually abandoned at this point n√∫√±ez l√≥pez and moskal 2019 considering the existing infrastructure and oil production experience in these well characterized and appropriately capped reservoirs many of the depleted reservoirs are good candidates for integrated co2 sequestration and circulation operations for geothermal energy production since co2 hasn t been used for enhanced oil recovery after secondary water flooded recovery in these oil reservoirs we assume they are saturated by brine initially for simplified model simulations the major purpose of this study is to numerically evaluate the technical feasibility and performance of potential co2 sequestration and subsequent co2 circulated geothermal productions in these fault blocked reservoirs of shuaiba formation with various hydro geothermal properties we also develop a response surfaces rs model between selected key input parameters and the response variables standing for important geothermal reservoir performances rs models such as kriging polynomials neural network gaussian support vector machines and radial basis functions etc razavi et al 2012 can be used as surrogates for the original numerical models for fast response computation in tasks like simulation based optimization and bayesian inference which demand hundreds or thousands of model simulations chen et al 2014 2015 in the past years rs methods were introduced to carbon sequestration modeling to evaluate hydro mechanic performance co2 storage risk assessment and cost estimations etc dai et al 2014a sun et al 2018 zulqarnain et al 2019 raziperchikolaee and mishra 2020 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars a nonparametric regression technique that adaptively construct models in local regions for regression modeling of high dimensional data friedman 1991 has been demonstrated to be more accurate and efficient than other rs methods jin et al 2001 chen et al 2013 in this study a mars model is developed and used to analyze continuous changes of response variables with variation in the input parameters in specified ranges especially with respect to top sensitive parameters according to mars based global sensitivity indices unlike previous sensitivity studies using several discrete model scenarios e g babaei 2019 continuous rs of performance indicators are developed to comprehensively assess mass budget fault leakage risk thermal production and lifespan of the geothermal reservoirs in this study besides few studies have been addressing the particular geothermal reservoir conditions found in north oman foreland basin which can be characterized by an inclined and thin layer partially to fully fault blocked relatively homogeneous and relatively low permeable formation which are suitable for horizontal flooding operations this paper is organized as follows in the methodology section our approach to modeling co2 sequestration and circulation operated by using horizontal wells is described the property ranges of these reservoirs are estimated according to field data at multiple locations of the basin we also describe how mars rss are developed using the training datasets generated from the co2 sequestration circulation model statistical probability distribution global sensitivity and rss of a set of designed geothermal performance indicators are analyzed in section 3 major findings significance and limitations of this study are concluded in section 4 2 modeling methodology 2 1 sequential co2 sequestration and circulation models in line with the purpose of evaluating the operation performance of co2 sequestration and circulation under a variety of conditions of oil reservoirs in north oman a simple homogeneous domain comprising an inclined storage reservoir and a perpendicular fault is assumed as illustrated in fig 2 as the storage reservoir is relatively thin with low permeability a horizontal injection and a production well are employed directly underneath the caprock seal to maximize sweeping area a base case is used to explain how numerical co2 sequestration and subsequent circulation models are developed nuft non isothermal unsaturated saturated flow and transport code developed and maintained by lawrence livermore national laboratory nitao 1998 is used as the numerical simulator the deterministic hydro geothermal properties are given in table 1 and mean values of 8 uncertain parameters are used for the base case table 2 the dimension and initial distribution of pressure and temperature are shown in fig 3 the coordinate system is rotated by 10 clockwise around y axis representing the dip angle of the reservoir layer the domain size is 2000 and 3000 m in x and y directions respectively the 2250 m vertical depth to the left top corner of the reservoir 30 m thickness of the reservoir and the 10 degrees of dip angle yields 2318 m for the domain size in z direction the cubical domain is discretized by 50 100 30 and 50 100 114 m3 cells in the reservoir and overburden respectively leading to a total of 40 30 10 20 36 000 model cells except for the leftmost cells representing the bounding fault plane the 39 30 20 23400 cells of the overburden above the reservoir storage are nullified leading to a 50 m wide fault plane and a 30 m thick reservoir layer as the active model cells fig 3a the top and bottom of the reservoir zone and left and right planes of the fault zone are assumed impermeable the cell volumes of front and back boundaries of both fault and reservoir are multiplied by 500 to represent a partially permeable faults the cell volumes of the right boundary of the reservoir are enlarged 106 times serving as an infinite far field a constant heat flow of 0 05 w m2 is applied upon the bottom boundary as the geothermal source constant pressure 0 2 mpa and temperature 30 c are specified at the top cell of the fault representing a depth of 10 m below water table the initial values of pressure and temperature are calculated according to their top boundary values hydrostatics and vertical geothermal gradient of 35 c km respectively as visualized in fig 3a and 3b to avoid potential re activation of the bounding faults or fracturing of the caprock caused by injection pressure a fixed 10 mpa overpressure is assumed upon the cells of the 1 km long horizontal injection well in the middle region of the domain along y axis at x 100 m beneath caprock fig 4 the temperature of injected co2 is specified as 30 c the entire fault reservoir system is initially saturated by 180 ppt brine under the constant bottom hole pressure bhp of 33 8 mpa 23 8 mpa initial pressure plus 10 mpa overpressure the injected supercritical co2 gradually displaces brine and spreads from the top left to down right region while a small portion of co2 may leak into the fault zone on the left co2 circulation production and re injection starts after 20 years of sequestration driven by constant overpressure at the injection well and extraction rate at the production well the values of model primary variables including pressure saturation concentration and temperature at the end of sequestration are used as initial conditions for the circulation model besides the injection well a 1 km long production well starts to extract fluids and its location is determined by co2 saturation in the end of sequestration stage as illustrated in fig 4 the x coordinates of the production well is the same as that of the farthest bottom layer cell where co2 saturation is 0 01 which is 600 m while y and z coordinates are the same as the injection well while the bhp of the injection well during co2 circulation remains the same as the sequestration stage 33 8 mpa the production rate is linearly increased from 0 to 1 5 times of the injection rate 10 17 kg s in the 20th year of sequestration in the first 1 5 years of circulation that is 15 255 kg s numerical experiments under various reservoir conditions indicate that this method of determining production well location and rate can yield co2 cut of produced fluids co2 and brine high enough 0 94 for surface co2 turbine operation welch and boyle 2009 2 2 development of response surfaces following the procedure illustrated in fig 5 rss using mars algorithm are developed between key reservoir property parameters and reservoir performance indicators response variables for efficient evaluations of co2 sequestration circulation under various reservoir conditions the definitions of input parameters and response variables are given in table 2 and 3 first 1000 samples are obtained from an eight dimensional parameter space constrained by the value range of each parameter using latin hypercube lh sampling mckay et al 1979 the first two parameters permeability of reservoir and fault zone are considered to have log uniform distributions while the other six input parameters are sampled uniformly in their ranges as listed in table 2 the first six inputs including permeability depth thickness dip of the reservoir and vertical geothermal gradient are directly associated with physical properties of the reservoir and hence their ranges are determined according to field data of the reservoirs in the north oman region the last two inputs namely volume factor of front back boundary cell facbndvol and the ratio of circulation to sequestration rate rcir2seq are artificially created facbndvol is used to multiply cell volumes and its value from 1 to 1000 represents an impermeable fault seal to an infinite aquifer on both front and back boundaries of the model domain babaei 2019 used a similar multiplier to enlarge boundary cell volumes by 1000 times to model an open reservoir system in our study facbndvol is designed to investigate the influence of various sealed faults as the front back lateral boundaries on the reservoir pressure fluid migration and geothermal heat extractions rcir2seq which has a value randomly distributed between 1 and 2 is used to calculate production rate during the circulation stage by multiplying the injection rate at the end of sequestration stage furthermore the production rate is linearly increased from 0 to the calculated value in the first rcir2seq years of the circulation stage to avoid abrupt underpressure near the production well for example in the base case discussed in the previous sub section the value of 1 5 as the middle point of rcir2seq s range is used and the calculated production rate is linearly reached in the first 1 5 years and remains constant afterwards during co2 circulation the range of rcir2seq is determined based on tens of numerical modeling experiments under different reservoir conditions to avoid large under pressure at production wells and to maximize co2 circulation and heat extraction the 2nd step is to generate and execute 1000 co2 sequestration models based on the 1000 input samples each of the input samples is incorporated into the nuft input files along with other deterministic parameter values note that the last input parameter rcir2seq is not used here in the sequestration model but solely in developing the circulation models apart from the previously described sampled parameters all the other input parameters are assumed deterministic and the same as the base case in the 1000 model runs the values of the following seven response variables are derived from the outputs of each sequestration model simulation fig 5 accumulated mass of co2 injected and leaked to the fault zone surface leakage percentage and brine mass leaked to the fault and out of the top cell in 20 years of sequestration injection production well determined by co2 saturation fig 4 and production rate determined by injection rate and rcir2seq the last two variable values are also used as inputs to the subsequent circulation model in the 3rd step 1000 co2 circulation models are generated using the same 1000 input samples and the corresponding sequestration model simulation results as the initial values except for the eight sampled input parameters and the derived production rate and well location all the other inputs are the same as those in the base case model a total of 12 response variables are designed with the first five on co2 and brine mass budget and the left seven variables on performance of geothermal extraction for each of the 12 response variables 1000 values are derived from the outputs of the corresponding circulation simulation fig 5 finally based on the 1000 input samples and the corresponding response variable values as the training dataset 19 rss are developed mapping the 8 vector input to each response variable using mars algorithm fig 5 the 7 and 12 response variables from sequestration and circulation models respectively are described in table 3 all rss are validated by a 10 fold cross validation method in which the training dataset is split into 10 subsets and each subset is used as a test set while all the other 9 subsets are used as a training dataset picard and cook 1984 izady et al 2017 using these rss sobol total order indices sti of each response variable to the eight input parameters are efficiently calculated for quantitative sensitivity analysis of the model system sobol 1993 sobol 2003 generally the parameter is considered strongly moderately and slightly sensitive for sti values around 1 0 0 5 and 0 1 respectively for each response variable the top two sensitive input parameters or those with sti 0 1 are identified and gray highlighted in table 4 for in depth rs analysis all the applied algorithms including lh sampling mars fitting cross validation and sti calculating are obtained from psuade the problem solving environment for uncertainty analysis and design exploration tong 2009 an interface written in python scripts is developed to integrate nuft models with psuade algorithms the 1000 co2 sequestration circulation models are distributed to and executed simultaneously in clusters at sultan qaboos university oman the running time of each single sequestration or circulation model varies between 1 and 5 h depending on input sample values 3 results and analysis in this section analysis of the 19 response variables and the corresponding rss are divided into three groups table 3 1 co2 and brine mass budget after 20 years of sequestration 2 co2 and brine mass budget after 20 years of circulation and 3 performance indicators of geothermal reservoirs after 30 years of heat extraction for each response variable the probability density and cumulative distribution functions pdf cdf respectively and the pairwise rss against the most sensitive input parameters are used to analyze fluid mass distribution and geothermal reservoir performance although 8 dimensional rss are developed for each response variable only 2d slices can be readily visualized for all 2 input rs plots other input parameter values are set in the middle point of their ranges 3 1 mass budget during co2 sequestration during the co2 sequestration co2 is injected into the brine filled reservoir and displace brine gradually under the 10 mpa overpressure against the 1 km horizontal well near the left fault boundary most of the injected co2 migrates towards reservoir far field and a small portion is leaked into the left fault zone and continues to move upward along the fault some co2 may leak out to ground surface and atmosphere concurrently brine might be driven into the fault zone and upwards to shallow aquifer fig 6 shows the time series of mass flux injected leaked to the fault stored co2 produced co2 and brine and co2 surface leakage percentage in 20 years of sequestration and 30 years of circulation from the base case model about 10 of the injected co2 is distributed to fault zone and surface leakage is 2 3 during sequestration stage in this subsection the cumulative mass during sequestration from 1000 model simulations will be analyzed 3 1 1 analysis of co2 injection and leakage during sequestration fig 7 gives the statistics of cumulative co2 mass distributions and rs to the two most sensitive input parameters the cumulative injected co2 in 20 years seqco2inj averaged over 1000 models is 6 7 mt among which 0 8 mt migrates into the fault zone seqco2flt leaving 5 9 mt stored in the reservoir averaged 2 31 of total injected co2 escapes from the fault zone to the atmosphere under constant bhp at the injection well the injected amount is dominated by reservoir permeability permstor with sti as high as 0 95 the reservoir thickness thickstor much less sensitive than its permeability is ranked as the 2nd most important parameter the rs of seqco2inj shows the injected co2 increase positively with both reservoir permeability and thickness reaching its highest value at the most permeable and thickest reservoir although the input parameters are uniformly sampled the distribution of seqco2inj is strongly right skewed left leaning according to its cdf curve the probability of the injected co2 5 and 10 mt reach 50 and 80 respectively which is also reflected by corresponding area in the 2d rs fig 7a fig 7b shows the fault zone co2 mass is controlled by and positively correlated to fault permeability sti 0 929 it also increases with the reservoir permeability because of the increase of total injected co2 but their proportion will decrease because more co2 will be stored in the reservoir moreover the increase rate is higher in upper region of permstor 14 2 log m2 than in the lower region according to the rs seqco2leak is mainly controlled by permeability of reservoir sti 0 623 and fault sti 0 466 and slightly affected by fault depth sti 0 127 fig 7c obviously the higher the ratio of the fault reservoir permeability the larger the surface leakage the influence of fault length on the leakage however is somewhat complicated the migration of co2 from the fault bottom to top is controlled not only by darcy s law but also by buoyancy force generated by co2 density difference according to darcy s law co2 flow is positively related to pressure gradient and fault permeability but negatively related to the travel length i e fault depth nevertheless the rs associated with permflt and depthstor shows sepco2leak increase with the fault depth within the major parameter ranges expect for the right bottom corner this might be explained by so called thermosiphon a driving force generated by the substantial co2 density changes with pressures along the fault pathway for the fault with high permeability 15 log m2 and short length 1 5 km darcy force dominates the upward co2 flow along the fault against thermosiphon force according to rs against permstor and depthstor where permflt is set as 15 5 seqco2leak increases with the fault depth in the major area suggesting thermosiphon effect dominates the co2 flow along the fault a comprehensive evaluation of thermosiphon effect for co2 under a variety of reservoir depths and geothermal gradients are available by adams et al 2014 the areas of rss where the values 5 are nullified to show not only a clearer lower leakage distribution but also the reservoir property parameters ranges that should be avoided although some studies suggest up to 2 is acceptable pacala 2003 van der zwaan and gerlagh 2009 the most recognized maximum leakage rate is 1 for co2 geological sequestration kutz and elkamel 2010 shaffer 2010 according to the rs analysis only a combination of higher storage reservoir permeability and lower fault permeability can meet this requirement of 1 leakage 3 1 2 analysis of brine leakage during sequestration during co2 sequestration brine in deep reservoir is primarily driven to right side far field of the storage reservoir and a small portion could be driven into the fault zone by the injected co2 pushed upward and leaked to shallow aquifer the probability distribution of seqbrineflt and the three pairwise rss against the three sensitive input parameters sti 0 1 ranked in sequence as permflt facbndvol and permstor are presented in fig 8 a it is seen that more brine mass will move into the fault as its permeability becomes higher facbndvol sampled between 1 and 1000 is used to magnify the cell volumes on front and back boundary planes which significantly affects pressure propagation and the brine transport to the front and back sides if facbndvol is larger more brine will migrate towards both sides of the reservoir instead of the low permeable fault zone which is the fact in major areas of the two associated rss whereas the maximum seqbrineflt is corresponding to the facbndvol s value of 50 or so instead of the minimum value of 1 one likely explanation is that the front back boundary cells in fault are also magnified by facbndvol and in a range of 1 and 50 it might help to release pressure in the bottom fault zone and induce more brine from the reservoir zone it is interesting that the maximum and minimum seqbrineflt correspond to the highest and lowest permflt respectively but both occur at the highest permstor in other words seqbrineflt changes more substantially with permflt when permstor becomes higher on the one hand higher reservoir permeability allows more co2 injected into the reservoir under fixed injector overpressure and drive more brine into the fault with high permeability but on the other hand it may induce more brine in the fault zone with low permeability into reservoir leading to less net brine into the fault according to the pdf and cdf of seqbrinetop fig 8b 90 of its values is 0 1 mt suggesting that few brine could reach the fault top and in some condition water flow back into the fault from the overlain aquifer instead negative value rs further reveals that the bottom brine can hardly reach the fault top in low permeable faults in high permeable faults log k 15 7 the largest amount of brine leaked out of the fault top happens for short faults and a small amount of water could flow reversely from overburden into the long faults depthstor 2 5 km brine density is far less sensitive to pressure and temperature changes than co2 and thermosiphon effect is negligible the bottom top pressure gradient is not sufficient to support brine s upward migration in long faults as a result the risk of brine leakage to the shallow aquifer is much lower than that of co2 and is negligible for deeper reservoir sequestrations particularly 3 2 well space and production rate for co2 circulation well space and production rate are critically important for a co2 geothermal system operation as they directly determine co2 sweeping area and thermal production and depletion as discussed in section 2 the location of the injection well is fixed for all the models hence well space for each circulation model is derived from the location of production well which is determined by co2 saturation in the 20th year of sequestration using the method illustrated in fig 4 the well space is averaged as 567 m and ranges between 150 and 1500 m the increment of well space is 50 m i e the grid cell size in dimension resulting in a stepwise cdf curve as shown in fig 9 a it is strongly sensitive to reservoir permeability sti 0 989 and slightly affected by reservoir depth sti 0 063 it makes sense since co2 saturation in reservoir is positively correlated to injected co2 which in turn is correlated with reservoir permeability fig 7a cirprodrate is a product of rcir2seq 1 0 2 0 and instantaneous co2 injection rate at the time of 20th year of sequestration varying from 2 84 to 70 76 with a mean of 17 75 kg s co2 injection rate is quite steady after 20 years of sequestration fig 6 under constant bhp and primarily determined by reservoir permeability fig 7a consequently the production rate for co2 circulation is mainly determined by reservoir permeability and the multiplier rcir2seq as shown in the rs fig 9b 3 3 mass budget during co2 circulation following 20 years of co2 sequestration while the 10 mpa overpressure remains in the 1 km long horizontal injection well hot fluid extraction starts from a parallel 1 km horizontal production well the production well location and extraction rate are specified based on co2 saturation and injection rate at the end of sequestration following the aforementioned method under this sink source configuration geothermal energy is extracted to the ground surface through co2 circulation the time series of co2 mass flux for the base case indicates that the co2 injection rate is increased under the constant fluid production though net injection rate and stored rate are reduced in circulation from the sequestration stage fig 6 co2 flux into the fault zone is relatively stable from sequestration to circulation a small portion of brine is also produced along with co2 during circulation in the following subsections five response variables on co2 and brine mass distribution are analyzed under a variety of reservoir conditions although circulation models are simulated to 50 years cumulative fluid masses are calculated after 20 years of co2 circulation in order to compare with those after the same length of co2 sequestration unlike sequestration most of the co2 injected during circulation is produced and the difference co2 injected co2 produced is defined as the response variable circo2net surface co2 leakage cumulated in total 40 years of consecutive sequestration and circulation is termed totco2leak the other response variables stand for the same meanings as those in sequestration stage 3 3 1 analysis of co2 net injection and leakage as shown in fig 10 an average 3 146 mt of co2 is net injected into the reservoir during the first 20 years of circulation from which 1 169 mt flows into the fault zone the average surface leakage in the 40 years of sequestration and circulation is 2 42 the mean circo2net is less than half of seqco2inj since the major portion of injected co2 is produced moreover the minimum circo2net is negative indicating that the produced co2 mass could be more than the injected under some conditions the net injected co2 is sensitive sti 0 1 to 4 input parameters yielding 6 pairwise 2d rss in fig 10a rcir2seq sti 0 489 is the most sensitive parameter for circo2net followed by permstor sti 0 474 circo2net decreases with the increase of rcir2seq and more significantly when permstor is higher the minimum negative value and maximum circo2net corresponds to the largest and smallest rcir2seq respectively at the highest permstor as discussed in the sequestration stage higher permstor leads to larger injection rate and the derived production rate as a product of the two parameters changes more significantly with rcir2seq as the dominant parameter when rcir2seq is small 1 3 circo2net increases monotonically with permstor when it is bigger than 1 3 however circo2net increases first and then decreases with permstor as shown in the rs the other two rss related to permstor sliced at the middle point of rcir2seq 1 5 show that circo2net peaks around 14 of permstor this finding indicates that depending on the objective function an optimal rcir2seq and permstor and the associated production rate exist under a specific set of reservoir conditions circo2net is slightly sensitive to and positively related to thickstor sti 0 168 and permflt sti 0 124 thicker reservoir or larger fault permeability may allow more co2 to be injected into the reservoir or leaked to the fault under the constant production rate yielding larger co2 net injected particularly permflt becomes more sensitive when it is greater than 15 7 as indicated in the three associated rss similar to seqco2flt circo2flt is strongly sensitive to and increases with permflt sti 0 967 the mean of circo2flt 1 169 mt is more than that of seqco2flt 0 821 mt due to the fluid extraction more co2 is injected to maintain the specified overpressure of the injection well causing more co2 transported to the nearby fault zone compared to seqco2flt facbndvol sti 0 073 switches the sensitivity rank with permstor sti 0 061 as the 2nd sensitive parameter for circo2flt and seems positively correlated only when it is 200 fig 10b higher values of facbndvol and permstor may both speed up the injection pressure release and induce more co2 injected and leaked to the fault zone compared to seqco2leak mean totco2leak is slightly increased 2 42 vs 2 31 and the maximum is doubled 28 25 vs 13 95 whereas the probability of 1 viable leakage increases to 50 from 30 as indicated by their cdfs fig 7c and 10c the rss further suggest that with low permeable and shallow storage reservoir and high permeable fault zone a much higher leakage could happen in the circulation than in the sequestration stage under most reservoir conditions however the leakage decreases during the circulation stage as indicated by its pdf and cdf which is also demonstrated by leakage history of base case fig 6 the fault properties including permeability sti 0 915 and depth sti 0 261 dominates the leakage in circulation while reservoir permeability is the most sensitive parameter sti 0 623 in sequestration totco2leak increases with the fault depth in lower permflt region but decrease in higher values the minimum leakage occurs around the middle point of permflt this strongly non linear behavior of leakage with various combinations of fault and reservoir properties is caused by the relative strength of darcy force and thermosiphon effect during co2 migration in the vertical fault plane as mentioned above 3 3 2 analysis of brine leakage the mean amount of brine driven into the fault zone is only 1 3 of its counterpart 0 08 vs 0 239 mt in sequestration and around 5 of its values is negative due to the production of brine with co2 fig 11 a cirbrineflt is strongly sensitive to facbndvol sti 0 821 and moderately sensitive to permflt sti 0 433 and permstor sti 0 420 facbndvol plays a more important role in brine flow to the fault zone during circulation compared to sequestration at the lowest facbndvol negative cirbrineflt suggests that brine may flow from the fault zone to the storage reservoir maximal cirbrineflt occurs at facbndvol 300 and higher values of permflt and in specific diagonal regions of facbndvol permstor brine flow inward and outward of the fault top boundary however is intensified during circulation compared to sequestration fig 11b the mean value of cirbrinetop is double that of seqbrinetop the probability and amount of brine inflow negative cirbrinetop is also increased the amount and direction of brine flow is mainly controlled by fault permeability according to the rs brine flow outwards in high values of permflt and inwards in its middle values in low fault permeability no brine flow can cross the top boundary fault depth affects the brine flow slightly higher depth leads to smaller outflow and larger inflow in high and middle values of permflt respectively the highest possibility for brine to enter overlaid shallow aquifer is in a short and permeable fault as fault permeability is usually heterogeneous and significantly uncertain choosing deeper reservoir may reduce the risk of brine contamination certainly and effectively 3 4 performance of geothermal production geothermal reservoir conditions and performance are evaluated in this section seven response variables on pressure and temperature decline co2 cut among produced fluids thermal production and lifespan are assessed using their probability distribution and rss below 3 4 1 1 pressure and temperature decline and thermal production for the partial fault compartmentalized reservoirs discussed in our study both overpressure and underpressure need to be carefully controlled to avoid possible fault re activation during co2 circulation pressure dropdown at the production well bottom happens mainly in the first 1 2 years when production rate increases from zero to the specified constant the mean and maximal underpressure cirdp pwell in 30 years of circulation are 4 59 and 10 41 mpa respectively corresponding appropriately to the fixed 10 mpa overpressure at the injection well co2 is hence circulated under pressure differences between injection and production wells the sensitive parameters for cirdp pwell are rcir2seq permflt permstor and facbndvol in sequence the six pairwise rss fig 12 a show cirdp pwell is positively correlated to all four parameters the larger rcir2seq yields higher production rate and consequentially higher underpressure the higher permflt permstor or facbndvol is in favor of co2 circulation and hence leads to high underpressure temperature near the production well unlike pressure declines more gradually with the continuous fluid extraction fig 6 the mean and maximal temperature decline in 30 years is 15 and 50 c respectively sensitive parameters for cirdt pwell are ranked in order as depthstor rcir2seq permstor and permflt and six pairwise rss are shown in fig 12b permflt is influential only at its high values 15 7 where a considerable amount of leaked to fault co2 induces more cold co2 injection into the reservoir when permstor increase from 14 6 to 14 4 the increase of circulation rate yields more temperature drops once it is larger than 14 4 the consequential longer well space dominates the influence on temperature decline at production well fig 9a which is reduced with the permstor these combined effects of production rate and well spaces lead to the peak temperature dropdown at 14 4 of permstor similar patterns can be found in permflt and permstor related rss of the associated circo2net fig 10a cirdt pwell increases monotonically with rcir2seq as the multiplier for production rate as the most sensitive parameter it is a little complicated to assess the influence of depthstor on cirdt pwell although the initial reservoir temperature increases linearly with depthstor the decline of temperature at the production well depends primarily on co2 circulation rate and well space hence the reduction of cirdt pwell with the increase of depthstor is mainly because of the increase in well space as revealed by fig 9a the mean produced heat energy in 30 years of operation is 6 7 1015 joules yielding 7 mw of converted thermal capacity thermal production is determined primarily by produced co2 and its temperature the rs suggests that highly permeable and thick reservoirs have higher potential thermal energy capacity fig 12c 3 4 2 2 co2 cut in the produced fluid the mass fraction of co2 to total fluid co2 brine produced namely co2 cut is another important performance indicator of the co2 geothermal system to guarantee appropriate running of co2 turbines co2 cut should be at least 0 94 welch and boyle 2009 it is also argued that it is acceptable for co2 cut to be slightly lower than 0 94 occasionally during co2 circulation garapati et al 2015 fig 12d and 12e presents probability distribution and rss for average and minimal co2 cut in 30 years of circulation respectively the mean values for ciraveco2cut and cirminco2cut are 0 973 and 0 956 respectively both above 0 94 the probability for ciraveco2cut and cirminco2cut below 0 94 is about 5 and 10 according to their cdfs both response variables are sensitive to permstor depthstor and rcir2seq ranked in sequence the rss associated with permstor and depthstor are very similar to those of cirdt pwell suggesting production rate and well space are key control variables affecting co2 cut as discussed in our methodology production rate and well space are carefully specified according to co2 plume and injection rate in the 20th year of sequestration which are determined by reservoir permeability depth and the multiplier rcir2seq high permeable and deep reservoirs along with large rcir2seq could cause co2 cut less than the required 0 94 as shown by white nullified area of rss 3 4 3 temperature and lifespan of geothermal reservoirs initial reservoir temperatures depend on reservoir depth and geothermal gradient after consecutive 20 years of sequestration and 30 years of circulation the two reservoir property parameters namely depthstor sti 0 864 and gradtemp sti 0 089 are still the top two sensitive parameters for cirt pwell fig 12f according to its cdf the probability of cirt pwell being lower than 75 c in the 30th year of circulation is about 30 the white area in the response gives the corresponding ranges of depthstor and gradtemp which should be avoided in choosing feasible geothermal reservoirs cirlifespan is defined as the years of circulation until cirt pwell is below 75 c although system performance is evaluated for 30 years of circulation which is the typical lifespan for a geothermal field nearly half of lifespans are longer than 50 years as shown by the pdf and cdf of cirlifespan fig 12g cirlifespan is controlled by reservoir depth sti 0 902 and slightly affected by the production rate multiplier rcir2seq sti 0 08 suggesting deeper geothermal reservoirs with higher temperatures always benefit reservoir longevity the minimal lifespan considered economically feasible for a co2 geothermal reservoir operation is assumed 15 years as indicated by the rs only a tiny area corresponding to highest rcir2seq and lowest depthstor represents values of cirlifespan 15 years in general lifespan is longer than 40 years for reservoirs deeper than 2 km 3 4 4 analysis of overall sensitivity of input parameters probability distribution of each response variable along with rss corresponding to the top two sensitive input parameters sti might be 0 1 or those with sti 0 1 parameter may be over 2 are analyzed above in this sub section overall sensitivity of each input parameter is analyzed column by column in table 4 in order to reveal their relative importance in the reservoir system the mean sti and the corresponding rank of each input parameter is summarized in the last two rows of table 4 as the no 1 sensitive parameter reservoir permeability strongly affects 7 response variables sti 0 5 high permeable reservoir is in favor of reservoir performance by yielding higher co2 injectivity fewer co2 leakage higher circulation rate larger injection production well space and more thermal production although the risk of co2 cut below required 94 is relatively high it can be overcome by choosing appropriate reservoir depth and production rate multiplier the fault permeability mainly controls the co2 and brine mass distribution to the fault zone subsequent upward migration and risk of surface leakage high permeable fault will substantially increase the risk of fluid leakage to the fault zone co2 leakage to atmosphere and brine contamination of shallow aquifers reservoir depth is ranked as the 3rd important parameter and can be easily determined in contrast to spatially heterogeneous permeability of the reservoir and fault zone deeper reservoirs can significantly reduce brine contamination of shallow aquifer yield high reservoir temperature and longer lifespan the production rate multiplier rcir2seq helps to adjust production rate based on the injection rate of sequestration and is influential to net injected co2 and the pressure dropdown around production well it should be carefully chosen to avoid extremely high underpressure which could cause reactivation of the faults bounding the reservoir the sealing performance of front back lateral faults facbndvol substantially affects brine mass transport to the fault zone generally a closed lateral boundary will drive more brine into the fault the reservoir thickness only slightly affects co2 injectivity and the resultant thermal production the vertical geothermal gradient which partially determines initial reservoir temperature could influence temperature history and lifespan to some degree dip angle is found insensitive to all the 19 response variables with mean sti 0 01 4 summary and conclusions one thousand numerical nuft models are developed to simulate consecutive co2 sequestration and circulation under a suite of reservoir conditions which cover possible hydro geothermal properties of typical thin layered and fault compartmentalized reservoirs in the north oman region nineteen response variables are designed as indicators of co2 and brine mass distribution and leakage and performance of geothermal reservoirs rss of these 19 variables are developed using simulated results from 1000 models as the training dataset global sensitivity indices of the 19 response variables to the eight input parameters are computed efficiently using the rss the probability distributions pdf and cdf of response variables sensitivity indices and rss are then used to comprehensively evaluate performance of co2 sequestration and geothermal production via co2 circulation in typical hydro geothermal reservoirs in north oman the main findings are concluded below under fixed overpressure at injection well reservoir permeability is the most dominant parameter to the system controlling co2 injectivity and hence affects more or less the subsequent mass distribution in the reservoir fault system well placement and circulation rate and thermal productions the mean co2 mass net injected in typical reservoirs in north oman is 0 335 and 0 157 mt year during sequestration and circulation stages respectively the mean thermal energy production capacity of 1000 simulations is 7 mw and it could reach 27 mw for the 40 m thick reservoir with permeability of 20 md the fault permeability controls mass leaked to the fault and subsequent co2 leakage rate to the atmosphere and brine contamination to the shallow aquifers large reservoir depth may eliminate the risk of brine contamination of shallow aquifers but might not effectively reduce co2 surface leakage because of thermosiphon effect on co2 migration in the vertical fault plane the mean co2 leakage to atmosphere is 2 31 and 2 42 of the net injected co2 during the two stages but up to 30 and 50 operations in the two stages can meet the leakage requirement of 1 combination of low fault permeability and high reservoir permeability can effectively control the co2 leakage rate in the acceptable level in general choosing deeper reservoir is favorable to longevity of geothermal reservoir given higher initial reservoir temperatures the mean lifespan of the 1000 geothermal reservoirs is 42 4 years and for half of them it is longer than 50 years for any geothermal reservoirs deeper than 2 km their lifespans are longer than 40 years reservoir thickness ranging 20 40 m and geothermal gradient between 30 and 40 c km are not the primary factors to consider and reservoir dip could be completely ignored during reservoir site selections the sealing property of lateral faults facbndvol mainly affects brine flux between storage reservoir and fault zone which is not the major concern since the fault zone is initially saturated with brine too instead the brine reaching the fault top poses the risk of contamination of shallow water resources and should be carefully evaluated as long as the reservoir depth is large enough the sealing property of lateral faults is negligible to the system the multiplier rcir2seq is very useful to adjust circulation rate to avoid extreme underpressure which could cause faults reactivation while overpressure on injection well is fixed at 10 mpa the resultant maximal and mean underpressure is only 10 41 and 4 59 mpa among all the 1000 operation scenarios thanks to the excellently designed method specifying circulation rates the proposed methods to determine production well placement according to co2 saturation and circulation rate according to co2 sequestration rate can guarantee 95 probability for averaged co2 cut in produced fluid in 30 years mixture of co2 and brine greater than required 0 94 the combination of highest reservoir permeability depth and circulation rate multiplier rcir2seq which could lead to co2 cut lower than 0 94 should be avoided rs analysis indicates that the performance of the system is not monotonically correlated to single or combination of these input parameters due to visualizing limitation only 2 input sliced rss are presented by setting other parameters in the middle point of their ranges complete exploration of full dimensional rss is highly suggested by numerical methods in addition to the visualization numerical optimization using rss of these response variables can avoid intensive computation difficulty during optimization using physical models and provide an efficient alternative to find optimal geothermal reservoir and operational scheme credit authorship

4577,gravelly soils characterized by a mixture of fine soil matrix and coarse gravel aggregates are widely distributed in high mountain and cold plateau areas these soils are frequently subjected to freeze thaw f t actions and the hydraulic conductivity is crucial for analyzing hydrological processes and geological hazards this study aims to investigate hydraulic conductivity in gravelly soils containing various contents of gravel particle fraction under cyclic freezing thawing the results show that the hydraulic conductivity in gravelly soils significantly depends on gravel content confining stress number of f t cycles and initial water content the presence of gravel particles modifies the porosity and pore connectivity tortuosity in soil matrix as well as affects the soil matrix gravel interfaces with increasing gravel content the overall gravel assembly transforms from a state of floating in the soil matrix to forming a contacted skeleton structure thus the extensively developed loose soil gravel interfaces due to f t cycles result in a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity increasing confining pressure significantly reduces the soil matrix void ratio and thereby decreases the hydraulic conductivity while no longer recovers the degradation in soil gravel interfaces induced by f t cycles different initial compacted water content provides different compacted soil structures divided by the optimum water content w opt a prominent increase of hydraulic conductivity after f t cycles occurs in samples compacted at the dry side of w opt while a slighter increase at its wet side keywords freeze thaw cycles gravelly soils hydraulic conductivity gravel particle content initial water content 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity or the coefficient of permeability is one of the most important hydraulic properties of soil in many disciplines for example in hydrology the terrestrial water cycle linking overland flow and groundwater recharge is mainly controlled by hydraulic conductivity jiang et al 2009 m√ºgler et al 2019 woolhiser et al 1996 in geotechnical and geological engineering landslides trigger slope instability and other geological hazards associated with natural soils is closely related to the change in the hydraulic characteristics vieira and fernandes 2004 shimizu and ono 2016 lee and ho 2009 fox et al 2007 prior research has revealed that hydraulic conductivity is not only controlled by soil types but also affected by external geomorphic environmental factors such as soil desiccation cracking cheng et al 2021 he et al 2015 rainfall infiltration bordoni et al 2015 loritz et al 2018 and dry wet cycles mohanty et al 2015 de camillis et al 2017 in cold regions variations in seasonal soil freeze thaw states are important indicators of climate change and influence the ground temperature hydrological processes surface energy and moisture balance peng et al 2016 thereby hydraulic conductivity in soils exposed to f t cycles has been paid great attention however the reported results are mainly limited to homogeneous soils with no polyphase constituents such as expansive clay loess dispersive soils saline soils and volcanic coarse grained soils han et al 2020 ishikawa et al 2016 lu et al 2019 nalbantoglu and tuncer 2001 othman and benson 1993 xu et al 2021 however few attempts have hitherto been made to explore the freeze thaw action on hydraulic conductivity of heterogeneous or mixed soils such as gravelly soils in mountain and cold plateau areas gravelly soil a mixed soil consisting of fine soils and gravel particles is widely distributed and susceptible to frequent f t cycles due to high altitude and seasonal variations nyberg 1993 mateos et al 2012 qu et al 2019 besides it also exists extensively in glacial tills mudflows landslides and colluvial soil deposits dong et al 2017 2019 luo et al 2019 it is a typical heterogeneous porous material with a multiscale structure and its hydraulic conductivity is challenging to quantify gao et al 2019 lu et al 2021 the hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soils is of vital importance to hydrological processes and geological hazards in mountain areas so that many scholars have made sustained attempts on it for instance the effect of gravel content on the hydraulic conductivity of soil gravel mixtures was investigated by shelley and daniel 1993 they found that when gravel content was greater than 50 60 the soil does not fill the voids between gravel particles and results in a high hydraulic conductivity the concept of heterogeneous density field was further used by shafiee 2008 to demonstrate the impact of gravel size and fabric anisotropy on the permeability in compacted gravelly soil mixtures besides the clay void ratio and the skeletal void ratio were used to evaluate the effect of soil fabric on the hydraulic behaviour of mixed soils shaker and elkady 2015 regarding the effect of soil matrix it was found by wang et al 2016 that for a matrix composition of clay and mucky soil the flow law follows the non darcy law however it follows darcy s law for the soil mixture with a fine sand matrix however the previous reported results have been mainly focused on the performance under normal temperature conditions considering the climate change and extreme weather events the phenomenon of freezing thawing has become quite frequent and its detrimental effects on earthworks have gradually aroused public concerns lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a b especially in cold alpine regions not only the natural hazards but also the construction of large water conservancy projects are enduring the degradation effects induced by the freezing thawing variation of gravelly soils li et al 2020 liu et al 2020 ren et al 2020 however until now no extensive attempts have been made to explore the hydraulic performance of gravelly soils subjected to freeze thaw f t actions revealing the effects of f t cycles and gravel particle fraction on the hydraulic conductivity is central to understanding the hydraulic behaviour of gravelly soils this contribution explores comprehensively the hydraulic conductivity performance of gravelly soils subjected to freeze thaw cycles firstly clayey soils mixed with different contents of gravel particles were compacted into cylindrical samples mesoscopic structural properties of compacted samples derived from ct scans were then introduced to estimate the clayey soil gravel particles distribution further a total of 0 1 2 3 5 7 and 10 f t cycling processes were simulated subsequently a series of triaxial permeability tests were conducted based on the experimental results effects of confining pressure gravel content number of f t cycles and initial compacted water content on the hydraulic conductivity were analyzed the results of this study are expected to provide some useful insights into understanding of basic hydrological processes and geological hazards in cold mountainous areas 2 materials and method 2 1 soil properties the tested materials were taken from a site located in the alpine cold region of southwest china where low temperatures can reach 16 c the index properties of the prepared soil are presented in table 1 the atterberg limits were found to be a liquid limit of 28 0 and a plastic limit of 15 5 based on the plasticity properties the soil was classified as low plasticity clay cl in the unified soil classification system uscs the tested gravel is a subangular slate particle with a size ranging from 2 mm to 20 mm and its basic properties are listed in table 1 for the tested gravelly soil samples gravel content is designed by weight as 0 10 30 and 50 and the particle size distribution is presented in fig 1 2 2 preparation of mixed gravelly soil samples the fine clayey soils were air dried crushed using a wooden hammer and passed through a 2 mm sieve then the water predetermined by weight was evenly sprayed on the air dried soil powders after that the wet soil was put into sealed plastic bags for at least 24 h to ensure the moisture equalization distributed as homogeneously as possible meanwhile the dry gravel particles were also treated to a saturated surface dry ssd state with the water absorption around 0 54 see table 1 subsequently the prepared wet clayey soils and gravels were thoroughly mixed which is defined as wet mixing method lu et al 2021 it is apparent from fig 2 a that the prepared mixtures by wet mixing method are considerably uniform and the soil aggregates do not form easily it was also found to be effective in the wet mixing of sand clay mixtures where sand grains were dispersed in the mixture uniformly and segregation was prevented monkul and ozden 2007 to obtain the maximum dry density œÅ dmax and optimum moisture content w opt of the tested gravelly soils a series of modified proctor tests as per astm d1557 astm 2008 were conducted it is found that the compaction curves all presented a single peak shape which is similar to those of pure clayey soils fig 2 b therefore the mixing of gravel particles into clayey soils does not change the overall shape of compaction curves the œÅ dmax and corresponding w opt for each compaction curve of gravelly soils can be thus determined it is apparent that with the increase of gravel content the œÅ dmax increased but the w opt presented a continuous decrease to further conducted the permeability tests a series of cylindrical samples were compacted layer by layer inside a cylindrical stainless steel mold by using a stratified sample preparation device modified by the authors lu et al 2019 2020 it is noted that the interface between layers was scarified before compaction of the subsequent layer to increase the inter layer roughness table 2 illustrates the test programme involving all the samples under different testing conditions among them series of no 1 no 5 and no 6 no 9 are designed to investigate the effect of gravel content under 0 and 1 f t cycle respectively it is noted that all samples were compacted at their corresponding optimum water contents series of no 3 no 8 and no 10 no 14 are compared to reveal the effect of f t cycling number series of no 8 and no 15 no 18 aim to consider the effect of initial compacted water content all above cases are applied under the confining pressure of 0 600 kpa table 3 2 3 ct based analysis of meso structure in soil samples for a profound understanding of the hydraulic conductivity behaviour of gravelly soils with different gravel contents it is necessary to acquire a meso structural insight into the distribution of gravel particles inside the soil matrix ct images are often taken to explore the soil fabric of the specimens in meso scales which is around 10 to 1000 Œºm scales between the smallest clay particle sizes and field structures luxmoore 1981 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 therefore a planar visual section of the tested samples for several typical gravel contents c g 10 30 and 50 is examined by a computed tomography ct scan by application of image analysis ct imagery data can be filtered and processed for obtaining parameters such as transverse sectional macro porosity and macro pore size gao et al 2019 fan et al 2021 herein fig 3 gives a quantitative analysis of the two dimensional pore size distribution of the tested samples based on ct images from the perspective of meso scales the relationship between incremental porosity and equivalent pore size illustrates that the meso scale pores exhibit clear unimodal size distributions this is consistent with the similar observations in an analysis of two dimensional pore size distribution performed on an eluvial colluvial gravelly soil gao et al 2019 however it should be noted that the captured unimodal pattern might not be the genuine characteristics due to the limitation of ct technique the samples with gravel contents of 10 30 and 50 have visual meso pore size in ranges of 0 mm 2 5 mm 0 mm 3 5 mm and 0 mm 5 5 mm respectively besides the corresponding peak value occurs at 1 0 mm 1 0 mm and 2 5 mm respectively the result indicates that increasing gravel content will significantly increase and enlarge the meso pores inside the compacted gravelly soil samples thus leading to the expected increase of soil matrix gravel interfaces this might be due to the fact that under high gravel contents the soil matrix will be totally separated by the coarse gravel particle skeleton and cannot be sufficiently compacted this gravel content dependent meso structures in compacted soil samples will significantly affect the hydraulic conductivity upon different factors such as confining pressure and f t cycles described later 2 4 laboratory freezing thawing tests the experimental freezing thawing test was performed in the cryogenic laboratory at hohai university as shown in fig 4 the soil samples were exposed to a closed three dimensional freezing condition othman and benson 1993 dalla santa et al 2019 according to astm d560 2003 and the authors previous studies lu et al 2019 2020 to effectively prevent the water loss induced by sublimation and evaporation during repeated f t cycling process the tested samples were pre sealed with plastic films a temperature of 20 c was set during freezing period and the thawing period was set as room temperature about 20 c during one f t cycle the sample was firstly frozen for 24 h and subsequently thawed for 24 h one f t cycle involves 48 h in this experimental work a total of 0 1 2 3 5 7 and 10 f t cycling processes were scheduled 2 5 hydraulic conductivity tests in triaxial conditions the hydraulic conductivity is usually measured following either the constant head or falling head method the former is suitable for coarse grained soils conversely the latter is recommended for fine grained soils and is independent of the hydraulic gradient i thus making effective the calculation of k based on darcy s law assaad and harb 2013 with respect to gravelly soils owing to the presence of oversized gravel particles size 2 mm 20 mm special sampling tools and large scale testing apparatus are required to measure the hydraulic conductivity in this study a flexible wall permeameter is utilized to conduct the permeability tests it can avoid the side wall leakage which is commonly observed when using rigid wall permeameter samingan et al 2003 besides the void ratio variation due to the application of confining pressure can be indirectly calculated from the real time deformations measured in the volume change tube at the end of consolidation it is noted that the samples were firstly saturated with a skempton s pore pressure coefficient b b Œ¥u Œ¥œÉ 3 measured to be higher than 0 95 zhang et al 2014 sadeghi and alipanahi 2020 afterward the tested sample was isotropically consolidated under confining pressures of 0 600 kpa following consolidation the water was flushed into the sample from a desired hydraulic gradient by seepage pressure device therefore the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks can be calculated based on the variations of water heads and the corresponding time intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of confining pressure fig 5 a and b show the change of hydraulic conductivity and the corresponding void ratio with the applied external confining pressures c g 30 it is observed that hydraulic conductivity presents a gradual decrease with the increase of confining stress when the confining pressure increases from 0 kpa to 200 kpa the void ratio decreases significantly from 0 55 to about 0 40 and the corresponding hydraulic conductivity also decreases sharply this is mainly because the sample is rapidly compressed under confining pressure and the soil voids become smaller and smaller with the confining pressure exceeding 400 kpa the void ratio decreases to a stable value around 0 33 0 36 and hydraulic conductivity basically maintains at 10 6 10 7 cm s the decrease in hydraulic conductivity is essentially attributed to the variation in the void volume of soil mass the soil voids will be gradually compressed and become smaller as the increasing confining pressure is applied on the sample surface such process tends to slow down due to the fact that soil mixture is a kind of compression induced hardening material and will become difficult to be compressed owing to the increase of stiffness alonso et al 2013 tarantino and de col 2008 this tendency is also reflected in the results that the degree of reduction in permeability goes down with increasing confining pressure it is also found that the sustained f t action will significantly increase the hydraulic conductivity despite the slight increase in global void ratio this might be because the gravelly soil s permeability is not only controlled by the global void ratio but also the interfaces of the combined soil gravel mixtures discussed latter fig 5 c further gives the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and void ratio it highlights that the hydraulic conductivity increase with void ratio regardless of the confining pressures 3 2 effect of number of f t cycles fig 6 a shows the changes of hydraulic conductivity with the number of f t cycles under different confining pressures c g 30 it is observed that increasing number of f t cycles will gradually increase the hydraulic conductivity no matter what the confining pressure is considering repeated freeze thaw processes the increase of hydraulic conductivity adds up cycle after cycle however the most significant increase occurs at 1st 2nd f t cycle this is because the irreversible alteration of the soil s internal structure is mostly achieved the first time when it is subjected to the cyclic freezing thawing similar observations that the largest change in permeability occurs after the first cycle have also been discussed in other kinds of soils konrad 1989 othman benson 1993 han et al 2020 dalla santa et al 2020 therefore upon f t cycles the hydraulic conductivity increase is largest the first time the soil experiences f t action and the effects diminish cycle after cycle a progressive depletion of such f t induced effects occurs and after several cycles the soil usually achieves a new equilibrium structure dalla santa et al 2019 thus after 7 10 f t cycles the hydraulic conductivity of the tested gravelly soil samples also trends to a stable value this means that just a few or even only one f t cycles can affect the hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soils considerably with regard to the confining stress effect the load applied after the f t treatment will make the frost induced cracks and micro pores trend to be closed thereby causing the effect of f t cycles on hydraulic conductivity become less remarkable under higher confining pressures the evolution of the macroscopic permeability coefficient is essentially reflected in the change of global void ratio change of the corresponding void ratio upon f t cycles is also depicted in fig 6 b under low temperature the pore water in the sample freezes into pore ice thus leading to not only the voids volume augment but also the voids interconnection augment dalla santa et al 2019 when the ice becomes melted the expanded void will no longer recover to be closed as unfrozen state therefore the soil matrix voids will endure a gradual enlargement due to the continuous f t cycles in fig 6 c the hydraulic conductivity data are depicted in relation to the void ratio data underline that the hydraulic conductivity increase with void ratio regardless of the different equilibrium soil structure achieved in the samples owing to the freeze thaw processes this observation is consistent with an experimental phenomenon reported by dalla santa et al 2016 that after 5 7 thermal cycles a new condition of equilibrium characterized by a lower void ratio seems to be achieved since no further deformation could be imposed by thermal variations in this study the relations of saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and void ratio e can be well estimated by an exponential function as follows 1 k s Œ± exp Œ≤ e where Œ± and Œ≤ are fitting parameters e is void ratio 3 3 effect of gravel content fig 7 a shows the change of hydraulic conductivity with gravel content under non frozen sate n 0 it is observed that the hydraulic conductivity firstly decreases with increasing gravel content to a minimum value at c g 30 and then gradually increases sharply with further addition of gravel particles similar phenomenon is also found in a permeability test of compacted granule clay mixtures by shafiee 2008 this is mainly because the permeability of gravelly soils is attributed to the combined influence of soil matrix gravel particles and soil matrix gravel interfaces on one hand small amount addition of gravel particles will reduce the flow paths inside the compacted soil matrix thus leading to the decrease in hydraulic conductivity on the other hand the soil gravel interface becomes the weak zone to provide preferential flow paths thereby causing an increase in hydraulic conductivity therefore under the above two opposite actions the experimental results show a minimum hydraulic conductivity under 30 gravel content as aforementioned in the meso structural analysis in fig 3 for the section in gravel contents of 10 and 30 the gravel particles are suspended in the clayey soil matrix where no contacts can form between the gravel particles with increasing the gravel content up to 50 a large number of gravel particles cause a gradual contact between gravel particles and soil matrix comes to be gradually separated by gravel particles under this circumstance weakly bonded gravel soil interfaces will thereby adequately develop such interfaces are expected to be prominently affected by f t cycles as confirmed by the forthcoming experimental evidences and discussions previous results have confirmed that 1st f t cycle has the significant impact on the increase of hydraulic conductivity herein as further show in fig 7 b the comparison of hydraulic conductivity under non frozen n 0 and 1 f t cycle n 1 is made for the samples with gravel content of 0 10 30 and 50 it is found that the hydraulic conductivity for different gravel contents all presents a significant increase tendency after one f t cycle the higher the gravel content is the greater the increase amplitude becomes this could be attributed to the difference in structural characteristics of gravelly soils with lower or higher gravel particle contents for the cases of lower gravel contents c g 0 10 and 30 it is apparent that the f t induced increase in hydraulic conductivity exhibits significant under lower confining pressure while becomes less dominate under higher confining pressure take c g 0 as an example under œÉ 3 0 kpa and 600 kpa the hydraulic conductivity after one f t cycle increased by 64 9 and 1 1 respectively however for higher gravel content c g 50 the hydraulic conductivity after one f t cycle increased by 64 3 and 54 6 1 respectively under œÉ 3 0 kpa and 600 kpa this means for the samples with high gravel contents there still exits a remarkable freeze thaw induced increase in hydraulic conductivity even under higher confining pressure that is the increase of confining pressure cannot adequately compensate for the permeability increases upon f t cycles even if the clayey soil matrix void ratio will significantly be reduced under confining stress this is because the structural characteristics in samples of c g 50 are expected to contribute to a large number of soil gravel interfaces with weak bonding upon repeated f t cycles fig 3 besides considering the self healing capacity of soil matrix mainly depends on plasticity and w opt dalla santa et al 2020 in this study the soil plasticity index is 12 5 and w opt is 11 4 these values are quite small and the soil belongs to cl according to uscs classification it is expected that the self healing capacity of the tested fine soils is quite limited therefore it further provides evidence that the high confinement cannot repair the irreversible degradation in soil gravel interfaces despite that it can close the frost induced cracks and pores in the clayey soil matrix as much as possible 3 4 effect of initial compacted water content fig 8 shows the changes of hydraulic conductivity in terms of confining pressure for samples compacted at different initial water contents under non frozen and one f t cycle c g 30 it is observed that the hydraulic conductivity of the sample under non frozen state is very close to that of the sample with 4 water content after one f t cycle it indicates that the k s of the sample with w 4 is basically unaffected by freeze thaw actions this is because when the water content is very low soil particles have a strong adsorption effect against the around water films and this small amount of water basically exists as unfrozen state even under negative temperature jin et al 2020 lu et al 2019 besides even if such small amount of water is completely frozen it is still difficult for ice particles to expand the soil pores and has almost negligible frost induced degradation on soil structures thus a very low water content basically has no effect on the variation of permeability coefficient upon f t cycles with the further increase of the initial water content from 6 to 12 the cyclic freezing thawing will cause a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity a higher amount of water content is expected to have more remarkable sensitivity to f t cycles because of the more expansion induced by frost heave in wetter soils thereby the samples with higher water contents will have greater values of hydraulic conductivity after f t cycles it is also noted from fig 8 that with the increase of confining pressure the increase of hydraulic conductivity induced by f t actions will be gradually restrained for instance when confining pressure reaches 600 kpa the hydraulic conductivities of samples with different initial water contents tend to a very close value actually the aforementioned restraining effect on hydraulic conductivity by confining pressure depends on both the number of f t cycles and initial water content herein taking the samples with w 8 3 and 12 as an example the comparison of hydraulic conductivity under different f t cycles is given in fig 9 it is apparent that with the increase of confining pressure the two curves of hydraulic conductivity under different initial water content will gradually resynthesize the same curve the intersection point of the two curves appears earlier with the increase of freeze thaw cycles this indicates that the larger the number of f t cycles the lower confining pressure is needed to remove the initial water content induced difference in hydraulic conductivity this is because with the increase of f t cycles the soil structure is gradually weakened and the internal micro cracks continuously expand thus the pore structure of the soil becomes more fluffy thereby easy to be compacted even a small confining pressure is applied to further explore the effect of initial compacted water content on hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soils fig 10 gives the variations of hydraulic conductivity of samples with different compacted water contents upon f t cycles c g 30 when the initial water content gradually increased from 4 to 12 the hydraulic conductivity under different confining pressures all showed a gradual increase tendency a higher amount of water content is expected to have more remarkable sensitivity to f t cycles because of the more expansion induced by frost heave in wetter soils such effect will cause a greater hydraulic conductivity of compacted soils with higher water contents however the magnitude of increase in hydraulic conductivity may not depend on the water content itself under low confining pressure the increase amplitude is larger while under high confining pressure the increase amplitude becomes smaller in addition to confining pressure the increase amplitude could also affected by the compacted soil structures previous research has revealed that different compaction states in compacted soils may result in different soil microstructures and further affect the hydro mechanical behaviour delage et al 1996 romero and simms 2008 in terms of effects of initial compacted water content on soil microstructure a major consensus from previous studies is that an aggregate structure is well developed in the soil sample compacted on the dry side of the w opt for the wet sample a dispersed structure will form and clayey soil particles forming a matrix will envelop the larger grains and fill the inter granular voids alonso et al 2013 li et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 the soil aggregate structure on the dry side of w opt is more unstable than the dispersed structure compacted at wet side under the action of external forces the large pores inside double porosity structural soils are more likely to be compacted and are more susceptible to environmental factors such as dry wet and freeze thaw cycles delage et al 1996 alonso 2007 in the experimental results when the water content increases from 4 to 8 3 w opt the hydraulic conductivity increases significantly however when the water content increases from 8 3 to 12 the hydraulic conductivity increases more slightly this could be attributed to the difference in microstructures of soil matrix compacted in different initial water contents for the gravelly soil sample with 30 gravel content the corresponding compacted optimum water content is 8 3 therefore it is w 0 8 3 the critical initial water content that controls the increase amplitude transformation of the hydraulic conductivity with initial water content 3 5 conceptual permeability zones in compacted gravelly soils based on the above experimental results it can be concluded that the hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soils increases significantly after freeze thaw actions which is affected by the confining pressure gravel content number of f t cycles and initial compacted water content to synthetically understand the evolution mechanism of hydraulic conductivity in gravelly soils under f t cycles fig 11 gives the illustration of the conceptual model for permeability zone in gravelly soils it mainly involves three zones impervious gravel particle weakly permeable clayey soil matrix and strongly permeable gravel soil interface the main feature of each zone is outlined and discussed as follows 1 zone of impervious gravel particle due to the impermeability of coarse aggregate particles the addition of small number of gravel particles will extend the flow paths inside the clayey soil matrix the flow path bypasses the gravel particles thereby decreasing the hydraulic conductivity to some extent this zone is basically unaffected by f t cycles however the increase of gravel content in compacted gravelly soils will be expected to cause an irreversible enlargement in the interfaces between gravels and the surrounding compacted clayey soil matrix 2 zone of weakly permeable clayey soil matrix the permeability in this zone is highly controlled by the compacted void ratio of the clayey soil matrix this zone is significantly affected by f t cycles because the soil matrix is a frost sensitive material the internal enlarged voids due to cyclic freezing thawing will be easily compressed and tend to be closed when subjected to the external action of confining pressure 3 zone of strongly permeable gravel clayey soil interface the interface between clayey soil matrix and gravels is relatively bonded weakly so that a significant reduction of permeability usually occurs under high gravel content the permeability sharply increases because large number of inter particle voids exist inside the interface of soil matrix gravel particle skeleton this zone is also remarkably controlled by f t cycles and the frost induced degradation will not recover even under higher confining pressure 4 conclusion hydraulic conductivity in gravelly soils with varying gravel contents considering effect of freezing thawing cycles was investigated experimentally in this study samples with different gravel contents were obtained by a wet mixing and stratified compaction method ten freeze thaw cycles are applied the influence of confining pressure gravel content number of f t cycles and initial compacted water content on permeability behaviour was quantitatively analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 hydraulic conductivity in compacted gravelly soils was controlled by gravel particle soil matrix and the interface of soil matrix gravel upon f t cycles it increased significantly and also depended on the confining pressure gravel content number of f t cycles and initial compacted water content 2 increase of confining pressure compressed the soil mixtures and reduced the global void ratio thereby decreasing the hydraulic conductivity under higher confining pressure the void increase in clayey soil matrix induced by f t cycles gradually trended to become closed while the degradation of the soil matrix gravel interface would no longer recover due to the limited self healing capacity of the tested fine clayey soils 3 upon progressive f t cycles the hydraulic conductivity remarkably increased in particular at the 1st 2nd f t cycle such phenomenon dominated in the cases at lower confining pressure and higher initial water content 4 gravel particle fraction decided the meso structural distribution in gravelly soils under lower gravel content the gravel particles floated in the clay matrix higher gravel content caused a gravel skeleton structure and leaded to a widely distributed soil matrix gravel interfaces which was easily affected by f t cycles and resulted in a significantly increase in hydraulic conductivity 5 with the increase of initial compacted water content the compacted soil structure was expected to transform from an aggregate structure to a dispersed structure thus it was found there was a prominent increase of hydraulic conductivity after f t cycles in samples compacted at the dry side of optimum water content while a slighter increase at the wet side of optimum credit authorship contribution statement yang lu conceptualization methodology formal

4577,gravelly soils characterized by a mixture of fine soil matrix and coarse gravel aggregates are widely distributed in high mountain and cold plateau areas these soils are frequently subjected to freeze thaw f t actions and the hydraulic conductivity is crucial for analyzing hydrological processes and geological hazards this study aims to investigate hydraulic conductivity in gravelly soils containing various contents of gravel particle fraction under cyclic freezing thawing the results show that the hydraulic conductivity in gravelly soils significantly depends on gravel content confining stress number of f t cycles and initial water content the presence of gravel particles modifies the porosity and pore connectivity tortuosity in soil matrix as well as affects the soil matrix gravel interfaces with increasing gravel content the overall gravel assembly transforms from a state of floating in the soil matrix to forming a contacted skeleton structure thus the extensively developed loose soil gravel interfaces due to f t cycles result in a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity increasing confining pressure significantly reduces the soil matrix void ratio and thereby decreases the hydraulic conductivity while no longer recovers the degradation in soil gravel interfaces induced by f t cycles different initial compacted water content provides different compacted soil structures divided by the optimum water content w opt a prominent increase of hydraulic conductivity after f t cycles occurs in samples compacted at the dry side of w opt while a slighter increase at its wet side keywords freeze thaw cycles gravelly soils hydraulic conductivity gravel particle content initial water content 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity or the coefficient of permeability is one of the most important hydraulic properties of soil in many disciplines for example in hydrology the terrestrial water cycle linking overland flow and groundwater recharge is mainly controlled by hydraulic conductivity jiang et al 2009 m√ºgler et al 2019 woolhiser et al 1996 in geotechnical and geological engineering landslides trigger slope instability and other geological hazards associated with natural soils is closely related to the change in the hydraulic characteristics vieira and fernandes 2004 shimizu and ono 2016 lee and ho 2009 fox et al 2007 prior research has revealed that hydraulic conductivity is not only controlled by soil types but also affected by external geomorphic environmental factors such as soil desiccation cracking cheng et al 2021 he et al 2015 rainfall infiltration bordoni et al 2015 loritz et al 2018 and dry wet cycles mohanty et al 2015 de camillis et al 2017 in cold regions variations in seasonal soil freeze thaw states are important indicators of climate change and influence the ground temperature hydrological processes surface energy and moisture balance peng et al 2016 thereby hydraulic conductivity in soils exposed to f t cycles has been paid great attention however the reported results are mainly limited to homogeneous soils with no polyphase constituents such as expansive clay loess dispersive soils saline soils and volcanic coarse grained soils han et al 2020 ishikawa et al 2016 lu et al 2019 nalbantoglu and tuncer 2001 othman and benson 1993 xu et al 2021 however few attempts have hitherto been made to explore the freeze thaw action on hydraulic conductivity of heterogeneous or mixed soils such as gravelly soils in mountain and cold plateau areas gravelly soil a mixed soil consisting of fine soils and gravel particles is widely distributed and susceptible to frequent f t cycles due to high altitude and seasonal variations nyberg 1993 mateos et al 2012 qu et al 2019 besides it also exists extensively in glacial tills mudflows landslides and colluvial soil deposits dong et al 2017 2019 luo et al 2019 it is a typical heterogeneous porous material with a multiscale structure and its hydraulic conductivity is challenging to quantify gao et al 2019 lu et al 2021 the hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soils is of vital importance to hydrological processes and geological hazards in mountain areas so that many scholars have made sustained attempts on it for instance the effect of gravel content on the hydraulic conductivity of soil gravel mixtures was investigated by shelley and daniel 1993 they found that when gravel content was greater than 50 60 the soil does not fill the voids between gravel particles and results in a high hydraulic conductivity the concept of heterogeneous density field was further used by shafiee 2008 to demonstrate the impact of gravel size and fabric anisotropy on the permeability in compacted gravelly soil mixtures besides the clay void ratio and the skeletal void ratio were used to evaluate the effect of soil fabric on the hydraulic behaviour of mixed soils shaker and elkady 2015 regarding the effect of soil matrix it was found by wang et al 2016 that for a matrix composition of clay and mucky soil the flow law follows the non darcy law however it follows darcy s law for the soil mixture with a fine sand matrix however the previous reported results have been mainly focused on the performance under normal temperature conditions considering the climate change and extreme weather events the phenomenon of freezing thawing has become quite frequent and its detrimental effects on earthworks have gradually aroused public concerns lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a b especially in cold alpine regions not only the natural hazards but also the construction of large water conservancy projects are enduring the degradation effects induced by the freezing thawing variation of gravelly soils li et al 2020 liu et al 2020 ren et al 2020 however until now no extensive attempts have been made to explore the hydraulic performance of gravelly soils subjected to freeze thaw f t actions revealing the effects of f t cycles and gravel particle fraction on the hydraulic conductivity is central to understanding the hydraulic behaviour of gravelly soils this contribution explores comprehensively the hydraulic conductivity performance of gravelly soils subjected to freeze thaw cycles firstly clayey soils mixed with different contents of gravel particles were compacted into cylindrical samples mesoscopic structural properties of compacted samples derived from ct scans were then introduced to estimate the clayey soil gravel particles distribution further a total of 0 1 2 3 5 7 and 10 f t cycling processes were simulated subsequently a series of triaxial permeability tests were conducted based on the experimental results effects of confining pressure gravel content number of f t cycles and initial compacted water content on the hydraulic conductivity were analyzed the results of this study are expected to provide some useful insights into understanding of basic hydrological processes and geological hazards in cold mountainous areas 2 materials and method 2 1 soil properties the tested materials were taken from a site located in the alpine cold region of southwest china where low temperatures can reach 16 c the index properties of the prepared soil are presented in table 1 the atterberg limits were found to be a liquid limit of 28 0 and a plastic limit of 15 5 based on the plasticity properties the soil was classified as low plasticity clay cl in the unified soil classification system uscs the tested gravel is a subangular slate particle with a size ranging from 2 mm to 20 mm and its basic properties are listed in table 1 for the tested gravelly soil samples gravel content is designed by weight as 0 10 30 and 50 and the particle size distribution is presented in fig 1 2 2 preparation of mixed gravelly soil samples the fine clayey soils were air dried crushed using a wooden hammer and passed through a 2 mm sieve then the water predetermined by weight was evenly sprayed on the air dried soil powders after that the wet soil was put into sealed plastic bags for at least 24 h to ensure the moisture equalization distributed as homogeneously as possible meanwhile the dry gravel particles were also treated to a saturated surface dry ssd state with the water absorption around 0 54 see table 1 subsequently the prepared wet clayey soils and gravels were thoroughly mixed which is defined as wet mixing method lu et al 2021 it is apparent from fig 2 a that the prepared mixtures by wet mixing method are considerably uniform and the soil aggregates do not form easily it was also found to be effective in the wet mixing of sand clay mixtures where sand grains were dispersed in the mixture uniformly and segregation was prevented monkul and ozden 2007 to obtain the maximum dry density œÅ dmax and optimum moisture content w opt of the tested gravelly soils a series of modified proctor tests as per astm d1557 astm 2008 were conducted it is found that the compaction curves all presented a single peak shape which is similar to those of pure clayey soils fig 2 b therefore the mixing of gravel particles into clayey soils does not change the overall shape of compaction curves the œÅ dmax and corresponding w opt for each compaction curve of gravelly soils can be thus determined it is apparent that with the increase of gravel content the œÅ dmax increased but the w opt presented a continuous decrease to further conducted the permeability tests a series of cylindrical samples were compacted layer by layer inside a cylindrical stainless steel mold by using a stratified sample preparation device modified by the authors lu et al 2019 2020 it is noted that the interface between layers was scarified before compaction of the subsequent layer to increase the inter layer roughness table 2 illustrates the test programme involving all the samples under different testing conditions among them series of no 1 no 5 and no 6 no 9 are designed to investigate the effect of gravel content under 0 and 1 f t cycle respectively it is noted that all samples were compacted at their corresponding optimum water contents series of no 3 no 8 and no 10 no 14 are compared to reveal the effect of f t cycling number series of no 8 and no 15 no 18 aim to consider the effect of initial compacted water content all above cases are applied under the confining pressure of 0 600 kpa table 3 2 3 ct based analysis of meso structure in soil samples for a profound understanding of the hydraulic conductivity behaviour of gravelly soils with different gravel contents it is necessary to acquire a meso structural insight into the distribution of gravel particles inside the soil matrix ct images are often taken to explore the soil fabric of the specimens in meso scales which is around 10 to 1000 Œºm scales between the smallest clay particle sizes and field structures luxmoore 1981 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 therefore a planar visual section of the tested samples for several typical gravel contents c g 10 30 and 50 is examined by a computed tomography ct scan by application of image analysis ct imagery data can be filtered and processed for obtaining parameters such as transverse sectional macro porosity and macro pore size gao et al 2019 fan et al 2021 herein fig 3 gives a quantitative analysis of the two dimensional pore size distribution of the tested samples based on ct images from the perspective of meso scales the relationship between incremental porosity and equivalent pore size illustrates that the meso scale pores exhibit clear unimodal size distributions this is consistent with the similar observations in an analysis of two dimensional pore size distribution performed on an eluvial colluvial gravelly soil gao et al 2019 however it should be noted that the captured unimodal pattern might not be the genuine characteristics due to the limitation of ct technique the samples with gravel contents of 10 30 and 50 have visual meso pore size in ranges of 0 mm 2 5 mm 0 mm 3 5 mm and 0 mm 5 5 mm respectively besides the corresponding peak value occurs at 1 0 mm 1 0 mm and 2 5 mm respectively the result indicates that increasing gravel content will significantly increase and enlarge the meso pores inside the compacted gravelly soil samples thus leading to the expected increase of soil matrix gravel interfaces this might be due to the fact that under high gravel contents the soil matrix will be totally separated by the coarse gravel particle skeleton and cannot be sufficiently compacted this gravel content dependent meso structures in compacted soil samples will significantly affect the hydraulic conductivity upon different factors such as confining pressure and f t cycles described later 2 4 laboratory freezing thawing tests the experimental freezing thawing test was performed in the cryogenic laboratory at hohai university as shown in fig 4 the soil samples were exposed to a closed three dimensional freezing condition othman and benson 1993 dalla santa et al 2019 according to astm d560 2003 and the authors previous studies lu et al 2019 2020 to effectively prevent the water loss induced by sublimation and evaporation during repeated f t cycling process the tested samples were pre sealed with plastic films a temperature of 20 c was set during freezing period and the thawing period was set as room temperature about 20 c during one f t cycle the sample was firstly frozen for 24 h and subsequently thawed for 24 h one f t cycle involves 48 h in this experimental work a total of 0 1 2 3 5 7 and 10 f t cycling processes were scheduled 2 5 hydraulic conductivity tests in triaxial conditions the hydraulic conductivity is usually measured following either the constant head or falling head method the former is suitable for coarse grained soils conversely the latter is recommended for fine grained soils and is independent of the hydraulic gradient i thus making effective the calculation of k based on darcy s law assaad and harb 2013 with respect to gravelly soils owing to the presence of oversized gravel particles size 2 mm 20 mm special sampling tools and large scale testing apparatus are required to measure the hydraulic conductivity in this study a flexible wall permeameter is utilized to conduct the permeability tests it can avoid the side wall leakage which is commonly observed when using rigid wall permeameter samingan et al 2003 besides the void ratio variation due to the application of confining pressure can be indirectly calculated from the real time deformations measured in the volume change tube at the end of consolidation it is noted that the samples were firstly saturated with a skempton s pore pressure coefficient b b Œ¥u Œ¥œÉ 3 measured to be higher than 0 95 zhang et al 2014 sadeghi and alipanahi 2020 afterward the tested sample was isotropically consolidated under confining pressures of 0 600 kpa following consolidation the water was flushed into the sample from a desired hydraulic gradient by seepage pressure device therefore the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks can be calculated based on the variations of water heads and the corresponding time intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of confining pressure fig 5 a and b show the change of hydraulic conductivity and the corresponding void ratio with the applied external confining pressures c g 30 it is observed that hydraulic conductivity presents a gradual decrease with the increase of confining stress when the confining pressure increases from 0 kpa to 200 kpa the void ratio decreases significantly from 0 55 to about 0 40 and the corresponding hydraulic conductivity also decreases sharply this is mainly because the sample is rapidly compressed under confining pressure and the soil voids become smaller and smaller with the confining pressure exceeding 400 kpa the void ratio decreases to a stable value around 0 33 0 36 and hydraulic conductivity basically maintains at 10 6 10 7 cm s the decrease in hydraulic conductivity is essentially attributed to the variation in the void volume of soil mass the soil voids will be gradually compressed and become smaller as the increasing confining pressure is applied on the sample surface such process tends to slow down due to the fact that soil mixture is a kind of compression induced hardening material and will become difficult to be compressed owing to the increase of stiffness alonso et al 2013 tarantino and de col 2008 this tendency is also reflected in the results that the degree of reduction in permeability goes down with increasing confining pressure it is also found that the sustained f t action will significantly increase the hydraulic conductivity despite the slight increase in global void ratio this might be because the gravelly soil s permeability is not only controlled by the global void ratio but also the interfaces of the combined soil gravel mixtures discussed latter fig 5 c further gives the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and void ratio it highlights that the hydraulic conductivity increase with void ratio regardless of the confining pressures 3 2 effect of number of f t cycles fig 6 a shows the changes of hydraulic conductivity with the number of f t cycles under different confining pressures c g 30 it is observed that increasing number of f t cycles will gradually increase the hydraulic conductivity no matter what the confining pressure is considering repeated freeze thaw processes the increase of hydraulic conductivity adds up cycle after cycle however the most significant increase occurs at 1st 2nd f t cycle this is because the irreversible alteration of the soil s internal structure is mostly achieved the first time when it is subjected to the cyclic freezing thawing similar observations that the largest change in permeability occurs after the first cycle have also been discussed in other kinds of soils konrad 1989 othman benson 1993 han et al 2020 dalla santa et al 2020 therefore upon f t cycles the hydraulic conductivity increase is largest the first time the soil experiences f t action and the effects diminish cycle after cycle a progressive depletion of such f t induced effects occurs and after several cycles the soil usually achieves a new equilibrium structure dalla santa et al 2019 thus after 7 10 f t cycles the hydraulic conductivity of the tested gravelly soil samples also trends to a stable value this means that just a few or even only one f t cycles can affect the hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soils considerably with regard to the confining stress effect the load applied after the f t treatment will make the frost induced cracks and micro pores trend to be closed thereby causing the effect of f t cycles on hydraulic conductivity become less remarkable under higher confining pressures the evolution of the macroscopic permeability coefficient is essentially reflected in the change of global void ratio change of the corresponding void ratio upon f t cycles is also depicted in fig 6 b under low temperature the pore water in the sample freezes into pore ice thus leading to not only the voids volume augment but also the voids interconnection augment dalla santa et al 2019 when the ice becomes melted the expanded void will no longer recover to be closed as unfrozen state therefore the soil matrix voids will endure a gradual enlargement due to the continuous f t cycles in fig 6 c the hydraulic conductivity data are depicted in relation to the void ratio data underline that the hydraulic conductivity increase with void ratio regardless of the different equilibrium soil structure achieved in the samples owing to the freeze thaw processes this observation is consistent with an experimental phenomenon reported by dalla santa et al 2016 that after 5 7 thermal cycles a new condition of equilibrium characterized by a lower void ratio seems to be achieved since no further deformation could be imposed by thermal variations in this study the relations of saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and void ratio e can be well estimated by an exponential function as follows 1 k s Œ± exp Œ≤ e where Œ± and Œ≤ are fitting parameters e is void ratio 3 3 effect of gravel content fig 7 a shows the change of hydraulic conductivity with gravel content under non frozen sate n 0 it is observed that the hydraulic conductivity firstly decreases with increasing gravel content to a minimum value at c g 30 and then gradually increases sharply with further addition of gravel particles similar phenomenon is also found in a permeability test of compacted granule clay mixtures by shafiee 2008 this is mainly because the permeability of gravelly soils is attributed to the combined influence of soil matrix gravel particles and soil matrix gravel interfaces on one hand small amount addition of gravel particles will reduce the flow paths inside the compacted soil matrix thus leading to the decrease in hydraulic conductivity on the other hand the soil gravel interface becomes the weak zone to provide preferential flow paths thereby causing an increase in hydraulic conductivity therefore under the above two opposite actions the experimental results show a minimum hydraulic conductivity under 30 gravel content as aforementioned in the meso structural analysis in fig 3 for the section in gravel contents of 10 and 30 the gravel particles are suspended in the clayey soil matrix where no contacts can form between the gravel particles with increasing the gravel content up to 50 a large number of gravel particles cause a gradual contact between gravel particles and soil matrix comes to be gradually separated by gravel particles under this circumstance weakly bonded gravel soil interfaces will thereby adequately develop such interfaces are expected to be prominently affected by f t cycles as confirmed by the forthcoming experimental evidences and discussions previous results have confirmed that 1st f t cycle has the significant impact on the increase of hydraulic conductivity herein as further show in fig 7 b the comparison of hydraulic conductivity under non frozen n 0 and 1 f t cycle n 1 is made for the samples with gravel content of 0 10 30 and 50 it is found that the hydraulic conductivity for different gravel contents all presents a significant increase tendency after one f t cycle the higher the gravel content is the greater the increase amplitude becomes this could be attributed to the difference in structural characteristics of gravelly soils with lower or higher gravel particle contents for the cases of lower gravel contents c g 0 10 and 30 it is apparent that the f t induced increase in hydraulic conductivity exhibits significant under lower confining pressure while becomes less dominate under higher confining pressure take c g 0 as an example under œÉ 3 0 kpa and 600 kpa the hydraulic conductivity after one f t cycle increased by 64 9 and 1 1 respectively however for higher gravel content c g 50 the hydraulic conductivity after one f t cycle increased by 64 3 and 54 6 1 respectively under œÉ 3 0 kpa and 600 kpa this means for the samples with high gravel contents there still exits a remarkable freeze thaw induced increase in hydraulic conductivity even under higher confining pressure that is the increase of confining pressure cannot adequately compensate for the permeability increases upon f t cycles even if the clayey soil matrix void ratio will significantly be reduced under confining stress this is because the structural characteristics in samples of c g 50 are expected to contribute to a large number of soil gravel interfaces with weak bonding upon repeated f t cycles fig 3 besides considering the self healing capacity of soil matrix mainly depends on plasticity and w opt dalla santa et al 2020 in this study the soil plasticity index is 12 5 and w opt is 11 4 these values are quite small and the soil belongs to cl according to uscs classification it is expected that the self healing capacity of the tested fine soils is quite limited therefore it further provides evidence that the high confinement cannot repair the irreversible degradation in soil gravel interfaces despite that it can close the frost induced cracks and pores in the clayey soil matrix as much as possible 3 4 effect of initial compacted water content fig 8 shows the changes of hydraulic conductivity in terms of confining pressure for samples compacted at different initial water contents under non frozen and one f t cycle c g 30 it is observed that the hydraulic conductivity of the sample under non frozen state is very close to that of the sample with 4 water content after one f t cycle it indicates that the k s of the sample with w 4 is basically unaffected by freeze thaw actions this is because when the water content is very low soil particles have a strong adsorption effect against the around water films and this small amount of water basically exists as unfrozen state even under negative temperature jin et al 2020 lu et al 2019 besides even if such small amount of water is completely frozen it is still difficult for ice particles to expand the soil pores and has almost negligible frost induced degradation on soil structures thus a very low water content basically has no effect on the variation of permeability coefficient upon f t cycles with the further increase of the initial water content from 6 to 12 the cyclic freezing thawing will cause a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity a higher amount of water content is expected to have more remarkable sensitivity to f t cycles because of the more expansion induced by frost heave in wetter soils thereby the samples with higher water contents will have greater values of hydraulic conductivity after f t cycles it is also noted from fig 8 that with the increase of confining pressure the increase of hydraulic conductivity induced by f t actions will be gradually restrained for instance when confining pressure reaches 600 kpa the hydraulic conductivities of samples with different initial water contents tend to a very close value actually the aforementioned restraining effect on hydraulic conductivity by confining pressure depends on both the number of f t cycles and initial water content herein taking the samples with w 8 3 and 12 as an example the comparison of hydraulic conductivity under different f t cycles is given in fig 9 it is apparent that with the increase of confining pressure the two curves of hydraulic conductivity under different initial water content will gradually resynthesize the same curve the intersection point of the two curves appears earlier with the increase of freeze thaw cycles this indicates that the larger the number of f t cycles the lower confining pressure is needed to remove the initial water content induced difference in hydraulic conductivity this is because with the increase of f t cycles the soil structure is gradually weakened and the internal micro cracks continuously expand thus the pore structure of the soil becomes more fluffy thereby easy to be compacted even a small confining pressure is applied to further explore the effect of initial compacted water content on hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soils fig 10 gives the variations of hydraulic conductivity of samples with different compacted water contents upon f t cycles c g 30 when the initial water content gradually increased from 4 to 12 the hydraulic conductivity under different confining pressures all showed a gradual increase tendency a higher amount of water content is expected to have more remarkable sensitivity to f t cycles because of the more expansion induced by frost heave in wetter soils such effect will cause a greater hydraulic conductivity of compacted soils with higher water contents however the magnitude of increase in hydraulic conductivity may not depend on the water content itself under low confining pressure the increase amplitude is larger while under high confining pressure the increase amplitude becomes smaller in addition to confining pressure the increase amplitude could also affected by the compacted soil structures previous research has revealed that different compaction states in compacted soils may result in different soil microstructures and further affect the hydro mechanical behaviour delage et al 1996 romero and simms 2008 in terms of effects of initial compacted water content on soil microstructure a major consensus from previous studies is that an aggregate structure is well developed in the soil sample compacted on the dry side of the w opt for the wet sample a dispersed structure will form and clayey soil particles forming a matrix will envelop the larger grains and fill the inter granular voids alonso et al 2013 li et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 the soil aggregate structure on the dry side of w opt is more unstable than the dispersed structure compacted at wet side under the action of external forces the large pores inside double porosity structural soils are more likely to be compacted and are more susceptible to environmental factors such as dry wet and freeze thaw cycles delage et al 1996 alonso 2007 in the experimental results when the water content increases from 4 to 8 3 w opt the hydraulic conductivity increases significantly however when the water content increases from 8 3 to 12 the hydraulic conductivity increases more slightly this could be attributed to the difference in microstructures of soil matrix compacted in different initial water contents for the gravelly soil sample with 30 gravel content the corresponding compacted optimum water content is 8 3 therefore it is w 0 8 3 the critical initial water content that controls the increase amplitude transformation of the hydraulic conductivity with initial water content 3 5 conceptual permeability zones in compacted gravelly soils based on the above experimental results it can be concluded that the hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soils increases significantly after freeze thaw actions which is affected by the confining pressure gravel content number of f t cycles and initial compacted water content to synthetically understand the evolution mechanism of hydraulic conductivity in gravelly soils under f t cycles fig 11 gives the illustration of the conceptual model for permeability zone in gravelly soils it mainly involves three zones impervious gravel particle weakly permeable clayey soil matrix and strongly permeable gravel soil interface the main feature of each zone is outlined and discussed as follows 1 zone of impervious gravel particle due to the impermeability of coarse aggregate particles the addition of small number of gravel particles will extend the flow paths inside the clayey soil matrix the flow path bypasses the gravel particles thereby decreasing the hydraulic conductivity to some extent this zone is basically unaffected by f t cycles however the increase of gravel content in compacted gravelly soils will be expected to cause an irreversible enlargement in the interfaces between gravels and the surrounding compacted clayey soil matrix 2 zone of weakly permeable clayey soil matrix the permeability in this zone is highly controlled by the compacted void ratio of the clayey soil matrix this zone is significantly affected by f t cycles because the soil matrix is a frost sensitive material the internal enlarged voids due to cyclic freezing thawing will be easily compressed and tend to be closed when subjected to the external action of confining pressure 3 zone of strongly permeable gravel clayey soil interface the interface between clayey soil matrix and gravels is relatively bonded weakly so that a significant reduction of permeability usually occurs under high gravel content the permeability sharply increases because large number of inter particle voids exist inside the interface of soil matrix gravel particle skeleton this zone is also remarkably controlled by f t cycles and the frost induced degradation will not recover even under higher confining pressure 4 conclusion hydraulic conductivity in gravelly soils with varying gravel contents considering effect of freezing thawing cycles was investigated experimentally in this study samples with different gravel contents were obtained by a wet mixing and stratified compaction method ten freeze thaw cycles are applied the influence of confining pressure gravel content number of f t cycles and initial compacted water content on permeability behaviour was quantitatively analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 hydraulic conductivity in compacted gravelly soils was controlled by gravel particle soil matrix and the interface of soil matrix gravel upon f t cycles it increased significantly and also depended on the confining pressure gravel content number of f t cycles and initial compacted water content 2 increase of confining pressure compressed the soil mixtures and reduced the global void ratio thereby decreasing the hydraulic conductivity under higher confining pressure the void increase in clayey soil matrix induced by f t cycles gradually trended to become closed while the degradation of the soil matrix gravel interface would no longer recover due to the limited self healing capacity of the tested fine clayey soils 3 upon progressive f t cycles the hydraulic conductivity remarkably increased in particular at the 1st 2nd f t cycle such phenomenon dominated in the cases at lower confining pressure and higher initial water content 4 gravel particle fraction decided the meso structural distribution in gravelly soils under lower gravel content the gravel particles floated in the clay matrix higher gravel content caused a gravel skeleton structure and leaded to a widely distributed soil matrix gravel interfaces which was easily affected by f t cycles and resulted in a significantly increase in hydraulic conductivity 5 with the increase of initial compacted water content the compacted soil structure was expected to transform from an aggregate structure to a dispersed structure thus it was found there was a prominent increase of hydraulic conductivity after f t cycles in samples compacted at the dry side of optimum water content while a slighter increase at the wet side of optimum credit authorship contribution statement yang lu conceptualization methodology formal

4578,extreme precipitation events have been increasing in recent decades and have been causing impacts to human life and property which requires expansion of existing networks to provide essential information for hydrometeorological analysis this study developed an entropy and copula based approach for precipitation monitoring network expansion aiming at adding stations in ungauged areas with high value of monitoring vom which was estimated through information content and redundancy the approach was applied to a network in the taihu lake basin china we grouped the adjacent stations based on thiessen polygons computed vom for each group and identified candidate locations for additional stations the entropy measures e g joint entropy and total correlation required to compute vom were estimated through the principle of maximum entropy pome and copula based joint distribution fitting we evaluated the performance of five copula families and adopted the student t copula as the optimal copula model results showed that orographic effect and network density were the main factors that influence vom variation i e high vom appeared in the southwest mountain area and the east area with sparsely distributed stations we also compared the results with those derived from three data quantization methods among which the rounding technique produced consistent results the final network schemes were generated by adding stations following a strategy that supports decision preference on the positioning scheme and station number and were evaluated through the kriging interpolation error the proposed approach provides an efficient and a practical way for strengthening a precipitation monitoring system keywords entropy copulas kriging interpolation pome precipitation monitoring network 1 introduction information on precipitation is fundamental for the assessment of climate change impact natural hazard forecasting and water resources management recent decades have been witnessing more frequent extreme precipitation events with high spatial and temporal variability which are being attributed to climate change these events cause impacts to human life and property especially in mountainous and coastal regions monitoring of such events requires a larger number of gauging stations to cover more areas of interest although satellite based remote sensing and ground based radar techniques provide valuable information monitoring networks are still needed to collect accurate in situ data and to validate remote sensing measurements several approaches have been developed for the optimal monitoring of precipitation and other variables e g streamflow water level and quality groundwater snowfall and snow cover etc as reviewed by chacon hurtado et al 2017 and mishra and coulibaly 2009 among these approaches entropy based approaches using shannon s information theory shannon 1948 have been developed since the 1980s and are known for their capability of measuring information content associated with a station or a network of stations keum et al 2017 various entropy related indices and criteria such as transinformation joint entropy and total correlation have been developed for hydrometric network design singh 2015 transinformation or mutual information simply measures the deliverable information between two stations which was introduced in the early stage husain 1987 1989 krstanovic and singh 1992a 1992b mogheir and singh 2002 the directional information transfer dit index has since been proposed for rainfall and streamflow network design yang and burn 1994 alfonso et al 2010a li et al 2012 su and you 2014 xu et al 2017 also transinformation has been coupled with multiple linear regression to measure the deliverable information between a station and the network markus et al 2003 mishra and coulibaly 2010 2014 fahle et al 2015 the introduction of total correlation by alfonso et al 2010a alfonso et al 2010b extended the measure of transferable information into multivariate cases and facilitated multi objective optimization with joint entropy and total correlation separately accounting for information content and redundancy the optimal network can be obtained from pareto solutions through a greedy algorithm typical examples include the dual entropy multivariate objective optimization crdemo framework proposed by samuel et al 2013 and the maximum information minimum redundancy mimr criterion proposed by li et al 2012 though initially developed for streamflow networks these approaches are applicable to other hydrological variables such as rainfall and water level keum and coulibaly 2017a 2017b keum et al 2018 leach et al 2016 2015 wang et al 2018 in addition transinformation was also coupled with bias measures for multi objective resampling of rain gauge networks xu et al 2015 despite these developments limited work has focused on the expansion of precipitation monitoring networks chen et al 2008 keum and coulibaly 2017a keum and coulibaly 2017b wei et al 2014 xu et al 2018 generally the aim of entropy based network expansion is to find candidate gauging locations and pick up those with high value of information a feasible way developed in previous works is to generate grid points with fixed spacing as potential locations then build entropy based objective functions to determine whether a particular location deserves an additional station chen et al 2008 wei et al 2014 however the randomly generated grid is independent of the existing network which cannot ensure that all positions with poor monitoring are covered some studies used interpolated data at potential locations for calculation of entropy which could cause deviation from the true value besides the process is restricted to the entropy domain while validation or reference from an outer context is needed to support the reliability of the approach concerning the gridding problem hosseini and kerachian 2017 explored the best spatial sampling scheme for a groundwater level monitoring network based on regular hexagons and thiessen polygons the thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 divided the area with perpendicular bisectors of lines joining adjacent gauges and assign each gauge with a controlling area which is especially suitable for areas where spatial distances between samples are irregular the technique is efficient and easy to implement yet its usage in hydrology has been limited to fundamental practices such as areal precipitation estimation frei and isotta 2019 han bray 2006 and spatial interpolation dirks et al 1998 goovaerts 2000 it can be expected that through reasonable utilization thiessen polygons could play an important role in precipitation network optimization e g assisting the analysis of spatial information distribution providing reference locations for additional stations and so on in hydrometric network expansion studies geostatistical techniques such as kriging interpolation have been integrated with entropy based methods kriging provides an explicit estimate of the interpolation error making it possible to identify areas with poor interpolation adhikary et al 2015 cheng et al 2008 mahmoudi meimand et al 2015 pardo ig√∫zquiza 1998 yeh et al 2011 the kriging and entropy integrated approach typically seeks a reduction in the interpolation variance assuming that for a network to be optimal the measured variable should be as certain as possible chacon hurtado et al 2017 xu et al 2018 developed a method to determine the optimal network that enables the reduction of kriging standard error of precipitation estimates throughout the watershed in environmental research baume et al 2011 compared the performance of four optimization algorithms for soil mineral observing network design with the mean universal kriging variance as interpolation accuracy measure and found the greedy algorithms minimizing entropy performed best kriging can serve as a complement to the entropy based framework assisting the selection of additional stations and evaluation of the final expansion scheme a common issue with entropy based approaches is that the entropy computation process has a large uncertainty restricted by the computation capability most early studies used distribution fitting or kernel density estimation to obtain entropy values husain 1987 1989 krstanovic and singh 1992a 1992b yang and burn 1994 although these methods were less than satisfactory or incapable for multivariate cases in recent studies the quantization methods have generally been adopted which discretize the continuous data with certain bin width or a mathematical floor function alfonso et al 2010a 2014 fahle et al 2015 keum coulibaly 2017a keum et al 2018 li et al 2012 although some studies concluded that the bin width had little influence on the station ranking li et al 2012 mishra and coulibaly 2010 others compared different discretization methods with fixed and dynamic bin width and found non negligible effect on the optimal network scheme fahle et al 2015 keum and coulibaly 2017a gong et al 2014 also pointed out that an improper bin width could cause significant error the shortcoming in entropy computation greatly weakens the reliability of entropy based approaches xu et al 2017 explored the integration of entropy and copulas for entropy estimation copulas are multivariate distribution functions commonly used in hydrology to model the dependence structures of random variables hao and singh 2015 de michele and salvadori 2003 and have been widely adopted in hydrology for multivariate frequency analyses favre et al 2004 hao and singh 2013 li et al 2019 salvadori and de michele 2004 2010 salvadori et al 2011 zhang and singh 2019 zhang et al 2012 2013 with proper model selection and parameter estimation copula and entropy together can help calculate multivariate entropy terms such as transinformation and total correlation in their work xu et al 2017 presented a copula entropy based directional information transfer cdit index to cluster rainfall gauges for multiobjective optimization such integration is an effective experiment and deserves further application this study aimed to develop an entropy and copula integrated approach for precipitation monitoring network expansion with focus on the spatial distribution of information we grouped adjacent stations based on thiessen polygons and evaluated the value of monitoring at ungauged locations with kriging interpolation error as a reference we presented the principle of maximum entropy pome and copula integrated method for entropy computation and compared the results with those obtained from traditional data quantization methods the final network expansion schemes were generated by adding stations at locations of high monitoring value 2 methodology 2 1 entropy theory 2 1 1 entropy shannon 1948 developed the entropy or information theory to quantify the uncertainty of random variables in accord with the thermodynamic entropy measure of disorder or randomness singh 2013 hence entropy can measure the uncertainty of hydrological variables such as precipitation which can reflect the information delivered by a gauging station or network in the univariate case given a random variable x s with probability density function pdf f x entropy or marginal entropy h x of x can be expressed singh 2013 as 1 h x s f x log f x d x for network design h x measures the information contained by a single station the unit of entropy depends on the logarithm base e g bit for 2 and nat for e cover and thomas 2006 extended to multivariate case entropy can measure the total information of station combinations for d variables x 1 x 2 xd defined on s 1 s 2 sd with joint pdf f x 1 x 2 xd the joint entropy can be formulated as singh 2015 2 h x 1 x 2 x d s 1 s 2 s d f x 1 x 2 x d log f x 1 x 2 x d d x 1 d x 2 d x d to measure the overlapping information among variables e g the duplicated information contained by a station combination transinformation and total correlation are introduced in the bivariate case for two variables x s and y r with marginal and joint pdf f x f y and f x y transinformation can be expressed as 3 t x y s r f x y log f x y f x f y d x d y in the multivariate case the difference between the sum of marginal entropy and joint entropy is calculated to estimate the total overlapping information known as total correlation 4 c x 1 x 2 x d i 1 d h x i h x 1 x 2 x d total correlation is adopted in network design as a measure of information redundancy which is supposed to be reduced for network efficiency 2 1 2 data quantization methods for entropy estimation according to the aforementioned formulations marginal and multiple distributions are essential for the calculation of entropy measures recently most studies used discrete instead of continuous distributions for entropy computation to avoid making distribution assumptions fahle et al 2015 keum and coulibaly 2017b several data quantization methods with fixed or dynamic bin widths have been proposed to calculate discrete entropy the rounding method converts a variable to the nearest lowest integer multiples of a constant a through a mathematical floor function as 5 x r a 2 x a 2 a where denotes the floor function that eliminates all decimal places in this study we adopted a 1 mm for computation and later analysis in order to reserve the variability of precipitation series as much as possible sturges 1926 suggested an optimal bin width for data quantization based on the sample range and size 6 a st r x 1 log 2 n where r x denotes the range of a series of x and n denotes the sample size scott 1979 presented another method to determine the optimal bin width by minimizing the integrated mean square error between true and histogram estimated density values which was formulated as 7 a sc 3 49 œÉ x n 1 3 where œÉ x is the standard deviation of variable x in this study the data quantization based entropy estimation was computed through the r package infotheo developed by meyer 2014 2 1 3 principle of maximum entropy pome in the case of marginal entropy the principle of maximum entropy pome can serve as an estimation method for distribution inference pome states that the distribution with maximum entropy subject to certain constraints should be adopted for it best represents the current state of knowledge jaynes 1957 specifically the constraints can be specified as 8 s f x d x 1 and 9 s g i x f x d x e g i x i 1 2 m where equation 8 is the normalization condition and equation 9 specifies m constraints in which gi x i 1 2 m represents the properties of interest typically different orders of moments of variables and e g i x is the expectation of gi x under the constraints f x is solved using the method of lagrange multipliers with lagrangian function l kapur and kesavan 1992 expressed as 10 l s f x log f x d x Œª 0 1 s f x d x 1 i 1 m Œª i s g i x f x d x e g i x where Œª i i 1 2 m are lagrange multipliers let l f 0 and the maximum entropy based probability density function pdf f x is obtained as 11 f x e x p Œª 0 i 1 m Œª i g i x where Œª i i 0 1 2 m can be obtained by substituting f x in equations 8 and 9 with equation 11 finally the cumulative distribution function cdf is obtained through the integral 12 f x a x f x d x in this study the pome related computation was implemented through the r package minxent developed by senay 2012 2 1 4 entropy disorder indexes for precipitation variability evaluation the knowledge of spatial and temporal variability of precipitation or precipitation heterogeneity is essential for network design the aforementioned marginal entropy provides a perspective by quantifying the uncertainty described by the probibality distribution of individual series in addition mishra and coulibaly 2009 presented intensity entropy ie and apportionment entropy ae to investigate the intra annual and decadal distributions of precipitation intensity entropy ie considering the number of rainy days ni i 1 2 12 in a month of a year to the total number of rainy days in the whole year n for a particular raingauge ie can be calculated as 13 i e i 1 12 n i n log 2 n i n apportionment entropy ae suppose ri i 1 2 12 is the monthly precipitation during the ith month in a year and r is the annual precipitation ae can be expressed as 14 a e i 1 12 r i r log 2 r i r according to the definition when the annual rainy days or precipitation amount are evenly apportioned to each month with the probability of 1 12 ie and ae take on their maximum value of log212 and the minimum value of 0 occurs when the precipitation is concentrated in one month with a probability of 1 similarly decadal apportionment entropy dae measures the randomness of the precipitation series on a decadal basis considering ai being the annual precipitation for the ith year and dr being the aggregate decadal precipation dae can be calculated as 15 d a e i 1 10 a i dr log 2 a i dr dae ranges between 0 and log210 with the above conceptes disorder index di is presented for analysis of precipitation variability which is difined as disorder index di maximum possible entropy value under evenly apportioned state actual entropy value obtained the disorder indexes calculated from ie ae and dae are known as intensity disorder index idi apportionment disorder index adi and decadal apportionment disorder index dadi and the maximum value of which are 3 5850 log212 3 5850 and 3 3219 log210 respectively idi adi and dadi are temporal measures of precipitaion varaibility the higher the disorder index is the larger will be the variability comparing the indexes of individual stations with respect to over all stations in the area helps providing the knowledge of spatial precipitation variability or heterogeneity 2 2 integration of entropy and copulas 2 2 1 copulas copulas are joint distribution functions of multiple variables independent of their marginal distributions joe 1997 nelsen 2006 a d dimensional copula cop is a map 0 1 d 0 1 d 2 with certain properties according to the theorem of sklar 1959 for d random variables x 1 x 2 xd with joint distribution f x 1 x 2 xd and marginal distributions u 1 f 1 x 1 u 2 f 2 x 2 ui f d xd a d dimensional copula cop exists such that 16 f x 1 x 2 x d c o p u 1 u 2 u d cop is unique if fi i 1 2 d are continuous otherwise cop is unique on r a n f 1 r a n f d there are several copula families each with certain construction rules the commonly used and easy to construct elliptical copulas and archimedean copulas were employed in this study elliptical copulas such as normal and student t copulas are constructed with corresponding marginal and joint elliptical distributions archimedean copulas are constructed with a strictly monotonically decreasing generating function œÜ 0 1 2 0 1 that is 17 c o p u 1 u 2 u d œÜ 1 œÜ u 1 œÜ u 2 œÜ u d an archimedean copula is uniquely determined by the generator gumbel frank and clayton copulas are the most common families of this type also copula families differ from each other in their tail dependence modelling ability basic information on the above elliptical and archimedean copula families is shown in tables 1 and 2 the suitability of a copula for a specified dependence structure can be assessed through the goodness of fit gof test using the cram√©r von mises statistic sn or kolmogorov smirnov statistic tn the model performance can be evaluated by log likelihood llh values akaike information criterion aic and cross validation cv values aic is expressed as 18 a i c 2 k 2 ln l where k denotes the number of parameters n denotes the sample size and l denotes the pseudo likelihood function values moreover copula modelling is conducted on the premise that the time series ui i 1 2 d are not autocorrelated which requires the unqualified data to be processed 2 2 2 total correlation estimation using copula entropy both total correlation and copulas are related to the dependency among two or more variables based on their linkage and total correlation can be estimated through appropriate copula modelling let x 1 x 2 xd be random variables with marginal distributions ui fi xi i 1 2 d copula entropy is defined as the entropy of the copula density function c o p u 1 u 2 u d 19 h cop u 1 u 2 u d 0 1 0 1 0 1 c o p u 1 u 2 u d log c o p u 1 u 2 u d d u 1 d u 2 d u d where c o p u 1 u 2 u d c o p u 1 u 2 u d u 1 u 2 u d a crucial linkage between entropy and copulas is that total correlation defined by equation 4 equals negative copula entropy ma and sun 2011 see appendix a for proof 20 c o p x 1 x 2 x d h cop u 1 u 2 u d therefore the total correlation of random variables x 1 x 2 xd can be estimated through copula entropy from equation 16 copula entropy is the expectation of the logarithm of c o p u 1 u 2 u d 21 h cop u 1 u 2 u d e ln c o p u 1 u 2 u d in this study the copula related computation was done through r package copula hofert et al 2020 in which the conditional approach and the marshall and olkin 1988 approach were employed as the random number generator for copulas to conclude the total correlation of multiple hydrological series can be estimated as follows step 1 get the marginal cdfs u 1 u 2 u d from empirical or fitted distributions or using pome step 2 select an optimal copula to model the dependence structure of multiple series according to llh aic and cv values step 3 calculate copula entropy h cop u 1 u 2 u d as total correlation estimates with marginal entropy computed using pome and total correlation estimated by copula estimation the joint entropy can be obtained through equation 4 2 3 kriging interpolation kriging interpolation is a method for unbiased and optimal linear estimation of regionalized variables at unsampled locations based on the spatially dependent variance adhikary et al 2015 for a regionalized variable with the normal distribution the kriging estimator is expressed as 22 z l 0 i 1 n Œª i z l i where z l 0 refers to the estimated value of z at unsampled location l 0 Œª i denotes weights associated with the observation at the location l i and n indicates the number of observations the kriging technique requires a variogram model to describe the spatial structure of the regionalized variable in the computation process i e 23 Œ≥ h 1 2 v a r z l z l h where l and l h are sampling locations separated by a distance h several variogram models are possible depending on the shape of the variogram function among which exponential gaussian and spherical variogram models are mostly used in hydrology the experimental variogram can be calculated from the observed data as 24 Œ≥ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z l i z l i h 2 where n h is the number of sample data points separated by a distance h one of the advantages of kriging is that it provides an estimate of the corresponding kriging error usually expressed as kriging variance as 25 œÉ e 2 v a r z l z l the square root of the kriging variance is termed as the kriging standard error kse which indicates the accuracy of interpolation at different locations kriging methods are classified into several types based on the study purpose and condition ordinary kriging is frequently used for rainfall interpolation which assumes that the regionalized variable z l has an unknown constant expectation m 26 e z l m the kriging variance in ordinary kriging can be computed as 27 œÉ z 2 l 0 Œº z i 1 n Œª i Œ≥ h 0 i f o r i 1 n Œª i 1 where Œº z denotes the lagrangian multiplier in the z scale h 0 i denotes the distance between the unsampled location l 0 and sample locations l i and n is the number of sample locations in cases where the regionalized variable presents a structure of ensemble modelled by a secondary variable the spatial behavior of the secondary variable is called external drift ly et al 2011 pointed out that for daily rainfall interpolation at the catchment scale when the correlation coefficient between elevation and rainfall exceeded 0 75 using kriging with elevation as external drift could generally reduce the prediction error therefore to make full use of the data conditions we separated the daily precipitation records into three cases each corresponding to an interpolation method as shown in table 3 the average kriging standard error kse of cases 1 and 2 was computed to identify locations with poor interpolation accuracy where the monitoring force should be strengthened 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the study area is located in the southwest taihu lake basin of china covering an area of 5930 9 km2 see fig 1 the landscape of which is composed of mountains hills and plains in the north and the southwest of the area the jieling mountains and the tianmu mountains raise the elevation to 500 1000 m among the mountain ranges are plains with elevation measured below 10 m and transition areas below 30 m the area is densely covered with natural and artificial river channels under a typical subtropical monsoon climate the area features four distinct seasons with annual mean temperature measured as 15 ‚Å∞c and annual precipitation measured as 1200 mm throughout the year there are three rainy seasons i e the spring rainy season in april and may the plum rain season also known as meiyu from middle june to middle july and the typhoon rainstorm season in august and september the precipitation has a decreasing trend from southwest to northeast the existing precipitation monitoring network in this area contains 45 stations the area is highly urbanized and is one of the most heavily populated and economically developed regions of china the urban area of which takes up a proportion of 10 2 data in 2016 still growing according to wmo 2008 the present network density has reached the recommended minimum densities of stations for mountains 2500 km2 station and interior plains or hilly areas 5750 km2 station but has not exceeded that for urban areas 10 20 km2 station meaning 30 59 stations in the urban area moreover researchers have found intensifying extreme precipitation in east and south china including the lower yangtze river basin which has potential to increase the probability of occurrence of natural hazards like floods li et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 therefore there is a demand for enhancing precipitation monitoring by expanding the gauging network to get better knowledge of the spatial temporal precipitation variation 3 2 data processing in this study we used daily precipitation data of 10 years 2007 2016 for computation as mentioned before when copula entropy was used for total correlation estimation we conducted a data merging strategy to eliminate the autocorrelation of the series the steps of which are described as follows an example is provided in appendix b step 1 pick out the effective rainy days i e those with at least one station had precipitation records 0 mm while others are regarded as interval days step 2 sum up the precipitation of neighboring effective rainy days that are separated by less than ni interval days and obtain 45 new series step 3 conduct autocorrelation tests to make sure the series are independent the number interval days ni should be neither too small nor too large as a small ni cannot eliminate the autocorrelation while a large ni will greatly shorten the series and affect copula modelling in this study ni 3 was adopted after processing the series length was shortened from 3652 to 165 all the 45 new series passed the autocorrelation tests and were used for subsequent copula modelling test results are provided in table s1 in the supplementary material 4 network expansion strategy in this study we proposed a novel network expansion strategy we first generated thiessen polygons covering the study area to depict the control area of each existing station then computed the value of monitoring vom at candidate locations based on the joint entropy h and total correlation c among adjacent stations finally new stations located at high vom points were added to form the expansion scheme a flowchart of the process is shown in fig 2 4 1 value of monitoring the index value of monitoring vom is employed to measure the information accumulation condition of adjacent stations specifically fig 3 a shows the thiessen polygons covering the study area with each station taking up a segment as its controlling area the basic unit for computing vom is the adjacent station group asg the combination of stations that share the same polygon sides as shown in fig 3b an asg usually contains three stations and asgs can overlap with each other when they contain common stations an important element in an asg is the central node i e the common vertex of the adjacent polygons in an asg fig 3b a node can serve as a location to mark the vom values also a possible place of candidate new stations totally there are 65 such groups and corresponding nodes in the study area to obtain the vom joint entropy h and total correlation c of certain asg are first computed then the values are normalized denoted as hn and cn accordingly vom is calculated as 25 vom h n c n where 26 h n h m i n h i m a x h i m i n h i f o r i 1 2 3 n 27 c n c m i n c i m a x c i m i n c i f o r i 1 2 3 n and n denotes the total number of asgs vom varies from 1 to 1 it provides a way to evaluate the information distribution over the study area and determine whether additional station is needed for a station group the character of vom and its relation with normalized joint entropy hn and total correlation cn is illustrated in fig 4 basically h and c are synchronized i e more information content corresponds to more information redundancy ideally hn matches cn and vom 0 while in some cases e g when the stations are located in mountain areas where precipitation has large variability or the stations are too sparse there tends to be larger h and smaller c than usual reflected as unmatched hn and cn and positive vom on the contrary in homogeneous areas where precipitation has small variability or an area with too dense stations relatively smaller h and larger c would produce negative vom for the second case the existing stations can meet the demand while for the first case additional stations are required to strengthen the monitoring force 4 2 network expansion procedure based on the definitions of asg and vom we developed the following steps to obtain the network expansion schemes step 1 generate thiessen polygons covering the study area and find out all asgs step 2 calculate the vom value of each asg step 3 select asgs with positive vom as candidate asgs that need additional stations step 4 determine the position within each candidate asg to locate a new station in our experiment three schemes were respectively adopted for comparison see fig 5 for example scheme a at the position where maximum kse is obtained within the triangle formed by collecting the three existing stations scheme b at the center of the triangle of existing stations scheme c at the common node of the three thiessen polygons step 5 obtain final schemes by adding stations in proper order in particular to avoid possible information redundancy from additional stations located too close to each other stations are added one by one and the pearson correlation coefficients are computed as an index to identify the unnecessary stations 1 interpolate the precipitation data at candidate positions of new stations for each scheme in step 3 using the kriging or idw method 2 sort all positions in descending order according to the vom value of the corresponding asg denote the interpolated precipitation series of the sorted asgs as si i 1 2 n where n is the number of asgs 3 add the first new station at the position with maximum vom 4 calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between precipitation series of the first and each remaining station i e cor s 1 si i 2 3 n if c o r s 1 s i exceeds a threshold p c the si corresponding position is removed from the candidate position sequence here p c 0 1 reflects the decision maker s acceptance to the similarity of stations within the network 5 find the candidate position related to s 2 if the position has been removed from the sequence move to the next step otherwise add a new station here 6 calculate cor s 2 si i 3 4 n analogously if c o r s 2 s i p c remove the related position 7 repeat similar operations as in steps 5 and 6 each time add a station at the position that has not been removed from the sorted sequence meanwhile calculate the correlation coefficient between the added station and each remaining one and remove the highly correlated positions then move to the next position until the last one has been processed finally all the added stations together with the existing stations compose the expanded network 5 results and discussion in this section we present the results of network expansion following the strategy described in section 4 2 we employed pome and copulas to compute the univariate and multivariate entropy measures the optimal copula model was selected from five copula families then we computed vom and analyzed its spatial distribution especially the correlation with kriging standard error kse we also compared the results with those obtained from three traditional data quantization methods note that in the computation process the observed precipitation series were employed for data quantization method while the merged precipitation series with no autocorrelation were employed for the copula entropy method 5 1 spatial and temporal variability of precipitation before the network expansion study it is essential to get a knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation and the spatial precipitation heterogeneity can provide reference for the raingauge network layout for this purpose the marginal entropy me intensity disorder index idi apportionment disorder index adi and decadal disorder index dadi were calculated the spatial distribution of which are shown in fig 6 here me was calculated with pome method to avoid subjective parameter selection monthly annul precipitation and rainy days in 10 years were added for idi and adi calculation as is shown me was well correlated with the topography individual stations in the southwest mountain area exhibited large entropy which indicates large temporal fluctuations me decreased with the elevation and got minimum values in the north and east plain area adi exhibited similar spatial variation with me meaning that the disproportion of monthly precipitation was more significant in the high elevation areas the disproportion was mainly caused by the east asian summer monsoon which brought abundant rainfall from june to september further amplified by the mountain topography on the contrary idi showed a negative correlation in most of the study area implying that the fluctuation of monthly rainy days were more significant in the plain areas this is explained as rainy days in the dry season in these areas were less than those in the mountain areas causing large discrepancy with the wet season dadi had no obvious correlation with the topography but showed a increasing trend from the southwest to the north indicating intensifying intra annual variability from the spatial variation of me idi adi and dadi it can be deduced that the southwest mountain area and the east and north areas required more stations for precipitation monitoring 5 2 value of monitoring vom computed with entropy copula integrated method 5 2 1 copula modelling to estimate the total correlation of adjacent stations with copula entropy an appropriate copula function is required to model the dependence structure of the related precipitation series in this study five copula families i e gumbel frank clayton normal and student t were tested for their goodness of fit gof results are shown as a heatmap in fig 7 as is shown in the gof tests concerning merged precipitation series of all the 65 asgs the frank copula failed in 25 of them and the clayton copula failed in 32 of them p value 0 05 to avoid the possible discrepancy caused by different copula models the chosen copula family should be applicable to all asgs therefore these two copula families were excluded from subsequent analysis the other three copula families i e gumbel normal and student t were used for copula entropy estimation still a best fitted copula family should be selected from the three to ensure the effectiveness of the modelled dependence structure and accuracy of the estimated copula entropy in this study the log likelihood llh values akaike information criterion aic as well as cross validation cv values were used to compare the performances of copula modelling the heatmaps in fig 8 show the scaled values of the above indexes it is seen that student t copula had the best performance among the three copulas i e the highest llh and the lowest aic for 64 asgs except for asg no 39 and the highest cv values for all 65 asgs the normal copula was the suboptimal family which slightly overperformed the gumbel regarding llh and aic indexes and had significant advantages regarding the cv values in conclusion the student t copula was the most appropriate to model the dependence structure of all multiple precipitation series below we will focus on the network expansion schemes based on the vom values computed from the student t copula while results obtained from the other two families were also computed and are compared here to demonstrate the effect of copula model selection 5 2 2 spatial variation of value of monitoring vom fig 9 presents the spatial variation of vom computed with student t copula with the topography and kse as basemap respectively as shown in fig 9a the positive vom values which indicate candidate locations of new stations were mainly distributed in two areas the southwest mountain area although held dense monitoring stations exhibited high vom this can be explained as the orographic rain contained more uncertainty i e more information the other was the east area with flat terrain and sparse stations the largest vom value was obtained here meaning great shortage of monitoring fig 9b substitutes the basemap with the average kse from 2496 interpolation operations each corresponding to a single rainy day obviously kse at a certain location was highly correlated with its distance to the surrounding stations it is seen that kse and vom corresponded well in most areas i e locations with poor interpolation results were evaluated as containing high value of monitoring discrepancy between the two indexes appeared in the southwest mountain area where demand for enhancing monitoring still existed despite the good interpolation quality it may be recalled that the kriging method constructed the variogram model for single day precipitation records while the entropy method utilized the multivariate dependence structures of the complete precipitation time series therefore vom extracted less spatial but much more temporal information from the data the information asymmetry explains why the large number of existing stations cannot meet the monitoring demand to investigate the effect of model selection fig 10 compares the vom values computed with the three copula families that passed the gof test here the asgs were sorted by the vom values derived from the student t copula it is seen that the vom range varied slightly with the copula type i e 0 83 0 81 for student t copula 0 83 0 90 for gumbel copula and 0 83 0 79 for normal copula also most of the vom values obtained from the gumbel and normal copulas were consistent with the student t case regarding the positive negative feature this means that the candidate locations identified for additional stations by the three copula families would generally be the same however the discrepancy of absolute vom values among the three scenarios would generate different sorts of the asgs in the station positioning process for example the asg with the maximum vom was ranked top in the student t scenario but was ranked 6th and 3th by the gumbel and normal copulas respectively the asg with minimum positive vom was ranked 28th by the student copula while ranked 22th and 14th by the gumbel and normal copulas respectively in conclusion changing the copula model would have little effect on the vom distribution but would still influence the final network expansion scheme 5 3 value of monitoring vom computed with data quantization methods 5 3 1 marginal entropy as mentioned before data quantization methods are commonly used for entropy computation but can produce inconsistent results as the class intervals are determined with different rules fig 11 is the correlation diagram of marginal entropy me of the 45 stations computed with pome and three quantization methods pome method generates the maximum entropy reflecting the largest uncertainty given the sample series which is the closest to natural state and the most reliable spatial distribution of me computed with pome has been shown in fig 6 from fig 11 it is seen that results of the rounding method had the strongest correlation with those of pome pearson s correlation coefficient cor 0 971 followed by the scott s method cor 0 968 among the three quantization methods the rounding and the scott s method were highly correlated cor 0 997 while sturges method was relatively less correlated with the others since the inconsistency of entropy values caused by using different formulations would be magnified in higher dimensions e g when computing the joint entropy or total correlation a proper quantization method should be used from above analysis rounding method was the most reliable and was adopted for subsequent computation of the value of monitoring vom index and network expansion schemes for comparison with the entropy copula integrated approach 5 3 2 spatial variation of value of monitoring vom fig 12 presents the spatial variation of vom computed by the rounding method compared with fig 9 vom varied in a smaller range making the stations less distinguishable with each other analogously asgs with positive vom were concentrated in the southwest mountain area and the east area the maximum vom was in the mountain area indicating the location with the largest demand for extra monitoring stations which differed from the student t copula case where the northeast plain area presented the largest vom in addition as shown in fig 12b apart from the mountain area the spatial variation of vom was consistent with that of kse as can be expected the discrepancy in entropy values would be transited to the vom values fig 13 compares the vom values computed with the three quantization methods apparently the discretization technique affected the vom based order of adjacent station groups asgs and variation range of vom results derived from the rounding method and scott s method were highly consistent which accorded well with the me results the vom values generally ranged from 0 5 to 0 5 values derived from the sturges method however varied in a wider range 0 91 0 54 moreover the vom based asg order especially the division of positive negative feature were largely inconsistent with the other two scenarios this implies that the arbitrariness in quantization interval selection can cause large discrepancy in entropy based index values thus affect the network evaluation results and the corresponding expansion schemes 5 4 effect of topography and network density from the spatial variation of vom as shown in figs 9 and 12 suggests that the key factors that influence vom might be 1 the topography of the area especially the orographic effect and 2 the density of monitoring stations to make further verification fig 14 shows the variation of vom as the elevation elevation at the central node of each asg and the average control area per station average area of the thiessen polygons of each asg varied where vom were computed with the entropy copula integrated method and the rounding method respectively it is seen that in both scenarios the asgs with high altitude and large control area got high vom values the maximum vom in fig 14a measured 0 81 corresponded to an average control area of 313 2 km2 meaning very sparse layout and the maximum vom in fig 14b measured 0 60 was obtained at the asg with the highest elevation 1286 m asgs in the plain area or with dense stations were mostly evaluated as low monitoring value bottom left part in the plots the results proved that the orographic effect and network density jointly influenced the vom variation 5 5 network expansion schemes from the above analysis the student t copula and the rounding formulation were respectively the most appropriate copula model and data quantization method for multivariate entropy computation using the two methods and following the network expansion strategy described in section 4 2 we obtained the enlarged network scheme with additional stations added to candidate positions with positive vom values as mentioned before this study adopted three schemes to locate a new station within an asg i e scheme a position with maximum kse scheme b center of three existing stations and scheme c common node of the thiessen polygons fig 15 presents the corresponding network expansion process when the correlation coefficient threshold was set as p c 0 95 the number beside each station denotes the order by which it was selected to join the network and the point size reflects the vom level besides the candidate positions that were excluded from the new network to avoid information redundancy pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0 95 are colored in grey the added stations were mainly located in the southwest mountain area and the east and northwest areas which generally accorded with the areas with large spatial and temporal variability of precipitation as analyzed in section 5 1 altering the locating schemes affected not only the position but also the number of new stations scheme a see fig 15a and 15d tended to increase stations at places away from the existing stations as this could improve the kriging interpolation performance scheme b see fig 15b and 15e was a conservative plan as the new station was always located at an inner center surrounded by existing stations scheme c see fig 15c and f by comparison enhanced the monitoring ability at the margin places of the study area which broadened the network coverage the alteration of positioning scheme changed the correlation coefficients of corresponding precipitation series calculated in each step under the redundancy preventing mechanism the effect of the changes magnified reflected as completely different network schemes specifically schemes a b and c in the copula scenario respectively contained 8 11 and 12 additional stations and their counterparts in the quantization scenario respectively contained 10 9 and 9 new stations the considerable number of excluded grey positions manifested that the mechanism played a significant role in reducing the neighboring stations to avoid information redundancy what s more it can be noted that the sensitivity to this mechanism differed in different areas in fig 15c for example the neighboring positions no 2 and no 3 in the mountain area were both selected while the three positions surrounding position no 1 in the plain area were removed though they had longer distances among each other this was also the case for the other five scenarios the deviation further verified the high uncertainty and variability of mountain precipitation besides the correlation coefficient threshold p c was an important factor of the network pattern it represented the acceptance of similarity of selected stations which directly determined whether or not to accept an additional station fig 16 shows the final network schemes obtained with p c 92 5 95 0 97 5 and vom from the student t copula and rounding method respectively for simplicity only the scenario of positioning scheme b is presented here the kse distribution was used as a basemap for comparison as can be expected as p c increased the final network schemes included a larger number of additional stations 6 11 19 in the copula case and 6 9 18 stations in the quantization case also it is noted that from fig 16a to 16c or from fig 16d to 16f the added stations remained to be distributed in areas of high elevation and large kse while some other areas kept vacancy of new stations this continuity proved the robustness of the approach in strengthening the monitoring capability in significant areas that had been identified in addition the correlation threshold p c can also serve as a parameter to adjust the additional station number i e the network expansion scale which depends on practical factors such as budget limitation or engineering conditions 6 conclusions in this study we developed an entropy and copula based approach for precipitation monitoring network expansion the core idea was to increase the number of stations in ungauged areas with high value of monitoring vom which was evaluated through the joint entropy h and total correlation c of station groups we presented an expansion strategy including three steps 1 divide the study area with thiessen polygons and group the adjacent stations 2 compute the vom for each group and identify those with positive values as candidate locations for additional stations where the proposed pome and copula integrated method and the traditional data quantization methods were both adopted to calculate entropy measures and 3 generate network expansion schemes by adding stations to qualified candidate positions in this step we explored three positioning schemes to locate new stations and the technique of excluding redundant stations the approach was applied to a precipitation gauging network containing 45 stations located in the southwest taihu lake basin china daily precipitation records of 10 years were used for computation tests of five copula families and three quantization methods showed that the student t copula and rounding formulation were respectively most applicable for vom computation also the effect of altering the copula family was less significant than that of changing the quantization method we analyzed the spatial variation of vom with that of the kriging standard error kse as reference and found that it was essential to strengthen the monitoring capability in the southwest mountain areas with large rainfall variability and the east areas with sparse stations meaning that orographic effect and network density were the main factors that influenced vom the final network schemes yielded different positioning schemes or selection limitations exhibited common features which proved the robustness of the approach compared with the previous approaches the developed framework has advantages in theory and practical the integration of entropy and copulas facilitates a relatively standard process for multivariate entropy computation copula modelling includes goodness of fit tests model performance evaluation and parameter estimation which reduce uncertainty and arbitrariness that can be caused by using different class intervals in data quantization methods the thiessen polygon based segmentation and reorganization of the area make it easier to analyze the spatial variation of vom identify areas with information redundancy or deficiency as well as visualize the station augmentation process the framework is open to decision preference regarding the number and positions of additional stations by changing the positioning scheme or adjusting a correlation coefficient threshold the final network scheme can be adapted to fit the budget or engineering considerations the main drawback of the approach is that the expansion is a self optimizing process with no standard indicating a satisfied network vom is essentially a measure to identify station groups that contain relatively more information compared to redundancy it will be automatically updated once the network is changed thus positive vom may still exist after network expansion which means the monitoring network can be further intensified by including more stations while there is no criterion to assess whether the network is qualified therefore future works may focus on establishing evaluation criteria as a reference for network expansion which requires abundant case studies of precipitation monitoring networks at different spatial and temporal scales credit

4578,extreme precipitation events have been increasing in recent decades and have been causing impacts to human life and property which requires expansion of existing networks to provide essential information for hydrometeorological analysis this study developed an entropy and copula based approach for precipitation monitoring network expansion aiming at adding stations in ungauged areas with high value of monitoring vom which was estimated through information content and redundancy the approach was applied to a network in the taihu lake basin china we grouped the adjacent stations based on thiessen polygons computed vom for each group and identified candidate locations for additional stations the entropy measures e g joint entropy and total correlation required to compute vom were estimated through the principle of maximum entropy pome and copula based joint distribution fitting we evaluated the performance of five copula families and adopted the student t copula as the optimal copula model results showed that orographic effect and network density were the main factors that influence vom variation i e high vom appeared in the southwest mountain area and the east area with sparsely distributed stations we also compared the results with those derived from three data quantization methods among which the rounding technique produced consistent results the final network schemes were generated by adding stations following a strategy that supports decision preference on the positioning scheme and station number and were evaluated through the kriging interpolation error the proposed approach provides an efficient and a practical way for strengthening a precipitation monitoring system keywords entropy copulas kriging interpolation pome precipitation monitoring network 1 introduction information on precipitation is fundamental for the assessment of climate change impact natural hazard forecasting and water resources management recent decades have been witnessing more frequent extreme precipitation events with high spatial and temporal variability which are being attributed to climate change these events cause impacts to human life and property especially in mountainous and coastal regions monitoring of such events requires a larger number of gauging stations to cover more areas of interest although satellite based remote sensing and ground based radar techniques provide valuable information monitoring networks are still needed to collect accurate in situ data and to validate remote sensing measurements several approaches have been developed for the optimal monitoring of precipitation and other variables e g streamflow water level and quality groundwater snowfall and snow cover etc as reviewed by chacon hurtado et al 2017 and mishra and coulibaly 2009 among these approaches entropy based approaches using shannon s information theory shannon 1948 have been developed since the 1980s and are known for their capability of measuring information content associated with a station or a network of stations keum et al 2017 various entropy related indices and criteria such as transinformation joint entropy and total correlation have been developed for hydrometric network design singh 2015 transinformation or mutual information simply measures the deliverable information between two stations which was introduced in the early stage husain 1987 1989 krstanovic and singh 1992a 1992b mogheir and singh 2002 the directional information transfer dit index has since been proposed for rainfall and streamflow network design yang and burn 1994 alfonso et al 2010a li et al 2012 su and you 2014 xu et al 2017 also transinformation has been coupled with multiple linear regression to measure the deliverable information between a station and the

information into multivariate cases and facilitated multi objective optimization with joint entropy and total correlation separately accounting for information content and redundancy the optimal network can be obtained from pareto solutions through a greedy algorithm typical examples include the dual entropy multivariate objective optimization crdemo framework proposed by samuel et al 2013

variables such as rainfall and water level keum and coulibaly 2017a 2017b keum et al 2018 leach et al 2016 2015 wang et al 2018 in addition transinformation was also coupled with bias measures for multi objective resampling of rain gauge networks xu et al 2015 despite these developments limited work has focused on the expansion of precipitation monitoring networks chen et al 2008 keum and coulibaly 2017a keum and coulibaly 2017b wei et al 2014 xu et al 2018 generally the aim of entropy based network expansion is to find candidate gauging locations and pick up those with high value of information a feasible way developed in previous works is to generate grid points with fixed spacing as potential locations then build entropy based objective functions to determine whether a particular location deserves an additional station chen et al 2008 wei et al 2014 however the randomly generated grid is independent of the existing network which cannot ensure that all positions with poor monitoring are covered some studies used interpolated data at potential locations for calculation of entropy which could cause deviation from the true value besides the process is restricted to the entropy domain while validation or reference from an outer context is needed to support the reliability of the approach concerning the gridding problem hosseini and kerachian 2017 explored the best spatial sampling scheme for a groundwater level monitoring network based on regular hexagons and thiessen polygons the thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 divided the area with perpendicular bisectors of lines joining adjacent gauges and assign each gauge with a controlling area which is especially suitable for areas where spatial distances between samples are irregular the technique is efficient and easy to implement yet its usage in hydrology has been limited to fundamental practices such as areal precipitation estimation frei and isotta 2019 han bray 2006 and spatial interpolation dirks et al 1998 goovaerts 2000 it can be expected that through reasonable utilization thiessen polygons could play an important role in precipitation network optimization e g assisting the analysis of spatial information distribution providing reference locations for additional stations and so on in hydrometric network expansion studies geostatistical techniques such as kriging interpolation have been integrated with entropy based methods kriging provides an explicit estimate of the interpolation error making it possible to identify areas with poor interpolation adhikary et al 2015 cheng et al 2008 mahmoudi meimand et al 2015 pardo ig√∫zquiza 1998 yeh et al 2011 the kriging and entropy integrated approach typically seeks a reduction in the interpolation variance assuming that for a network to be optimal the measured variable should be as certain as possible chacon hurtado et al 2017 xu et al 2018 developed a method to determine the optimal network that enables the reduction of kriging standard error of precipitation estimates throughout the watershed in environmental research baume et al 2011 compared the performance of four optimization algorithms for soil mineral observing network design with the mean universal kriging variance as interpolation accuracy measure and found the greedy algorithms minimizing entropy performed best kriging can serve as a complement to the entropy based framework assisting the selection of additional stations and evaluation of the final expansion scheme a common issue with entropy based approaches is that the entropy computation process has a large uncertainty restricted by the computation capability most early studies used distribution fitting or kernel density estimation to obtain entropy values husain 1987 1989 krstanovic and singh 1992a 1992b yang and burn 1994 although these methods were less than satisfactory or incapable for multivariate cases in recent studies the quantization methods have generally been adopted which discretize the continuous data with certain bin width or a mathematical floor function alfonso et al 2010a 2014 fahle et al 2015 keum coulibaly 2017a keum et al 2018 li et al 2012 although some studies concluded that the bin width had little influence on the station ranking li et al 2012 mishra and coulibaly 2010 others compared different discretization methods with fixed and dynamic bin width and found non negligible effect on the optimal network scheme fahle et al 2015 keum and coulibaly 2017a gong et al 2014 also pointed out that an improper bin width could cause significant error the shortcoming in entropy computation greatly weakens the reliability of entropy based approaches xu et al 2017 explored the integration of entropy and copulas for entropy estimation copulas are multivariate distribution functions commonly used in hydrology to model the dependence structures of random variables hao and singh 2015 de michele and salvadori 2003 and have been widely adopted in hydrology for multivariate frequency analyses favre et al 2004 hao and singh 2013 li et al 2019 salvadori and de michele 2004 2010 salvadori et al 2011 zhang and singh 2019 zhang et al 2012 2013 with proper model selection and parameter estimation copula and entropy together can help calculate multivariate entropy terms such as transinformation and total correlation in their work xu et al 2017 presented a copula entropy based directional information transfer cdit index to cluster rainfall gauges for multiobjective optimization such integration is an effective experiment and deserves further application this study aimed to develop an entropy and copula integrated approach for precipitation monitoring network expansion with focus on the spatial distribution of information we grouped adjacent stations based on thiessen polygons and evaluated the value of monitoring at ungauged locations with kriging interpolation error as a reference we presented the principle of maximum entropy pome and copula integrated method for entropy computation and compared the results with those obtained from traditional data quantization methods the final network expansion schemes were generated by adding stations at locations of high monitoring value 2 methodology 2 1 entropy theory 2 1 1 entropy shannon 1948 developed the entropy or information theory to quantify the uncertainty of random variables in accord with the thermodynamic entropy measure of disorder or randomness singh 2013 hence entropy can measure the uncertainty of hydrological variables such as precipitation which can reflect the information delivered by a gauging station or network in the univariate case given a random variable x s with probability density function pdf f x entropy or marginal entropy h x of x can be expressed singh 2013 as 1 h x s f x log f x d x for network design h x measures the information contained by a single station the unit of entropy depends on the logarithm base e g bit for 2 and nat for e cover and thomas 2006 extended to multivariate case entropy can measure the total information of station combinations for d variables x 1 x 2 xd defined on s 1 s 2 sd with joint pdf f x 1 x 2 xd the joint entropy can be formulated as singh 2015 2 h x 1 x 2 x d s 1 s 2 s d f x 1 x 2 x d log f x 1 x 2 x d d x 1 d x 2 d x d to measure the overlapping information among variables e g the duplicated information contained by a station combination transinformation and total correlation are introduced in the bivariate case for two variables x s and y r with marginal and joint pdf f x f y and f x y transinformation can be expressed as 3 t x y s r f x y log f x y f x f y d x d y in the multivariate case the difference between the sum of marginal entropy and joint entropy is calculated to estimate the total overlapping information known as total correlation 4 c x 1 x 2 x d i 1 d h x i h x 1 x 2 x d total correlation is adopted in network design as a measure of information redundancy which is supposed to be reduced for network efficiency 2 1 2 data quantization methods for entropy estimation according to the aforementioned formulations marginal and multiple distributions are essential for the calculation of entropy measures recently most studies used discrete instead of continuous distributions for entropy computation to avoid making distribution assumptions fahle et al 2015 keum and coulibaly 2017b several data quantization methods with fixed or dynamic bin widths have been proposed to calculate discrete entropy the rounding method converts a variable to the nearest lowest integer multiples of a constant a through a mathematical floor function as 5 x r a 2 x a 2 a where denotes the floor function that eliminates all decimal places in this study we adopted a 1 mm for computation and later analysis in order to reserve the variability of precipitation series as much as possible sturges 1926 suggested an optimal bin width for data quantization based on the sample range and size 6 a st r x 1 log 2 n where r x denotes the range of a series of x and n denotes the sample size scott 1979 presented another method to determine the optimal bin width by minimizing the integrated mean square error between true and histogram estimated density values which was formulated as 7 a sc 3 49 œÉ x n 1 3 where œÉ x is the standard deviation of variable x in this study the data quantization based entropy estimation was computed through the r package infotheo developed by meyer 2014 2 1 3 principle of maximum entropy pome in the case of marginal entropy the principle of maximum entropy pome can serve as an estimation method for distribution inference pome states that the distribution with maximum entropy subject to certain constraints should be adopted for it best represents the current state of knowledge jaynes 1957 specifically the constraints can be specified as 8 s f x d x 1 and 9 s g i x f x d x e g i x i 1 2 m where equation 8 is the normalization condition and equation 9 specifies m constraints in which gi x i 1 2 m represents the properties of interest typically different orders of moments of variables and e g i x is the expectation of gi x under the constraints f x is solved using the method of lagrange multipliers with lagrangian function l kapur and kesavan 1992 expressed as 10 l s f x log f x d x Œª 0 1 s f x d x 1 i 1 m Œª i s g i x f x d x e g i x where Œª i i 1 2 m are lagrange multipliers let l f 0 and the maximum entropy based probability density function pdf f x is obtained as 11 f x e x p Œª 0 i 1 m Œª i g i x where Œª i i 0 1 2 m can be obtained by substituting f x in equations 8 and 9 with equation 11 finally the cumulative distribution function cdf is obtained through the integral 12 f x a x f x d x in this study the pome related computation was implemented through the r package minxent developed by senay 2012 2 1 4 entropy disorder indexes for precipitation variability evaluation the knowledge of spatial and temporal variability of precipitation or precipitation heterogeneity is essential for network design the aforementioned marginal entropy provides a perspective by quantifying the uncertainty described by the probibality distribution of individual series in addition mishra and coulibaly 2009 presented intensity entropy ie and apportionment entropy ae to investigate the intra annual and decadal distributions of precipitation intensity entropy ie considering the number of rainy days ni i 1 2 12 in a month of a year to the total number of rainy days in the whole year n for a particular raingauge ie can be calculated as 13 i e i 1 12 n i n log 2 n i n apportionment entropy ae suppose ri i 1 2 12 is the monthly precipitation during the ith month in a year and r is the annual precipitation ae can be expressed as 14 a e i 1 12 r i r log 2 r i r according to the definition when the annual rainy days or precipitation amount are evenly apportioned to each month with the probability of 1 12 ie and ae take on their maximum value of log212 and the minimum value of 0 occurs when the precipitation is concentrated in one month with a probability of 1 similarly decadal apportionment entropy dae measures the randomness of the precipitation series on a decadal basis considering ai being the annual precipitation for the ith year and dr being the aggregate decadal precipation dae can be calculated as 15 d a e i 1 10 a i dr log 2 a i dr dae ranges between 0 and log210 with the above conceptes disorder index di is presented for analysis of precipitation variability which is difined as disorder index di maximum possible entropy value under evenly apportioned state actual entropy value obtained the disorder indexes calculated from ie ae and dae are known as intensity disorder index idi apportionment disorder index adi and decadal apportionment disorder index dadi and the maximum value of which are 3 5850 log212 3 5850 and 3 3219 log210 respectively idi adi and dadi are temporal measures of precipitaion varaibility the higher the disorder index is the larger will be the variability comparing the indexes of individual stations with respect to over all stations in the area helps providing the knowledge of spatial precipitation variability or heterogeneity 2 2 integration of entropy and copulas 2 2 1 copulas copulas are joint distribution functions of multiple variables independent of their marginal distributions joe 1997 nelsen 2006 a d dimensional copula cop is a map 0 1 d 0 1 d 2 with certain properties according to the theorem of sklar 1959 for d random variables x 1 x 2 xd with joint distribution f x 1 x 2 xd and marginal distributions u 1 f 1 x 1 u 2 f 2 x 2 ui f d xd a d dimensional copula cop exists such that 16 f x 1 x 2 x d c o p u 1 u 2 u d cop is unique if fi i 1 2 d are continuous otherwise cop is unique on r a n f 1 r a n f d there are several copula families each with certain construction rules the commonly used and easy to construct elliptical copulas and archimedean copulas were employed in this study elliptical copulas such as normal and student t copulas are constructed with corresponding marginal and joint elliptical distributions archimedean copulas are constructed with a strictly monotonically decreasing generating function œÜ 0 1 2 0 1 that is 17 c o p u 1 u 2 u d œÜ 1 œÜ u 1 œÜ u 2 œÜ u d an archimedean copula is uniquely determined by the generator gumbel frank and clayton copulas are the most common families of this type also copula families differ from each other in their tail dependence modelling ability basic information on the above elliptical and archimedean copula families is shown in tables 1 and 2 the suitability of a copula for a specified dependence structure can be assessed through the goodness of fit gof test using the cram√©r von mises statistic sn or kolmogorov smirnov statistic tn the model performance can be evaluated by log likelihood llh values akaike information criterion aic and cross validation cv values aic is expressed as 18 a i c 2 k 2 ln l where k denotes the number of parameters n denotes the sample size and l denotes the pseudo likelihood function values moreover copula modelling is conducted on the premise that the time series ui i 1 2 d are not autocorrelated which requires the unqualified data to be processed 2 2 2 total correlation estimation using copula entropy both total correlation and copulas are related to the dependency among two or more variables based on their linkage and total correlation can be estimated through appropriate copula modelling let x 1 x 2 xd be random variables with marginal distributions ui fi xi i 1 2 d copula entropy is defined as the entropy of the copula density function c o p u 1 u 2 u d 19 h cop u 1 u 2 u d 0 1 0 1 0 1 c o p u 1 u 2 u d log c o p u 1 u 2 u d d u 1 d u 2 d u d where c o p u 1 u 2 u d c o p u 1 u 2 u d u 1 u 2 u d a crucial linkage between entropy and copulas is that total correlation defined by equation 4 equals negative copula entropy ma and sun 2011 see appendix a for proof 20 c o p x 1 x 2 x d h cop u 1 u 2 u d therefore the total correlation of random variables x 1 x 2 xd can be estimated through copula entropy from equation 16 copula entropy is the expectation of the logarithm of c o p u 1 u 2 u d 21 h cop u 1 u 2 u d e ln c o p u 1 u 2 u d in this study the copula related computation was done through r package copula hofert et al 2020 in which the conditional approach and the marshall and olkin 1988 approach were employed as the random number generator for copulas to conclude the total correlation of multiple hydrological series can be estimated as follows step 1 get the marginal cdfs u 1 u 2 u d from empirical or fitted distributions or using pome step 2 select an optimal copula to model the dependence structure of multiple series according to llh aic and cv values step 3 calculate copula entropy h cop u 1 u 2 u d as total correlation estimates with marginal entropy computed using pome and total correlation estimated by copula estimation the joint entropy can be obtained through equation 4 2 3 kriging interpolation kriging interpolation is a method for unbiased and optimal linear estimation of regionalized variables at unsampled locations based on the spatially dependent variance adhikary et al 2015 for a regionalized variable with the normal distribution the kriging estimator is expressed as 22 z l 0 i 1 n Œª i z l i where z l 0 refers to the estimated value of z at unsampled location l 0 Œª i denotes weights associated with the observation at the location l i and n indicates the number of observations the kriging technique requires a variogram model to describe the spatial structure of the regionalized variable in the computation process i e 23 Œ≥ h 1 2 v a r z l z l h where l and l h are sampling locations separated by a distance h several variogram models are possible depending on the shape of the variogram function among which exponential gaussian and spherical variogram models are mostly used in hydrology the experimental variogram can be calculated from the observed data as 24 Œ≥ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z l i z l i h 2 where n h is the number of sample data points separated by a distance h one of the advantages of kriging is that it provides an estimate of the corresponding kriging error usually expressed as kriging variance as 25 œÉ e 2 v a r z l z l the square root of the kriging variance is termed as the kriging standard error kse which indicates the accuracy of interpolation at different locations kriging methods are classified into several types based on the study purpose and condition ordinary kriging is frequently used for rainfall interpolation which assumes that the regionalized variable z l has an unknown constant expectation m 26 e z l m the kriging variance in ordinary kriging can be computed as 27 œÉ z 2 l 0 Œº z i 1 n Œª i Œ≥ h 0 i f o r i 1 n Œª i 1 where Œº z denotes the lagrangian multiplier in the z scale h 0 i denotes the distance between the unsampled location l 0 and sample locations l i and n is the number of sample locations in cases where the regionalized variable presents a structure of ensemble modelled by a secondary variable the spatial behavior of the secondary variable is called external drift ly et al 2011 pointed out that for daily rainfall interpolation at the catchment scale when the correlation coefficient between elevation and rainfall exceeded 0 75 using kriging with elevation as external drift could generally reduce the prediction error therefore to make full use of the data conditions we separated the daily precipitation records into three cases each corresponding to an interpolation method as shown in table 3 the average kriging standard error kse of cases 1 and 2 was computed to identify locations with poor interpolation accuracy where the monitoring force should be strengthened 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the study area is located in the southwest taihu lake basin of china covering an area of 5930 9 km2 see fig 1 the landscape of which is composed of mountains hills and plains in the north and the southwest of the area the jieling mountains and the tianmu mountains raise the elevation to 500 1000 m among the mountain ranges are plains with elevation measured below 10 m and transition areas below 30 m the area is densely covered with natural and artificial river channels under a typical subtropical monsoon climate the area features four distinct seasons with annual mean temperature measured as 15 ‚Å∞c and annual precipitation measured as 1200 mm throughout the year there are three rainy seasons i e the spring rainy season in april and may the plum rain season also known as meiyu from middle june to middle july and the typhoon rainstorm season in august and september the precipitation has a decreasing trend from southwest to northeast the existing precipitation monitoring network in this area contains 45 stations the area is highly urbanized and is one of the most heavily populated and economically developed regions of china the urban area of which takes up a proportion of 10 2 data in 2016 still growing according to wmo 2008 the present network density has reached the recommended minimum densities of stations for mountains 2500 km2 station and interior plains or hilly areas 5750 km2 station but has not exceeded that for urban areas 10 20 km2 station meaning 30 59 stations in the urban area moreover researchers have found intensifying extreme precipitation in east and south china including the lower yangtze river basin which has potential to increase the probability of occurrence of natural hazards like floods li et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 therefore there is a demand for enhancing precipitation monitoring by expanding the gauging network to get better knowledge of the spatial temporal precipitation variation 3 2 data processing in this study we used daily precipitation data of 10 years 2007 2016 for computation as mentioned before when copula entropy was used for total correlation estimation we conducted a data merging strategy to eliminate the autocorrelation of the series the steps of which are described as follows an example is provided in appendix b step 1 pick out the effective rainy days i e those with at least one station had precipitation records 0 mm while others are regarded as interval days step 2 sum up the precipitation of neighboring effective rainy days that are separated by less than ni interval days and obtain 45 new series step 3 conduct autocorrelation tests to make sure the series are independent the number interval days ni should be neither too small nor too large as a small ni cannot eliminate the autocorrelation while a large ni will greatly shorten the series and affect copula modelling in this study ni 3 was adopted after processing the series length was shortened from 3652 to 165 all the 45 new series passed the autocorrelation tests and were used for subsequent copula modelling test results are provided in table s1 in the supplementary material 4 network expansion strategy in this study we proposed a novel network expansion strategy we first generated thiessen polygons covering the study area to depict the control area of each existing station then computed the value of monitoring vom at candidate locations based on the joint entropy h and total correlation c among adjacent stations finally new stations located at high vom points were added to form the expansion scheme a flowchart of the process is shown in fig 2 4 1 value of monitoring the index value of monitoring vom is employed to measure the information accumulation condition of adjacent stations specifically fig 3 a shows the thiessen polygons covering the study area with each station taking up a segment as its controlling area the basic unit for computing vom is the adjacent station group asg the combination of stations that share the same polygon sides as shown in fig 3b an asg usually contains three stations and asgs can overlap with each other when they contain common stations an important element in an asg is the central node i e the common vertex of the adjacent polygons in an asg fig 3b a node can serve as a location to mark the vom values also a possible place of candidate new stations totally there are 65 such groups and corresponding nodes in the study area to obtain the vom joint entropy h and total correlation c of certain asg are first computed then the values are normalized denoted as hn and cn accordingly vom is calculated as 25 vom h n c n where 26 h n h m i n h i m a x h i m i n h i f o r i 1 2 3 n 27 c n c m i n c i m a x c i m i n c i f o r i 1 2 3 n and n denotes the total number of asgs vom varies from 1 to 1 it provides a way to evaluate the information distribution over the study area and determine whether additional station is needed for a station group the character of vom and its relation with normalized joint entropy hn and total correlation cn is illustrated in fig 4 basically h and c are synchronized i e more information content corresponds to more information redundancy ideally hn matches cn and vom 0 while in some cases e g when the stations are located in mountain areas where precipitation has large variability or the stations are too sparse there tends to be larger h and smaller c than usual reflected as unmatched hn and cn and positive vom on the contrary in homogeneous areas where precipitation has small variability or an area with too dense stations relatively smaller h and larger c would produce negative vom for the second case the existing stations can meet the demand while for the first case additional stations are required to strengthen the monitoring force 4 2 network expansion procedure based on the definitions of asg and vom we developed the following steps to obtain the network expansion schemes step 1 generate thiessen polygons covering the study area and find out all asgs step 2 calculate the vom value of each asg step 3 select asgs with positive vom as candidate asgs that need additional stations step 4 determine the position within each candidate asg to locate a new station in our experiment three schemes were respectively adopted for comparison see fig 5 for example scheme a at the position where maximum kse is obtained within the triangle formed by collecting the three existing stations scheme b at the center of the triangle of existing stations scheme c at the common node of the three thiessen polygons step 5 obtain final schemes by adding stations in proper order in particular to avoid possible information redundancy from additional stations located too close to each other stations are added one by one and the pearson correlation coefficients are computed as an index to identify the unnecessary stations 1 interpolate the precipitation data at candidate positions of new stations for each scheme in step 3 using the kriging or idw method 2 sort all positions in descending order according to the vom value of the corresponding asg denote the interpolated precipitation series of the sorted asgs as si i 1 2 n where n is the number of asgs 3 add the first new station at the position with maximum vom 4 calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between precipitation series of the first and each remaining station i e cor s 1 si i 2 3 n if c o r s 1 s i exceeds a threshold p c the si corresponding position is removed from the candidate position sequence here p c 0 1 reflects the decision maker s acceptance to the similarity of stations within the network 5 find the candidate position related to s 2 if the position has been removed from the sequence move to the next step otherwise add a new station here 6 calculate cor s 2 si i 3 4 n analogously if c o r s 2 s i p c remove the related position 7 repeat similar operations as in steps 5 and 6 each time add a station at the position that has not been removed from the sorted sequence meanwhile calculate the correlation coefficient between the added station and each remaining one and remove the highly correlated positions then move to the next position until the last one has been processed finally all the added stations together with the existing stations compose the expanded network 5 results and discussion in this section we present the results of network expansion following the strategy described in section 4 2 we employed pome and copulas to compute the univariate and multivariate entropy measures the optimal copula model was selected from five copula families then we computed vom and analyzed its spatial distribution especially the correlation with kriging standard error kse we also compared the results with those obtained from three traditional data quantization methods note that in the computation process the observed precipitation series were employed for data quantization method while the merged precipitation series with no autocorrelation were employed for the copula entropy method 5 1 spatial and temporal variability of precipitation before the network expansion study it is essential to get a knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation and the spatial precipitation heterogeneity can provide reference for the raingauge network layout for this purpose the marginal entropy me intensity disorder index idi apportionment disorder index adi and decadal disorder index dadi were calculated the spatial distribution of which are shown in fig 6 here me was calculated with pome method to avoid subjective parameter selection monthly annul precipitation and rainy days in 10 years were added for idi and adi calculation as is shown me was well correlated with the topography individual stations in the southwest mountain area exhibited large entropy which indicates large temporal fluctuations me decreased with the elevation and got minimum values in the north and east plain area adi exhibited similar spatial variation with me meaning that the disproportion of monthly precipitation was more significant in the high elevation areas the disproportion was mainly caused by the east asian summer monsoon which brought abundant rainfall from june to september further amplified by the mountain topography on the contrary idi showed a negative correlation in most of the study area implying that the fluctuation of monthly rainy days were more significant in the plain areas this is explained as rainy days in the dry season in these areas were less than those in the mountain areas causing large discrepancy with the wet season dadi had no obvious correlation with the topography but showed a increasing trend from the southwest to the north indicating intensifying intra annual variability from the spatial variation of me idi adi and dadi it can be deduced that the southwest mountain area and the east and north areas required more stations for precipitation monitoring 5 2 value of monitoring vom computed with entropy copula integrated method 5 2 1 copula modelling to estimate the total correlation of adjacent stations with copula entropy an appropriate copula function is required to model the dependence structure of the related precipitation series in this study five copula families i e gumbel frank clayton normal and student t were tested for their goodness of fit gof results are shown as a heatmap in fig 7 as is shown in the gof tests concerning merged precipitation series of all the 65 asgs the frank copula failed in 25 of them and the clayton copula failed in 32 of them p value 0 05 to avoid the possible discrepancy caused by different copula models the chosen copula family should be applicable to all asgs therefore these two copula families were excluded from subsequent analysis the other three copula families i e gumbel normal and student t were used for copula entropy estimation still a best fitted copula family should be selected from the three to ensure the effectiveness of the modelled dependence structure and accuracy of the estimated copula entropy in this study the log likelihood llh values akaike information criterion aic as well as cross validation cv values were used to compare the performances of copula modelling the heatmaps in fig 8 show the scaled values of the above indexes it is seen that student t copula had the best performance among the three copulas i e the highest llh and the lowest aic for 64 asgs except for asg no 39 and the highest cv values for all 65 asgs the normal copula was the suboptimal family which slightly overperformed the gumbel regarding llh and aic indexes and had significant advantages regarding the cv values in conclusion the student t copula was the most appropriate to model the dependence structure of all multiple precipitation series below we will focus on the network expansion schemes based on the vom values computed from the student t copula while results obtained from the other two families were also computed and are compared here to demonstrate the effect of copula model selection 5 2 2 spatial variation of value of monitoring vom fig 9 presents the spatial variation of vom computed with student t copula with the topography and kse as basemap respectively as shown in fig 9a the positive vom values which indicate candidate locations of new stations were mainly distributed in two areas the southwest mountain area although held dense monitoring stations exhibited high vom this can be explained as the orographic rain contained more uncertainty i e more information the other was the east area with flat terrain and sparse stations the largest vom value was obtained here meaning great shortage of monitoring fig 9b substitutes the basemap with the average kse from 2496 interpolation operations each corresponding to a single rainy day obviously kse at a certain location was highly correlated with its distance to the surrounding stations it is seen that kse and vom corresponded well in most areas i e locations with poor interpolation results were evaluated as containing high value of monitoring discrepancy between the two indexes appeared in the southwest mountain area where demand for enhancing monitoring still existed despite the good interpolation quality it may be recalled that the kriging method constructed the variogram model for single day precipitation records while the entropy method utilized the multivariate dependence structures of the complete precipitation time series therefore vom extracted less spatial but much more temporal information from the data the information asymmetry explains why the large number of existing stations cannot meet the monitoring demand to investigate the effect of model selection fig 10 compares the vom values computed with the three copula families that passed the gof test here the asgs were sorted by the vom values derived from the student t copula it is seen that the vom range varied slightly with the copula type i e 0 83 0 81 for student t copula 0 83 0 90 for gumbel copula and 0 83 0 79 for normal copula also most of the vom values obtained from the gumbel and normal copulas were consistent with the student t case regarding the positive negative feature this means that the candidate locations identified for additional stations by the three copula families would generally be the same however the discrepancy of absolute vom values among the three scenarios would generate different sorts of the asgs in the station positioning process for example the asg with the maximum vom was ranked top in the student t scenario but was ranked 6th and 3th by the gumbel and normal copulas respectively the asg with minimum positive vom was ranked 28th by the student copula while ranked 22th and 14th by the gumbel and normal copulas respectively in conclusion changing the copula model would have little effect on the vom distribution but would still influence the final network expansion scheme 5 3 value of monitoring vom computed with data quantization methods 5 3 1 marginal entropy as mentioned before data quantization methods are commonly used for entropy computation but can produce inconsistent results as the class intervals are determined with different rules fig 11 is the correlation diagram of marginal entropy me of the 45 stations computed with pome and three quantization methods pome method generates the maximum entropy reflecting the largest uncertainty given the sample series which is the closest to natural state and the most reliable spatial distribution of me computed with pome has been shown in fig 6 from fig 11 it is seen that results of the rounding method had the strongest correlation with those of pome pearson s correlation coefficient cor 0 971 followed by the scott s method cor 0 968 among the three quantization methods the rounding and the scott s method were highly correlated cor 0 997 while sturges method was relatively less correlated with the others since the inconsistency of entropy values caused by using different formulations would be magnified in higher dimensions e g when computing the joint entropy or total correlation a proper quantization method should be used from above analysis rounding method was the most reliable and was adopted for subsequent computation of the value of monitoring vom index and network expansion schemes for comparison with the entropy copula integrated approach 5 3 2 spatial variation of value of monitoring vom fig 12 presents the spatial variation of vom computed by the rounding method compared with fig 9 vom varied in a smaller range making the stations less distinguishable with each other analogously asgs with positive vom were concentrated in the southwest mountain area and the east area the maximum vom was in the mountain area indicating the location with the largest demand for extra monitoring stations which differed from the student t copula case where the northeast plain area presented the largest vom in addition as shown in fig 12b apart from the mountain area the spatial variation of vom was consistent with that of kse as can be expected the discrepancy in entropy values would be transited to the vom values fig 13 compares the vom values computed with the three quantization methods apparently the discretization technique affected the vom based order of adjacent station groups asgs and variation range of vom results derived from the rounding method and scott s method were highly consistent which accorded well with the me results the vom values generally ranged from 0 5 to 0 5 values derived from the sturges method however varied in a wider range 0 91 0 54 moreover the vom based asg order especially the division of positive negative feature were largely inconsistent with the other two scenarios this implies that the arbitrariness in quantization interval selection can cause large discrepancy in entropy based index values thus affect the network evaluation results and the corresponding expansion schemes 5 4 effect of topography and network density from the spatial variation of vom as shown in figs 9 and 12 suggests that the key factors that influence vom might be 1 the topography of the area especially the orographic effect and 2 the density of monitoring stations to make further verification fig 14 shows the variation of vom as the elevation elevation at the central node of each asg and the average control area per station average area of the thiessen polygons of each asg varied where vom were computed with the entropy copula integrated method and the rounding method respectively it is seen that in both scenarios the asgs with high altitude and large control area got high vom values the maximum vom in fig 14a measured 0 81 corresponded to an average control area of 313 2 km2 meaning very sparse layout and the maximum vom in fig 14b measured 0 60 was obtained at the asg with the highest elevation 1286 m asgs in the plain area or with dense stations were mostly evaluated as low monitoring value bottom left part in the plots the results proved that the orographic effect and network density jointly influenced the vom variation 5 5 network expansion schemes from the above analysis the student t copula and the rounding formulation were respectively the most appropriate copula model and data quantization method for multivariate entropy computation using the two methods and following the network expansion strategy described in section 4 2 we obtained the enlarged network scheme with additional stations added to candidate positions with positive vom values as mentioned before this study adopted three schemes to locate a new station within an asg i e scheme a position with maximum kse scheme b center of three existing stations and scheme c common node of the thiessen polygons fig 15 presents the corresponding network expansion process when the correlation coefficient threshold was set as p c 0 95 the number beside each station denotes the order by which it was selected to join the network and the point size reflects the vom level besides the candidate positions that were excluded from the new network to avoid information redundancy pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0 95 are colored in grey the added stations were mainly located in the southwest mountain area and the east and northwest areas which generally accorded with the areas with large spatial and temporal variability of precipitation as analyzed in section 5 1 altering the locating schemes affected not only the position but also the number of new stations scheme a see fig 15a and 15d tended to increase stations at places away from the existing stations as this could improve the kriging interpolation performance scheme b see fig 15b and 15e was a conservative plan as the new station was always located at an inner center surrounded by existing stations scheme c see fig 15c and f by comparison enhanced the monitoring ability at the margin places of the study area which broadened the network coverage the alteration of positioning scheme changed the correlation coefficients of corresponding precipitation series calculated in each step under the redundancy preventing mechanism the effect of the changes magnified reflected as completely different network schemes specifically schemes a b and c in the copula scenario respectively contained 8 11 and 12 additional stations and their counterparts in the quantization scenario respectively contained 10 9 and 9 new stations the considerable number of excluded grey positions manifested that the mechanism played a significant role in reducing the neighboring stations to avoid information redundancy what s more it can be noted that the sensitivity to this mechanism differed in different areas in fig 15c for example the neighboring positions no 2 and no 3 in the mountain area were both selected while the three positions surrounding position no 1 in the plain area were removed though they had longer distances among each other this was also the case for the other five scenarios the deviation further verified the high uncertainty and variability of mountain precipitation besides the correlation coefficient threshold p c was an important factor of the network pattern it represented the acceptance of similarity of selected stations which directly determined whether or not to accept an additional station fig 16 shows the final network schemes obtained with p c 92 5 95 0 97 5 and vom from the student t copula and rounding method respectively for simplicity only the scenario of positioning scheme b is presented here the kse distribution was used as a basemap for comparison as can be expected as p c increased the final network schemes included a larger number of additional stations 6 11 19 in the copula case and 6 9 18 stations in the quantization case also it is noted that from fig 16a to 16c or from fig 16d to 16f the added stations remained to be distributed in areas of high elevation and large kse while some other areas kept vacancy of new stations this continuity proved the robustness of the approach in strengthening the monitoring capability in significant areas that had been identified in addition the correlation threshold p c can also serve as a parameter to adjust the additional station number i e the network expansion scale which depends on practical factors such as budget limitation or engineering conditions 6 conclusions in this study we developed an entropy and copula based approach for precipitation monitoring network expansion the core idea was to increase the number of stations in ungauged areas with high value of monitoring vom which was evaluated through the joint entropy h and total correlation c of station groups we presented an expansion strategy including three steps 1 divide the study area with thiessen polygons and group the adjacent stations 2 compute the vom for each group and identify those with positive values as candidate locations for additional stations where the proposed pome and copula integrated method and the traditional data quantization methods were both adopted to calculate entropy measures and 3 generate network expansion schemes by adding stations to qualified candidate positions in this step we explored three positioning schemes to locate new stations and the technique of excluding redundant stations the approach was applied to a precipitation gauging network containing 45 stations located in the southwest taihu lake basin china daily precipitation records of 10 years were used for computation tests of five copula families and three quantization methods showed that the student t copula and rounding formulation were respectively most applicable for vom computation also the effect of altering the copula family was less significant than that of changing the quantization method we analyzed the spatial variation of vom with that of the kriging standard error kse as reference and found that it was essential to strengthen the monitoring capability in the southwest mountain areas with large rainfall variability and the east areas with sparse stations meaning that orographic effect and network density were the main factors that influenced vom the final network schemes yielded different positioning schemes or selection limitations exhibited common features which proved the robustness of the approach compared with the previous approaches the developed framework has advantages in theory and practical the integration of entropy and copulas facilitates a relatively standard process for multivariate entropy computation copula modelling includes goodness of fit tests model performance evaluation and parameter estimation which reduce uncertainty and arbitrariness that can be caused by using different class intervals in data quantization methods the thiessen polygon based segmentation and reorganization of the area make it easier to analyze the spatial variation of vom identify areas with information redundancy or deficiency as well as visualize the station augmentation process the framework is open to decision preference regarding the number and positions of additional stations by changing the positioning scheme or adjusting a correlation coefficient threshold the final network scheme can be adapted to fit the budget or engineering considerations the main drawback of the approach is that the expansion is a self optimizing process with no standard indicating a satisfied network vom is essentially a measure to identify station groups that contain relatively more information compared to redundancy it will be automatically updated once the network is changed thus positive vom may still exist after network expansion which means the monitoring network can be further intensified by including more stations while there is no criterion to assess whether the network is qualified therefore future works may focus on establishing evaluation criteria as a reference for network expansion which requires abundant case studies of precipitation monitoring networks at different spatial and temporal scales credit

4579,high fluoride f concentrations in groundwater affected by geothermal activity have been reported worldwide but the genesis mechanism is not adequately understood in this study 92 groundwater samples and 63 sediment samples were collected from the china s guide basin for chemical analyses and laboratory tests results indicate that groundwater f concentrations continuously increase along a flow path being consistent with trends of na and hco3 concentrations na ca molar ratio and ph values while ca2 concentrations show a decreasing trend water soluble f contents in sediments increase as the depth increases higher f groundwater samples generally have lower Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values than those of lower f samples the major hydrogeochemical processes controlling the formation of high f groundwater include precipitation of ca2 or cation exchange between ca2 and na or both which enhance dissolutions of f containing minerals and facilitate the release of f into groundwater slightly alkaline environments and increased hco3 and co3 2 concentrations favor desorption of f from solid surfaces into groundwater closed hydrogeological conditions and long term water rock interactions in confined aquifers accumulate f in groundwater exposed geothermal springs around the guide basin also contribute to the formation of high f groundwaters directly by the input of geothermal water and indirectly by heat transfer into aquifers at a regional scale which is a problem deserving further investigation keywords fluorine groundwater confined aquifer hydrogeochemical process guide basin 1 introduction fluoride f is a micronutrient essential for strengthening human skeletal tissues and teeth its absence in the diet limits tissue growth and impairs fertility however an excessive intake of f can cause dental or skeletal fluorosis and enzyme damage or even worse genetic damage premature aging mental retardation cancer or bone pathology ayenew 2008 chowdhury et al 2019 approximately 200 million people suffer from chronic endemic fluorosis in 28 developed and developing countries including india jacks et al 2005 vikas et al 2013 brazil souza et al 2013 the african continent rango et al 2010 pakistan rafique et al 2009 and china amini et al 2008 currell et al 2011 gao et al 2007 2019 guo wang 2005 wang et al 2009 in china over 41 million inhabitants suffered from dental fluorosis and 2 6 million from skeletal fluorosis in 1 325 counties ministry of health of china 2010 fluoride has been found to be rich in granites alkali granites and hydrothermal deposits ayoob gupta 2006 when f containing minerals including fluorite caf2 sellaite mgf2 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f cryolite na3alf6 villiaumite naf and topaz al2 sio4 f2 and their weathering products contact groundwater f is gradually released and accumulated in the groundwater via water rock interactions su et al 2015 fluorite has generally been considered as the dominant source of groundwater f shah danishwar 2003 geothermal waters frequently contain high f concentrations such as from 17 9 to 19 6 mg l in tibet s yabajing geothermal field and up to 50 mg l in the thermal waters of yellowstone national park such concentrations may cause chemical and thermal contamination of surface and subsurface waters in adjacent areas guo et al 2007 aksoy et al 2009 deng et al 2011 wen et al 2013 other processes that form high f groundwater include na ca cation exchanges and or precipitation of caco3 under favorable conditions during which ca2 is removed from groundwater and the dissolution of caf2 is promoted meenakshi et al 2004 chae et al 2007 tirumalesh et al 2007 gomez et al 2009 liu et al 2013 furthermore under alkaline conditions oh tends to mobilize f from the surfaces of clay minerals and amorphous fe al oxyhydroxides into groundwater due to their similar charges and radii saxena ahmed 2003 guo et al 2012 su et al 2013 li et al 2015 additionally anthropogenic activities such as applications of phosphate fertilizers and discharges of sewage sludge increase dissolved f concentrations in groundwater li et al 2019 however to our knowledge no systematic investigations have been done to explore hydrogeochemical processes governing the mobilization and accumulation of f in confined groundwater influenced by geothermal system fluorosis is a widespread problem in the guide basin in western china during the last few decades many domestic and irrigation wells in the guide basin that contain high f have been used as drinking water sources for several thousand people wen et al 2013 previous studies have indicated that anthropogenic activity is not the reason for the high f in the groundwater especially in the deep groundwater due to small population small amount of animal husbandry weak agricultural activity and high elevations of the recharge area in the basin shi et al 2010 li et al 2012 qiao et al 2021 the occurrence of high f groundwater has been linked to geothermal waters and the geological setting plays an important role in controlling f enrichment migration and transformation shi et al 2010 li et al 2012 however the fundamental mechanism leading to high f groundwater in the guide basin is still not fully understood therefore this study selected the guide basin to show the major geochemical processes controlling f enrichment in groundwater at the scale of a basin the specific objectives are 1 to characterize the hydrogeochemical properties of high f groundwater 2 to investigate the lithological features of the aquifer sediments containing high contents of f and 3 to unravel the main processes controlling the regional distributions of groundwater f in confined aquifers in the guide basin 2 study area the guide basin is in the upper reach of the yellow river in qinghai province fig 1 and is drained by the yellow river and its tributaries yan et al 2005 qiao et al 2021 it has a semi arid continental climate song et al 2008 with an annual average temperature of 7 to 8 precipitation of 252 mm evaporation of 2 000 mm and humidity of 49 the strata beneath the guide basin include the paleocene oligocene xining group miocene pliocene guide group and quaternary deposits from the bottom to the top the guide group forms a wide and gradually tilting syncline from the south and north toward the yellow river and a southwest symmetrical confined aquifer with a dip toward the east zhang et al 2016 the pliocene group is further divided into three subgroups the early n2 1 the middle n2 2 and the later n2 3 the n2 2 is composed mainly of light gray mudstone sandy mudstone and green gray lenticular sandstone and forms several confined aquifers the high f groundwater occurs mainly in those confined aquifers the quaternary unconfined aquifers occur at depths of 100 m below land surface bls and comprise mainly well rounded and well sorted gravel and sand approximately 12 to 32 m thick xu et al 1976 detailed information about the hydrogeological profile across the study area has been provided in our previous study wang et al 2018 the confined aquifers are recharged mainly from surrounding mountains and overlying unconfined aquifers the yellow river is the final discharge area of groundwater in the basin the unconfined aquifers are recharged from precipitation surrounding mountains and the riverbed of a tributary of the yellow river 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analysis ninety two groundwater samples were collected from the basin including 70 samples from unconfined groundwater ug 20 samples from confined groundwater cg and 2 samples from hot springs xj and zc fig 1 eight wells distributed along a groundwater flow path approximately perpendicular to the contours of a confined water head were used to represent the inferred groundwater flow direction fig 1 the first two wells contained water from unconfined aquifers and were in the recharge area 0 to 2 km whereas the next four wells and the last two wells bored water from confined aquifers and were in a subsurface passage area 6 to 9 6 km and discharge area 9 6 to 10 6 km respectively groundwater was sampled from each well after pumping for over 20 min until the redox potential oxidation reduction potential orp ph water temperature t and total dissolved solids tds had stabilized during sampling orp electrical conductivity ec ph t and tds were monitored in situ in an inline flow cell using a portable multiparameter meter hi9828 hanna instruments the instrument was calibrated using standard solutions before use alkalinity

other samples were filtered through 0 22 Œºm pore size membrane filters in the field samples for analyzing anions were stored in 10 ml polyethylene tubes without acidification samples for analyzing major cations and trace elements were collected in 125 ml polyethylene bottles and were acidified to ph 2 by adding 6 m ultrapure hno3 all samples were stored at 4 c and were transported to the laboratory as soon as possible concentrations of anions including f cl no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were measured by an ion chromatograph dx 120 dionex concentrations of major cations were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icap6300 thermo and trace elements were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms 7500ce agilent technologies for most water samples ion imbalances were smaller than 5 hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes were measured using a picarro l2120 i analyzer picarro those isotopic ratios i e d h and 18o 16o were expressed relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water standard analytical precisions of Œ¥18o and Œ¥d were higher than 0 1 and 1 respectively 3 2 sediment sampling and analysis a rotary drilling machine was used to drill a borehole called hej hereafter from which 63 sediment samples were taken down to 470 m bls sediment samples were collected at intervals of 5 to 8 m and additional samples were collected at lithological boundaries after being taken from the borehole the sediment samples were wrapped with foil and were placed in polyethylene bags which were immediately sealed with pure n2 all samples were preserved at 4 c during transport to the laboratory and were stored at 20 c before analysis major components in sediments were determined by x ray fluorescence xrf spectroscopy two sediment samples from depths of 163 2 m and 430 5 m bls were selected for x ray diffraction xrd analysis eight sediment samples from the confined aquifers were selected to extract pore water pw in the lab using a high speed refrigerated centrifuge gl21m kaida china special teflon centrifuge tubes were made to extract the pw specifically approximately 25g of sediment was placed in a tube and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for one hour the obtained pws were analyzed for major anions and cations by ics 600 and icp aes respectively freeze dried sediments were mixed with deionized water at a ratio of 1 5 solid to liquid in a polyethylene centrifuge tube which was shaken at 150 rpm for 1 h for determination of sediment soluble components after the mixture was centrifuged at 5 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was filtered through 0 22 Œºm membrane filters to determine the major anion and cation concentrations subsamples were analyzed by an ion chromatograph dx 120 dionex and icp aes icap6300 thermo respectively 4 results 4 1 water general chemistry the major properties and hydrochemistry of the water samples are shown in tables1 and s1 in supplementary materials the results showed a wide variation in concentrations of major ions according to the piper plots the hydrochemical type of the ug was mainly ca na hco3 and of the cg was mainly na cl hco3 the xj hot spring water was of na so4 hco3 type and that of the zc hot spring water was na so4 cl fig 2 most values of tds were 800 mg l with a maximum of 1 350 mg l the ph values ranged between 6 84 and 8 05 in the ug and between 8 38 and 9 08 in the cg indicating weakly to moderately alkaline in the water samples fluoride concentrations ranged from 0 10 to 2 01 mg l in the ug from 0 66 to 5 67 mg l in the cg and from 9 63 to 16 7 mg l in the hot springs those concentrations were slightly lower than the f concentration in the yangbajan geothermal water in tibet wen et al 2013 approximately 2 86 75 and 100 of the ug cg and hot spring samples respectively had f concentrations higher than 1 5 mg l which was the maximal optimal level set by the world health organization who 1996 furthermore f concentrations in the cg increased from the southern part the recharge area to the northern part the discharge area of the basin fig 1 4 2 sediment geochemistry in borehole hej sediment lithology included mainly yellow sandy silt dark gray clay white gray sand dark gray sand and thick red clay fig 3 the xrd test results illustrated that minerals in sediment sample 1 taken at the depth of 163 2 m bls included mainly quartz 56 5 plagioclase 21 8 muscovite 13 8 and orthoclase 7 9 in sediment sample 2 taken at the depth of 430 5 m bls the minerals included mainly quartz 52 9 plagioclase 19 8 muscovite 14 3 orthoclase 9 6 and calcite 3 5 the xrf test results showed that the sediments were composed mainly of sio2 27 3 to 90 3 average 57 4 and al2o3 4 12 to 17 9 average 11 0 table s1 indicating that silicate minerals or aluminosilicate minerals were the major minerals in the sediments other components included fe2o3 1 13 to 7 69 average 4 30 cao 0 54 to 13 7 average 3 89 k2o 1 74 to 4 39 average 3 03 and mno2 0 02 to 0 22 average 0 09 the contents of water soluble f in the shallow sediments were lower than those in deep sediments fig 3 and table s1 the molar ratio of water soluble na ca was the lowest in the shallow sediments and increased with depth fig 3 the water soluble f and na ca molar ratio showed a similar trend with depth fig 3 a high water soluble ca2 contents average 487 mg kg were observed in shallow sandy silt in which the water soluble f contents were relatively low 0 85 to 2 22 mg kg average 1 36 mg kg fig 4 however the water soluble ca2 contents of deep sand samples and clay samples were relatively lower averaging 10 9 and 12 0 mg kg respectively whereas the water soluble f contents were relatively higher ranging from 1 97 to 8 79 mg kg in deep sand samples average 4 01 mg kg and from 2 04 to 11 9 mg kg in clay samples average 7 02 mg kg fig 4 all sediments used to extract pw were derived from the confined aquifers the results show that the f of pw had an average content of 2 44 mg l ranging from 1 01 to 6 09 mg l which was comparable to the values of confined water samples ranging from 0 66 to 5 67 mg l average 2 67 mg l table s1 4 3 stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥d although ug cg and hot spring samples had various Œ¥18o and Œ¥d values all samples lay on or near the global meteoric water line Œ¥d 8 Œ¥18o 10 craig 1961 and local meteoric water line Œ¥d 7 01 Œ¥18o 1 53 modified from huang et al 2015 fig 5 which showed their precipitation origin the wide ranges in Œ¥18o and Œ¥d reflected different residence times all cg samples had much lower Œ¥18o and Œ¥d values than the ug samples suggesting that the cg was recharged from higher altitude areas and had undergone a long period of water rock interactions qin et al 2005 batlle et al 2017 the high f groundwaters were distributed mainly in the bottom left of fig 5 and were slightly depleted in heavy isotopes higher f groundwaters generally had lower Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values two of the ug samples had Œ¥18o and Œ¥d values similar to those of the cg samples fig 5 which may have been due to the mixing of the cg into shallow groundwater 4 4 spatial variations in groundwater chemistry the values of Œ¥d and Œ¥18o showed a gradually decreasing trend along the flow path fig 6 a which was also observed within other confined aquifers along a groundwater flow path batlle et al 2017 dissolved ion concentrations varied with the groundwater flow toward the center of the basin fig 6 in the recharge area concentrations of ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were relatively high whereas concentrations of na were low fig 6b and 6c downstream ca2 and mg2 concentrations initially decreased 2 to 7 5 km and then remained relatively constant beyond 7 5 km fig 6b however na hco3 cl and so4 2 concentrations continuously increased after a slight decrease in the first part of the flow path 6 0 to 9 6 km fig 6c fluoride concentrations progressively increased from 0 30 mg l to 5 67 mg l along the flow path fig 6e the molar ratio of na ca increased from the recharge area to the discharge area ph values continuously increased from 7 63 to 9 07 along the groundwater flow path fig 6e however groundwater ca2 concentrations decreased along the flow path vertically major ion concentrations of samples from the deep confined aquifers were mostly lower than those from the shallow aquifers fig 7 however f concentration and the na ca molar ratio in deep groundwater were commonly higher than those in the unconfined aquifers ph values were higher in deep groundwater average 8 79 than in shallow groundwater average 7 50 high f groundwater samples 1 5 mg l were distributed mainly in the discharge areas of the confined aquifers in the study area the trend of f concentrations was similar to that of the molar ratios of na ca along the depths 5 discussion 5 1 influence of geothermal water spring waters sampled from xj and zc had high f concentrations 16 7 and 9 63 mg l respectively indicating that geothermal waters around the guide basin were enriched with dissolved f numerous studies have shown that f is generally enriched in geothermal fluids chae et al 2007 guo et al 2007 rafique et al 2009 wen et al 2013 furthermore geothermal water could strongly affect the freshwater groundwater located around geothermal fields dogdu and bayari 2002 aksoy et al 2009 li et al 2019 in this study ug and cg may have been affected by geothermal water at a regional scale boron b provided a good fingerprint to identify the influences of geothermal water on groundwater components maity et al 2011 there were positive correlations between concentrations of f and b in the ug r 0 86 p 0 01 and cg r 0 91 p 0 01 fig 8 a nevertheless concentrations of b in the hot springs average 8 550 Œºg l were approximately 40 times as high as those in the cg average 246 Œºg l and 50 times as high as those in the ug average 172 Œºg l fig 8a a positive correlation between f concentration and the b sr molar ratio in our studied groundwater samples was observed in the cg r 0 84 p 0 01 or ug r 0 77 p 0 01 fig 8b a similar trend regarding f concentration versus b sr molar ratio had been observed in geothermal groundwaters of the gonghe basin which is adjacent to the guide basin with the similar geothermal background zhang et al 2016 in case that the studied aquifers were massively invaded by geothermal waters ug and cg samples should be theoretically distributed along the mixing line of local meteoric water and geothermal water as shown in fig 8b however the groundwater samples were mostly located in the upper side of the mixing line being closer to the y axis fig 8b this indicates that in addition to the input of geothermal waters other sources must have contributed f to the groundwater especially the cg other contributions are discussed in sections 5 2 5 3 and 5 4 also heat transmission indirectly affects groundwater f concentrations this was evidenced by the positive correlation between groundwater f concentrations and temperature in the cg r 0 51 p 0 05 fig 9 the guide basin is tectonically controlled by the sinistral kunlun fault and the altyn tagh south qilian fault the aquifers are heated by magmatic sources beneath song et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 which results in a relatively high temperature of deep confined groundwater average 19 4 in the basin an increase in water temperature improves decomposition of organic matter in the confined aquifer and production of hco3 co3 2 and oh in groundwater which are conducive to f desorption via competitive adsorption jesu√üek et al 2013 matthijs et al 2013 rodriguez et al 2015 those are discussed further in section 5 3 5 2 influence of f containing mineral dissolution and precipitation the saturation indices of caco3 and caf2 in all groundwater samples were calculated with the u s geological survey s phreeqc version 3 3 5 parkhurst and appelo 2013 results show that the samples were mostly undersaturated with respect to caf2 but were oversaturated with respect to caco3 fig 10 dissolution of f containing minerals i e fluorite and fluorapatite is enhanced when ca2 is precipitated as caco3 resulting in the formation of f rich and ca2 poor groundwater the negative correlation between ca2 and f concentrations indicates that caf2 solubility limited a continuous increase in f concentration in the groundwater the hot springs were oversaturated with respect to caf2 which is consistent with the fact that geothermal water usually is in equilibrium with fluorite or is oversaturated with respect to fluorite ellis mahon 1964 chae et al 2007 rafique et al 2009 wen et al 2013 the solubility of fluorite in geothermal water can be affected by pressure ionic strength polymorphism and complexing capacity of the solution nordstrom jenne 1977 at high temperature co precipitation of fluorite was observed along with calcite during the experimental study by sar et al 2020 concentration of ca2 decreases when the water is oversaturated with respect to caco3 then f increases until saturating caf2 kim jeong 2005 precipitation of ca2 enhanced f release into groundwater as confirmed by sicalcite 0 in the majority of high f groundwater samples this is also supported by previous observations that f concentrations are higher in na cl or na hco3 type groundwaters but generally lower in ca hco3 and ca cl type groundwaters in other areas wang et al 2009 currell et al 2011 5 3 competitive adsorption desorption of f in cg with high ph and high hco3 concentration is another important factor promoting f enrichment in the guide basin higher f concentrations in groundwaters generally had ph values of 8 38 to 9 08 average 8 79 fig 11 a which were generally greater than the point of zero charge of most natural minerals 7 to 8 pham et al 2006 jeong et al 2013 on one hand negatively charged surfaces of sediments release exchangeable f into groundwater which is an important source of dissolved f in groundwater mcnab et al 2009 on the other hand under high ph conditions f released from the solid surfaces could be promoted via competitive adsorption between oh and f owing to their similar ionic radii jacks et al 2005 sreedevi et al 2006 kumar et al 2016 also there were positive correlations between hco3 and f concentrations in either cg r 0 79 p 0 01 and ug r 0 70 p 0 01 fig 11b this indicates that the presence of hco3 was conducive to f desorption via competitive adsorption numerous studies have shown that an increased hco3 concentration enhances f desorption from mineral surfaces into groundwater via competitive adsorption between negatively charged hco3 and negatively charged f wang et al 2009 pi et al 2015 co3 2 concentration in cg average 7 90 mg l is generally higher than that of ug 0 10 mg l and there is a positive correlation between co3 2 and f concentrations in cg fig s1 in figure supplementary the reason may be that co3 2 competes with f for adsorption sites on sediment surfaces which also causes f desorption into the groundwater alarc√≥n herrera et al 2013 wei et al 2015 virginia et al 2018 5 4 roles of hydrogeological settings unconfined aquifers comprise mainly gravel and sandy gravel occasionally interblended with thin clay layers this favors aquifer recharging via precipitation generally fresh precipitation has high concentrations of dissolved co2 which promotes the dissolution of carbonates i e camg co3 2 and caco3 and silicates i e plagioclase under this circumstance ca na hco3 type groundwater generally forms accordingly the source of ug salinity is mainly from the dissolution of silicates and carbonates fig 12 a confined aquifers comprise mainly sandstone and siltstone according to the core sediment data obtained previously by xu et al 1976 confined aquifers in the guide basin belong to typical fluvial lacustrine sedimentary strata xu et al 1976 found that aquifer sediments contain plentiful soluble evaporites mainly nacl and na2so4 the main chemical reactions occurring in confined aquifer included dissolution of evaporites and precipitation of calcite or dolomite fig 12a the evaporites i e nacl or na2so4 in the sediments tended to dissolve along the flow path as br cl molar ratio gradually decreased along with the groundwater flow fig 6d therefore in this study cl na and so4 2 concentrations generally showed increasing trends whereas ca2 and mg2 concentrations showed decreasing trends along the flow path fig 6b the decrease in ca sr molar ratio indicated that precipitation of ca2 occurred in the aquifer fig 6d the decreasing trends of ca2 and mg2 concentrations may have resulted from precipitation of calcite sicalcite 0 in most of the water samples and cation exchanges between ca2 mg2 and na decomposition of organic matter in confined aquifers produces much hco3 wang et al 2018 which associates with ca2 as caco3 precipitation this process enhances dissolution of f containing minerals i e fluorite and fluorapatite and subsequently contributes to groundwater f in addition all the studied samples were plotted around the y x line indicating that cation exchanges occurred in the confined aquifers fig 12b cation exchange interactions between ca2 mg2 and na result in a decrease in ca2 and mg2 concentrations and an increase in na concentration wang et al 2009 the decrease in ca2 concentrations promotes dissolution of f containing minerals i e fluorite and fluorapatite and thus leads to a release of free f from sediments into groundwater furthermore results of water soluble and pw in sediments all show that the aquifer sediment is the main source of dissolved f in groundwater concentrations of f were positively correlated with na ca ratios in cg r 0 88 p 0 01 fig 13 this observation is consistent with the results of laboratory studies gao et al 2007 currell et al 2011 showing that na rich and ca depleted solutions are conducive to f accumulation hence cation exchange could also have played a role in the release of f from the sediments also the long residence time estimated to range from 6 16 0 2 to 28 6 1 74 ka based on 14c data lang 2016 and closed hydrogeological conditions of the confined aquifers would have contributed to a continuous accumulation of f this study shows that geothermal water contributes to formation of high f groundwater directly via input of f and indirectly via heat transmission into aquifers promoting decomposition of organic matters and production of hco3 co3 2 and oh which are conducive to desorption of f into groundwater 6 conclusions high f groundwater in the guide basin occurs mainly in confined aquifers fluoride concentrations continuously increase along the groundwater flow path especially in the confined aquifer higher f groundwaters generally have lower Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values and lower concentrations of ca2 but higher temperatures ph hco3 and co3 2 water soluble f contents of sediment samples show an increasing trend with depth geothermal springs around the guide basin contribute to the formation of high f groundwaters directly by the input of geothermal waters with higher f concentrations and indirectly by heat transmission into aquifers at a regional scale precipitation of ca2 and cation exchange between ca2 and na enhance dissolution of f containing minerals i e fluorite and fluorapatite and increase f concentrations in groundwater slightly alkaline environments and increased hco3 concentrations promote the release of f from solid surfaces into groundwater via competitive adsorption closed hydrogeological conditions and long term water rock interactions in confined aquifers favor f accumulation in groundwater credit authorship contribution

4579,high fluoride f concentrations in groundwater affected by geothermal activity have been reported worldwide but the genesis mechanism is not adequately understood in this study 92 groundwater samples and 63 sediment samples were collected from the china s guide basin for chemical analyses and laboratory tests results indicate that groundwater f concentrations continuously increase along a flow path being consistent with trends of na and hco3 concentrations na ca molar ratio and ph values while ca2 concentrations show a decreasing trend water soluble f contents in sediments increase as the depth increases higher f groundwater samples generally have lower Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values than those of lower f samples the major hydrogeochemical processes controlling the formation of high f groundwater include precipitation of ca2 or cation exchange between ca2 and na or both which enhance dissolutions of f containing minerals and facilitate the release of f into groundwater slightly alkaline environments and increased hco3 and co3 2 concentrations favor desorption of f from solid surfaces into groundwater closed hydrogeological conditions and long term water rock interactions in confined aquifers accumulate f in groundwater exposed geothermal springs around the guide basin also contribute to the formation of high f groundwaters directly by the input of geothermal water and indirectly by heat transfer into aquifers at a regional scale which is a problem deserving further investigation keywords fluorine groundwater confined aquifer hydrogeochemical process guide basin 1 introduction fluoride f is a micronutrient essential for strengthening human skeletal tissues and teeth its absence in the diet limits tissue growth and impairs fertility however an excessive intake of f can cause dental or skeletal fluorosis and enzyme damage or even worse genetic damage premature aging mental retardation cancer or bone pathology ayenew 2008 chowdhury et al 2019 approximately 200 million people suffer from chronic endemic fluorosis in 28 developed and developing countries including india jacks et al 2005 vikas et al 2013 brazil souza et al 2013 the african continent rango et al 2010 pakistan rafique et al 2009 and china amini et al 2008 currell et al 2011 gao et al 2007 2019 guo wang 2005 wang et al 2009 in china over 41 million inhabitants suffered from dental fluorosis and 2 6 million from skeletal fluorosis in 1 325 counties ministry of health of china 2010 fluoride has been found to be rich in granites alkali granites and hydrothermal deposits ayoob gupta 2006 when f containing minerals including fluorite caf2 sellaite mgf2 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f cryolite na3alf6 villiaumite naf and topaz al2 sio4 f2 and their weathering products contact groundwater f is gradually released and accumulated in the groundwater via water rock interactions su et al 2015 fluorite has generally been considered as the dominant source of groundwater f shah danishwar 2003 geothermal waters frequently contain high f concentrations such as from 17 9 to 19 6 mg l in tibet s yabajing geothermal field and up to 50 mg l in the thermal waters of yellowstone national park such concentrations may cause chemical and thermal contamination of surface and subsurface waters in adjacent areas guo et al 2007 aksoy et al 2009 deng et al 2011 wen et al 2013 other processes that form high f groundwater include na ca cation exchanges and or precipitation of caco3 under favorable conditions during which ca2 is removed from groundwater and the dissolution of caf2 is promoted meenakshi et al 2004 chae et al 2007 tirumalesh et al 2007 gomez et al 2009 liu et al 2013 furthermore under alkaline conditions oh tends to mobilize f from the surfaces of clay minerals and amorphous fe al oxyhydroxides into groundwater due to their similar charges and radii saxena ahmed 2003 guo et al 2012 su et al 2013 li et al 2015 additionally anthropogenic activities such as applications of phosphate fertilizers and discharges of sewage sludge increase dissolved f concentrations in groundwater li et al 2019 however to our knowledge no systematic investigations have been done to explore hydrogeochemical processes governing the mobilization and accumulation of f in confined groundwater influenced by geothermal system fluorosis is a widespread problem in the guide basin in western china during the last few decades many domestic and irrigation wells in the guide basin that contain high f have been used as drinking water sources for several thousand people wen et al 2013 previous studies have indicated that anthropogenic activity is not the reason for the high f in the groundwater especially in the deep groundwater due to small population small amount of animal husbandry weak agricultural activity and high elevations of the recharge area in the basin shi et al 2010 li et al 2012 qiao et al 2021 the occurrence of high f groundwater has been linked to geothermal waters and the geological setting plays an important role in controlling f enrichment migration and transformation shi et al 2010 li et al 2012 however the fundamental mechanism leading to high f groundwater in the guide basin is still not fully understood therefore this study selected the guide basin to show the major geochemical processes controlling f enrichment in groundwater at the scale of a basin the specific objectives are 1 to characterize the hydrogeochemical properties of high f groundwater 2 to investigate the lithological features of the aquifer sediments containing high contents of f and 3 to unravel the main processes controlling the regional distributions of groundwater f in confined aquifers in the guide basin 2 study area the guide basin is in the upper reach of the yellow river in qinghai province fig 1 and is drained by the yellow river and its tributaries yan et al 2005 qiao et al 2021 it has a semi arid continental climate song et al 2008 with an annual average temperature of 7 to 8 precipitation of 252 mm evaporation of 2 000 mm and humidity of 49 the strata beneath the guide basin include the paleocene oligocene xining group miocene pliocene guide group and quaternary deposits from the bottom to the top the guide group forms a wide and gradually tilting syncline from the south and north toward the yellow river and a southwest symmetrical confined aquifer with a dip toward the east zhang et al 2016 the pliocene group is further divided into three subgroups the early n2 1 the middle n2 2 and the later n2 3 the n2 2 is composed mainly of light gray mudstone sandy mudstone and green gray lenticular sandstone and forms several confined aquifers the high f groundwater occurs mainly in those confined aquifers the quaternary unconfined aquifers occur at depths of 100 m below land surface bls and comprise mainly well rounded and well sorted gravel and sand approximately 12 to 32 m thick xu et al 1976 detailed information about the hydrogeological profile across the study area has been provided in our previous study wang et al 2018 the confined aquifers are recharged mainly from surrounding mountains and overlying unconfined aquifers the yellow river is the final discharge area of groundwater in the basin the unconfined aquifers are recharged from precipitation surrounding mountains and the riverbed of a tributary of the yellow river 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analysis ninety two groundwater samples were collected from the basin including 70 samples from unconfined groundwater ug 20 samples from confined groundwater cg and 2 samples from hot springs xj and zc fig 1 eight wells distributed along a groundwater flow path approximately perpendicular to the contours of a confined water head were used to represent the inferred groundwater flow direction fig 1 the first two wells contained water from unconfined aquifers and were in the recharge area 0 to 2 km whereas the next four wells and the last two wells bored water from confined aquifers and were in a subsurface passage area 6 to 9 6 km and discharge area 9 6 to 10 6 km respectively groundwater was sampled from each well after pumping for over 20 min until the redox potential oxidation reduction potential orp ph water temperature t and total dissolved solids tds had stabilized during sampling orp electrical conductivity ec ph t and tds were monitored in situ in an inline flow cell using a portable multiparameter meter hi9828 hanna instruments the instrument was calibrated using standard solutions before use alkalinity was measured with a digital titrator model 16900 hach with a bromocresol green methyl red indicator for analyzing Œ¥d and Œ¥18o 2 ml brown glass bottles were filled without headspace with samples all other samples were filtered through 0 22 Œºm pore size membrane filters in the field samples for analyzing anions were stored in 10 ml polyethylene tubes without acidification samples for analyzing major cations and trace elements were collected in 125 ml polyethylene bottles and were acidified to ph 2 by adding 6 m ultrapure hno3 all samples were stored at 4 c and were transported to the laboratory as soon as possible concentrations of anions including f cl no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were measured by an ion chromatograph dx 120 dionex concentrations of major cations were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icap6300 thermo and trace elements were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms 7500ce agilent technologies for most water samples ion imbalances were smaller than 5 hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes were measured using a picarro l2120 i analyzer picarro those isotopic ratios i e d h and 18o 16o were expressed relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water standard analytical precisions of Œ¥18o and Œ¥d were higher than 0 1 and 1 respectively 3 2 sediment sampling and analysis a rotary drilling machine was used to drill a borehole called hej hereafter from which 63 sediment samples were taken down to 470 m bls sediment samples were collected at intervals of 5 to 8 m and additional samples were collected at lithological boundaries after being taken from the borehole the sediment samples were wrapped with foil and were placed in polyethylene bags which were immediately sealed with pure n2 all samples were preserved at 4 c during transport to the laboratory and were stored at 20 c before analysis major components in sediments were determined by x ray fluorescence xrf spectroscopy two sediment samples from depths of 163 2 m and 430 5 m bls were selected for x ray diffraction xrd analysis eight sediment samples from the confined aquifers were selected to extract pore water pw in the lab using a high speed refrigerated centrifuge gl21m kaida china special teflon centrifuge tubes were made to extract the pw specifically approximately 25g of sediment was placed in a tube and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for one hour the obtained pws were analyzed for major anions and cations by ics 600 and icp aes respectively freeze dried sediments were mixed with deionized water at a ratio of 1 5 solid to liquid in a polyethylene centrifuge tube which was shaken at 150 rpm for 1 h for determination of sediment soluble components after the mixture was centrifuged at 5 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was filtered through 0 22 Œºm membrane filters to determine the major anion and cation concentrations subsamples were analyzed by an ion chromatograph dx 120 dionex and icp aes icap6300 thermo respectively 4 results 4 1 water general chemistry the major properties and hydrochemistry of the water samples are shown in tables1 and s1 in supplementary materials the results showed a wide variation in concentrations of major ions according to the piper plots the hydrochemical type of the ug was mainly ca na hco3 and of the cg was mainly na cl hco3 the xj hot spring water was of na so4 hco3 type and that of the zc hot spring water was na so4 cl fig 2 most values of tds were 800 mg l with a maximum of 1 350 mg l the ph values ranged between 6 84 and 8 05 in the ug and between 8 38 and 9 08 in the cg indicating weakly to moderately alkaline in the water samples fluoride concentrations ranged from 0 10 to 2 01 mg l in the ug from 0 66 to 5 67 mg l in the cg and from 9 63 to 16 7 mg l in the hot springs those concentrations were slightly lower than the f concentration in the yangbajan geothermal water in tibet wen et al 2013 approximately 2 86 75 and 100 of the ug cg and hot spring samples respectively had f concentrations higher than 1 5 mg l which was the maximal optimal level set by the world health organization who 1996 furthermore f concentrations in the cg increased from the southern part the recharge area to the northern part the discharge area of the basin fig 1 4 2 sediment geochemistry in borehole hej sediment lithology included mainly yellow sandy silt dark gray clay white gray sand dark gray sand and thick red clay fig 3 the xrd test results illustrated that minerals in sediment sample 1 taken at the depth of 163 2 m bls included mainly quartz 56 5 plagioclase 21 8 muscovite 13 8 and orthoclase 7 9 in sediment sample 2 taken at the depth of 430 5 m bls the minerals included mainly quartz 52 9 plagioclase 19 8 muscovite 14 3 orthoclase 9 6 and calcite 3 5 the xrf test results showed that the sediments were composed mainly of sio2 27 3 to 90 3 average 57 4 and al2o3 4 12 to 17 9 average 11 0 table s1 indicating that silicate minerals or aluminosilicate minerals were the major minerals in the sediments other components included fe2o3 1 13 to 7 69 average 4 30 cao 0 54 to 13 7 average 3 89 k2o 1 74 to 4 39 average 3 03 and mno2 0 02 to 0 22 average 0 09 the contents of water soluble f in the shallow sediments were lower than those in deep sediments fig 3 and table s1 the molar ratio of water soluble na ca was the lowest in the shallow sediments and increased with depth fig 3 the water soluble f and na ca molar ratio showed a similar trend with depth fig 3 a high water soluble ca2 contents average 487 mg kg were observed in shallow sandy silt in which the water soluble f contents were relatively low 0 85 to 2 22 mg kg average 1 36 mg kg fig 4 however the water soluble ca2 contents of deep sand samples and clay samples were relatively lower averaging 10 9 and 12 0 mg kg respectively whereas the water soluble f contents were relatively higher ranging from 1 97 to 8 79 mg kg in deep sand samples average 4 01 mg kg and from 2 04 to 11 9 mg kg in clay samples average 7 02 mg kg fig 4 all sediments used to extract pw were derived from the confined aquifers the results show that the f of pw had an average content of 2 44 mg l ranging from 1 01 to 6 09 mg l which was comparable to the values of confined water samples ranging from 0 66 to 5 67 mg l average 2 67 mg l table s1 4 3 stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥d although ug cg and hot spring samples had various Œ¥18o and Œ¥d values all samples lay on or near the global meteoric water line Œ¥d 8 Œ¥18o 10 craig 1961 and local meteoric water line Œ¥d 7 01 Œ¥18o 1 53 modified from huang et al 2015 fig 5 which showed their precipitation origin the wide ranges in Œ¥18o and Œ¥d reflected different residence times all cg samples had much lower Œ¥18o and Œ¥d values than the ug samples suggesting that the cg was recharged from higher altitude areas and had undergone a long period of water rock interactions qin et al 2005 batlle et al 2017 the high f groundwaters were distributed mainly in the bottom left of fig 5 and were slightly depleted in heavy isotopes higher f groundwaters generally had lower Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values two of the ug samples had Œ¥18o and Œ¥d values similar to those of the cg samples fig 5 which may have been due to the mixing of the cg into shallow groundwater 4 4 spatial variations in groundwater chemistry the values of Œ¥d and Œ¥18o showed a gradually decreasing trend along the flow path fig 6 a which was also observed within other confined aquifers along a groundwater flow path batlle et al 2017 dissolved ion concentrations varied with the groundwater flow toward the center of the basin fig 6 in the recharge area concentrations of ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were relatively high whereas concentrations of na were low fig 6b and 6c downstream ca2 and mg2 concentrations initially decreased 2 to 7 5 km and then remained relatively constant beyond 7 5 km fig 6b however na hco3 cl and so4 2 concentrations continuously increased after a slight decrease in the first part of the flow path 6 0 to 9 6 km fig 6c fluoride concentrations progressively increased from 0 30 mg l to 5 67 mg l along the flow path fig 6e the molar ratio of na ca increased from the recharge area to the discharge area ph values continuously increased from 7 63 to 9 07 along the groundwater flow path fig 6e however groundwater ca2 concentrations decreased along the flow path vertically major ion concentrations of samples from the deep confined aquifers were mostly lower than those from the shallow aquifers fig 7 however f concentration and the na ca molar ratio in deep groundwater were commonly higher than those in the unconfined aquifers ph values were higher in deep groundwater average 8 79 than in shallow groundwater average 7 50 high f groundwater samples 1 5 mg l were distributed mainly in the discharge areas of the confined aquifers in the study area the trend of f concentrations was similar to that of the molar ratios of na ca along the depths 5 discussion 5 1 influence of geothermal water spring waters sampled from xj and zc had high f concentrations 16 7 and 9 63 mg l respectively indicating that geothermal waters around the guide basin were enriched with dissolved f numerous studies have shown that f is generally enriched in geothermal fluids chae et al 2007 guo et al 2007 rafique et al 2009 wen et al 2013 furthermore geothermal water could strongly affect the freshwater groundwater located around geothermal fields dogdu and bayari 2002 aksoy et al 2009 li et al 2019 in this study ug and cg may have been affected by geothermal water at a regional scale boron b provided a good fingerprint to identify the influences of geothermal water on groundwater components maity et al 2011 there were positive correlations between concentrations of f and b in the ug r 0 86 p 0 01 and cg r 0 91 p 0 01 fig 8 a nevertheless concentrations of b in the hot springs average 8 550 Œºg l were approximately 40 times as high as those in the cg average 246 Œºg l and 50 times as high as those in the ug average 172 Œºg l fig 8a a positive correlation between f concentration and the b sr molar ratio in our studied groundwater samples was observed in the cg r 0 84 p 0 01 or ug r 0 77 p 0 01 fig 8b a similar trend regarding f concentration versus b sr molar ratio had been observed in geothermal groundwaters of the gonghe basin which is adjacent to the guide basin with the similar geothermal background zhang et al 2016 in case that the studied aquifers were massively invaded by geothermal waters ug and cg samples should be theoretically distributed along the mixing line of local meteoric water and geothermal water as shown in fig 8b however the groundwater samples were mostly located in the upper side of the mixing line being closer to the y axis fig 8b this indicates that in addition to the input of geothermal waters other sources must have contributed f to the groundwater especially the cg other contributions are discussed in sections 5 2 5 3 and 5 4 also heat transmission indirectly affects groundwater f concentrations this was evidenced by the positive correlation between groundwater f concentrations and temperature in the cg r 0 51 p 0 05 fig 9 the guide basin is tectonically controlled by the sinistral kunlun fault and the altyn tagh south qilian fault the aquifers are heated by magmatic sources beneath song et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 which results in a relatively high temperature of deep confined groundwater average 19 4 in the basin an increase in water temperature improves decomposition of organic matter in the confined aquifer and production of hco3 co3 2 and oh in groundwater which are conducive to f desorption via competitive adsorption jesu√üek et al 2013 matthijs et al 2013 rodriguez et al 2015 those are discussed further in section 5 3 5 2 influence of f containing mineral dissolution and precipitation the saturation indices of caco3 and caf2 in all groundwater samples were calculated with the u s geological survey s phreeqc version 3 3 5 parkhurst and appelo 2013 results show that the samples were mostly undersaturated with respect to caf2 but were oversaturated with respect to caco3 fig 10 dissolution of f containing minerals i e fluorite and fluorapatite is enhanced when ca2 is precipitated as caco3 resulting in the formation of f rich and ca2 poor groundwater the negative correlation between ca2 and f concentrations indicates that caf2 solubility limited a continuous increase in f concentration in the groundwater the hot springs were oversaturated with respect to caf2 which is consistent with the fact that geothermal water usually is in equilibrium with fluorite or is oversaturated with respect to fluorite ellis mahon 1964 chae et al 2007 rafique et al 2009 wen et al 2013 the solubility of fluorite in geothermal water can be affected by pressure ionic strength polymorphism and complexing capacity of the solution nordstrom jenne 1977 at high temperature co precipitation of fluorite was observed along with calcite during the experimental study by sar et al 2020 concentration of ca2 decreases when the water is oversaturated with respect to caco3 then f increases until saturating caf2 kim jeong 2005 precipitation of ca2 enhanced f release into groundwater as confirmed by sicalcite 0 in the majority of high f groundwater samples this is also supported by previous observations that f concentrations are higher in na cl or na hco3 type groundwaters but generally lower in ca hco3 and ca cl type groundwaters in other areas wang et al 2009 currell et al 2011 5 3 competitive adsorption desorption of f in cg with high ph and high hco3 concentration is another important factor promoting f enrichment in the guide basin higher f concentrations in groundwaters generally had ph values of 8 38 to 9 08 average 8 79 fig 11 a which were generally greater than the point of zero charge of most natural minerals 7 to 8 pham et al 2006 jeong et al 2013 on one hand negatively charged surfaces of sediments release exchangeable f into groundwater which is an important source of dissolved f in groundwater mcnab et al 2009 on the other hand under high ph conditions f released from the solid surfaces could be promoted via competitive adsorption between oh and f owing to their similar ionic radii jacks et al 2005 sreedevi et al 2006 kumar et al 2016 also there were positive correlations between hco3 and f concentrations in either cg r 0 79 p 0 01 and ug r 0 70 p 0 01 fig 11b this indicates that the presence of hco3 was conducive to f desorption via competitive adsorption numerous studies have shown that an increased hco3 concentration enhances f desorption from mineral surfaces into groundwater via competitive adsorption between negatively charged hco3 and negatively charged f wang et al 2009 pi et al 2015 co3 2 concentration in cg average 7 90 mg l is generally higher than that of ug 0 10 mg l and there is a positive correlation between co3 2 and f concentrations in cg fig s1 in figure supplementary the reason may be that co3 2 competes with f for adsorption sites on sediment surfaces which also causes f desorption into the groundwater alarc√≥n herrera et al 2013 wei et al 2015 virginia et al 2018 5 4 roles of hydrogeological settings unconfined aquifers comprise mainly gravel and sandy gravel occasionally interblended with thin clay layers this favors aquifer recharging via precipitation generally fresh precipitation has high concentrations of dissolved co2 which promotes the dissolution of carbonates i e camg co3 2 and caco3 and silicates i e plagioclase under this circumstance ca na hco3 type groundwater generally forms accordingly the source of ug salinity is mainly from the dissolution of silicates and carbonates fig 12 a confined aquifers comprise mainly sandstone and siltstone according to the core sediment data obtained previously by xu et al 1976 confined aquifers in the guide basin belong to typical fluvial lacustrine sedimentary strata xu et al 1976 found that aquifer sediments contain plentiful soluble evaporites mainly nacl and na2so4 the main chemical reactions occurring in confined aquifer included dissolution of evaporites and precipitation of calcite or dolomite fig 12a the evaporites i e nacl or na2so4 in the sediments tended to dissolve along the flow path as br cl molar ratio gradually decreased along with the groundwater flow fig 6d therefore in this study cl na and so4 2 concentrations generally showed increasing trends whereas ca2 and mg2 concentrations showed decreasing trends along the flow path fig 6b the decrease in ca sr molar ratio indicated that precipitation of ca2 occurred in the aquifer fig 6d the decreasing trends of ca2 and mg2 concentrations may have resulted from precipitation of calcite sicalcite 0 in most of the water samples and cation exchanges between ca2 mg2 and na decomposition of organic matter in confined aquifers produces much hco3 wang et al 2018 which associates with ca2 as caco3 precipitation this process enhances dissolution of f containing minerals i e fluorite and fluorapatite and subsequently contributes to groundwater f in addition all the studied samples were plotted around the y x line indicating that cation exchanges occurred in the confined aquifers fig 12b cation exchange interactions between ca2 mg2 and na result in a decrease in ca2 and mg2 concentrations and an increase in na concentration wang et al 2009 the decrease in ca2 concentrations promotes dissolution of f containing minerals i e fluorite and fluorapatite and thus leads to a release of free f from sediments into groundwater furthermore results of water soluble and pw in sediments all show that the aquifer sediment is the main source of dissolved f in groundwater concentrations of f were positively correlated with na ca ratios in cg r 0 88 p 0 01 fig 13 this observation is consistent with the results of laboratory studies gao et al 2007 currell et al 2011 showing that na rich and ca depleted solutions are conducive to f accumulation hence cation exchange could also have played a role in the release of f from the sediments also the long residence time estimated to range from 6 16 0 2 to 28 6 1 74 ka based on 14c data lang 2016 and closed hydrogeological conditions of the confined aquifers would have contributed to a continuous accumulation of f this study shows that geothermal water contributes to formation of high f groundwater directly via input of f and indirectly via heat transmission into aquifers promoting decomposition of organic matters and production of hco3 co3 2 and oh which are conducive to desorption of f into groundwater 6 conclusions high f groundwater in the guide basin occurs mainly in confined aquifers fluoride concentrations continuously increase along the groundwater flow path especially in the confined aquifer higher f groundwaters generally have lower Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values and lower concentrations of ca2 but higher temperatures ph hco3 and co3 2 water soluble f contents of sediment samples show an increasing trend with depth geothermal springs around the guide basin contribute to the formation of high f groundwaters directly by the input of geothermal waters with higher f concentrations and indirectly by heat transmission into aquifers at a regional scale precipitation of ca2 and cation exchange between ca2 and na enhance dissolution of f containing minerals i e fluorite and fluorapatite and increase f concentrations in groundwater slightly alkaline environments and increased hco3 concentrations promote the release of f from solid surfaces into groundwater via competitive adsorption closed hydrogeological conditions and long term water rock interactions in confined aquifers favor f accumulation in groundwater credit authorship contribution
