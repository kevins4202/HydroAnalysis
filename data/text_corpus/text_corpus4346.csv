horizontal vertical swelling amplification coefficients displacement amplitudes displacement ratio 1 introduction generally in natural ocean environments ocean floor is usually covered with marine sediment layer with finite thickness a natural marine sediment is no doubt an assemblage of solid particles forming a matrix or skeleton pores of which are filled with one or more fluids such a medium is viewed as a porous solid consisting of solid skeleton and pore fluid s however it has been broadly reported that some of the natural sedimentary materials are partially saturated for example in an oil reservoir the solid constituent viscous fluid oil and inviscid gas natural gas occur together therefore numerous types of porous media exist and almost limitless applications and uses are there the possibility of swelling property cannot be ruled out completely in any porous medium this property in any porous solid is occurred due to the shear response provided by the liquid constituents present in the medium so without any doubt we can consider a natural marine sediment layer as a swelling poroelastic layer to understand the nature of the porous media several theories have been developed by the researchers in most of the mixture theories the complete information about the interactional terms is not available and there is no systematic way to obtain these terms even if pore structure is available swelling of porous medium is one of the most important property which has hardly been accounted in mixture theories eringen 1994 developed a continuum theory of swelling porous elastic soils as a continuum theory of mixture for porous elastic solids filled with viscous liquid and gas eringen s theory of swelling porous media is different from the theory of porous media developed by tuncay and corapcioglu 1997 garg and nayfeh 1986 wei and muraleetharan 2002a b lo et al 2005 etc in the sense of net shear response of the porous medium in these theories shear response of the porous medium is provided by the solid matrix only while in eringen s theory it is provided not only by the solid matrix but also by the liquid constituent the present mathematical model is based on the eringen 1994 continuum theory of swelling poroelastic solid this theory provides a fundamental basis for the treatment of various problems in the field of swelling oil exploration slurries and consolidation problems the material properties of the ocean floor are classified on the basis of wave propagation study carried out at the water ocean floor interface the actual feedback about the ocean floor is deduced on basis of wave reflection signal the study of seismic ground motions plays an important role around and beneath the foundations of offshore structures such as breakwater pipeline and tunnel these issues are important to analyze the geoacoustic properties of the seabed sediments and its subbottom structure and for exploring oil gas and water present in the rocks of ocean floor hence the problem of wave propagation at ocean floor is of great importance practically as well as theoretically in the various scientific fields such as hydrogeology engineering geology seismology petroleum geophysics and ocean engineering therefore to study the wave propagation reflection and refraction multi directional motions i e horizontal and vertical motion in the ocean floor great efforts have been done by various authors including yang 2001 wang et al 2013 corredor et al 2014 lyu et al 2014 ye and wang 2015 chen et al 2015 2017 2018 feng et al 2016 2017 kumari et al 2017 barak et al 2018 li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 etc yang 2001 analyzes the influences of water saturation on the horizontal and vertical motions in a layered soil bedrock structure he noticed that even a minute decrease in water saturation from full saturation may cause a remarkable difference between the vertical and horizontal components at the ground surface he observed that one may need to take carefully the saturation conditions in the interpretation of field observations corredor et al 2014 studied the effects of layer thickness on reflection and transmission coefficients of a single layer sandwiched between two dissimilar poroelastic media they also discussed several special cases lyu et al 2014 studied the reflection and transmission of wave at water porous sediment with a double porosity substrate without taking lff into account they found that the presence of double porosity substrate significantly affect the reflected wave in overlying water chen et al 2015 studied the reflection of acoustic waves from the elastic seabed with an overlying gassy poroelastic layer they studied the influences of poroelastic layer thickness wave frequency incident direction and liquid saturation on reflection characteristics respectively chen et al 2017 studied the horizontal and vertical motion at surface of a gassy ocean sediment layer induced by obliquely incident s v wave the expression of horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes are derived which can be considered as a function of saturation degree incident angle wave frequency and layer thickness the influences of saturation degree incident angle wave frequency and layer thickness on the two dimensional ground motion are discussed later chen et al 2018 studied the horizontal and vertical motion at surface of a gassy ocean sediment layer induced by obliquely incident p wave this problem is essential for the interpretation of field observations on seismic ground motions of the seabed the theoretical formulation is presented for the computation of horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes in terms of saturation degree incident angle wave frequency and layer thickness li et al 2018 studied the seismic ground motion in the free field in the partially saturated porous layer overlying bedrock they found that the presence of a gas phase in the partially saturated porous layer has a significant influence on the seismic ground motions recently chen et al 2020 developed an analytical model to study the soil displacements pore pressures and effective stresses in a nearly saturated porous seabed on the basis of biot s theory they adopted the two dynamic approaches fully dynamic fd and partially dynamic pd to analyze the influence of inertial terms of pore fluid a remarkable impact of slight unsaturation has been observed on the propagation characteristics of p 1 and p 2 waves in seabed until now to the best of our knowledge no investigation have been launched to study the reflection and transmission of plane waves at the plane interface between seawater and the ocean floor comprising an upper swelling porous layer and underlying elastic seabed the existence of such model cannot be ruled out in nature the main objective of studying the horizontal and vertical motions is to explore the possibility of wave propagation and to observe the effects of swelling on them in the present study the mixtures theory developed by eringen 1994 as applicable to swelling porous media is employed to study the horizontal and vertical motions at the surface of swelling poroelastic layer in coupled system the analytical expressions of horizontal and vertical displacements at the surface of swelling porous solid are evaluated for both incidences i e p and s v waves the impermeable boundary conditions at the interface of swelling porous solid and elastic solid are considered the closed form analytical expressions for reflection and transmission coefficients are derived theoretically for appropriate boundary conditions finally a theoretical formulation is presented for the computation of horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes which can be considered as a function of incident angle wave frequency layer thickness and swelling property of the medium 2 theoretical formulation in this study we consider a coupled system coupled system means

particular problem according to the wu et al 1990 the fluid flow impedance across the interface z 0 between the overlying sea water and swelling poroelastic layer is difficult to determine therefore in the present problem we have explored the perfectly sealed surface pores across the interface z 0 between the overlying sea water and swelling poroelastic layer in case of fully sealed pores

matlab based on tomar and goyal 2013 the relevant value of material parameters of swelling porous solid are given in table 1 7 numerical discussion 7 1 results for an incident p wave 7 1 1 effect of layer thickness h three different cases of layer thickness are considered fig 2 illustrates the influence of the thickness of overlying sediment on the amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it can be seen that the effect of layer thickness on the displacement amplitude strongly depends on the angle of incidence the effect of thickness on the vertical displacement amplitude is larger at θ 0 0 and no impact is observed at θ 0 90 the horizontal displacement amplitude decreases with the increase in layer thickness the impact of h is not visible on the horizontal displacement amplitude at both normal and grazing incidences the vertical displacement amplitude decreases with increase in both layer thickness and incident direction the significant impact of h is seen on amplitude of horizontal displacement for θ 0 0 90 therefore these trends suggest that the variation in layer thickness has a significant effect on the ground motion amplitudes moreover the variational pattern of these curve is almost consistent with fig 4 of chen et al 2018 fig 3 displays that the amplification coefficients of vertical and horizontal displacements are strongly decreases with the increase in layer thickness a larger impact of incident direction is observed on the amplification coefficient of horizontal displacement as compared to the amplification coefficient of vertical displacement fig 4 presents the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 of swelling poroelastic layer it is indicated that there is no impact of h on the displacement ratio for θ 0 0 18 it is clearly visible that displacement ratio with layer thickness is intensive beyond θ 0 18 the displacement ratio decreases with the increase in layer thickness a remarkable influence of h is seen at grazing incidence this curve is almost consistent with fig 5 of chen et al 2018 7 1 2 effect of frequency ω three different cases of wave frequency are considered fig 5 displays the effect of wave frequency on the amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it is clearly visible that the effect of wave frequency on the displacement amplitudes strongly depends on the angle of incidence the effect of wave frequency on the vertical displacement amplitude is remarkable at θ 0 0 and no impact is observed at θ 0 90 the horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes increases with increase in wave frequency i e decreasing of wavelength the horizontal displacement amplitude has a zero value at the normal incidence and increases with θ 0 and it attains a maximum value around θ 0 40 especially for ω 2 π 0 5 khz and it decreases to zero at the grazing incidence the vertical displacement amplitude approaches maximum value at θ 0 0 then it continuously decreases to zero at θ 0 90 the significant impact of ω is seen on amplitude of horizontal displacement for θ 0 0 90 therefore these trends suggest that the wave frequency significantly influenced the ground motion amplitudes fig 6 displays that the amplification coefficients of horizontal and vertical displacements are strongly decreases with the increase in wave frequency the behavior of vertical amplification coefficient is almost linear except for ω 2 π 0 01 khz the significant impact of ω is clearly visible on both amplification coefficients of vertical and horizontal displacements over the entire range of incident angle the influence of wave frequency is visible on both amplification coefficients at both normal and grazing incidences fig 7 represents the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 of swelling poroelastic layer it is indicated that there is no impact of ω on the displacement ratio for θ 0 0 10 it is clearly visible that displacement ratio with ω are intensive beyond θ 0 10 the displacement ratio increases with the increase in incident direction except for ω 2 π 0 01 khz a remarkable impact of frequency is noticed at grazing incidence these ratios decreases with the increase in frequency beyond θ 0 15 fig 8 represents the amplitude of horizontal displacement at the surface of seabed z 0 and bottom of seabed z h as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies the amplitude of horizontal displacement fluctuate periodically with layer thickness for ω 2 π 0 01 0 05 khz at the surface of seabed z 0 and bottom of seabed z h the behavior of this amplitude is almost linear with h at both z 0 and z h the amplitude of horizontal displacement at the surface of seabed z 0 is strongly increases with the increase in ω over the entire range of h finally a significant influence of ω is noticed on the amplitude of horizontal displacement at both z 0 and z h fig 9 displays the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z h of swelling poroelastic layer as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies it is indicated that the displacement ratio fluctuate irregularly with increase of layer thickness for ω 2 π 0 1 0 05 khz it is clearly visible that displacement ratio with layer thickness is intensive in the entire range of θ 0 the fluctuations of the displacement ratio is less intensive when the frequency is low fig 10 displays the results for amplification coefficient of horizontal and vertical displacement i e u x u z as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies these coefficients are shown to be irregular with the increase of thickness especially for ω 2 π 0 05 0 1 khz it is also worth noting that the fluctuations of these coefficients with layer thickness are less intensive when ω 2 π 0 01 khz a significant effect of ω is shown on these coefficients over the entire range of h 7 1 3 effect of incident direction θ 0 two different values of incident direction are considered fig 11 displays the effect of incident directions on the amplitude of horizontal displacement at the surface of seabed z 0 and bottom of seabed z h as a function of layer thickness h the incident angle is set to be 35 and 45 it is noticed that the amplitude of horizontal displacement is increased with the increase in incident direction over the entire range of h at z 0 in comparison amplitude of horizontal displacement at both surface i e z 0 and z h almost bear a similar trend for both 35 and 45 moreover the behavior of amplitude of horizontal displacement is almost periodic at both z 0 and z h fig 12 illustrates the displacement ratio i e u x u z at the bottom of seabed z h the impact of incident direction is not visible on the displacement ratio for h 5 7 the variational trend with h is almost alike for both 35 and 45 finally a significant impact of incident direction is noticed on u x u z fig 13 displays amplification coefficient of horizontal i e u x z 0 u x z h and vertical displacement i e u z z 0 u z z h as a function of layer thickness h for two different incident directions the amplification coefficients of vertical and horizontal displacements fluctuate irregularly for both θ 0 35 and θ 0 45 in the entire range of h the variational trend of u x z 0 u x z h and u z z 0 u z z h are almost unlike in the entire range of h a significant influence of incident direction is observed on both 7 1 4 effect of swelling parameter μ ν the phenomenon of swelling in the considered model is occurred due to the presence of coefficients λ ν and μ ν in the equations of motion these coefficients are related to the macroscopic viscosity of liquid phase the non zero values of these coefficients make the macroscopic velocity profile of fluid flow non uniform and hence causes swelling in the porous medium the effect of swelling property on the wave propagation characteristics is represented by the variation in μ ν goyal and tomar 2015 three different cases of swelling parameter μ ν are considered fig 14 illustrates the influence of swelling parameter i e viscosity coefficient on the amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it can be seen that the effect of swelling parameter on the displacement amplitude strongly depends on the angle of incidence the effect of swelling parameter on the vertical displacement amplitude is larger at θ 0 0 and no impact is observed at θ 0 90 the horizontal displacement amplitude decreases with the increase in swelling parameter the impact of μ ν is not visible on the horizontal displacement amplitude at both normal and grazing incidences the vertical displacement amplitude decreases with increase in both swelling parameter and incident direction the significant impact of μ ν is seen on amplitude of horizontal displacement for θ 0 0 90 thus the swelling phenomena plays an important role on the ground motion amplitudes when porous matrix contains highly viscous fluid fig 15 illustrates the influence of swelling parameter i e viscosity coefficient on the amplification coefficients of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it can be seen that the effect of swelling parameter on the amplification coefficients strongly depends on the angle of incidence and viscosity coefficient a remarkable influence of μ ν is observed on both amplification coefficients in the entire range of θ 0 these coefficients decreases with the increase in incident direction beyond θ 0 30 for all values of μ ν also both amplification coefficients are weakened when porous matrix contains highly viscous fluid fig 16 presents the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 of swelling poroelastic layer it is indicated that there is no impact of μ ν on the displacement ratio for θ 0 0 40 a little influence of viscosity coefficient is seen on the displacement ratio beyond θ 0 40 the displacement ratio decreases with the increase in viscosity coefficient 7 2 results for an incident s v wave 7 2 1 effect of layer thickness h three different cases of layer thickness are considered fig 17 illustrates the influence of the thickness of overlying sediment on the amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it can be seen that the effect of layer thickness on the displacement amplitudes strongly depends on the angle of incidence and thickness of layer the significant impact of h is seen on amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements these displacement amplitudes are decreased with the increase in layer thickness the impact of h is not seen on both displacement amplitudes at both normal and grazing incidences therefore these trend suggest that the variation in layer thickness has a significant effect on the ground motion amplitudes fig 18 displays that the amplification coefficients of horizontal i e u x z 0 u x z h and vertical displacement i e u z z 0 u z z h as a function of incident direction θ 0 a remarkable impact of h is seen on amplification coefficients for θ 0 0 90 the variational trend of amplification coefficient of horizontal and vertical displacement is opposite to each other except h 30 m fig 19 represents the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 of swelling poroelastic layer it is indicated that there is no impact of h on the displacement ratio for θ 0 0 22 it is clearly visible that displacement ratio with h is intensive beyond θ 0 22 the displacement ratio decreases with the increase in h for θ 0 32 a remarkable impact of h is noticed at grazing incidence 7 2 2 effect of frequency ω three different cases of wave frequency are considered fig 20 displays the effect of wave frequency on the amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it is clearly visible that the effect of wave frequency on the displacement amplitudes strongly depend on the angle of incidence the effect of wave frequency on these displacement amplitudes is not observed at both normal and grazing incidences the horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes have almost alike behavior with respect to both wave frequency and incident direction these displacement amplitudes increases with the increase in frequency for θ 0 0 58 therefore these trend suggest that the wave frequency significantly influenced the ground motion amplitudes fig 21 displays that the amplification coefficients of horizontal displacement is strongly increased with the increase in incident direction θ 0 the vertical amplification coefficient has a significant value at both normal and grazing incidences for all values of ω while horizontal amplification coefficient has zero value at normal incidence and significant value at grazing incidence the amplification coefficient of vertical displacement decreases with the increase in frequency the significant impact of ω is clearly visible on both amplification coefficients of vertical and horizontal displacements fig 22 represents the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 of swelling poroelastic layer a remarkable impact of frequency is noticed at grazing incidence but no impact of frequency is observed at normal incidence these ratios decrease with the increase in frequency beyond θ 0 20 displacement ratio shows constant behavior for ω 2 π 0 5 khz θ 0 18 and for ω 2 π 0 1 khz θ 0 45 fig 23 represents the amplitude of horizontal displacement at the surface of seabed z 0 and bottom of seabed z h as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies the amplitude of horizontal displacement fluctuates almost periodically with layer thickness for ω 2 π 0 1 0 05 khz at both z 0 and z h moreover for ω 2 π 0 01 khz the amplitude of horizontal displacement at the bottom and surface of seabed shows almost linear behavior with h it increases with increase in frequency for both surfaces i e z 0 and z h finally a significant influence of ω is noticed on the amplitude of horizontal displacement at both z 0 and z h fig 24 displays the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z h of swelling poroelastic layer as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies it is indicated that the displacement ratio fluctuates irregularly with increase of layer thickness a remarkable impact of frequency is observed in the entire range of h fig 25 displays the results for amplification coefficient of horizontal and vertical displacement i e u x u z as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies these coefficients are shown to be fluctuate irregularly with the increase of thickness it is also worth noting that the fluctuations of these coefficients with layer thickness are less intensive when ω 2 π 0 01 khz a significant effect of ω is shown on these coefficients over the entire range of h 7 2 3 effect of incident direction θ 0 two different values of incident direction are considered fig 26 displays the effect of incident direction on the amplitude of horizontal displacement at the surface of seabed z 0 and bottom of seabed z h as a function of layer thickness h the incident angle is set to be 35 and 45 it is noticed that the amplitude of horizontal displacement fluctuates irregularly over the entire range of h at both the surfaces i e z 0 and z h in comparison amplitude of horizontal displacement at surface z 0 is weakened with the increase of h at the surface z 0 the behavior of amplitude of horizontal displacement is almost periodic at bottom of seabed over the entire range of h the amplitude of horizontal displacement at bottom of seabed is stronger than the surface of seabed finally a significant impact of incident direction is observed at both the surfaces i e z 0 and z h fig 27 illustrates the displacement ratio i e u x u z at the bottom of seabed z h it is observed that the displacement ratio fluctuates irregularly over the entire range of h for both incident directions 35 and 45 a significant impact of incident direction is noticed on u x u z fig 28 displays amplification coefficient of horizontal and vertical displacements i e u x u z as a function of layer thickness h for two different incident directions the amplification coefficient of vertical displacement is weakened with the increase in θ o in the entire range of h these amplification coefficients fluctuate irregularly in the entire range of h for both incident directions 35 and 45 a significant impact of incident direction is noticed on both amplification coefficients 7 2 4 effect of swelling parameter μ ν fig 29 displays the effect of swelling parameter i e viscosity coefficient on the amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it can be seen that no effect of swelling parameter is observed on these displacement amplitudes beyond θ 0 59 also these are decreased with the increase in swelling parameter for θ 0 0 60 the impact of μ ν is not visible on the horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes at both normal and grazing incidences thus in the presence of highly viscous fluid swelling phenomena significantly influences the ground motion fig 30 shows the influence of swelling parameter i e viscosity coefficient on the amplification coefficients of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it can be seen that the effect of swelling parameter on the amplification coefficients strongly depends on the angle of incidence and viscosity coefficient a remarkable influence of μ ν is observed on both amplification coefficients in the entire range of θ 0 amplification coefficient of horizontal displacement increases with the increase in incident direction up to θ 0 39 beyond that its behavior remains constant also both amplification coefficients are weakened in the presence of highly viscous fluid in porous matrix fig 31 presents the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 of swelling poroelastic layer it is indicated that there is no impact of μ ν on the displacement ratio for θ 0 0 30 after that it decreases with the increase in viscosity coefficient after θ 0 45 its behavior is constant with respect to the incident direction for all values of μ ν the displacement ratio decreases with the increase in viscosity coefficient after θ 0 30 8 conclusions the tool most commonly used in earthquake engineering is the site evaluation technique generally known as h v it is

21730,the horizontal and vertical motions at the surface of swelling poroelastic layer in coupled system are investigated coupled system means water swelling porous sediment elastic solid substrate system the analytical expressions of horizontal and vertical displacements at the surface of swelling porous solid are evaluated for both incidences i e p and s v waves the closed form analytical expressions for reflection and transmission coefficients are derived theoretically for appropriate boundary conditions the horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes are derived analytically in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients the horizontal and vertical motion of swelling poroelastic layer is examined through analyzing three key factors amplification coefficients displacement amplitudes and displacement ratio the impacts of wave frequency thickness of swelling poroelastic layer incident direction and swelling property of the medium are examined on these three key factor numerically numerical results indicate that the surface motion strongly depends on wave frequency thickness of layer swelling property of the medium and incident direction keywords horizontal vertical swelling amplification coefficients displacement amplitudes displacement ratio 1 introduction generally in natural ocean environments ocean floor is usually covered with marine sediment layer with finite thickness a natural marine sediment is no doubt an assemblage of solid particles forming a matrix or skeleton pores of which are filled with one or more fluids such a medium is viewed as a porous solid consisting of solid skeleton and pore fluid s however it has been broadly reported that some of the natural sedimentary materials are partially saturated for example in an oil reservoir the solid constituent viscous fluid oil and inviscid gas natural gas occur together therefore numerous types of porous media exist and almost limitless applications and uses are there the possibility of swelling property cannot be ruled out completely in any porous medium this property in any porous solid is occurred due to the shear response provided by the liquid constituents present in the medium so without any doubt we can consider a natural marine sediment layer as a swelling poroelastic layer to understand the nature of the porous media several theories have been developed by the researchers in most of the mixture theories the complete information about the interactional terms is not available and there is no systematic way to obtain these terms even if pore structure is available swelling of porous medium is one of the most important property which has hardly been accounted in mixture theories eringen 1994 developed a continuum theory of swelling porous elastic soils as a continuum theory of mixture for porous elastic solids filled with viscous liquid and gas eringen s theory of swelling porous media is different from the theory of porous media developed by tuncay and corapcioglu 1997 garg and nayfeh 1986 wei and muraleetharan 2002a b lo et al 2005 etc in the sense of net shear response of the porous medium in these theories shear response of the porous medium is provided by the solid matrix only while in eringen s theory it is provided not only by the solid matrix but also by the liquid constituent the present mathematical model is based on the eringen 1994 continuum theory of swelling poroelastic solid this theory provides a fundamental basis for the treatment of various problems in the field of swelling oil exploration slurries and consolidation problems the material properties of the ocean floor are classified on the basis of wave propagation study carried out at the water ocean floor interface the actual feedback about the ocean floor is deduced on basis of wave reflection signal the study of seismic ground motions plays an important role around and beneath the foundations of offshore structures such as breakwater pipeline and tunnel these issues are important to analyze the geoacoustic properties of the seabed sediments and its subbottom structure and for exploring oil gas and water present in the rocks of ocean floor hence the problem of wave propagation at ocean floor is of great importance practically as well as theoretically in the various scientific fields such as hydrogeology engineering geology seismology petroleum geophysics and ocean engineering therefore to study the wave propagation reflection and refraction multi directional motions i e horizontal and vertical motion in the ocean floor great efforts have been done by various authors including yang 2001 wang et al 2013 corredor et al 2014 lyu et al 2014 ye and wang 2015 chen et al 2015 2017 2018 feng et al 2016 2017 kumari et al 2017 barak et al 2018 li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 etc yang 2001 analyzes the influences of water saturation on the horizontal and vertical motions in a layered soil bedrock structure he noticed that even a minute decrease in water saturation from full saturation may cause a remarkable difference between the vertical and horizontal components at the ground surface he observed that one may need to take carefully the saturation conditions in the interpretation of field observations corredor et al 2014 studied the effects of layer thickness on reflection and transmission coefficients of a single layer sandwiched between two dissimilar poroelastic media they also discussed several special cases lyu et al 2014 studied the reflection and transmission of wave at water porous sediment with a double porosity substrate without taking lff into account they found that the presence of double porosity substrate significantly affect the reflected wave in overlying water chen et al 2015 studied the reflection of acoustic waves from the elastic seabed with an overlying gassy poroelastic layer they studied the influences of poroelastic layer thickness wave frequency incident direction and liquid saturation on reflection characteristics respectively chen et al 2017 studied the horizontal and vertical motion at surface of a gassy ocean sediment layer induced by obliquely incident s v wave the expression of horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes are derived which can be considered as a function of saturation degree incident angle wave frequency and layer thickness the influences of saturation degree incident angle wave frequency and layer thickness on the two dimensional ground motion are discussed later chen et al 2018 studied the horizontal and vertical motion at surface of a gassy ocean sediment layer induced by obliquely incident p wave this problem is essential for the interpretation of field observations on seismic ground motions of the seabed the theoretical formulation is presented for the computation of horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes in terms of saturation degree incident angle wave frequency and layer thickness li et al 2018 studied the seismic ground motion in the free field in the partially saturated porous layer overlying bedrock they found that the presence of a gas phase in the partially saturated porous layer has a significant influence on the seismic ground motions recently chen et al 2020 developed an analytical model to study the soil displacements pore pressures and effective stresses in a nearly saturated porous seabed on the basis of biot s theory they adopted the two dynamic approaches fully dynamic fd and partially dynamic pd to analyze the influence of inertial terms of pore fluid a remarkable impact of slight unsaturation has been observed on the propagation characteristics of p 1 and p 2 waves in seabed until now to the best of our knowledge no investigation have been launched to study the reflection and transmission of plane waves at the plane interface between seawater and the ocean floor comprising an upper swelling porous layer and underlying elastic seabed the existence of such model cannot be ruled out in nature the main objective of studying the horizontal and vertical motions is to explore the possibility of wave propagation and to observe the effects of swelling on them in the present study the mixtures theory developed by eringen 1994 as applicable to swelling porous media is employed to study the horizontal and vertical motions at the surface of swelling poroelastic layer in coupled system the analytical expressions of horizontal and vertical displacements at the surface of swelling porous solid are evaluated for both incidences i e p and s v waves the impermeable boundary conditions at the interface of swelling porous solid and elastic solid are considered the closed form analytical expressions for reflection and transmission coefficients are derived theoretically for appropriate boundary conditions finally a theoretical formulation is presented for the computation of horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes which can be considered as a function of incident angle wave frequency layer thickness and swelling property of the medium 2 theoretical formulation in this study we consider a coupled system coupled system means

and goyal 2013 have already investigated the propagation characteristics phase velocities and attenuation coefficients of plane harmonic waves in swelling porous solid they found that five three

respectively the propagation of two shear waves are identified with pairs ψ j v β j j 1 2 are named as s 1 s 2 waves respectively expressions for the velocities of five waves are given in tomar and

particular problem according to the wu et al 1990 the fluid flow impedance across the interface z 0 between the overlying sea water and swelling poroelastic layer is difficult to determine therefore in the present problem we have explored the perfectly sealed surface pores across the interface z 0 between the overlying sea water and swelling poroelastic layer in case of fully sealed pores boundary surface discharge of fluid is not allowed out of aggregate hence for fully sealed surface pores restrictions are implemented on the displacement components of fluids particles the relevant

problem a plane harmonic wave p or s v propagates with velocity v 0 and angular frequency ω through a linear elastic solid is incident at the boundary z h with an angle of incidence θ 0 consequently two reflected waves i e p and s v are generated in linear elastic solid i e z h ten five transmitted p 1 p 2 p 3 s 1 s 2 waves and five reflected p 1 p 2 p 3 s 1 s 2 waves are generated in the swelling poroelastic layer i e h z 0 and as water is not able to withstand shear stress only one transmitted wave i e p is observed in the overlying water i e 0 z 4 1 displacement potentials in this work wave motion is considered in x z plane as the particle motions is identified by displacement potentials therefore the wave fields in the different regions in terms of displacement potentials can be expressed as follows 1 in seawater z 0 12 ϕ w a t p e x p ι l t p x m t p z ω t where a t p represents the amplitude of transmitted p wave the parameters l t p ω sin θ 0 v 0 and m t p ω 1 v w 2 sin

the vertical displacement amplitude is larger at θ 0 0 and no impact is observed at θ 0 90 the horizontal displacement amplitude decreases with the increase in layer thickness the impact of h is not visible on the horizontal displacement amplitude at both normal and grazing incidences the vertical displacement amplitude decreases with increase in both layer thickness and incident direction the significant impact of h is seen on amplitude of horizontal displacement for θ 0 0 90 therefore these trends suggest that the variation in layer thickness has a significant effect on the ground motion amplitudes moreover the variational pattern of these curve is almost consistent with fig 4 of chen et al 2018 fig 3 displays that the amplification coefficients of vertical and horizontal displacements are strongly decreases with the increase in layer thickness a larger impact of incident direction is observed on the amplification coefficient of horizontal displacement as compared to the amplification coefficient of vertical displacement fig 4 presents the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 of swelling poroelastic layer it is indicated that there is no impact of h on the displacement ratio for θ 0 0 18 it is clearly visible that displacement ratio with layer thickness is intensive beyond θ 0 18 the displacement ratio decreases with the increase in layer thickness a remarkable influence of h is seen at grazing incidence this curve is almost consistent with fig 5 of chen et al 2018 7 1 2 effect of frequency ω three different cases of wave frequency are considered fig 5 displays the effect of wave frequency on the amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it is clearly visible that the effect of wave frequency on the displacement amplitudes strongly depends on the angle of incidence the effect of wave frequency on the vertical displacement amplitude is remarkable at θ 0 0 and no impact is observed at θ 0 90 the horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes increases with increase in wave frequency i e decreasing of wavelength the horizontal displacement amplitude has a zero value at the normal incidence and increases with θ 0 and it attains a maximum value around θ 0 40 especially for ω 2 π 0 5 khz and it decreases to zero at the grazing incidence the vertical displacement amplitude approaches maximum value at θ 0 0 then it continuously decreases to zero at θ 0 90 the significant impact of ω is seen on amplitude of horizontal displacement for θ 0 0 90 therefore these trends suggest that the wave frequency significantly influenced the ground motion amplitudes fig 6 displays that the amplification coefficients of horizontal and vertical displacements are strongly decreases with the increase in wave frequency the behavior of vertical amplification coefficient is almost linear except for ω 2 π 0 01 khz the significant impact of ω is

coefficients at both normal and grazing incidences fig 7 represents the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 of swelling poroelastic layer it is indicated that there is no impact of ω on the displacement ratio for θ 0 0 10 it is clearly visible that displacement ratio with ω are intensive beyond θ 0 10 the displacement ratio increases with the increase in incident direction except for ω 2 π 0 01 khz a remarkable impact of frequency is noticed at grazing incidence these ratios decreases with the increase in frequency beyond θ 0 15 fig 8

horizontal displacement fluctuate periodically with layer thickness for ω 2 π 0 01 0 05 khz at the surface of seabed z 0 and bottom of seabed z h the behavior of this amplitude is almost linear with h at both z 0 and z h the amplitude of horizontal displacement at the surface of seabed z 0 is strongly increases with the increase in ω over the entire range of h finally a significant influence of ω is noticed on the amplitude of horizontal displacement at both z 0 and z h fig 9 displays the results for ratios of horizontal and vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z h of swelling poroelastic layer as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies it is indicated that the displacement ratio fluctuate irregularly with increase of layer thickness for ω 2 π 0 1 0 05 khz it is clearly visible that displacement ratio with layer thickness is intensive in the entire range of θ 0 the fluctuations of the displacement ratio is less intensive when the frequency is low fig 10 displays the results for amplification coefficient of horizontal and vertical displacement i e u x u z as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies these coefficients are shown to be irregular with the increase of thickness especially for ω 2 π 0 05 0 1 khz it is also worth noting that the fluctuations of these coefficients with layer thickness are less intensive when ω 2 π 0 01 khz a significant effect of ω is shown on these coefficients over the entire range of h 7 1 3 effect of incident direction θ 0 two different values of incident direction

fluctuate irregularly for both θ 0 35 and θ 0 45 in the entire range of h the variational trend of u x z 0 u x z h and u z z 0 u z z h are almost unlike in the entire range of h a significant influence of incident direction is observed on both 7 1 4 effect of swelling parameter μ ν the phenomenon of swelling in the considered model is occurred due to the presence of coefficients λ ν and μ ν in the equations of motion these coefficients are related to the macroscopic viscosity of liquid phase the non zero values of these coefficients make the macroscopic velocity profile of fluid flow non uniform and hence causes swelling in the porous medium the effect of swelling property on the wave propagation characteristics is represented by the variation in μ ν goyal and tomar 2015 three different cases of swelling parameter μ ν are considered fig 14 illustrates the influence of swelling parameter i e viscosity coefficient on the amplitude of horizontal and vertical displacements

visible on the horizontal displacement amplitude at both normal and grazing incidences the vertical displacement amplitude decreases with increase in both swelling parameter and incident direction the significant impact of μ ν is seen on amplitude of horizontal displacement for θ 0 0 90 thus the swelling phenomena plays an important role on the ground motion amplitudes when porous matrix contains highly viscous fluid fig 15 illustrates the influence of swelling parameter i e viscosity coefficient on the amplification coefficients of horizontal and vertical displacements versus the incident direction θ 0 it can be seen that the effect of swelling parameter on the amplification coefficients strongly depends on the angle of incidence and viscosity coefficient a remarkable influence of μ ν

incidences the horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes have almost alike behavior with respect to both wave frequency and incident direction these displacement amplitudes increases with the increase in frequency for θ 0 0 58 therefore these trend suggest that the wave frequency significantly influenced the ground motion amplitudes fig 21 displays that the amplification coefficients of horizontal displacement is strongly increased with the increase in incident direction θ 0 the vertical amplification coefficient has a significant value at both normal and grazing incidences for all values of ω while horizontal amplification coefficient has zero value at normal incidence and significant value at grazing incidence the amplification coefficient of vertical displacement decreases with the increase in frequency the significant impact of ω is clearly visible on both amplification coefficients of vertical and horizontal displacements fig 22 represents the results for ratios of

is observed in the entire range of h fig 25 displays the results for amplification coefficient of horizontal and vertical displacement i e u x u z as a function of layer thickness h for three different wave frequencies these coefficients are shown to be fluctuate irregularly with the increase of thickness it is also worth noting that the fluctuations of these coefficients with layer thickness are less intensive when ω 2 π 0 01 khz a significant effect of ω is shown on these coefficients over the entire range of h 7 2 3 effect of incident direction θ 0 two different values of incident direction are considered fig 26 displays the effect of incident direction on the amplitude of horizontal displacement at the surface of seabed z 0 and bottom of seabed z h as a function of layer thickness h the incident angle is set to be 35 and 45 it is noticed that the amplitude of horizontal displacement fluctuates irregularly over the entire range of h at both the surfaces i e z 0 and z h in comparison amplitude of horizontal displacement at surface z 0 is weakened with the increase of h at the surface z 0 the behavior of amplitude of horizontal displacement is almost periodic at bottom of seabed over the entire range of h the amplitude of horizontal displacement at bottom of seabed is stronger than the surface of seabed finally a significant impact of incident direction is

viscosity and ignoring the significant sloshing behaviour at the liquid free surface are the main sources of differences between experimental and theoretical results lee et al 2011 came up with a new type of liquid damper that adopts the working methodology of both tlcd and tld in combination a novel design methodology was developed min et al 2014 for a two way liquid damper to control the vibration of high rise buildings caused due to wind action it consisted of tlcd in which liquid oscillates inside the vertical columns and tsd in which sloshing of liquid takes place the liquid oscillation and sloshing took place in two orthogonal directions respectively konar and ghosh 2012 first studied the sloshing effects on the control efficiency of liquid column vibration absorbers lcvas but the sloshing phenomenon was modelled mechanically using a spring mass dashpot system hence the simultaneous and coupled effects of liquid sloshing and liquid oscillation got ignored di matteo et al 2015 used an equivalent mechanical system to model liquid sloshing effect inside tlcd considering only the first mode di matteo et al 2015 performed experiments on tlcd and for the first time observed sloshing mode in the vertical columns of the tlcd while performing experiments they focused on tlcds without orifices as to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the tlcd in order to establish only geometrical dependency the objective of the present work is to study the effects of liquid sloshing phenomenon on the dynamic properties of tlcd before utilizing it as a passive damper in controlling structural vibration henceforth the review of literature covers two broad areas of research work control efficiency of tlcd and numerical modelling of liquid sloshing the preceding paragraphs give a brief review of the efficiency of tlcd as a passive damper whereas the following presents a concise review of liquid sloshing and vof methodology graham and rodriguez 1952

container subjected to external acceleration the attempt to predict sloshed induced dynamics applying linear theories based on the potential formulation was reported in abramson 1966 ibrahim 2005 faltinsen et al 2003 2000 considered a 3d mode coupled solution to sloshing but their study was limited to rectangular containers only faltinsen and timokha 2009 presented sloshing with marine applications while the focus was on ship tanks their study also included the nonlinear multimodal method and an introduction to cfd including several experimental results hirt and nichols 1981 developed the vof method which was proved to be more reliable and proficient than other methods for handling complex free boundary configurations numerical and experimental studies akyildiz and erdem ünal 2006 akyildiz and ünal 2005 performed to notice pressure deviations and 3d effects of liquid sloshing in a moving partially filled rectangular tank vof technique was used to study non linear behaviour as well as the damping characteristics of liquid sloshing liu and lin 2008 developed a numerical wave tank to study 3d non linear liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank the large eddy simulation les approach was adopted to model the turbulence effect whereas the second order accurate vof method was used for tracking broken free surface eswaran et al 2009 analyzed sloshing waves for

liquid sloshing setup to evaluate the pressure developed on the walls of a square tank and the free surface displacement of water from the undisturbed level godderidge et al 2009 investigated the effect of fluid compressibility on pressure developed due to resonant and non resonant sloshing in a rectangular container rebouillat and liksonov 2010 reviewed recent studies on the fluid structure interaction fsi in partially filled liquid containers describing the importance of fsi for numerous applications such as the airspace industry rockets satellites road and naval transportation their paper particularly focused on the sloshing phenomenon and on the numerical schemes used to find the sloshing wave amplitude frequency pressure exerted on the walls and the effect of sloshing on the container s stability thiagarajan et al 2011 presented the fundamentals of linear potential theory for sloshing motions in a 2d rectangular tank and provided an explanation about the inconsistencies published in the existing literature numerical simulations were also performed to find slosh induced pressure and free surface movement under sway motion having a small amplitude ansari et al 2011 and gómez goñi et al 2013 simulated the sloshing in containers consisting of two liquid phases with different densities while the later talked about the effect of density difference and came up with the idea of single phase fluid modelling jung et al 2012 performed a numerical study to explore the effect of vertical baffle height in controlling sloshing in a moving 3d rectangular tank partially filled with incompressible liquid the researchers simulated the viscous two phase flow using the vof method elahi et al 2015 developed a 2d numerical model taking into account liquid free surface displacement liquid viscosity and surface tension to study liquid sloshing phenomenon using the vof method oxtoby et al 2015 described a semi implicit vof free surface modelling methodology for violent free surface motion an efficient solution method was proposed to capture highly dynamic liquid gas sloshing scenarios on arbitrary unstructured meshes xue et al 2017 experimentally investigated the efficiency of providing four types of the baffles to reduce sloshing pressure under a wide range of forcing frequencies wang et al 2017 took the benefits of both the boundary element bem and finite element methods fem to have an insight on the impacts of placing different baffles on oscillating liquid in partly filled rigid toroidal tank frosina et al 2018 performed experimental and numerical analyses to understand the violent sloshing phenomenon inside vehicle fuel tank sanapala et al 2018 investigated the dynamics of liquid sloshing in a partially filled rectangular tank by

mathematical formulation 2 1 modelling using finite element method the partially filled u shaped container used as a computational fluid domain with different types of boundaries in a rectangular coordinate system is shown in fig 1 the linearized governing equation of motion of inviscid incompressible and irrotational fluid flow may be written considering pressure as a field variable biswal et al 2006 2003 mitra and sinhamahapatra 2008 1 2 p x z t 0 i n ω where the entire fluid domain is represented by ω and the 2d spatial discretization is done with 4 noded bi linear quadrilateral elements the suitable conditions for different boundaries indicated in fig 1 are as follows fluid structure interface boundary γ i if the container wall vibrates with an acceleration u n in the outward normal direction the condition alongside fluid structure interface may be written as 2 p n ρ u n free surface boundary γ f the dynamic and kinematic conditions must satisfy at the free surface for the traction to be continuous and the particle should remain on the free surface assuming linear water wave theory the free surface boundary condition may be written as 3 p ρ g η p n p g bottom boundary γ b the container base is considered as rigid so at the bottom portion of the container 4 p n 0 where ρ and g are the fluid density and gravitational acceleration n is defined as the outward normal direction at different boundaries as the container wall is assumed as rigid the structural acceleration u n becomes the ground acceleration z t single dot and double dot over any variable represent the single and double derivative of that variable with respect to time using galerkin s approach the residual form of the governing differential eq 1 for the liquid may be written as 5 ω w 2 p d ω 0 where w is the weight function rewriting eq 5 we get 6 ω n t 2 p d ω 0 where n is the interpolation function performing integration by parts and applying green gauss divergence theorem eq 6 is transformed to 7 ω n t n p d ω γ n t p n d γ now imposing the boundary conditions stated in eqs 2 4 eq 7 is rewritten as 8 ω n t n p d ω 1 g γ f n t n p d γ γ i n t ρ f u n d γ eq 8 can be written as

platform for different modes are reported in section 4 for a detailed understanding of the fe formulation of fluid the reader is referred to the work of maity and bhattacharyya 2003 1999 and mandal and maity 2016 2015 2 2 modelling using volume of fluid method the numerical simulations are carried out on the ansys fluent platform a general purpose cfd package in solving any cfd problem it is required to solve navier stokes ns equations and the continuity equation with different boundary conditions after applying reynolds averaging technique for turbulence modelling the ns equations can be written as 13 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 14 ρ u i t u j u i x j p x i μ 2 u i x j 2 x j ρ u i u j q i f i where u is the velocity vector in rectangular coordinate system ρ u i u j is the reynolds stresses and μ is the dynamic viscosity q i and f i represent the body force due to gravity and momentum source respectively the momentum source basically depends on the liquid density and the external acceleration provided by the user resulting a unit of k g m 2 s 2 the reynolds stresses depend on the mean velocity gradients through eq 15 can be estimated by choosing any turbulence model the standard k epsilon turbulence model with enhanced wall function launder and spalding 1972 is adopted in the present study 15 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k δ i j where μ t is the turbulent viscosity according to the boussinesq hypothesis the interrelation between turbulent kinetic energy k and it s dissipation rate ε as given in eqs 16 18 can be found in rhee 2005 16 k 1 2 u x u x u y u y u z u z 17 ε υ u i x j u i x j u j x i 18 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε the bars above the variables represent the time averaged quantity the transport equations for k and ε can be found in existing literature as written below 19 ρ k t ρ u j k x j τ i j u i x j ρ ε x j μ μ t σ k k x j 20 ρ ε t ρ u j ε x j c 1 ε ε k τ i j u i x j c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j where c μ c 1 ε c 2 ε σ k and σ ε are the empirical constants for the standard k ε model the values of c μ 0 09 c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 σ k 1 00 and σ ε 1 30 are chosen for the simulation study as already mentioned earlier the vof method has gained attention over the years in capturing the free surface movement of the sloshing liquid the reader is referred to the study of thiagarajan et al 2011 to have detailed knowledge and a clear understanding of the vof methodology the volume fraction of the n t h fluid is represented by β n after solving the continuity equation for the volume fraction of phases the interface between the phases can be located the equation of the volume fraction for the n t h phase can be written as 21 β n t v β n 0 eq 21 is solved only for the secondary phase and hence the volume fraction for the primary phase is obtained using the following equation 22 n 1 m β n 1 where m is the total no of phases the solution of each momentum equation gives the velocity field for the whole fluid domain that is shared between the phases the fluid properties such as density and viscosity for a control volume can be estimated as the summation of the volume fractions of the component phases using the relation ρ n 1 m β n ρ n the effect of surface tension is excluded from the present work whereas the no slip condition on the tank walls is imposed as a boundary condition 3 experimental study 3 1 experimental setup tests are carried out on the container and the structural system separately as well as on the combined configuration in the shaking table test laboratory at the indian institute of technology kharagpur the three axes six dof shaking table system is capable of bearing a load up to 500 kg having a table dimension of 1 m 1 m the max permissible acceleration velocity frequency and base amplitude that can be given as input are 2g 0 9 m s 50 hz and 150 mm respectively the experimental setup that is developed to study the dynamics of fluid flow consists of a u shaped container also termed as liquid column damper lcd partially filled with coloured water a video recording camera which can capture video with a frame rate of 30 fps in 1920 1080 resolution and one wooden scale attached to column 2 of the container the motion of the interface is recorded this video is then converted to digital images using image processing toolbox in matlab and the time histories of the interface movement are obtained the container is made of perspex material having specific inner dimensions as shown in fig 2 b it is to be noted that when it comes to experiments the free surface is called as the interface since it is really an air water interface not an approximate model the container is filled with coloured water to a height of 290 mm measured from the base the theoretical natural frequency of the liquid column obtained using ω n 2 g l e is 0 8 hz l e 0 78 m is the total liquid column length measured along the centre line of the liquid lcd is subjected to a horizontal harmonic excitation x t x 0 cos ω t where x 0 and ω are the amplitude and circular frequency of external excitation having values assigned as 0 01 0 02 m and 5 026 rad s respectively high rise structures generally have well separated modes of vibration with a low fundamental frequency the authors have aimed at suppressing a particular mode of vibration specially the fundamental mode that helps to make the sdof approximation the primary structure as shown in fig 3 a is a single story frame made with a removable mass system placed at the top the structural mass comprising three steel plates of 6 mm thick and two perspex sheets of 8 mm thick that result in a total mass of 86 7 kg is supported on four mild steel ms flats of 20 mm 8 mm each having a length of 1 2 m from the fixed base free vibration tests on the primary structure are performed by giving a small perturbation and the average value of the natural frequency is obtained as 0 8 hz 3 2 measurement of natural frequency in the following section results obtained from the experiment are presented which include a series of free and forced vibration tests the free vibration response in terms of non dimensional displacement of the oscillating liquid column is shown in fig 4 the data are given in table 1 a the movement of the interface under oscillatory motion is shown in fig 4 the response plots confirm the decaying motion of the interface the damping can be generated mainly due to friction at the boundary layers liquid height kinematic viscosity and the dimensions of the tank immensely influence the generated damping force after obtaining the dynamic parameters of the lcd as given in table 1 b a discrepancy between experimental and theoretical natural frequency is found which signifies a prominent impact that the sloshing liquid creates on the dynamic characteristics of lcd the observed mode shapes of liquid sloshing are shown in figs 5 and 6 the experimental snapshot sequences of the forced vibration response of liquid inside the lcd are shown in figs 7 and 8 under harmonic excitations the selection of time instants is arbitrary 3 3 effectiveness of lcd in controlling structural vibration due to harmonic load a comparison of experimentally obtained acceleration response of the structure with and without lcd subjected to harmonic excitation of frequency 0 8 hz is plotted in fig 9 a which notifies a reduction of 129 37 and 66 8 in the root mean square r m s value and the max value respectively of the acceleration response of the structure the psd functions for the structural acceleration responses are evaluated without damper and with lcd and plotted in fig 9 b it is observed that without lcd the structure shows a dominant peak at the natural frequency in the case of combined system two such peaks moved on either side of that single peak with a considerable reduction in amplitude is noticed which also signifies the tuning effect of the damper system while performing experimental studies as the time step is chosen to be 0 0625 s the plotted power spectral density functions psdfs is not smooth in the case of numerical simulation the optimum values of lcd parameters are generally preferred in this present experimental work the scope of providing the same is limited henceforth the shifting of frequencies and the tuning effect of lcd that are observed are approximate but acceptable 3 4 effectiveness of lcd in controlling structural vibration due to earthquake load to study the robustness of lcd in controlling structural vibration further investigation is carried out by performing experiments while the primary structure is subjected to scaled earthquake acceleration records six such records are selected randomly and the details are given in table 2 the structural acceleration response is obtained with and without the lcd and is plotted in fig 10 effectiveness of lcd in controlling earthquake induced vibration is noticed for a wide frequency range of earthquake excitations 4 numerical study 4 1 computational modelling approach the 2d schematic of the present 3d computational model that represents the two phase air water gas liquid system is shown in fig 11 a structured grid is generated to mesh the computational domain which consists of 12 000 hexahedral cells the density and viscosity of air and water considered in this study are 1 225 998 2 k g m 3 and 0 0000179 0 00103 k g m s respectively computational parameters are chosen based on the author s knowledge gained from existing literature for transient formulation the first order accurate backward implicit scheme is used modified high resolution interface capturing hric scheme is used to obtain the face fluxes for all cells including those near the free surface a non iterative time advancement scheme is used with the specific solvers for spatial discretization as suggested in the literature rhee 2005 except for second order upwind scheme for momentum non iterative relaxation factors for both the momentum and pressure calculation in the subsequent time steps are considered as 1 0 the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm as highly recommended in ansys 2013 for all transient flow calculations is adopted in the present study for pressure velocity coupling while presto scheme is used for spatial discretization as the fluid is assumed to be incompressible the time step size is kept as 0 01 s and the analysis is performed for 20 s the pressure at the specific locations p1 p7 in fig 11 and the free surface elevation at the right wall of column 2 are monitored during the numerical simulation to obtain the liquid free surface movement in fluent a line is created at the centre of the right wall of column 2 of the container joining the top and the bottom most points lie on the wall with reference to this line an iso surface is then created and the volume fraction value of phase 2 water is declared as 0 5 indicating it to be a free surface at the beginning of the simulation 4 2 validation of the vof methodology to validate the adopted vof methodology the results of the present study are compared to the same available in existing literature xue et al 2017 for the purpose the numerical model of a rectangular liquid tank is developed in fluent dimensions are kept similar to those given in the literature xue et al 2017 the tank is filled with water up to a height of 180 mm and harmonic motion of type x t x 0 cos ω t is applied at the base of the tank x 0 and ω represent the amplitude and circular frequency of the forced excitation the values are chosen as 0 02 m and 5 442 rad s respectively while performing the validation study the free surface movement at specific time instants are shown in fig 12 the time variation of dynamic pressure at the specified locations p1 p2 and p3 obtained numerically are plotted in fig 13 for comparison with the experimental results given by xue et al 2017 and a reasonably good agreement is found 4 3 numerical results with experimental verifications the result presented in this section mainly focuses on the comparison of natural frequencies of liquid sloshing to start with natural frequencies obtained from the 2d fem modelling approach described in section 2 1 obtained through experiment and as well as evaluated numerically using vof in fluent for different modes of vibration are presented and compared fig 14 shows the variation of maximum liquid displacement with forcing frequency of the external harmonic excitations frequency response curves thus obtained clear the fact of having sloshing modes at those peaks which are listed in table 3 4 4 grid independence study so as to study the mesh independency and to select optimum mesh size four different meshes are used and free surface displacements are plotted as shown in fig 15 a for finer meshes than 12 000 cells no such significant changes are observed hence mesh 2 with 12 000 cells is chosen for the simulation study keeping in mind the total computational time before selecting an appropriate one for this simulation study the effects of different turbulence models are also studied with six different models the time history of liquid free surface displacements is plotted and shown in fig 15 b that shows negligible differences as complex turbulence models take more computational time standard k epsilon model is selected for the numerical simulation 4 5 selection of appropriate turbulence model there is no such previous literature available which strongly recommends modelling a sloshing flow as inviscid laminar or turbulent some authors jung et al 2012 thiagarajan et al 2011 rhee 2005 assumed the flow to be turbulent whereas some other studies chen et al 2009 chen and price 2009 used inviscid model turbulence is basically a 3d unsteady irregular motion witnessed in fluids at moderate to high reynolds numbers practical flows are usually based on fluids of low to very low viscosity almost all fluid flows can be technically called as turbulent ansys 2013 the turbulence intensity i is defined as the ratio of the r m s of the velocity fluctuations u to the mean flow velocity u a v g turbulence intensity can be approximately related to reynolds number by the empirical formula i 0 16 r e 0 125 numerical simulation of liquid sloshing in a u shaped container exposed to external excitation is carried out on fluent software using the vof method as described earlier the frequency of the external harmonic excitation is kept as 0 85 hz two types of viscous models are considered in the analysis initially the liquid is assumed to be inviscid and the simulation study is performed the time history of liquid free surface displacement is obtained and plotted in figs 16 a and 17 a for comparison with the experimental results it is observed that this model overestimated the experimental result then the k epsilon turbulence model is introduced and the simulation study is performed the time history of liquid free surface displacement is found and again plotted in figs 16 b and 17 b for comparison with the experimental results which clarify the fact that the k epsilon model closely predicts the liquid sloshing phenomenon than the inviscid model it is also observed that with the increase in excitation frequency above 1 2 hz the inviscid solution exhibits unphysical fluctuations and due to numerical instabilities the simulation suddenly gets aborted before completion of the analysis whereas in case of turbulent solution no such scenarios are noticed due to consideration of turbulence the kinetic energy of the oscillating liquid gets dissipated and therefore have less energy to climb up and hence displacement of the free surface eventually decreases to validate our observation further the contour plot of the turbulent reynolds number at different time instants is shown in fig 18 and it can be stated that the turbulence effect cannot be ignored in order to accurately measure the flow quantities contour plot of turbulent reynolds number velocity vectors and turbulence intensity extracted from fluent at particular time instants are plotted in figs 18 20 the turbulence intensity for this specific analysis varies in between 0 0089 and 0 77 the max value of reynolds number is found as 41 920 according to fluent user s guide turbulence intensity of 1 or less is usually considered as low while turbulence intensity greater than 10 are considered as high turbulent flows from the contour plot of the velocity vector it is found that the max velocity of the flow is 0 524 m s reynolds number is then estimated using r e ρ v l μ and the value obtained as 50 782 the time instants selected to show the contour plots are arbitrary these contour plots of turbulent reynolds number velocity vectors and turbulence intensity as shown in figs 18 20 are obtained for a specific case where the container is subjected to external excitation of type x t x 0 cos ω t with a magnitude of 0 01 m and frequency 0 85 hz the snapshots of the free liquid surface movement recorded and obtained both experimentally and numerically at different time instants are shown in fig 21 with a perfect match the excitation amplitude and frequency are kept as 0 01 m and 0 8 hz respectively 4 6 parametric studies in order to examine the effects of liquid filling level inside the vertical columns of the container on the liquid free surface movement and the developed wall pressure parametric studies are performed with changing the frequency of the external excitations free surface displacement and non dimensional pressure variations are obtained and plotted against time fig 22 a shows the pressure fluctuation near the free surface of the container i e at the locations p1 p2 and p3 which are at 0 29 m 0 27 m and 0 25 m from the base of the container respectively the liquid inside the vertical columns is filled up to a height of 0 29 m from the base the amplitude and frequency of the external excitation are kept as 20 mm and 0 85 hz respectively the plot shows that the effect of static pressure becomes significant as we move away from the free surface as p1 is located at the free surface it can be observed that the contribution of the dynamic pressure due to liquid sloshing is more than static pressure at this location fig 22 b shows the pressure deviation away from the free surface of the container i e at the locations p4 p5 p6 and p7 which are at 0 2 m 0 15 m 0 1 m and 0 05 m from the base of the container from these above plots it is clarified that the pressure variation on the container wall is mainly due to sloshing which is more prominent at the free surface because of sloshing phenomenon the pressure variation measured near the top regions shows a stiff slope when plotted against time instead liquid behaviour is more decent in the inner and bottom region static pressure dominates and the pressure variation curves come up with higher values as shown in fig 22 b but the absence of sloshing effects makes the curves less slope due to an increase in liquid filling level the displacement of the liquid free surface gets decreased or increased for a specified excitation frequency the liquid inside the vertical column of the container is filled up to a level of 0 15 m 0 25 m and 0 35 m i e maintaining a filling level of 30 50 and 70 respectively and subjected to an external excitation of amplitude 20 mm and frequency 0 85 hz the variation of liquid free surface displacement is plotted against time in fig 23 a when the container is 50 filled the natural frequency of liquid sloshing lies close to the exciting frequency and hence the displacement is more the container is again excited with a forcing frequency of 0 74 hz and the time history of liquid free surface displacement for three different filling levels is plotted in fig 23 b when the container is 70 filled the natural frequency of liquid sloshing lies close to 0 74 hz resulting in more liquid displacement variations in pressure with change in filling level at differently specified pressure locations i e p4 p5 p6 and p7 are plotted in figs 24 and 25 under two excitation frequencies 0 85 hz and 0 74 hz respectively the amplitude of external excitation is kept as 20 mm for both cases from fig 24 it can be noticed that for the 50 filling the pressure variation maintains sinusoidal nature consistently whereas in fig 25 for the 70 filling the pressure variation shows regularity in the sinusoidal waveform this is obvious as the 50 filling makes the natural sloshing frequency close to 0 85 hz and the 70 filling makes the natural sloshing frequency close to 0 74 hz it is further noticed that with the decrease in exciting frequency the pressure developed on the right wall of the container is also decreased as the energy supplied from the excitation is distributed to the total liquid volume the net work done by water also decreases finally the container is subjected to external excitations of amplitude 5 mm and frequencies 0 85 hz 2 3 hz and 2 7 hz the movement of the free liquid surface is plotted in fig 26 for the case of 0 85 hz a uniform response showing a sinusoidal pattern is found with a max liquid displacement of 2 98 cm for the case of 2 3 hz and 2 7 hz the max liquid displacements are observed as 7 16 cm and 6 11 cm respectively the response patterns for the last two cases are abrupt due to the liquid sloshing effects and a well known beating phenomenon is also observed kareem et al 2009 5 conclusions a study on the understanding of the efficacy of u shaped containers to be used as liquid dampers in high rise building systems is presented in this paper an experimental study was undertaken with a u shaped container to understand the liquid sloshing effect particularly on the fundamental frequency by conducting free as well as forced vibration tests the time history of the free surface motion was recorded and relevant data were captured as carrying out experiments for different scenarios is a difficult proposition it was felt necessary to come up with a proper numerical model to understand the sloshing behaviour of the liquid contained in a u shaped container as an initial step towards it 3d numerical model is adopted to observe the liquid sloshing phenomenon and its effects on u shaped containers finally the control efficiency of the lcd in controlling structural vibration obtained experimentally performing forced vibration tests is investigated the major findings are summarized below 1 due to the presence of liquid sloshing the fundamental theoretical frequency i e 0 8 hz differs from the frequency obtained numerically or observed experimentally 2 the liquid inside the vertical columns of the lcd experiences oscillatory motion simultaneously it is observed that the free surface undergoes sloshing motion as well the first frequency i e 0 85 hz as computed numerically or observed experimentally is the oscillating frequency the second and third frequency i e 2 3 hz and 2 7 hz are the corresponding first and second sloshing frequency 3 observing the variations of the turbulent quantities the fluid flow can be said as low turbulent flow incorporation of turbulence in the numerical model of liquid sloshing accurately predicts the fluid flow and the response of the free surface matches well with the experimental results 4 it is observed experimentally that the use of lcd as a passive damper is effective in controlling structural vibration under harmonic as well as earthquake excitations in this work the effects of wide velocity variation near the walls and corner sloshing on the free surface behaviour are assumed to be insignificant therefore the concluding remarks should be considered valid only within the defined scope of this paper as suggested by the co authors a continuation of the present work with an emphasis on the breaking free surface waves due to large amplitude of external loading will be carried out author contribution mr anupam das conceptualization methodology software

21731,the focus of the present study is on the efficacy of u shaped containers used as liquid dampers in high rise building system an experimental study was undertaken with a u shaped container to understand the liquid sloshing effect on the response control of tall buildings by conducting free as well as forced vibration tests the time history of the free surface motion was recorded using a video recording camera and relevant data were captured as carrying out experiments for different scenarios all the time is a difficult proposition it was felt necessary to develop appropriate

known as tuned sloshing damper tsd and tuned liquid column damper tlcd are used as vibration controlling devices in civil engineering structures saaed et al 2015 tlcd in particular has been receiving a great deal of attention among researchers due to its easy implementation low cost of installation usage of its contained liquid for water supply and comparatively better control performance tlcds are basically partially liquid filled rigid u shaped containers the damping generating mechanism is governed by the hydrodynamic head loss when the liquid inside the tlcd passes through the orifice sakai et al 1989 presented classical formulation of liquid oscillation inside a tlcd and provided expression to compute the fundamental frequency of the oscillating liquid later on researchers balendra et al 1995 chang and hsu 1998 gao et al 1997 mostly focused on determining the optimum design parameters of the tlcd though the theory is well established some studies chaiviriyawong et al 2007 hitchcock et al 1997a 1997b reported discrepancies among experimental and numerical natural frequencies of tlcd flow separation due to large transition zones excluding the effect of liquid viscosity and ignoring the significant sloshing behaviour at the liquid free surface are the main sources of differences between experimental and theoretical results lee et al 2011 came up with a new type of liquid damper that adopts the working methodology of both tlcd and tld in combination a novel design methodology was developed min et al 2014 for a two way liquid damper to control the vibration of high rise buildings caused due to wind action it consisted of tlcd in which liquid oscillates inside the vertical columns and tsd in which sloshing of liquid takes place the liquid oscillation and sloshing took place in two orthogonal directions respectively konar and ghosh 2012 first studied the sloshing effects on the control efficiency of liquid column vibration absorbers lcvas but the sloshing phenomenon was modelled mechanically using a spring mass dashpot system hence the simultaneous and coupled effects of liquid sloshing and liquid oscillation got ignored di matteo et al 2015 used an equivalent mechanical system to model liquid sloshing effect inside tlcd considering only the first mode di matteo et al 2015 performed experiments on tlcd and for the first time observed sloshing mode in the vertical columns of the tlcd while performing experiments they focused on tlcds without orifices as to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the tlcd in order to establish only geometrical dependency the objective of the present work is to study the effects of liquid sloshing phenomenon on the dynamic properties of tlcd before utilizing it as a passive damper in controlling structural vibration henceforth the review of literature covers two broad areas of research work control efficiency of tlcd and numerical modelling of liquid sloshing the preceding paragraphs give a brief review of the efficiency of tlcd as a passive damper whereas the following presents a concise review of liquid sloshing and vof methodology graham and rodriguez 1952

container subjected to external acceleration the attempt to predict sloshed induced dynamics applying linear theories based on the potential formulation was reported in abramson 1966 ibrahim 2005 faltinsen et al 2003 2000 considered a 3d mode coupled solution to sloshing but their study was limited to rectangular containers only faltinsen and timokha 2009 presented sloshing with marine applications while the focus was on ship tanks their study also included the nonlinear multimodal method and an introduction to cfd including several experimental results hirt and nichols 1981

ünal 2006 akyildiz and ünal 2005 performed to notice pressure deviations and 3d effects of liquid sloshing in a moving partially filled rectangular tank vof technique was used to study non linear behaviour as well as the damping characteristics of liquid sloshing liu and lin 2008 developed a numerical wave tank to study 3d non linear liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank the large eddy

effect of fluid compressibility on pressure developed due to resonant and non resonant sloshing in a rectangular container rebouillat and liksonov 2010 reviewed recent studies on the fluid structure interaction fsi in partially filled liquid containers describing the importance of fsi for numerous applications such as the airspace industry rockets satellites road and naval transportation their paper particularly focused on the sloshing phenomenon and on the numerical schemes used to find the sloshing wave amplitude frequency pressure exerted on the walls and the effect of sloshing on the container s stability thiagarajan et al 2011 presented the fundamentals of linear potential theory for sloshing motions in a 2d rectangular tank and provided an explanation about the inconsistencies published in the existing literature numerical simulations were also performed to find slosh induced pressure and free surface movement under sway motion having a small amplitude ansari et al 2011 and gómez goñi et al 2013 simulated the sloshing in containers consisting of two liquid phases with different densities while the later talked about the effect of density difference and came up with the idea of single phase fluid modelling jung et al 2012 performed a numerical study to explore the effect of vertical baffle height in controlling sloshing in a moving 3d rectangular tank partially filled with incompressible liquid the researchers simulated the viscous two phase flow using the vof method elahi et al 2015 developed a 2d numerical model taking into account liquid free surface

violent free surface motion an efficient solution method was proposed to capture highly dynamic liquid gas sloshing scenarios on arbitrary unstructured meshes xue et al 2017 experimentally investigated the efficiency of providing four types of the baffles to reduce sloshing pressure under a wide range of forcing frequencies wang et al 2017 took the benefits of both the boundary element bem and finite element methods fem to have an insight on the impacts of placing different baffles on oscillating liquid in partly filled rigid toroidal tank frosina et al 2018 performed experimental

mathematical formulation 2 1 modelling using finite element method the partially filled u shaped container used as a computational fluid domain with different types of boundaries in a rectangular coordinate system is shown in fig 1 the linearized governing equation of motion of inviscid incompressible and irrotational fluid flow may be written considering pressure as a field variable biswal et al 2006 2003 mitra and sinhamahapatra 2008 1 2 p x z t 0 i n ω where the entire fluid domain is represented by ω and the 2d spatial discretization is done with 4 noded bi linear quadrilateral elements the suitable conditions for different boundaries indicated in fig 1 are as follows fluid structure interface boundary γ i if the container wall vibrates with an acceleration u n in the outward normal direction the condition alongside fluid structure interface may be written as 2 p n ρ u n free surface boundary γ f the dynamic and kinematic conditions must satisfy at the free surface for the traction to be continuous and the particle should remain on the free surface assuming linear water wave theory the free surface boundary condition may be written as 3 p ρ g η p n p g bottom boundary γ b the container base is considered as rigid so at the bottom portion of the container 4 p n 0 where ρ and g are the fluid density and gravitational acceleration n is defined as the outward normal direction at different boundaries as the container wall is assumed as rigid the structural acceleration u n becomes the ground acceleration z t single dot and double dot over any variable represent the single and double derivative of that variable with respect to time using galerkin s approach the residual form of the governing differential eq 1 for the liquid may be written as 5 ω w 2 p d ω 0 where w is the weight function rewriting eq 5 we get 6 ω n t 2 p d ω 0 where n is the interpolation function performing integration by parts and applying green gauss divergence theorem eq 6 is transformed to 7 ω n t n p d ω γ n t p n d γ now imposing the boundary conditions stated in eqs 2 4 eq 7 is rewritten as 8 ω n t n p d ω 1 g γ f n t n p d γ γ i n t ρ f u n d γ eq 8 can be written as

platform for different modes are reported in section 4 for a detailed understanding of the fe formulation of fluid the reader is referred to the work of maity and bhattacharyya 2003 1999 and mandal and maity 2016 2015 2 2 modelling using volume of fluid method the numerical simulations are carried out on the ansys fluent platform a general purpose cfd package in solving any cfd problem it is required to solve navier stokes ns equations and the continuity equation with different boundary conditions after applying reynolds averaging technique for turbulence modelling the ns equations can be written as 13 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 14 ρ u i t u j u i x j p x i μ 2 u i x j 2 x j ρ u i u j q i f i where u is the velocity vector in rectangular coordinate system ρ u i u j is the reynolds stresses and μ is the dynamic viscosity q i and f i represent the body force due to gravity and momentum source respectively the momentum source basically depends on the liquid density and the external acceleration provided by the user resulting a unit of k g m 2 s 2 the reynolds stresses depend on the mean velocity gradients through eq 15 can be estimated by choosing any turbulence model the standard k epsilon turbulence model with enhanced wall function launder and spalding 1972 is adopted in the present study 15 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k δ i j where μ t is the turbulent viscosity according to the boussinesq hypothesis the interrelation between turbulent kinetic energy k and it s dissipation rate ε as given in eqs 16 18 can be found in rhee 2005 16 k 1 2 u x u x u y u y u z u z 17 ε υ u i x j u i x j u j x i 18 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε the bars above the variables represent the time averaged quantity the transport equations for k and ε can be found in existing literature as written below 19 ρ k t

standard k ε model the values of c μ 0 09 c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 σ k 1 00 and σ ε 1 30 are chosen for the simulation study as already mentioned earlier the vof method has gained attention over the years in capturing the free surface movement of the sloshing liquid the reader is referred to the study of thiagarajan et al 2011 to have detailed knowledge and a clear understanding of the vof methodology the volume fraction of the n t h fluid is represented by β n after solving the continuity equation for the volume fraction of phases the interface between the phases can be located the equation of the volume fraction for the n t h phase can be written as 21 β n t v β n 0 eq 21 is solved only for the secondary phase and hence the volume fraction for the primary phase is obtained using the following equation 22 n 1 m β n 1 where m is the total no of phases the solution of each momentum equation gives the velocity field for the whole fluid domain that is shared between the phases the fluid properties such as density and viscosity for a control volume can be estimated as the summation of the volume fractions of the component phases using the relation ρ n 1 m β n ρ n the effect of surface tension is excluded from the present work whereas the no slip condition on the tank walls is imposed as a boundary condition 3 experimental study 3 1 experimental setup tests are carried out on the container and the structural system separately as well as on the combined configuration in the shaking table test laboratory at the indian institute of technology kharagpur the three axes six dof shaking table system is capable of bearing a load up to 500 kg having a table dimension of 1 m 1 m the max permissible acceleration velocity frequency and base amplitude that can be given as input are 2g 0 9 m s 50 hz and 150 mm respectively the experimental setup that is developed to study the dynamics of fluid flow consists of a u shaped container also termed as liquid column damper lcd partially filled with coloured water a video recording camera which can capture video with a frame rate of 30 fps in 1920 1080 resolution and one wooden scale attached to column 2 of the container the motion of the interface is recorded this video is then converted to digital images using image processing toolbox in matlab and the time histories of the interface movement are obtained the container is made of perspex material having specific inner dimensions as shown in fig 2 b it is to be noted that when it comes to experiments the free surface is called as the interface since it is really an air water interface not an approximate model the container is filled with coloured water to a height of 290 mm measured from the base the theoretical natural frequency of the liquid column obtained using ω n 2 g l e is 0 8 hz l e 0 78 m is the total liquid column length measured along the centre line of the liquid lcd is subjected to a horizontal harmonic excitation x t x 0 cos ω t where x 0 and ω are the amplitude and circular frequency of external excitation having values assigned as 0 01 0 02 m and 5 026 rad s respectively high rise structures generally have well separated modes of vibration with a low fundamental frequency the authors have aimed at suppressing a particular mode of vibration specially the fundamental mode that helps to make the sdof approximation the primary structure as shown in fig 3 a is a single story frame made with a removable mass system placed at the top the structural mass comprising three steel plates of 6 mm thick and two perspex sheets of 8 mm thick that result in a total mass of 86 7 kg is supported on four mild steel ms flats of 20 mm 8 mm each having a length of 1 2 m from the fixed base free vibration tests on the primary structure are performed by giving a small perturbation and the average value of the natural frequency is obtained as 0 8 hz 3 2 measurement of natural frequency in the following section results obtained from the experiment are presented which include a series of free and forced vibration tests the free vibration response in terms of non dimensional displacement of the oscillating liquid column is shown in fig 4 the data are given in table 1 a the movement of the interface under oscillatory motion is shown in fig 4 the response plots confirm the decaying motion of the interface the damping can be generated mainly due to friction at the boundary layers liquid height kinematic viscosity and the dimensions of the tank immensely influence the generated damping force after obtaining the dynamic parameters of the lcd as given in table 1 b a discrepancy between experimental and theoretical natural frequency is found which signifies a prominent impact that the sloshing liquid creates on the dynamic characteristics of lcd the observed mode shapes of liquid sloshing are shown in figs 5 and 6 the experimental snapshot sequences of the forced vibration response of liquid inside the lcd are shown in figs 7 and 8 under harmonic excitations the selection of time instants is arbitrary 3 3 effectiveness of lcd in controlling structural vibration due to harmonic load a comparison of experimentally obtained acceleration response of the structure with and without lcd subjected to harmonic excitation of frequency 0 8 hz is plotted in fig 9 a which notifies a reduction of 129 37 and 66 8 in the root mean square r m s value and the max value respectively of the acceleration response of the structure the psd functions for the structural acceleration responses are evaluated without damper and with lcd and plotted in fig 9 b it is observed that without lcd the structure shows a dominant peak at the natural frequency in the case of combined system two such peaks moved on either side of that single peak with a considerable reduction in amplitude is noticed which also signifies the tuning effect of the damper system while performing experimental studies as the time step is chosen to be 0 0625 s the plotted power spectral density functions psdfs is not smooth in the case of numerical simulation the optimum values of lcd parameters are generally preferred in this present experimental work the scope of providing the same is limited henceforth the shifting of frequencies and the tuning effect of lcd that are observed are approximate but acceptable 3 4 effectiveness of lcd in controlling structural vibration due to earthquake load to study the robustness of lcd in controlling structural vibration further investigation is carried out by performing experiments while the primary structure is subjected to scaled earthquake acceleration records six such records are selected randomly and the details are given in table 2 the structural acceleration response is obtained with and without the lcd and is plotted in fig 10 effectiveness of lcd in controlling earthquake induced vibration is noticed for a wide frequency range of earthquake excitations 4 numerical study 4 1 computational modelling approach the 2d schematic of the present 3d computational model that represents the two phase air water gas liquid system is shown in fig 11 a structured grid is generated to mesh the computational domain which consists of 12 000 hexahedral cells the density and viscosity of air and water considered in this study are 1 225 998 2 k g m 3 and 0 0000179 0 00103 k g m s respectively computational parameters are chosen based on the author s knowledge gained from existing literature for transient formulation the first order accurate backward implicit scheme is used modified high resolution interface capturing hric scheme is used to obtain the face fluxes for all cells including those near the free surface a non iterative time advancement scheme is used with the specific solvers for spatial discretization as suggested in the literature rhee 2005 except for second order upwind scheme for momentum non iterative relaxation factors for both the momentum and pressure calculation in the subsequent time steps are considered as 1 0 the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm as highly recommended in ansys 2013 for all transient flow calculations is adopted in the present study for pressure velocity coupling while presto scheme is used for spatial discretization as the fluid is assumed to be incompressible the time step size is kept as 0 01 s and the analysis is performed for 20 s the pressure at the specific locations p1 p7 in fig 11 and the free surface elevation at the right wall of column 2 are monitored during the numerical simulation to obtain the liquid free surface movement in fluent a line is created at the centre of the right wall of column 2 of the container joining the top and the bottom most points lie on the wall with reference to this line an iso surface is then created and the volume fraction value of phase 2 water is declared as 0 5 indicating it to be a free surface at the beginning of the simulation 4 2 validation of the vof methodology to validate the adopted vof methodology the results of the present study are compared to the same available in existing literature xue et al 2017 for the purpose the numerical model of a rectangular liquid tank is developed in fluent dimensions are kept similar to those given in the literature xue et al 2017 the tank is filled with water up to a height of 180 mm and harmonic motion of type x t x 0 cos ω t is applied at the base of the tank x 0 and ω represent the amplitude and circular frequency of the forced excitation the values are chosen as 0 02 m and 5 442 rad s respectively while performing the validation study the free surface movement at specific time instants are shown in fig 12 the time variation of dynamic pressure at the specified locations p1 p2 and p3 obtained numerically are plotted in fig 13 for comparison with the experimental results given by xue et al 2017 and a reasonably good agreement is found 4 3 numerical results with experimental verifications the result presented in this section mainly focuses on the comparison of natural frequencies of liquid sloshing to start with natural frequencies obtained from the 2d fem modelling approach described in section 2 1 obtained through experiment and as well as evaluated numerically using vof in fluent for different modes of vibration are presented and compared fig 14 shows the variation of maximum liquid displacement with forcing frequency of the external harmonic excitations frequency response curves thus obtained clear the fact of having sloshing modes at those peaks which are listed in table 3 4 4 grid independence study so as to study the mesh independency and to select optimum mesh size four different meshes are used and free surface displacements are plotted as shown in fig 15 a for finer meshes than 12 000 cells no such significant changes are observed hence mesh 2 with 12 000 cells is chosen for the simulation study keeping in mind the total computational time before selecting an appropriate one for this simulation study the effects of different turbulence models are also studied with six different models the time history of liquid free surface displacements is plotted and shown in fig 15 b that shows negligible differences as complex turbulence models take more computational time standard k epsilon model is selected for the numerical simulation 4 5 selection of appropriate turbulence model there is no such previous literature available which strongly recommends modelling a sloshing flow as inviscid laminar or turbulent some authors jung et al 2012 thiagarajan et al 2011 rhee 2005 assumed the flow to be turbulent whereas some other studies chen et al 2009 chen and price 2009 used inviscid model turbulence is basically a 3d unsteady irregular motion witnessed in fluids at moderate to high reynolds numbers practical flows are usually based on fluids of low to very low viscosity almost all fluid flows can be technically called as turbulent ansys 2013 the turbulence intensity i is defined as the ratio of the r m s of the velocity fluctuations u to the mean flow velocity u a v g turbulence intensity can be approximately related to reynolds number by the empirical formula i 0 16 r e 0 125 numerical simulation of liquid sloshing in a u shaped container exposed to external excitation is carried out on fluent software using the vof method as described earlier the frequency of the external harmonic excitation is kept as 0 85 hz two types of viscous models are considered in the analysis initially the liquid is assumed to be inviscid and the simulation study is performed the time history of liquid free surface displacement is obtained and plotted in figs 16 a and 17 a for comparison with the experimental results it is observed that this model overestimated the experimental result then the k epsilon turbulence model is introduced and the simulation study is performed the time history of liquid free surface displacement is found and again plotted in figs 16 b and 17 b for comparison with the experimental results which clarify the fact that the k epsilon model closely predicts the liquid sloshing phenomenon than the inviscid model it is also observed that with the increase in excitation frequency above 1 2 hz the inviscid solution exhibits unphysical fluctuations and due to numerical instabilities the simulation suddenly gets aborted before completion of the analysis whereas in case of turbulent solution no such scenarios are noticed due to consideration of turbulence the kinetic energy of the oscillating liquid gets dissipated and therefore have less energy to climb up and hence displacement of the free surface eventually decreases to validate our observation further the contour plot of the turbulent reynolds number at different time instants is shown in fig 18 and it can be stated that the turbulence effect cannot be ignored in order to accurately measure the flow quantities contour plot of turbulent reynolds number velocity vectors and turbulence intensity extracted from fluent at particular time instants are plotted in figs 18 20 the turbulence intensity for this specific analysis varies in between 0 0089 and 0 77 the max value of reynolds number is found as 41 920 according to fluent user s guide turbulence intensity of 1 or less is usually considered as low while turbulence intensity greater than 10 are considered as high turbulent flows from the contour plot of the velocity vector it is found that the max velocity of the flow is 0 524 m s reynolds number is then estimated using r e ρ v l μ and the value obtained as 50 782 the time instants selected to show the contour plots are arbitrary these contour plots of turbulent reynolds number velocity vectors and turbulence intensity as shown in figs 18 20 are obtained for a specific case where the container is subjected to external excitation of type x t x 0 cos ω t with a magnitude of 0 01 m and frequency 0 85 hz the snapshots of the free liquid surface movement recorded and obtained both experimentally and numerically at different time instants are shown in fig 21 with a perfect match the excitation amplitude and frequency are kept as 0 01 m and 0 8 hz respectively 4 6 parametric studies in order to examine the effects of liquid filling level inside the vertical columns of the container on the liquid free surface movement and the developed wall pressure parametric studies are performed with changing the frequency of the external excitations free surface displacement and non dimensional pressure variations are obtained and plotted against time fig 22 a shows the pressure fluctuation near the free surface of the container i e at the locations p1 p2 and p3 which are at 0 29 m 0 27 m and 0 25 m from the base of the container respectively the liquid inside the vertical columns is filled up to a height of 0 29 m from the base the amplitude and frequency of the external excitation are kept as 20 mm and 0 85 hz respectively the plot shows that the effect of static pressure becomes significant as we move away from the free surface as p1 is located at the free surface it can be observed that the contribution of the dynamic pressure due to liquid sloshing is more than static pressure at this location fig 22 b shows the pressure deviation away from the free surface of the container i e at the locations p4 p5 p6 and p7 which are at 0 2 m 0 15 m 0 1 m and 0 05 m from the base of the container from these above plots it is clarified that the pressure variation on the container wall is mainly due to sloshing which is more prominent at the free surface because of sloshing phenomenon the pressure variation measured near the top regions shows a stiff slope when plotted against time instead liquid behaviour is more decent in the inner and bottom region static pressure dominates and the pressure variation curves come up with higher values as shown in fig 22 b but the absence of sloshing effects makes the curves less slope due to an increase in liquid filling level the displacement of the liquid free surface gets decreased or increased for a specified excitation frequency the liquid inside the vertical column of the container is filled up to a level of 0 15 m 0 25 m and 0 35 m i e maintaining a filling level of 30 50 and 70 respectively and subjected to an external excitation of amplitude 20 mm and frequency 0 85 hz the variation of liquid free surface displacement is plotted against time in fig 23 a when the container is 50 filled the natural frequency of liquid sloshing lies close to the exciting frequency and hence the displacement is more the container is again excited with a forcing frequency of 0 74 hz and the time history of liquid free surface displacement for three different filling levels is plotted in fig 23 b when the container is 70 filled the natural frequency of liquid sloshing lies close to 0 74 hz resulting in more liquid displacement variations in pressure with change in filling level at differently specified pressure locations i e p4 p5 p6 and p7 are plotted in figs 24 and 25 under two excitation frequencies 0 85 hz and 0 74 hz respectively the amplitude of external excitation is kept as 20 mm for both cases from fig 24 it can be noticed that for the 50 filling the pressure variation maintains sinusoidal nature consistently whereas in fig 25 for the 70 filling the pressure variation shows regularity in the sinusoidal waveform this is obvious as the 50 filling makes the natural sloshing frequency close to 0 85 hz and the 70 filling makes the natural sloshing frequency close to 0 74 hz it is further noticed that with the decrease in exciting frequency the pressure developed on the right wall of the container is also decreased as the energy supplied from the excitation is distributed to the total liquid volume the net work done by water also decreases finally the container is subjected to external excitations of amplitude 5 mm and frequencies 0 85 hz 2 3 hz and 2 7 hz the movement of the free liquid surface is plotted in fig 26 for the case of 0 85 hz a uniform response showing a sinusoidal pattern is found with a max liquid displacement of 2 98 cm for the case of 2 3 hz and 2 7 hz the max liquid displacements are observed as 7 16 cm and 6 11 cm respectively the response patterns for the last two cases are abrupt due to the liquid sloshing effects and a well known beating phenomenon is also observed kareem et al 2009 5 conclusions a study on the understanding of the efficacy of u shaped containers to be used as liquid dampers in high rise building systems is presented in this paper an experimental study was undertaken with a u shaped container to understand the liquid sloshing effect particularly on the fundamental frequency by conducting free as well as forced vibration tests the time history of the free surface motion was recorded and relevant data were captured as carrying out experiments for different scenarios is a difficult proposition it was felt necessary to come up with a proper numerical model to understand the sloshing behaviour of the liquid contained in a u shaped container as an initial step towards it 3d numerical model is adopted to observe the liquid sloshing phenomenon and its effects on u shaped containers finally the control efficiency of the lcd in controlling structural vibration obtained experimentally performing forced vibration tests is investigated the major findings are summarized below 1 due to the presence of liquid sloshing the fundamental theoretical frequency i e 0 8 hz differs from the frequency obtained numerically or observed experimentally 2 the liquid inside the vertical columns of the lcd experiences oscillatory motion simultaneously it is observed that the free surface undergoes sloshing motion as well the first frequency i e 0 85 hz as computed numerically or observed experimentally is the oscillating frequency the second and third frequency i e 2 3 hz and 2 7 hz are the corresponding first and second sloshing frequency 3 observing the variations of the turbulent quantities the fluid flow can be said as low turbulent flow incorporation of turbulence in the numerical model of liquid sloshing accurately predicts the fluid flow and the response of the free surface matches well with the experimental results 4 it is observed experimentally that the use of lcd as a passive damper is effective in controlling structural vibration under harmonic as well as earthquake excitations in this work the effects of wide velocity variation near the walls and corner sloshing on the free surface behaviour are assumed to be insignificant therefore the concluding remarks should be considered valid only within the defined scope of this paper as suggested by the co authors a continuation of the present work with an emphasis on the breaking free surface waves due to large amplitude of external loading will be carried out author contribution mr anupam das conceptualization methodology software

21732,the coupled interaction between the damaged ship motion and flooding water is very complicated and the time domain coupling should be considered for the accurate prediction of ship stability in this paper we propose a nonlinear time domain unified viscous and potential prediction method for the prediction of ship dynamics coupled with floodwater in this method the nonlinear three dimensional time domain hybrid source method is used for the simulation of ship motion and the fully viscous method is used for the simulation of the motion of floodwater which can take the advantage of potential theory in calculating ship motion and viscous theory in calculating floodwater firstly the theory basis mathematical model and calculation process for this unified method are given secondly two boundary conditions and two time scales for the match between potential theory and viscous theory are proposed thirdly taking the ittc benchmark model as an example the simulation results in calm water by this unified method with different boundary conditions are compared with fully viscous simulation results and experimental results the research show that the proposed unified prediction method can predict the dynamics of ship motion and describe the details of flooding water very well at the same time the calculation time can be saved a lot compared with full viscous method as the grid number for viscous simulation is considerably reduced keywords three dimensional time domain hybrid source boundary condition time scale damaged ship motion 1 introduction the behavior of a damaged ship is very complex because of the interaction between the ship motion and the flow inside the damaged compartment and the evaluation of the damage ship motion is a challenging task the performance of a damaged ship in waves is influenced not only by external waves but also by the internal loads of the fluid flow and sloshing the inflow of floodwater causes the change of ship parameters mass buoyancy etc and the sloshing of liquid inside the damaged compartment the loads generated by the sloshing of liquid will further affect the motion characteristics of the ship the motion of damaged ship and the floodwater are coupled with each other water flowing into the compartment has a significant effect on the ship stability and safety therefore a feasible prediction method for the damaged ship stability considering the interaction between the damaged ship and the floodwater is very important the dynamic performance of damaged ship in waves is constantly changing which leads to high nonlinearity of this dynamic system therefore an effective method to reproduce the extreme nonlinearity of the ship motion and the flowing process is to solve it in time domain generally there are three basic problems related to damaged ship motion ittc 2005 ship motion under the excitation of waves at zero forward speed the flooding phenomenon itself namely the process of water inflow and outflow through damage openings and progressive flooding through internal spaces the behavior of the accumulated floodwater inside the ship s compartments and its interaction with the ship up to now many works have been devoted to the study of the damaged stability in waves the assessment of damaged ship motion is normally based on potential theory vassalos et al 1994 zaraphonitiset et al 1997 umeda et al 2004 santos et al 2008 spanos and papanikolaou 2007 van walree et al 2007 jasionowski and vassalos 2011 lee 2015 krüger 2016 acanfora et al 2019 the wave forces and hydrodynamic forces are usually calculated by potential theory the same way as intact ship the internal water surface is assumed to be horizontal or a free moving plane the inflow and outflow of water through the damaged opening are calculated by the modified empirical bernoulli s equation and the sloshing inside the compartment is usually ignored or simply described by shallow water equation or lump mass method furthermore the roll damping and damping forces due to floodwater are usually calculated by empirical method we can see that the potential theory cannot accurately capture the viscous features of floodwater and sloshing with the development of computational fluid dynamics viscous flow method has been widely used in the research of damaged ships and it is deemed to be a better choice for the detailed description of the dynamic characteristics of flow indeed it has been used by several researchers to study the motion of damaged ship and flooding water such as cfd simulation based on unsteady rans equations or meshless sph method skaar 2006 shen and vassalos 2009 sadat hosseini et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 caldas et al 2018 cao et al 2019 niotis et al 2019 ruth et al 2019 these studies verify the feasibility of cfd method for the successful description of the floodwater and its characteristics however we should also be aware of the simulation of the damaged ship motion coupled with flooding process by fully viscous cfd method is unrealistic for the engineering application due to the high computational costs at present the coupling between the damaged ship motion and the flooding water in waves is a very complex problem the in waves calculations need to consider not only the motions of damaged ship but also the strong non linear floodwater dynamics as well as the progressive flooding particularly despite a number of studies that focused on the relationship between flooding water and the motion response of damaged ship the effects of flooding dynamics on the motion of a damage ship is not yet clearly understood considering that cfd method can simulate most of the flow characteristics and the potential flow method has a strong advantage in solving seakeeping problems the coupling method of cfd and potential theory will be a good way to reduce the computational cost on one hand and to simulate the flow problem more efficiently on the other hand in this method cfd is used to simulate the flow in the damaged compartment whilst the potential flow method is used to calculate the forces due to the action of waves cho et al 2006 developed a numerical method that can take into account the internal flow and the effect of sloshing in their method the ship motion is solved by the three dimensional frequency domain panel method and the internal fluid motion is solved by the modified vof method gao et al 2013 simulated the motion of one damaged ro ro ship coupled with damaged flow in which the ship motions in waves were calculated with the use of strip theory and flows inside the damaged compartment were calculated by rans equation hashimoto et al 2015 simulated the transient behavior of ships by coupling the three dimensional mps method with the conventional 2d strip method the studies above inspire us to establish a method that can combine cfd and potential theory to investigate the hydrodynamics of floodwater and its effects on the damaged ship motions in this paper a unified viscous and potential prediction method uvap is proposed in which the three dimensional time domain hybrid source method is used for the calculation of damaged ship motion in waves and the fully viscous cfd method is used for the simulation of floodwater two boundary condition forms for damaged opening and two time scales are introduced then the time domain coupling between damaged ship motion and damaged floodwater are simulated based on this method by taking the ittc benchmark model as an example we exchanged our research results in issw 2019 bu and gu 2019 and this paper gives more detailed introduction about this method and also more detailed comparisons of the results in calm water 2 unified viscous and

the hull fixed coordinate system which undertakes synchronous motion with the hull for convenience of calculation the reference coordinate system o x y z is introduced and the o x y plane is located at the mean water level with the origin o just above or below the center of gravity g three dimensional time domain hybrid source method is used for the calculation of damaged ship motions the field domain contains two sub domains divided by an virtual arbitrary control surface sc as shown in fig 2 the inner field domain i is a closed area with three boundaries the wetted hull surface sb the partial free surface sf1 close to the ship body and the control surface sc while the outer field domain ii is an area closed by the control surface sc the remaining free surface sf2 and the virtual boundary s at infinity zhang et al 1998 liu and papanikolaou 2011 bu et al 2019a 2019b the total perturbation potential φi p t in the inner field domain satisfies the following conditions 3 2 φ i 0 inner 2 φ i 2 t g φ i z 0 on s f 1 t 0 φ i n v n φ w n on s b t 0 φ i φ i t 0 at t 0 the boundary integral equation of rankine source in the inner field domain i can be written as follows 4 2 π φ i p

the panel can be calculated by integrating the pressure along the wetted surface 8 f s b p n d s m s b r n p d s where r n the radial and normal vectors defined in the hull fixed coordinate system then we can obtain the added mass coefficient the damping coefficient the froude krylov force the hydrostatic force and the diffraction force in eq 2 2 3 fully viscous method for damaged floodwater the internal force and moment due to the viscous flow of floodwater and tank sloshing in eq 2 can be computed by the viscous method and can be given as 9 f in s f p f s n d s m in s r f f p f s n d s where f p and f s are the pressure and shear force acting on the compartment wall respectively these forces can be calculated by the commercial cfd software meanwhile the viscous flow solver needs to be secondary developed to couple with the potential flow solver in time domain the governing equations of flow field include the continuity equation the momentum equation and the phase volume fraction equation which are expressed as follows 10 t v ρ d v s ρ u u g n d s 0 t v ρ u d v s ρ u u u g n d s v ω u d v s p i n d s v ρ g d v s μ u u t d s t v α d v s α u u g n d s 0 where ρ is the mixture

equations are associated with volume fraction through density ρ and viscous coefficient μ in the whole viscous flow calculation region once the force and moment acting on the compartment wall are calculated they will serve as the initial conditions for the next iteration of eq 2 2 4 calculation process of uvap method the calculation process of the unified viscous and potential prediction method is the following see fig 3 1 initialization of ship motion by time domain potential flow solver including initial time meshing and the calculation of hydrodynamic coefficients 2 initialization of the viscous flow field within the damaged compartment including the pressure and velocity fields free surface etc 3 the time domain potential flow solver calculates the hydrodynamic and wave induced forces to solve the ship equations of motion this step involves also establishing of the boundary conditions of the flow field in the rans solution such as the boundary conditions of the computational domain or the boundary condition of the damaged opening 4 the boundary conditions calculated by time domain potential method are transferred to cfd method 5 after the boundary conditions are transferred to the viscous flow solver it initializes the calculations of the floodwater ingress and egress of the damaged opening as well as the flow of water and tank sloshing inside the damaged compartment then the relatively steady state internal forces and moments due to floodwater and sloshing in certain time interval can be obtained after a series of internal iterations 6 the internal forces and moments calculated by viscous flow solver are transferred to the time domain potential flow solver 7 the hydrodynamic loads due to floodwater are treated as one part of the external forces acting on the hull and the ship s equations of motion are solved by the fourth order runge kutta method 8 the updated motions of the damaged compartment obtained from the solution of the ship motion equation are transferred to the cfd method 9 repeat 3 8 until the calculation is completed 3 research object and numerical model 3 1 research object the ittc benchmark model for progressive flooding is selected as the research object the experimental data was provided by napa ltd and aalto university for the validation of numerical method ruponen 2006 ruponen et al 2007 this model is a barge with eight interconnected compartments as seen in fig 4 its principal dimensions are given in table 1 the model tests were conducted in calm water the damaged compartments are situated in the middle of the hull towards the bow of the ship compartments and connections are shown in fig 5 and table 2 the damage opening is located at the mid length of the side wall of compartment r21s 185 mm below the waterline in the study presented in this paper db1 and db2 in the lower compartment are not connected with the upper compartment and therefore they will not be flooded in the simulation 3 2 numerical model the heave roll and pitch motions are free with other motions constrained in the experiment thus we also adopt three degrees of freedom heave roll pitch mathematical model for the calculation of damaged motion coupled with damaged flow in order to comparing the calculation results and experimental results eq 2 can be simplified as 11 m a 33 x 3 b 33 x 3 j 4 5 a 3 j x j b 3 j x j f 3 f k h f 3 d f f 3 in i i i a i i x i b i i x i j 3 i 5 a i j x j b i j x j f i f k h f i d f f i in i 4 5 the linear roll damping coefficient is used in this case because only this coefficient is available up to now the roll damping moment can be calculated based on the critical roll damping coefficient 12 b 44 ς 2 i x x a 44 m g g m where ς is the critical roll damping coefficient obtained from experiment ruponen et al 2007 fig 6 shows the linear order panels used for the calculation of damaged ship motion in the potential part of the unified viscous and potential prediction method fig 7 shows the meshes used for the calculation of damaged flow in the viscous part of this unified prediction method and the meshes around the openings are all refined 3 3 time scale and coordinate system the potential flow solver can afford a step with longer time because the mesh size is larger than that in viscous flow solver conversely the mesh size in viscous flow should be small enough especially around the small scale openings and the small size means the requirement of the short time step as a result it is necessary to introduce two distinct time scales for potential and viscous flow solvers we use fast and slow time scales in the time domain solution and the method of multi step superposition is used for the coupling between these two flow solvers for example if the time step associated with the potential flow solver is given as δt then the viscous flow is solved in n inner time steps with equal time interval of δt 1 where δt nδt 1 and the value of n depends on the courant number the floodwater forces after the n inner time steps are applied to the ship s equations of motion to ensure the unification of the two flow solvers in calculation time the schematic diagram is shown in fig 8 except for the time scale the coordinate systems used in potential flow part and viscous flow part should also be matched with each other the local coordinate system is introduced into the calculation of viscous solver and it is aligned with the inertial coordinate system used in the calculation of ship motions as shown in fig 9 the forces acting on the compartment are calculated based on the instantaneous position of the gravity center all calculated forces need to be converted to forces in the earth fixed coordinate system and then added together 3 4 boundary conditions for the damage opening the calculation of damaged ship motion also needs to consider the hydrodynamic forces caused by the inflow and outflow of floodwater through damaged opening it requires the accurate calculation of the flowrate through the damaged opening thus the boundary conditions applied at the damaged opening should guarantee the match between potential flow theory and viscous flow theory three different methods for handling of the boundary condition at the damage opening are utilized in the unified viscous and potential prediction method 1 far field pressure boundary condition the far field pressure boundary condition is applied to the domain constructed by constraining the entire cfd domain with two parallel planes aligned with the front and rear end of the damaged compartments gao et al 2013 as shown in fig 10 the front and back sections of the computational domain are slip wall boundary conditions while the upper and lower boundary conditions are far field pressure boundary conditions the corresponding pressure conditions are determined according to the position of the free surface the interior and exterior walls of the compartment use the wall boundary condition 2 near field pressure boundary condition the idea of near field pressure boundary condition originates from our finding during fully viscous simulation we found that the velocity field in the proximity of the damage opening presents a hemispherical transition zone therefore the computational domain consists of the interior region and a hemispherical region near the damage opening as shown in fig 11 the cfd solver does not need to set the free surface position when this boundary condition is used because there is no inconsistency of the free surface between viscous flow and potential flow the simulation part includes the damaged compartment and hemispherical region therefore the slip wall boundary conditions are employed as the boundary condition of the damaged compartment and the pressure inlet boundary condition is applied on the outer wall of the hemispherical region 3 hatch pressure boundary condition the idea of hatch pressure boundary condition stems from the problem of orifice and pipeline flow the computational domain of this method includes only the interior of the damaged compartment as shown in fig 12 the slip wall boundary conditions are also employed as the boundary condition of the damaged compartment and the pressure inlet boundary condition is applied at the damaged opening there is no external flow field and the flow into the compartment is entirely determined by the pressure applied at the damage opening the pressure directly calculated by potential flow solver needs to be corrected due to the pressure loss which is similar to the setting of the local pressure loss coefficient in the problem of the orifice and pipeline flow herein the hatch pressure boundary condition in viscous flow calculation is given by modifying the pressure in the hatch obtained from potential flow calculation the pressure at the damage opening in cfd calculations is given as 13 p v k p 0 where p v is the pressure at the damage opening in cfd calculation p 0 is the pressure near the damaged opening calculated by the potential flow solver including the first and second order pressure caused by incident wave and disturbance potential k is the local loss coefficient of the pressure fig 13 presents the value of k used in this paper initial value of the coefficient k is 0 6 and it increases gradually after 10s these values are obtained by the detailed comparisons of the calculated results with fully cfd simulation results such as the comparisons of the ship motion the amount of floodwater the velocity and the pressure field at different time steps of course the universal selection law of this coefficient requires further research for different damaged conditions 4 fully viscous simulation and validation 4 1 setup for simulation we firstly validated the calculation accuracy of the fully viscous method for the damaged ship motion coupled with the floodwater by taking this barge ship as an example similar studies were also conducted by caldas et al 2018 and hu et al 2019 they investigated the dynamics of this model based on the commercial cfd software the numerical simulations for the damaged ship motion are performed by solving unsteady rans equation the free surface is modelled with the two phase vof approach with a high resolution interface capturing hric scheme based on the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes the pressure correction algorithm of simple type is used for the pressure velocity coupling an algebraic multi grid amg solver is used to accelerate the convergence of the solution a segregated flow solver approach is utilized for all simulations the dimensions of the computational domain are 15 m 15 m 10 m the meshing utilises the technique of overlapping grid the wall boundary condition is applied to the hull surface and the pressure outlet condition is used for the external computational domain there are two sets of grids in the computational domain as shown in fig 14 background grid which contains the whole flow field and the overlapping grid containing the hull and the surrounding flow field data exchange between these two sets of grids is carried out by interpolation near the interface 4 2 simulation results and validation fig 15 depicts the calculation of flooding process at different time steps and the maximum simulation time is 300s we compare the profiles of the free surface inside the damaged compartment at different moments with experimental results as shown in fig 16 we also compare the height of water level calculated by cfd method with experimental results at the same measuring position as shown in fig 17 the calculations of floodwater levels in different compartments are in good agreement with model test results which validates the feasibility of the viscous method for the calculation of flooding process fig 18 shows the calculation results of heave pitch and roll motions for better comparisons the average values per period are used in the cfd simulation results the consistency between simulation results and experimental results further validates the calculation accuracy of cfd method for damaged ship motion in calm water 5 simulation results by unified prediction method and analysis 5 1 analysis of flooding process in order to verify the reliability of the nonlinear time domain unified viscous and potential prediction method proposed in this paper the numerical results calculated by different ways of handling boundary conditions at the damage opening are compared with the experimental data the mesh quantity used for calculations are 1 3 million cells for the fully cfd simulation 620 000 cells for the unified prediction method with the far field pressure boundary condition 320 000 cells for the unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition and 300 000 cells for the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary fig 19 shows the flow inside the compartment calculated by different methods it can be observed in these figures that the transient inflow shows strong non linear characteristics at t 5s the unified viscous and potential prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition can simulate the non linear transient inflow better than that with far field boundary condition at the moment of t 25s the floodwater begins to flow to the other side the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condition offers the closest match to the calculation results of cfd simulation at this time instant the unified prediction method with far field pressure boundary condition overestimates the inflow water while the unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition proposed in this paper underestimates the inflow water the inflow water is quite small at this time hence its impact on the ship behaviour may be relatively small the flooding process tend to be stable with the increase of time overall the unified prediction method with three different boundary conditions captures the flow process very well fig 20 shows the comparison of velocity fields computed by different methods it can be note from the figures that the unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition calculates the velocity field well but the velocities calculated by the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condition are relatively small at t 5s however the accuracy becomes better with the increase of time overall there is little difference in the velocity fields calculated by the full cfd method and the unified prediction method with different boundary conditions near field pressure boundary far field pressure boundary and hatch pressure boundary and the comparison results between different methods validate the applicability of the boundary conditions proposed in this paper fig 21 shows the comparison of pressure fields calculated by fully cfd method and the unified prediction method with three different boundary conditions it can be seen from the figures that the unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition calculates the pressure field well but the pressure calculated by the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condition are relatively small at t 5s as similar to the results of velocity field overall there is little difference in pressure fields calculated by the full cfd method and the unified prediction method with three different boundary conditions which further verify the applicability of the boundary conditions for the study of damaged ship motion coupled with floodwater 5 2 analysis of damaged ship motion the results calculated by the unified viscous and potential prediction method fully viscous method and model test are compared in fig 22 for the roll motion errors calculated by the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condition are relatively large at the initial stage this may be caused by the errors in the calculation of floodwater inflow roll damping etc the errors can be neglected because the roll motion is very small for the heave and pitch motions the calculated results of fully viscous simulation unified prediction method with far field pressure boundary condition unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condtion and unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condtion are all in good agreement with the results of model tests the comparisons of the time domain motions calculated by unified viscous and potential prediction method with different boundary conditions prove that the unified method and the boundary conditions for the match between viscous and potential can be used for the calculation of the damaged ship motion therefore we can deduce that the unified viscous and potential prediction method with our proposed boundary conditions is a reliable and practical method for the prediction of damaged ship motion especially for the study of the interaction between damaged ship motion and flooding 5 3 analysis of calculation costs table 3 illustrates the mesh quantity and calculation time cost by different methods the mesh quantity for fully viscous cfd method is about 1 3 million and it needs 100 h to complete 50s calculation by using 40 cores parallel computing in the cluster the number of grids for the unified method with the far field pressure boundary condtion is 620 000 and it takes about 150 h to complete the 50s calculation by using 5 cores in the ordinary desktop computer the number of grids for the unified method with the near field pressure boundary condtion and hatch pressure boundary condtion is basically 300 000 and it takes about 100 h to complete 50s calculation by using 5 cores in the ordinary desktop computer the data in table 3 clearly tell us that the unified viscous and potential prediction method can save a lot of time compared with cfd simulation we can also see that the unified viscous and potential prediction method with our proposed boundary conditions near field boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition cut down the computing time compared to that with far field pressure boundary primarily because the calculation of the unified viscous and potential prediction method with far field pressure boundary needs to include a relatively large computational domain outside the damaged opening and the mesh quantity is much larger than that calculated with near field boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition theoretically the calculation domain of viscous flow is cut parallel to the damaged opening under far field boundary condition it will lead to the inconsistency of free surface between the potential and viscous solutions in the calculation of wave conditions especially when the incoming flow is vertical or intersecting with the damaged opening in contrast the free surface is naturally consistent under the near field pressure boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition and they can be used to calculate damaged ship motion under different wave directions and ship speeds we will further investigate the application of different boundary conditions in waves in the future 6 conclusion in this paper a unified viscous and potential prediction method uvap method for damaged ship stability is proposed based on the real time interactive iteration of three dimensional time domain hybrid source method and viscous cfd method this uvap method combines the advantage of the three dimensional time domain hybrid source method in calculating extreme motion of ship in waves and the advantage of cfd method in detailed simulation for hull floodwater interaction two time scales are introduced and two boundary condition forms for damage opening in the unified model are proposed the research and analysis show that 1 the unified viscous and potential prediction method established in this paper can be effectively applied to the study of real time coupled damaged flow of damaged ships 2 the comparisons of flow process velocity pressure with full cfd method and model tests verify the effectiveness of the proposed unified viscous and potential prediction method for the prediction of damaged ship stability in calm water 3 the proposed near field pressure boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition for the damaged opening can significantly reduce the mesh quantity and save the computation time without compromising the accuracy of calculations we are still validating the accuracy of this unified viscous and potential prediction method for the

21732,the coupled interaction between the damaged ship motion and flooding water is very complicated and the time domain coupling should be considered for the accurate prediction of ship stability in this paper we propose a nonlinear time domain unified viscous and potential prediction method for the prediction of ship dynamics coupled with floodwater in this method the nonlinear three dimensional time domain hybrid source method is used for the simulation of ship motion and the fully viscous method is used for the simulation of the motion of floodwater which can take the advantage of potential theory in calculating ship motion and viscous theory in calculating floodwater firstly the theory basis mathematical model and calculation process for this unified method are given secondly two boundary conditions and two time scales for the match between potential theory and viscous theory are proposed thirdly taking the ittc benchmark model as an example the simulation results in calm water by this unified method with different boundary conditions are compared with fully viscous simulation results and experimental results the research show that the proposed unified prediction method can predict the dynamics of ship motion and describe the details of flooding water very well at the same time the calculation time can be saved a lot compared with full viscous method as the grid number for viscous simulation is considerably reduced keywords three dimensional time domain hybrid source boundary condition time scale damaged ship motion 1 introduction the behavior of a damaged ship is very complex because of the interaction between the ship motion and the flow inside the damaged compartment and the evaluation of the damage ship motion is a challenging task the performance of a damaged ship in waves is influenced not only by external waves but also by the internal loads of the fluid flow and sloshing the inflow of floodwater causes the change of ship parameters mass buoyancy etc and the sloshing of liquid inside the damaged compartment the loads generated by the sloshing of liquid will further affect the motion characteristics of the ship the motion of damaged ship and the floodwater are coupled with each other water flowing into the compartment has a significant effect on the ship stability and safety therefore a feasible prediction method for the damaged ship stability considering the interaction between the damaged ship and the floodwater is very important the dynamic performance of damaged ship in waves is constantly changing which leads to high nonlinearity of this dynamic system therefore an effective method to reproduce the extreme nonlinearity of the ship motion and the flowing process is to solve it in time domain generally there are three basic problems related to damaged ship motion ittc 2005 ship motion under the excitation of waves at zero forward speed the flooding phenomenon itself namely the process of water inflow and outflow through damage openings and progressive flooding through internal spaces the behavior of the accumulated floodwater inside the ship s compartments and its interaction with the ship up to now many works have been devoted to the study of the damaged stability in waves the assessment of damaged ship motion is normally based on potential theory vassalos et al 1994 zaraphonitiset et al 1997 umeda et al 2004 santos et al 2008 spanos and papanikolaou 2007 van walree et al 2007 jasionowski and vassalos 2011 lee 2015 krüger 2016 acanfora et al 2019 the wave forces and hydrodynamic forces are usually calculated by potential theory the same way as intact ship the internal water surface is assumed to be horizontal or a free moving plane the inflow and outflow of water through the damaged opening are calculated by the modified empirical bernoulli s equation and the sloshing inside the compartment is usually ignored or simply described by shallow water equation or lump mass method furthermore the roll damping and damping forces due to floodwater are usually calculated by empirical method we can see that the potential theory cannot accurately capture the viscous features of floodwater and sloshing with the development of computational fluid dynamics viscous flow method has been widely used in the research of damaged ships and it is deemed to be a better choice for the detailed description of the dynamic characteristics of flow indeed it has been used by several researchers to study the motion of damaged ship and flooding water such as cfd simulation based on unsteady rans equations or meshless sph method skaar 2006 shen and vassalos 2009 sadat hosseini et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 caldas et al 2018 cao et al 2019 niotis et al 2019 ruth et al 2019 these studies verify the feasibility of cfd method for the successful description of the floodwater and its characteristics however we should also be aware of the simulation of the damaged ship motion coupled with flooding process by fully viscous cfd method is unrealistic for the engineering application due to the high computational costs at present the coupling between the damaged ship motion and the flooding water in waves is a very complex problem the in waves calculations need to consider not only the motions of damaged ship but also the strong non linear floodwater dynamics as well as the progressive flooding particularly despite a number of studies that focused on the relationship between flooding water and the motion response of damaged ship the effects of flooding dynamics on the motion of a damage ship is not yet clearly understood considering that cfd method can simulate most of the flow characteristics and the potential flow method has a strong advantage in solving seakeeping problems the coupling method of cfd and potential theory will be a good way to reduce the computational cost on one hand and to simulate the flow problem more efficiently on the other hand in this method cfd is used to simulate the flow in the damaged compartment whilst the potential flow method is used to calculate the forces due to the action of waves cho et al 2006 developed a numerical method that can take into account the internal flow and the effect of sloshing in their method the ship motion is solved by the three dimensional frequency domain panel method and the internal fluid motion is solved by the modified vof method gao et al 2013 simulated the motion of one damaged ro ro ship coupled with damaged flow in which the ship motions in waves were calculated with the use of strip theory and flows inside the damaged compartment were calculated by rans equation hashimoto et al 2015 simulated the transient behavior of ships by coupling the three dimensional mps method with the conventional 2d strip method the studies above inspire us to establish a method that can combine cfd and potential theory to investigate the hydrodynamics of floodwater and its effects on the damaged ship motions in this paper a unified viscous and potential prediction method uvap is proposed in which the three dimensional time domain hybrid source method is used for the calculation of damaged ship motion in waves and the fully viscous cfd method is used for the simulation of floodwater two boundary condition forms for damaged opening and two time scales are introduced then the time domain coupling between damaged ship motion and damaged floodwater are simulated based on this method by taking the ittc benchmark model as an example we exchanged our research results in issw 2019 bu and gu 2019 and this paper gives more detailed introduction about this method and also more detailed comparisons of the results in calm water 2 unified viscous and

the hull fixed coordinate system which undertakes synchronous motion with the hull for convenience of calculation the reference coordinate system o x y z is introduced and the o x y plane is located at the mean water level with the origin o just above or below the center of gravity g three dimensional time domain hybrid source method is used for the calculation of damaged ship motions the field domain contains two sub domains divided by an virtual arbitrary control surface sc as shown in fig 2 the inner field domain i is a closed area with three boundaries the wetted hull surface sb the partial free surface sf1 close to the ship body and the control surface sc while the outer field domain ii is an area closed by the control surface sc the remaining free surface sf2 and the virtual boundary s at infinity zhang et al 1998 liu and papanikolaou 2011 bu et al 2019a 2019b the total perturbation potential φi p t in the inner field domain satisfies the following conditions 3 2 φ i 0 inner 2 φ i 2 t g φ i z 0 on s f 1 t 0 φ i n v n φ w n on s b t 0 φ i φ i t 0 at t 0 the boundary integral equation of rankine source in the inner field domain i can be written as follows 4 2 π φ i p

the panel can be calculated by integrating the pressure along the wetted surface 8 f s b p n d s m s b r n p d s where r n the radial and normal vectors defined in the hull fixed coordinate system then we can obtain the added mass coefficient the damping coefficient the froude krylov force the hydrostatic force and the diffraction force in eq 2 2 3 fully viscous method for damaged floodwater the internal force and moment due to the viscous flow of floodwater and tank sloshing in eq 2 can be computed by the viscous method and can be given as 9 f in s f p f s n d s m in s r f f p f s n d s where f p and f s are the pressure and shear force acting on the compartment wall respectively these forces can be calculated by the commercial cfd software meanwhile the viscous flow solver needs to be secondary developed to couple with the potential flow solver in time domain the governing equations of flow field include the continuity equation the momentum equation and the phase volume fraction equation which are expressed as follows 10 t v ρ d v s ρ u u g n d s 0 t v ρ u d v s ρ u u u g n d s v ω u d v s p i n d s v ρ g d v s μ u u t d s t v α d v s α u u g n d s 0 where ρ is the mixture

equations are associated with volume fraction through density ρ and viscous coefficient μ in the whole viscous flow calculation region once the force and moment acting on the compartment wall are calculated they will serve as the initial conditions for the next iteration of eq 2 2 4 calculation process of uvap method the calculation process of the unified viscous and potential prediction method is the following see fig 3 1 initialization of ship motion by time domain potential flow solver including initial time meshing and the calculation of hydrodynamic coefficients 2 initialization of the viscous flow field within the damaged compartment including the pressure and velocity fields free surface etc 3 the time domain potential flow solver calculates the hydrodynamic and wave induced forces to solve the ship equations of motion this step involves also establishing of the boundary conditions of the flow field in the rans solution such as the boundary conditions of the computational domain or the boundary condition of the damaged opening 4 the boundary conditions calculated by time domain potential method are transferred to cfd method 5 after the boundary conditions are transferred to the viscous flow solver it initializes the calculations of the floodwater ingress and egress of the damaged opening as well as the flow of water and tank sloshing inside the damaged compartment then the relatively steady state internal forces and moments due to floodwater and sloshing in certain time interval can be obtained after a series of internal iterations 6 the internal forces and moments calculated by viscous flow solver are transferred to the time domain potential flow solver 7 the hydrodynamic loads due to floodwater are treated as one part of the external forces acting on the hull and the ship s equations of motion are solved by the fourth order runge kutta method 8 the updated motions of the damaged compartment obtained from the solution of the ship motion equation are transferred to the cfd method 9 repeat 3 8 until the calculation is completed 3 research object and numerical model 3 1 research object the ittc benchmark model for progressive flooding is selected as the research object the experimental data was provided by napa ltd and aalto university for the validation of numerical method ruponen 2006 ruponen et al 2007 this model is a barge with eight interconnected compartments as seen in fig 4 its principal dimensions are given in table 1 the model tests were conducted in calm water the damaged compartments are situated in the middle of the hull towards the bow of the ship compartments and connections are shown in fig 5 and table 2 the damage opening is located at the mid length of the side wall of compartment r21s 185 mm below the waterline in the study presented in this paper db1 and db2 in the lower compartment are not connected with the upper compartment and therefore they will not be flooded in the simulation 3 2 numerical model the heave roll and pitch motions are free with other motions constrained in the experiment thus we also adopt three degrees of freedom heave roll pitch mathematical model for the calculation of damaged motion coupled with damaged flow in order to comparing the calculation results and experimental results eq 2 can be simplified as 11 m a 33 x 3 b 33 x 3 j 4 5 a 3 j x j b 3 j x j f 3 f k h f 3 d f f 3 in i i i a i i x i b i i x i j 3 i 5 a i j x j b i j x j f i f k h f i d f f i in i 4 5 the linear roll damping coefficient is used in this case because only this coefficient is available up to now the roll damping moment can be calculated based on the critical roll damping coefficient 12 b 44 ς 2 i x x a 44 m g g m where ς is the critical roll damping coefficient obtained from experiment ruponen et al 2007 fig 6 shows the linear order panels used for the calculation of damaged ship motion in the potential part of the unified viscous and potential prediction method fig 7 shows the meshes used for the calculation of damaged flow in the viscous part of this unified prediction method and the meshes around the openings are all refined 3 3 time scale and coordinate system the potential flow solver can afford a step with longer time because the mesh size is larger than that in viscous flow solver conversely the mesh size in viscous flow should be small enough especially around the small scale openings and the small size means the requirement of the short time step as a result it is necessary to introduce two distinct time scales for potential and viscous flow solvers we use fast and slow time scales in the time domain solution and the method of multi step superposition is used for the coupling between these two flow solvers for example if the time step associated with the potential flow solver is given as δt then the viscous flow is solved in n inner time steps with equal time interval of δt 1 where δt nδt 1 and the value of n depends on the courant number the floodwater forces after the n inner time steps are applied to the ship s equations of motion to ensure the unification of the two flow solvers in calculation time the schematic diagram is shown in fig 8 except for the time scale the coordinate systems used in potential flow part and viscous flow part should also be matched with each other the local coordinate system is introduced into the calculation of viscous solver and it is aligned with the inertial coordinate system used in the calculation of ship motions as shown in fig 9 the forces acting on the compartment are calculated based on the instantaneous position of the gravity center all calculated forces need to be converted to forces in the earth fixed coordinate system and then added together 3 4 boundary conditions for the damage opening the calculation of damaged ship motion also needs to consider the hydrodynamic forces caused by the inflow and outflow of floodwater through damaged opening it requires the accurate calculation of the flowrate through the damaged opening thus the boundary conditions applied at the damaged opening should guarantee the match between potential flow theory and viscous flow theory three different methods for handling of the boundary condition at the damage opening are utilized in the unified viscous and potential prediction method 1 far field pressure boundary condition the far field pressure boundary condition is applied to the domain constructed by constraining the entire cfd domain with two parallel planes aligned with the front and rear end of the damaged compartments gao et al 2013 as shown in fig 10 the front and back sections of the computational domain are slip wall boundary conditions while the upper and lower boundary conditions are far field pressure boundary conditions the corresponding pressure conditions are determined according to the position of the free surface the interior and exterior walls of the compartment use the wall boundary condition 2 near field pressure boundary condition the idea of near field pressure boundary condition originates from our finding during fully viscous simulation we found that the velocity field in the proximity of the damage opening presents a hemispherical transition zone therefore the computational domain consists of the interior region and a hemispherical region near the damage opening as shown in fig 11 the cfd solver does not need to set the free surface position when this boundary condition is used because there is no inconsistency of the free surface between viscous flow and potential flow the simulation part includes the damaged compartment and hemispherical region therefore the slip wall boundary conditions are employed as the boundary condition of the damaged compartment and the pressure inlet boundary condition is applied on the outer wall of the hemispherical region 3 hatch pressure boundary condition the idea of hatch pressure boundary condition stems from the problem of orifice and pipeline flow the computational domain of this method includes only the interior of the damaged compartment as shown in fig 12 the slip wall boundary conditions are also employed as the boundary condition of the damaged compartment and the pressure inlet boundary condition is applied at the damaged opening there is no external flow field and the flow into the compartment is entirely determined by the pressure applied at the damage opening the pressure directly calculated by potential flow solver needs to be corrected due to the pressure loss which is similar to the setting of the local pressure loss coefficient in the problem of the orifice and pipeline flow herein the hatch pressure boundary condition in viscous flow calculation is given by modifying the pressure in the hatch obtained from potential flow calculation the pressure at the damage opening in cfd calculations is given as 13 p v k p 0 where p v is the pressure at the damage opening in cfd calculation p 0 is the pressure near the damaged opening calculated by the potential flow solver including the first and second order pressure caused by incident wave and disturbance potential k is the local loss coefficient of the pressure fig 13 presents the value of k used in this paper initial value of the coefficient k is 0 6 and it increases gradually after 10s these values are obtained by the detailed comparisons of the calculated results with fully cfd simulation results such as the comparisons of the ship motion the amount of floodwater the velocity and the pressure field at different time steps of course the universal selection law of this coefficient requires further research for different damaged conditions 4 fully viscous simulation and validation 4 1 setup for simulation we firstly validated the calculation accuracy of the fully viscous method for the damaged ship motion coupled with the floodwater by taking this barge ship as an example similar studies were also conducted by caldas et al 2018 and hu et al 2019 they investigated the dynamics of this model based on the commercial cfd software the numerical simulations for the damaged ship motion are performed by solving unsteady rans equation the free surface is modelled with the two phase vof approach with a high resolution interface capturing hric scheme based on the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes the pressure correction algorithm of simple type is used for the pressure velocity coupling an algebraic multi grid amg solver is used to accelerate the convergence of the solution a segregated flow solver approach is utilized for all simulations the dimensions of the computational domain are 15 m 15 m 10 m the meshing utilises the technique of overlapping grid the wall boundary condition is applied to the hull surface and the pressure outlet condition is used for the external computational domain there are two sets of grids in the computational domain as shown in fig 14 background grid which contains the whole flow field and the overlapping grid containing the hull and the surrounding flow field data exchange between these two sets of grids is carried out by interpolation near the interface 4 2 simulation results and validation fig 15 depicts the calculation of flooding process at different time steps and the maximum simulation time is 300s we compare the profiles of the free surface inside the damaged compartment at different moments with experimental results as shown in fig 16 we also compare the height of water level calculated by cfd method with experimental results at the same measuring position as shown in fig 17 the calculations of floodwater levels in different compartments are in good agreement with model test results which validates the feasibility of the viscous method for the calculation of flooding process fig 18 shows the calculation results of heave pitch and roll motions for better comparisons the average values per period are used in the cfd simulation results the consistency between simulation results and experimental results further validates the calculation accuracy of cfd method for damaged ship motion in calm water 5 simulation results by unified prediction method and analysis 5 1 analysis of flooding process in order to verify the reliability of the nonlinear time domain unified viscous and potential prediction method proposed in this paper the numerical results calculated by different ways of handling boundary conditions at the damage opening are compared with the experimental data the mesh quantity used for calculations are 1 3 million cells for the fully cfd simulation 620 000 cells for the unified prediction method with the far field pressure boundary condition 320 000 cells for the unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition and 300 000 cells for the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary fig 19 shows the flow inside the compartment calculated by different methods it can be observed in these figures that the transient inflow shows strong non linear characteristics at t 5s the unified viscous and potential prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition can simulate the non linear transient inflow better than that with far field boundary condition at the moment of t 25s the floodwater begins to flow to the other side the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condition offers the closest match to the calculation results of cfd simulation at this time instant the unified prediction method with far field pressure boundary condition overestimates the inflow water while the unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition proposed in this paper underestimates the inflow water the inflow water is quite small at this time hence its impact on the ship behaviour may be relatively small the flooding process tend to be stable with the increase of time overall the unified prediction method with three different boundary conditions captures the flow process very well fig 20 shows the comparison of velocity fields computed by different methods it can be note from the figures that the unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition calculates the velocity field well but the velocities calculated by the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condition are relatively small at t 5s however the accuracy becomes better with the increase of time overall there is little difference in the velocity fields calculated by the full cfd method and the unified prediction method with different boundary conditions near field pressure boundary far field pressure boundary and hatch pressure boundary and the comparison results between different methods validate the applicability of the boundary conditions proposed in this paper fig 21 shows the comparison of pressure fields calculated by fully cfd method and the unified prediction method with three different boundary conditions it can be seen from the figures that the unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condition calculates the pressure field well but the pressure calculated by the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condition are relatively small at t 5s as similar to the results of velocity field overall there is little difference in pressure fields calculated by the full cfd method and the unified prediction method with three different boundary conditions which further verify the applicability of the boundary conditions for the study of damaged ship motion coupled with floodwater 5 2 analysis of damaged ship motion the results calculated by the unified viscous and potential prediction method fully viscous method and model test are compared in fig 22 for the roll motion errors calculated by the unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condition are relatively large at the initial stage this may be caused by the errors in the calculation of floodwater inflow roll damping etc the errors can be neglected because the roll motion is very small for the heave and pitch motions the calculated results of fully viscous simulation unified prediction method with far field pressure boundary condition unified prediction method with near field pressure boundary condtion and unified prediction method with hatch pressure boundary condtion are all in good agreement with the results of model tests the comparisons of the time domain motions calculated by unified viscous and potential prediction method with different boundary conditions prove that the unified method and the boundary conditions for the match between viscous and potential can be used for the calculation of the damaged ship motion therefore we can deduce that the unified viscous and potential prediction method with our proposed boundary conditions is a reliable and practical method for the prediction of damaged ship motion especially for the study of the interaction between damaged ship motion and flooding 5 3 analysis of calculation costs table 3 illustrates the mesh quantity and calculation time cost by different methods the mesh quantity for fully viscous cfd method is about 1 3 million and it needs 100 h to complete 50s calculation by using 40 cores parallel computing in the cluster the number of grids for the unified method with the far field pressure boundary condtion is 620 000 and it takes about 150 h to complete the 50s calculation by using 5 cores in the ordinary desktop computer the number of grids for the unified method with the near field pressure boundary condtion and hatch pressure boundary condtion is basically 300 000 and it takes about 100 h to complete 50s calculation by using 5 cores in the ordinary desktop computer the data in table 3 clearly tell us that the unified viscous and potential prediction method can save a lot of time compared with cfd simulation we can also see that the unified viscous and potential prediction method with our proposed boundary conditions near field boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition cut down the computing time compared to that with far field pressure boundary primarily because the calculation of the unified viscous and potential prediction method with far field pressure boundary needs to include a relatively large computational domain outside the damaged opening and the mesh quantity is much larger than that calculated with near field boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition theoretically the calculation domain of viscous flow is cut parallel to the damaged opening under far field boundary condition it will lead to the inconsistency of free surface between the potential and viscous solutions in the calculation of wave conditions especially when the incoming flow is vertical or intersecting with the damaged opening in contrast the free surface is naturally consistent under the near field pressure boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition and they can be used to calculate damaged ship motion under different wave directions and ship speeds we will further investigate the application of different boundary conditions in waves in the future 6 conclusion in this paper a unified viscous and potential prediction method uvap method for damaged ship stability is proposed based on the real time interactive iteration of three dimensional time domain hybrid source method and viscous cfd method this uvap method combines the advantage of the three dimensional time domain hybrid source method in calculating extreme motion of ship in waves and the advantage of cfd method in detailed simulation for hull floodwater interaction two time scales are introduced and two boundary condition forms for damage opening in the unified model are proposed the research and analysis show that 1 the unified viscous and potential prediction method established in this paper can be effectively applied to the study of real time coupled damaged flow of damaged ships 2 the comparisons of flow process velocity pressure with full cfd method and model tests verify the effectiveness of the proposed unified viscous and potential prediction method for the prediction of damaged ship stability in calm water 3 the proposed near field pressure boundary condition and hatch pressure boundary condition for the damaged opening can significantly reduce the mesh quantity and save the computation time without compromising the accuracy of calculations we are still validating the accuracy of this unified viscous and potential prediction method for the

numerically the results presented herein provide important guidance to better understand the hydrodynamic performance of this new structure type keywords morison equation dumbbell shaped cylinder wave and current force drag and inertia coefficients wave flume experiment 1 introduction a growing number of sea crossing bridges have been built in china in recent years e g the east sea bridge the hangzhou bay bridge and the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge the pingtan straits rail cum road bridge is still under construction for most sea crossing bridges mentioned above elevated caps with pile groups are commonly applied as foundations deng et al 2019 the bridge cofferdam with various cross sections acting as a truncated column is often used to construct the elevated bridge cap in the marine environment bridge cofferdams with various cross sections are widely applied in actual bridge engineering for example the truncated circular cylinder is commonly used due to its advantage of good structural performance under wave or wave current actions the truncated rectangular bridge cofferdam is usually adopted in shallow water conditions especially in non navigable areas due to its advantage of rapid construction the truncated quasi ellipse bridge cofferdam is used broadly to adapt the transverse layout of the sea crossing long span bridge pylon constructions the bridge cofferdam may suffer large wave and current forces under severe marine conditions of strong wave and current actions which will have strong control over its design and construction thus the accurate predictions of wave current forces need to be taken into consideration to obtain a better design and safer construction wave interactions with a truncated cylinder with circular cross section have been widely investigated analytically e g garret 1971 eatock taylor and hung 1987 eatock taylor and huang 1997 li and liu 2019 and experimentally boo 2006 yuan and huang 2010 some researchers have paid attention to the wave current interactions with vertical truncated circular cylinder kim and celebi 1998 studied three dimensional fully nonlinear wave current interactions with a truncated circular cylinder using simple rankin sources and a mixed eulerian and lagrangian mel time marching scheme however the numerical model is properly robust accurate when the relevant keulegan carpenter number is less than2 except when incident waves are too steep or current velocities are too large celebi 2001 established a numerical model to simulate nonlinear transient wave interactions with a truncated circular cylinder in a steady uniform current in which the indirect desingularized boundary integral equation method was used to solve the mixed initial boundary value problem different from the numerical model above park et al 2001 investigated the similar problem of nonlinear wave current interactions with a stationary truncated circular cylinder using the ns equation and a marker and cell method the viscous numerical wave tank model can produce reasonable results for higher harmonic wave run up which are more sensitive to changes in current speed some scholars have also given analytical solution to the problem above mazarakos and mavrakos 2013 presented a new method to solve the diffraction problem around a fixed truncated circular cylinder under combined wave and weak current actions double expansions of the velocity potential in terms of the wave slope and the strouhal number were solved the first order and second order horizontal forces demonstrate the significance of the current contribution to the total hydrodynamic loading in addition to the case of a truncated cylinder of circular cross section wave or wave current interactions with a cylinder of rectangular section have also attracted some attention shankar et al 1983 investigated the wave forces moments and wave pattern for square and rectangular cylinder under various angles of wave incidence numerically based on the finite element formulation of the linear diffraction problem harmel derouich 1991 investigated the wave forces on large smooth rectangular cylinders of five different aspect ratios at low keulegan carpenter numbers experimentally which made great contribution to wave loads on vertical rectangular cylinder to further study the effects of currents along the waves harmel derouich 1993 carried out experiments with smooth sharp edged rectangular cylinders the inertia drag and other force coefficients corresponding to low keulegan carpenter numbers up to a value of 4 were measured venugopal et al 2000 conducted a detailed experimental investigation of regular and random wave forces acting on a surface piercing truncated rectangular cylinder at different aspect ratios following the study mentioned above venugopal et al 2008 then carried out a series of experiments to study the drag and inertia coefficients for horizontally submerged rectangular cylinders in waves and currents some researchers studied the same problem by numerical simulation lin et al 2003 established a 3d navier stokes model to investigate wave current interactions with a vertical square cylinder which indicated that the vortex effect around the sharp edged cylinder should not be ignored under combined wave current interactions kang et al 2013 used a similar numerical model to study wave current interactions with a square cylinder at different reynolds numbers clear flow separation and vortex shedding may be formed around the square cylinder when the current speed exceeds the maximum wave induced fluid particle velocity however in both studies above the wave deformation induced by nonlinear wave current interactions e g current effect on wavelength and wave height was not considered as regards cylinder with other cross section wave diffraction problem by a truncated quasi ellipse cylinder have also been investigated wang et al 2011 investigated nonlinear wave forces on quasi ellipse caissons numerically based on the finite difference method and the volume of fluid method the effect of the parameters of relative wave height relative caisson width and relative length width ratio on the wave forces of the quasi ellipse caisson was studied wave diffraction problem of the similar cylinder was investigated by liu et al 2018 in their study the diffraction potential solutions were solved by expanding the radius function of a truncated cylinder surface into a fourier series and using the method of separation of variables the wave elevation and wave excitation forces for different cases are solved by the analytical model to better adapt the transverse layout of pylon constructions for long span and deep water navigation bridges a new structure type of dumbbell shaped bridge cofferdams has been adopted to construct the elevated cap foundations of the pylons as shown in fig 1 from actual engineering practice e g pingtan straits rail cum road bridge it is found that the wave current force is the predominant load on the bridge cofferdam zhang 2017 xu 2018 however there have been few physical model tests or numerical simulations investigating the wave current forces of such structures the hydrodynamic characteristics of the dumbbell shaped cylinder under combined wave and current conditions have not been well known by bridge engineers which is not conducive to structural design and construction plan formulation this study provides reliable experimental and numerical predictions of the hydrodynamic force coefficients of a typical dumbbell shaped bridge cofferdam in the combined wave and current environment wave only and wave current forces were measured in the wave flume tests the drag coefficients c d and inertia coefficients c m under wave current actions were derived based on the modified morison equations and linear wave theory the hydrodynamic characteristics of the dumbbell shaped cylinder were then compared with those of the circular cylinder with equal submergence depth and projected area to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics and wave current structure interactions of dumbbell shaped cylinders under extreme wave current conditions an earlier established model kang et al 2015 was developed and validated with the same dumbbell shaped cylinder a combined wave current interaction problem was studied the developed les model lin and li 2003 was coupled to the model to simulate the wave current induced turbulence around the cylinder the viscous numerical model was adopted to cross check both the numerical and experimental results 2 experimental setup 2 1 dumbbell shaped cofferdam model the experiments were carried out in the combined wave current channel at the deep water large span bridge laboratory southwest jiaotong university china fig 2 a shows an illustration of the wave flume used in this study the flume is 60 m long 2 0 m wide and 1 8 m high and equipped with a hydraulic piston type wave generator in this experiment a rigid steel frame at the middle part of the wave flume was used to fix the dynamometer and cofferdam models the test specimen was fixed to the middle part by a rigid connection structure and connected with a 3 component dynamometer the rigid connection structure was located at the top of the specimen and the bottom of the sensor to provide enough clearance the prototype bridge cofferdam is a steel suspended box structure in shape it is designed to be a dumbbell shaped truncated cylinder which is 15 m in transverse width 33 9 m in longitudinal width and 30 m in height generally the draft of the bridge cofferdam is determined by the elevation of the elevated cap bottom and its height in this study the cofferdam was partially submerged with a draft d 0 of 12 0 m the water depth of the cofferdam was fixed at 48 0 m considering the wave flume size wave and current conditions and capacities of the measuring instruments the test model was designed at a model scale of 1 60 model prototype the structure model was rigidly installed and positioned approximately 28 5 m away from the wave maker whose design avoids any vibrations and movements during the wave current impact detailed dimensions of the dumbbell shaped cylinder model are shown in fig 2 a d 2 2 testing conditions experiments were conducted at a constant water depth of d 0 8 m under different wave only and wave current conditions as shown in tables 1 2 waves propagating in the opposite direction as currents namely opposing current waves u 0 owc and waves propagating in the same direction as currents namely following current waves u 0 fwc were both considered in this study in the experiments wave current conditions were generated using the same method as that of chen et al 2017 for wave only conditions regular wave interactions with dumbbell shaped cylinders were considered first for the current only condition the current was not generated until the current velocity remained steady for the wave current condition the current only condition was generated first and the same wave generator control signal as with the wave only condition was then used finally wave current forces around the cylinder were measured when both the waves and the currents remained sufficiently stable zhang et al 2020 used the same wave flume to investigate wave current forces on a box girder and demonstrated that the current generated by the bidirectional axial flow pump in the pipe is stable and essentially uniform over the water depth although we can observe that the measured current profile is slightly sheared near the flume bottom it has little effect on the surface waves because strong sheared flow is limited to a very thin fluid layer above the flume bottom thus the generated current in the wave flume can be considered uniform over the water depth chen et al 2017 2 3 uncertainty analysis according to the procedure recommended by the international towing tank conference ittc the uncertainties analysis performed for these wave flume tests are given below generally two types of uncertainties need to be considered in this study type a random and type b systematic elhanafi et al 2017 type a uncertainty can be evaluated by using a statistical analysis of several repeated observations with repeated and same quantity the wave current induced water level and force results exhibited good repeatability which can effectively reduce type a uncertainty the main factors affecting the type b uncertainty in the tests of wave current actions on the dumbbell shaped cylinder model are listed below a model geometry the maximum allowed dimensional deviation was chosen as 1 0 mm based on the experiences in the model fabrication and tests it is believed that this deviation will lead to minor effects on model behavior since it has little influence on submerged volume model symmetry b waves calibration the calibrated waves were measured using wave gauges with uncertainties of less than 0 1 mm the wave height was allowed a maximum deviation at 4 and the wave period was allowed a maximum deviation at 2 c currents calibration acoustic doppler velocimetry adv was used to measure the current speed with the uncertainties as less than 0 5 d set up uncertainties the position and direction of the dumbbell shaped cofferdam model was checked before each test which was done according to the lines crossing the wave flume position of the wave probe was allowed a maximum deviation of in the longitudinal and transverse directions and 2 mm in the water depth direction the draft of the dumbbell shaped cofferdam model was allowed a maximum deviation of 1 mm e wave wave current forces measurements 3 component dynamometer with a capacity of 475n for the horizontal wave forces was used to measure the x axis wave or wave current forces of the dumbbell shaped cofferdam model the system uncertainties were estimated as less than 1 5 95 confidence level percent of full scale load the uncertainty of hydrodynamic coefficients c m and c d will be mainly affected by the force measurement uncertainty 2 4 data sampling to investigate the wave parameters only a wave gauge with a sampling rate of 100 hz and a precision of 0 1 mm was placed at the center of the model location when the wave flow field was stable totally 10 cycles of waveforms were conducted and the final results were the average wave heights of these cycles two acoustic doppler velocimeters adv v1 v2 with an accuracy of 0 5 and a sampling rate of 200 hz were adopted to measure the current velocity v1 was set at the center of the model location and v2 was set 2 0 m upstream of the model the current profile without the model was measured to ensure that the generated current can be considered uniform over the water depth during the model test the current generation system produced a stable flow field its current velocity was measured and verified by the acoustic doppler velocimeter adv v2 the collection frequency of the three component dynamometer was 200 hz when the wave flow field was stable 10 cycles of waveforms and force data were conducted twice for each wave only or wave current case 3 theory and data analysis 3 1 wave field in currents due to the interaction of wave and current the current will affect the propagation of the wave and then change the characteristics of wave e g wave height and wavelength meanwhile the current flow field will also be affected by the surface wave a number of researchers have investigated the wave current interactions e g li 1990 and hegdes and lee 1992 here several research conclusions from their studies will be applied in the following section as mentioned before the generated current in the wave flume can be considered steady and uniform over the entire water depth thus based on linear wave theory and the wave action flux conservation principle the transformation of the wave height h is defined as follows li 1990 1 h h 0 1 u c 0 5 l s l 0 5 a s a d 0 5 1 u c 2 a d a d 0 5 2 a d 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d 3 a s 1 2 k s d sinh 2 k s d where h 0 l s and k s are the static wave height wavelength and wavenumber under wave actions without current respectively additionally l c and d are the current affected wavelength wave celerity and water depth respectively the wave number k is determined by the modified dispersion relation 4 ω k u 2 g k tanh k h according to linear wave theory a designated fluid particle velocity of a uniform current can be applied for the inlet boundary 5 u x u h 2 ω k u cosh k z d sinh k d cos k x ω t 6 u z h 2 ω k u sinh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t where ω 2 π t is the angular frequency k is the current affected wavenumber h is the current affected wave height and t is the wave period the water surface elevation η is written as 7 η h 2 sin k x ω t 3 2 wave current forces calculations the modified semiempirical force model morison et al 1950 is adopted here to evaluate hydrodynamic forces acting on a cylinder taking the effect of currents iwagaki 1984 into account 8 f x 1 2 c d ρ a u w u u w u c m ρ v u w where f x is the horizontal hydrodynamic force acting on the cylinder a is the projected area of the cylinder on the plane perpendicular to the wave propagation v is the volume of the cylinder u w is the wave induced horizontal velocity and u w is the horizontal particle acceleration both assumed to follow the linear airy wave theory with the current affected wave height and wave length u is the current velocity assumed to be uniform in depth u represents the uniform current opposing the direction of wave propagation ρ is the water density and c d and c m are the nondimensional drag and inertia coefficients under wave current actions respectively 3 3 predominant parameters for expressing the hydrodynamic force coefficients the new definition for kc numbers iwagaki et al 1984 is introduced to express hydrodynamic force coefficients in the coexisting wave current field 9 k c u m t d sin φ π φ cos φ u u m k c π u t d u u m where φ arccos u u m u m is the maximum wave induced fluid particle velocity and d is the diameter of the

parameter in this study the kc number range of the experimental wave only and wave current cases was 0 8 8 0 the tested range of re numbers was 0 4 1 84 105 and β varied from 2 16 105 to 7 35 105 based on equations 1 8 the theoretical wave only u 0 or wave current forces can be calculated the least square method minimizing the total errors between the theoretical wave only or wave current results and experimental data is applied to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c m 4 test results analysis 4 1 current affected wave height analysis to investigate the effect of the wave periods t and uniform current u on the wave heights twenty three different cases were studied the input values are summarized in table 2 the measured time series of wave elevations at gauge g0 for the cases of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m u 0 0 m s and u 0 4 m s are shown in fig 3 compared with that of wave only actions see fig 3 a the wave amplitudes decrease under the following current actions see fig 3 b as a result the dispersion relation and the corresponding surface elevation formula are modified under combined wave current actions ryu et al 2003 fig 4 a shows the wave height change against different wave periods t with different wave current parameters compared with the wave only condition w the wave height h current affected wave height under owc changes by approximately 30 and 20 when t is equal to 1 0 s and 1 8 s respectively the wave deformation with a shorter period is affected more by the current velocity due to nonlinear wave current interactions fig 4 b shows the wave height change against various current velocities with different wave current parameters as shown in fig 4 b the opposing current u 0 amplifies the wave height and the current affected wave height h changes by approximately 11 and 40 when u is equal to 0 1 m s and 0 2 m s respectively t 1 4 s h 0 0 12 m the current affected wave height decreases more substantially due to the fwc actions as the current velocity u increases for example compared with the case of the wave only condition t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m the current affected wave height h changes by approximately 6 and 26 when u equals 0 1 m s and 0 4 m s respectively fig 4 c shows the relationship between the current affected wave height and kc numbers under different wave current conditions the plot of fig 3 c shows that the current affected wave height change exhibits more scatter under opposing current waves compared to the case under following current waves the current affected wave height decreases as the kc numbers increase under following current wave actions 4 2 hydrodynamic force analysis 4 2 1 hydrodynamic coefficients analysis in this section the modified morison formula equation 8 is adopted to evaluate the drag and inertia coefficients of the dumbbell shaped cylinder under combined wave current actions in which the current affected wave parameters are calculated by equations 1 6 the drag and inertia coefficients versus the kc numbers under different flow conditions are presented in fig 5 including the w actions owc actions and fwc actions fig 5 a indicates that c m exhibits more scatter under the action of opposing current waves with the increase in the kc numbers under the following current wave action both c m and c d values are concentrated and have a good correlation with the kc numbers this reflects that c d under wave only actions is more dispersed especially under low kc numbers showing that throughout the range of the kc number tested the inertia coefficients c m exhibit less scatter than that of the drag coefficients c d in this section we changed the wave periods t between 0 85 s and 1 8 s with the same wave height h 0 0 08 m to consider various kc numbers which range from 0 8 to 2 5 the inertia coefficient c m increases with increasing kc numbers when the kc number exceeds 1 0 c m approaches a steady value of 1 30 the drag coefficients c d decrease with increasing kc and exhibit larger values at low kc numbers refer to fig 5 b the time history curves of in line wave only and wave current forces obtained with the computed c d and c m values for the dumbbell shaped cylinder are provided as well for four kc numbers kc 0 92 2 01 3 52 8 04 in fig 6 a d to increase the data readability and clarity of the figures it is noted that only 4 cycles of measured results are given after the wave only or wave current interaction reached a steady state in the following sections the measured force time series agrees well with the generated wave only and wave current forces obtained by the modified morison equations 1 to 8 to verify the accuracy of the computed c d and c m the peak values of computed and measured wave only and wave current forces acquired by substituting the hydrodynamic coefficients in equation 8 are also shown in fig 7 through the comparison it can be concluded that the modified morison equations can properly evaluate the peak forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder 4 2 2 comparison of simple wave current force estimation methods in this section the measured wave current forces wc are compared with linear summation of the measured wave only w and current only forces c on the dumbbell shaped cylinder fig 8 a b compares the wave current force time series θ 0 with the same wave current parameters of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 2 m s and 0 4 m s it is shown that the measured wave current force is clearly smaller than a linear combination of the wave only and current only forces linear sum due to nonlinear wave current interactions when the current velocity u is relatively small little difference can be found between them refer to fig 8 a where u 0 2 m s as the current velocity u increases a greater difference can be observed especially for the minimum wave current forces as shown in fig 8 b where u 0 4 m s to better quantify the difference fig 8 c shows the measured peak value of horizontal wave current forces and the linear summation of the wave only and current only forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder θ 0 here each point represents the mean value over a complete time series this reveals that the positive or negative forces may be overestimated or underestimated by the simple linear summation of wave only and current only forces to clarify an overall measurement error the following ratios are defined ψ f x w c max f x w max f x c f x w c max 100 12 ξ f x w c min f x w min f x c f x w c min 100 where f x w c max and f x w c min are the measured peak wave current forces in the x direction f x w max and f x w min are the measured peak wave only forces and f x c is the measured steady current only force the peak forces are calculated from the average peak values over a complete time series the variation in the ratios versus incident angles θ is shown in fig 8 d e this reflects that the ratio of ψ reaches approximately 36 19 under different wave current actions the ratio of ξ shows a large value for the minimum forces especially for larger current velocities e g it even approaches more than 80 for the case of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 4 m s the results indicate that the linear summation of the wave only and current only forces overestimates the actual peak wave current forces including the maximum and minimum values acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder for fwc comparatively the linear summation values may underestimate the actual peak wave current forces for most cases of owc in practice this overestimation or underestimation would bring about unnecessary economic waste and unfavorable factors when considering the wave current forces on bridge cofferdams by simple superposition 5 numerical simulation in this section a 3d numerical model based on a multiple layer σ coordinate three dimensional model and immersed boundary method kang et al 2015 was applied to investigate the wave current interactions with the dumbbell shaped cylinder the numerical results were compared with the experimental data and used to further investigate the mechanics of wave current forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder after model validation 5 1 mathematical model a developed multiple layer σ coordinate three dimensional model lin 2006 based on the navier stokes equations is adopted to prescribe the motions of incompressible wave and current fluid particles based on this numerical model the immersed boundary method was supplemented to simulate the irregular structure kang et al 2015 in this study to simulate the turbulent flows induced by nonlinear wave current structure interactions the les model deardorff 1970 is incorporated into the established mathematical model kang et al 2015 large scale eddy motions and small scale turbulent fluctuation simulations are solved by a large eddy simulation method a spatial filter is applied to the original navier stokes equations and the relevant modified governing equations are as follows 13 u x u σ σ x v y v σ σ y

and the stress terms τ can be found from lin 2006 the governing equation for the free surface movement η is as follows 19 η t x h η u d z y h η v d z 0 both free surface and velocities are provided based on either laboratory measurement or theoretical expression in the inflow boundary condition the dispersion relation equation 4 and wave making boundary have been used in a number of numerical models for wave current interactions e g ryu et al 2003 chen et al 2017 and kim et al 2016 etc to simulate linear wave propagation in steady and uniform currents several researchers zhao 2007 li 1990 xu et al 2013 2014 have applied the inflow boundary condition from equations 1 7 and obtained good agreement between the numerical model results and the experimental data for our study the same inflow boundary condition is applied which we can find from fig 4 a b that the transformation of wave height is in good agreement with the theoretical results i e equations 1 7 of li 1990 other boundary conditions including the bottom boundary the free surface and the outgoing boundary setup are described by kang et al 2015 5 2 verification of the numerical model the multilayer σ coordinate transformation model can capture the free surface wave well lin 2006 to verify its accuracy the nonuniform grid system is adopted in the horizontal domain in this section it is noted that all the numerical models are based on the same model scale as the test model the numerical convergence tests of the mesh and time interval discretization were conducted with the case of static wave height h 0 0 12 m wave period t 1 6 s and u 0 0 m s to accurately simulate wave elevations without the structure three different meshes were used a coarse mesh 40 meshes per wavelength an intermediate mesh 50 meshes per wavelength and a fine mesh 60 meshes per wavelength fig 9 shows the time history of the free surface at gauge g0 under three different meshes in all three cases above 20 meshes were applied across the depth of the numerical wave flume with the first layer depth h 1 d d 0 0 6 m the meshes of first layer n1 14 the second layer depth h 2 0 0 m the meshes of second layer n2 0 and the third layer depth h 3 d 0 0 2 m the meshes of third layer n3 6 comparatively a lower wave elevation amplitude can be found when the course mesh 40 meshes per wavelength was adopted the intermediate and fine meshes can capture the wave elevations well indicating that an intermediate mesh is sufficient for application to properly simulate the wave forces acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder as before mesh convergence tests were performed to determine the optimal finest mesh size near the structure surfaces three cases of dxmin dymin 0 025 m 0 0125 m and 0 00625 m near the structure surface were considered for all cases the time step dt should be restricted by the courant number kang et al 2015 showing that dt 0 001 s performs good enough to obtain steady results for better observation the grids information with coarse intermediate and finer grid sizes closed to the cylinder zone are given in fig 10 a c fig 10 d shows the time history of horizontal wave forces acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder under the three above different meshes for the mesh case of dxmin dymin 0 025 m the wave force values were lower than those of the experimental data there was no significant difference in the simulation force results between the case of dxmin dymin 0 0125 m and that of dxmin dymin 0 00625 m therefore the final grid resolutions for the following numerical cases adopted were as follows dx l 50 was used for the near velocity inlet zone main computational zone and far field from the main computational zone dxmin dymin 0 0125 m was used near the structure surface accordingly the intermediate meshes 50 meshes per wavelength were then applied to simulate nonlinear wave current actions near the structure surface the finest grid size of dxmin dymin 0 0125 m was adopted for the numerical simulation of wave current interactions with a dumbbell shaped cylinder the numerical and measured time histories of wave elevations at gauge g0 0 0 m 0 0 m without structure are shown in fig 11 a taking the case of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 4 m s as an example the comparison indicates that the present numerical model can accurately simulate wave current interactions thus we further investigate wave current forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder fig 11 b shows the time histories of the horizontal force in the x direction fx acting on the cylinder under the abovementioned wave current parameters it is found that the present numerical model can compute the horizontal wave current forces fx on the dumbbell shaped cylinder accurately to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics better for the dumbbell shaped cylinder the hydrodynamic coefficients of a typical circular cylinder diameter 0 25 m draught 0 2 m with the same projected area are also measured and compared in this study the variations in the horizontal drag and inertia coefficients versus kc for the circular and dumbbell shaped cylinders are shown in fig 12 the results show that the change in hydrodynamic coefficients in the kc numbers for the circular cylinder is similar to that in the previous study bearman et al 1985 comparatively the inertia coefficient c m of the dumbbell shaped cylinder is lower than that of the circular cylinder fig 12 a from the plot of fig 12 b it can be found that the drag coefficients c d decrease with increasing kc and exhibit larger values at low kc numbers for both circular and dumbbell shaped cylinders fig 13 a d shows the time histories of the measured computed wave and wave current forces including the drag force and inertial force on the dumbbell shaped cylinder and circular cylinder t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m u 0 0 m s and 0 4 m s from the plot of fig 13 a and c it can be found that inertial force plays a dominant role for wave only cases on both cylinders as the current velocity increases u 0 4 m s the drag force contributes more to the total wave current forces as shown in fig 13 b and d which can be explained in fig 14 fig 14 a h shows the three dimensional free surface elevation and vortex distribution around the two cylinders when the wave crest is approaching in front of the cylinder taking the dumbbell shaped cylinder as an example when u 0 0 m s only a small amount of corresponding free surface deformation around the cylinder and almost no vortex shedding can be found as shown in fig 14 a and b for the wave current conditions with u 0 4 m s symmetrical vortex shedding occurs in the downstream zone of the cylinder which will result in a larger drag force fig 14 d as is common knowledge in the separation zone the free surface may be sucked down since the pressure is relatively low lin 2003 thus we can clearly observe the low free surface especially near the front corner side around the cylinder fig 14 c the same phenomenon can be found on the circular cylinder fig 14 e h fig 14 d h shows the 3d vorticity fields around the two cylinders vortex separations occur on the front side of both cylinders the symmetrical vorticity in the wake region of the dumbbell shaped cylinder is wider than that of the circular cylinder in addition vortex shedding occurs at different positions in the downstream zone for both cylinders from the plots of fig 14 c and g we can see that it takes longer for the same wave current conditions to propagate along the dumbbell shaped cylinder compared with that of the circular cylinder thus different vortex distributions and free surface deformations around the two cylinders may lead to wave only or wave current force differences including inertial and drag forces 5 3 further simulation by the established numerical model 5 3 1 influence of current velocity u some narrow strait crossing bridges may be exposed to stronger current actions potentially accompanied by large waves induced by extreme typhoon weather therefore in this section additional numerical simulations of the dumbbell shaped cylinder θ 0 interactions with more extreme wave current conditions are conducted the detailed numerical wave only and wave current parameters are shown in table 3 it is noted that only following current waves are considered in the following sections fig 15 shows the relationship between the hydrodynamic coefficients of the dumbbell shaped cylinder and the kc number under the numerical wave current cases of table 3 as seen from fig 15 kc is between 1 and 20 for the present cases fig 15 a reflects that with increasing kc number the c m value tends to be stable with an average value of 1 1 however when the kc number is located between 1 and 10 the c d value fluctuates greatly this is because the inertial forces play a dominant role in the morison equation for low kc numbers thus the error function is not sensitive to the other error in c d with the least square approach in other words minimizing the difference between the calculated and numerical forces will not be able to determine the drag force coefficients c d accurately yuan and huang 2010 thus irregularity can be discovered in the drag coefficients c d with increasing kc numbers with the continuous increase in the kc number the c d value tends to stabilize and the average value is close to 0 6 which can be observed from fig 15 b fig 15 c indicates that the peak computed wave current forces including the maximum and minimum values estimated by the modified morison equations equation 1 to 7 are in good agreement with the numerical simulation results in this study fig 16 shows the comparisons of the three dimensional free surface elevation around the cylinder when the wave crest is approaching the cylinder e g t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 0 m s 0 2 m s and 0 4 m s due to the shelter effect of the cylinder the free surface displacement is obviously visible at the front and back sides of the cylinder for the wave only case only a slight amount of corresponding free surface deformation occurs around the cylinder as shown in fig 16 a as is common knowledge in the separation zone the free surface may be sucked down since the pressure is relatively low lin 2003 thus we can observe clearly the low free surface for the cases of u 0 2 m s and u 0 4 m s especially near the front corner side around the cylinder as shown in fig 16 b c which will further determines the exact wave current forces on the cylinder fig 17 a c presents the time history of numerical wave current forces acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder according to the construction unit bridge foundation construction is usually designed assuming a symmetrical wave current force acting on the bridge cofferdam i e the maximum values are assumed to be the same as the absolute value of minimum wave current forces however in this study wave current forces display obvious asymmetry on the cylinder i e the maximum values are obviously larger than the absolute value of the minimum wave current forces under the fwc conditions for example at the current velocity u 0 8 m s and the static wave height h 0 0 12 m fig 17 a shows that the time series of the wave current forces exhibits asymmetry as the wave periods t increase additionally at the current velocity u 0 8 m s and the wave period t 1 8 s fig 17 b reveals that with higher crest values and trough values the time series of the wave current forces shows stronger asymmetric characteristics as static wave height h 0 decreases from h 0 0 08 m to h 0 0 12 m fig 17 c reflects a similar pattern as that of fig 17 b with the static wave height h 0 0 12 m and the wave period t 1 8 s as the current velocity u increases to better quantify the asymmetry the following ratio is defined 20 α f x w c max f x w c max f x w c min fig 17 d shows variations in the asymmetry coefficient α versus different kc numbers the asymmetry coefficient α presents an almost linear increasing relation with kc numbers when the kc numbers approach 18 20 the asymmetry coefficient α is extremely close to 1 0 insight into the asymmetric characteristics of peak wave current forces is conducive to better formulating bridge foundation construction schemes especially for sea crossing bridges an attempt is made to draw a best fit curve with the combined measured and numerical hydrodynamic force coefficients as shown in fig 18 and the empirical expressions for the best fit curves are offered below the following expressions can be applied to calculate the inertial and drag wave current forces on a dumbbell shaped cylinder θ 0 within the range of kc numbers between 0 8 and 20 c m 1 231 k c 0 056 21 c d 1 999 k c 0 6833 5 3 2 influence of the incident flow directions θ in practical sea crossing bridges the axis of the bridge piers is not always perpendicular to the main flow direction i e wave or wave current may act obliquely on the bridge cofferdam as the dumbbell shaped cylinder is not a completely symmetrical structure the influence of flow incident directions θ on the wave only or wave current forces should be investigated for bridge cofferdam design and construction issues however due to the limitation of experimental conditions i e the wave flume width the bridge cofferdam sizes the actual wave current conditions and the scale ratio the influence of the blockage ratio for such a structure type seems to be inevitable especially for several cases of large incident flow directions the width ratios between the model and the flume are larger than 1 10 as suggested by the ocean engineering committee of the international towing tank conference ittc thus it is necessary to explore the influence of incident flow directions on the wave or wave current forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder experimentally and numerically in this study 7 cases of θ 0 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 were researched experimentally the validated numerical model was then adopted to reproduce the experimental cases and investigate the blockage effect and wall effect for the present experimental cases the following fixed wave current parameters were used wave period t 1 6 s static wave height h 0 0 12 m and current velocity u 0 0 m s and 0 4 m s it is noted that in all the experiments oblique wave or wave current actions were simulated equivalently by turning the cylinder model around a certain angle as shown in fig 2 c in the numerical model three different widths of the numerical wave flume 2 0 m 4 0 m and 6 0 m for different incident directions θ were considered fig 19 gives the numerical inertia and drag coefficients versus sinθ under three different flume widths together with the experimental data of wave only and wave current cases it can be concluded that the numerical results of c d and c m for the cases of θ 0 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 width 2 0 m are in good agreement with the experimental data in addition c d and c m coefficients increase with incident angles θ which is due to the increasing projected length in the vertical wave propagation direction and the horizontal wave only or wave current force with θ comparing the given wave only cases there is no significant difference in the inertia coefficient c m with different numerical flume widths this indicates that the blockage effect and wall effect have little influence on the hydrodynamic performance under the given wave only condition the numerical results can also indirectly ensure the reliability of the experimental data however for the wave current cases it can be observed that due to the blockage effect and wall effect the experimental and numerical results width 2 0 m of inertia coefficient c m versus sinθ may be underestimated the numerical results remain almost the same for the cases of width 4 0 m and width 6 0 m in which all the cases meet the requirements of the blockage ratio the relative difference in the c m numerical results between the case of width 2 0 m and the cases of width 4 0 m and width 6 0 m is 4 17 as shown in fig 19 a d both the c d and c m coefficients have benign regularity versus sinθ we try to fit the numerical results of c d and c m for the cases of width 6 0 m it is indicated that c d and c m are both quadratically correlated with the sine value of the incident angle θ the study results can better guide bridge engineers to quickly estimate oblique wave only or wave current forces acting on dumbbell shaped bridge cofferdams fig 20 shows the isosurfaces of vorticity around the dumbbell shaped cylinder at t 0 0 t when the wave crest is approaching the front side of the structure and t 0 5 t when the wave trough is approaching the front side of the structure for the case of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 4 m s taking various flow directions θ 0 30 60 and 90 as examples it reveals that the intensity shape and position of the vortices around the structure differ from each other under different flow directions for θ 0 a visibly symmetrical vortex structure can be found around the cylinder at these two moments as the wave current propagates from t 0 0 t to t 0 5 t obvious periodic vortex shedding arises especially in the downstream zone of the cylinder fig 20 a b as the flow direction θ increases asymmetric and disorganized vortex structures around the cylinder can be observed at θ 30 fig 20 c d comparing the vortices at t 0 0 t and t 0 5 t vortex shedding occurs at the rear corner of the cylinder similarly more extensive and complicated vortex structures can be discovered at the rear side of the structure when θ 60 fig 20 e f i e in the downstream zone of the cylinder for θ 90 a visibly symmetrical vortex can also be observed around the cylinder where vortex separation occurs on the front side of the structure surface fig 20 g h vortex shedding takes place in the positions on the structure surface that are tangent to the direction of the wave current propagation as a result of the different shelter effects of the cylinder and nonlinear wave current body interactions more complicated vortex structures can be discovered especially in the further downstream zone around the cylinder thus the vortex structure may have a direct influence on the wave current induced run up and dynamic pressure distributions finally resulting in different wave current forces on the cylinder 6 conclusions wave only and wave current force measurements were carried out on a vertical truncated dumbbell shaped cylinder in a wave flume the dumbbell shaped cylinder was tested at a water depth of 0 8 m and was constructed with its axis to incident flow angles θ equal to 0 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 horizontal forces induced by regular waves opposing current waves and following current waves were measured drag and inertia coefficients were evaluated based on modified morison equations and linear wave theory the relevant conclusions drawn from this study are summarized below 1 the test results show that the inertia coefficient c m exhibits more scatter under opposing current wave action it is also the same as drag coefficients c d under wave only actions especially under low kc numbers however hydrodynamic force coefficients have a good correlation with kc numbers under the actions of the following current waves compared with those of the circular cylinder of the same submergence depth and projected area the mean values of c m and c d of the dumbbell shaped cylinder are obviously lower 2 the study indicates that the linear summation of wave only and current only forces will overestimate actual peak wave current forces including the maximum and minimum values acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder under fwc comparatively the linear summation values may underestimate the actual peak wave current forces for most cases of owc thus this approach seems to not be a reasonable way to estimate the wave current forces especially under combined waves and stronger current actions 3 the transient flow patterns including the free surface deformation and vortex distribution around the cylinder are analyzed by the established and validated numerical model further numerical simulations of the dumbbell shaped cylinder under extreme wave current conditions are conducted the empirical equation fit for the hydrodynamic force coefficients c m and c d of the dumbbell shaped cylinder are obtained according to the numerical simulation and experimental data 4 the hydrodynamic force coefficients c m and c d grow with increasing incident flow direction θ from 0 to 90 the drag and inertia coefficients are both quadratically correlated with sinθ the variation in hydrodynamic coefficients with sinθ can be used to quickly

and current force drag and inertia coefficients wave flume experiment 1 introduction a growing number of sea crossing bridges have been built in china in recent years e g the east sea bridge the hangzhou bay bridge and the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge the pingtan straits rail cum road bridge is still under construction for most sea crossing bridges mentioned above elevated caps with pile groups are commonly applied as foundations deng et al 2019 the bridge cofferdam with various cross sections acting as a truncated column is often used to construct the elevated bridge cap in the marine environment bridge cofferdams with various cross sections are widely applied in actual bridge engineering for example the truncated circular cylinder is commonly used due to its advantage of good structural performance under wave or wave current actions the truncated rectangular bridge cofferdam is usually adopted in shallow water conditions especially in non navigable areas due to its advantage of rapid construction the truncated quasi ellipse bridge cofferdam is used broadly to adapt the transverse layout of the sea crossing long span bridge pylon constructions the bridge cofferdam may suffer large wave and current forces under severe marine conditions of strong wave and current actions which will have strong control over its design and construction thus the accurate predictions of wave current forces need to be taken into consideration to obtain a better design and safer construction wave interactions with a truncated cylinder with circular cross section have been widely investigated analytically e g garret 1971 eatock taylor and hung 1987 eatock taylor and huang 1997 li and liu 2019 and experimentally boo 2006 yuan and huang 2010 some researchers have paid attention to the wave current interactions with vertical truncated circular cylinder kim and celebi 1998 studied three dimensional fully nonlinear wave current interactions with a truncated circular cylinder using simple rankin sources and a mixed eulerian and lagrangian mel time marching scheme however the numerical model is properly robust accurate when the relevant keulegan carpenter number is less than2 except when incident waves are too steep or current velocities are too large celebi 2001 established a numerical model to simulate nonlinear transient wave interactions with a truncated circular cylinder in a steady uniform current in which the indirect desingularized boundary integral equation method was used to solve the mixed initial boundary value problem different from the numerical model above park et al 2001 investigated the similar problem of nonlinear wave current interactions with a stationary truncated circular cylinder using the ns equation and a marker and cell method the viscous numerical wave tank model can produce reasonable results for higher harmonic wave run up which are more sensitive to changes in current speed some scholars have also given analytical solution to the problem above mazarakos and mavrakos 2013 presented a new method to solve the diffraction problem around a fixed truncated circular cylinder under combined wave and weak current actions double expansions of the velocity potential in terms of the wave slope and the strouhal number were solved the first order and second order horizontal forces demonstrate the significance of the current contribution to the total hydrodynamic loading in addition to the case of a truncated cylinder of circular cross section wave or wave current interactions with a cylinder of rectangular section have also attracted some attention shankar et al 1983 investigated the wave forces moments and wave pattern for square and rectangular cylinder under various angles of wave incidence numerically based on the finite element formulation of the linear diffraction problem harmel derouich 1991 investigated the wave forces on large smooth rectangular cylinders of five different aspect ratios at low keulegan carpenter numbers experimentally which made great contribution to wave loads on vertical rectangular cylinder to further study the effects of currents along the waves harmel derouich 1993 carried out experiments with smooth sharp edged rectangular cylinders the inertia drag and other force coefficients corresponding to low keulegan carpenter numbers up to a value of 4 were measured venugopal et al 2000 conducted a detailed experimental investigation of regular and random wave forces acting on a surface piercing truncated rectangular cylinder at different aspect ratios following the study mentioned above venugopal et al 2008 then carried out a series of experiments to study the drag and inertia coefficients for horizontally submerged rectangular cylinders in waves and currents some researchers studied the same problem by numerical simulation lin et al 2003 established a 3d navier stokes model to investigate wave current interactions with a vertical square cylinder which indicated that the vortex effect around the sharp edged cylinder should not be ignored under combined wave current interactions kang et al 2013 used a similar numerical model to study wave current interactions with a square cylinder at different reynolds numbers clear flow separation and vortex shedding may be formed around the square cylinder when the current speed exceeds the maximum wave induced fluid particle velocity however in both studies above the wave deformation induced by nonlinear wave current interactions e g current effect on wavelength and wave height was not considered as regards cylinder with other cross section wave diffraction problem by a truncated quasi ellipse cylinder have also been investigated wang et al 2011 investigated nonlinear wave forces on quasi ellipse caissons numerically based on the finite difference method and the volume of fluid method the effect of the parameters of relative wave height relative caisson width and relative length width ratio on the wave forces of the quasi ellipse caisson was studied wave diffraction problem of the similar cylinder was investigated by liu et al 2018 in their study the diffraction potential solutions were solved by expanding the radius function of a truncated cylinder surface into a fourier series and using the method of separation of variables the wave elevation and wave excitation forces for different cases are solved by the analytical model to better adapt the transverse layout of pylon constructions for long span and deep water navigation bridges a new structure type of dumbbell shaped bridge cofferdams has been adopted to construct the elevated cap foundations of the pylons as shown in fig 1 from actual engineering practice e g pingtan straits rail cum road bridge it is found that the wave current force is the predominant load on the bridge cofferdam zhang 2017 xu 2018 however there have been few physical model tests or numerical simulations investigating the wave current forces of such structures the hydrodynamic characteristics of the dumbbell shaped cylinder under combined wave and current conditions have not been well known by bridge engineers which is not conducive to structural design and construction plan formulation this study provides reliable experimental and numerical predictions of the hydrodynamic force coefficients of a typical dumbbell shaped bridge cofferdam in the combined wave and current environment wave only and wave current forces were measured in the wave flume tests the drag coefficients c d and inertia coefficients c m under wave current actions were derived based on the modified morison equations and linear wave theory the hydrodynamic characteristics of the dumbbell shaped cylinder were then compared with those of the circular cylinder with equal submergence depth and projected area to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics and wave current structure interactions of dumbbell shaped cylinders under extreme wave current conditions an earlier established model kang et al 2015 was developed and validated with the same dumbbell shaped cylinder a combined wave current interaction problem was studied the developed les model lin and li 2003 was coupled to the model to simulate the wave current induced turbulence around the cylinder the viscous numerical model was adopted to cross check both the numerical and experimental results 2 experimental setup 2 1 dumbbell shaped cofferdam model the experiments were carried out in the combined wave current channel at the deep water large span bridge laboratory southwest jiaotong university china fig 2 a shows an illustration of the wave flume used in this study the flume is 60 m long 2 0 m wide and 1 8 m high and equipped with a hydraulic piston type wave generator in this experiment a rigid steel frame at the middle part of the wave flume was used to fix the dynamometer and cofferdam models the test specimen was fixed to the middle part by a rigid connection structure and connected with a 3 component dynamometer the rigid connection structure was located at the top of the specimen and the bottom of the sensor to provide enough clearance the prototype bridge cofferdam is a steel suspended box structure in shape it is designed to be a dumbbell shaped truncated cylinder which is 15 m in transverse width 33 9 m in longitudinal width and 30 m in height generally the draft of the bridge cofferdam is determined by the elevation of the elevated cap bottom and its height in this study the cofferdam was partially submerged with a draft d 0 of 12 0 m the water depth of the cofferdam was fixed at 48 0 m considering the wave flume size wave and current conditions and capacities of the measuring instruments the test model was designed at a model scale of 1 60 model prototype the structure model was rigidly installed and positioned approximately 28 5 m away from the wave maker whose design avoids any vibrations and movements during the wave current impact detailed dimensions of the dumbbell shaped cylinder model are shown in fig 2 a d 2 2 testing conditions experiments were conducted at a constant water depth of d 0 8 m under different wave only and wave current conditions as shown in tables 1 2 waves propagating in the opposite direction as currents namely opposing current waves u 0 owc and waves propagating in the same direction as currents namely following current waves u 0 fwc were both considered in this study in the experiments wave current conditions were generated using the same method as that of chen et al 2017 for wave only conditions regular wave interactions with dumbbell shaped cylinders were considered first for the current only condition the current was not generated until the current velocity remained steady for the wave current condition the current only condition was generated first and the same wave generator control signal as with the wave only condition was then used finally wave current forces around the cylinder were measured when both the waves and the currents remained sufficiently stable zhang et al 2020 used the same wave flume to investigate wave current forces on a box girder and demonstrated that the current generated by the bidirectional axial flow pump in the pipe is stable and essentially uniform over the water depth although we can observe that the measured current profile is slightly sheared near the flume bottom it has little effect on the surface waves because strong sheared flow is limited to a very thin fluid layer above the flume bottom thus the generated current in the wave flume can be considered uniform over the water depth chen et al 2017 2 3 uncertainty analysis according to the procedure recommended by the international towing tank conference ittc the uncertainties analysis performed for these wave flume tests are given below generally two types of uncertainties need to be considered in this study type a random and type b systematic elhanafi et al 2017 type a uncertainty can be evaluated by using a statistical analysis of several repeated observations with repeated and same quantity the wave current induced water level and force results exhibited good repeatability which can effectively reduce type a uncertainty the main factors affecting the type b uncertainty in the tests of wave current actions on the dumbbell shaped cylinder model are listed below a model geometry the maximum allowed dimensional deviation was chosen as 1 0 mm based on the experiences in the model fabrication and tests it is believed that this deviation will lead to minor effects on model behavior since it has little influence on submerged volume model symmetry b waves calibration the calibrated waves were measured using wave gauges with uncertainties of less than 0 1 mm the wave height was allowed a maximum deviation at 4 and the wave period was allowed a maximum deviation at 2 c currents calibration acoustic doppler velocimetry adv was used to measure the current speed with the uncertainties as less than 0 5 d set up uncertainties the position and direction of the dumbbell shaped cofferdam model was checked before each test which was done according to the lines crossing the wave flume position of the wave probe was allowed a maximum deviation of in the longitudinal and transverse directions and 2 mm in the water depth direction the draft of the dumbbell shaped cofferdam model was allowed a maximum deviation of 1 mm e wave wave current forces measurements 3 component dynamometer with a capacity of 475n for the horizontal wave forces was used to measure the x axis wave or wave current forces of the dumbbell shaped cofferdam model the system uncertainties were estimated as less than 1 5 95 confidence level percent of full scale load the uncertainty of hydrodynamic coefficients c m and c d will be mainly affected by the force measurement uncertainty 2 4 data sampling to investigate the wave parameters only a wave gauge with a sampling rate of 100 hz and a precision of 0 1 mm was placed at the center of the model location when the wave flow field was stable totally 10 cycles of waveforms were conducted and the final results were the average wave heights of these cycles two acoustic doppler velocimeters adv v1 v2 with an accuracy of 0 5 and a sampling rate of 200 hz were adopted to measure the current velocity v1 was set at the center of the model location and v2 was set 2 0 m upstream of the model the current profile without the model was measured to ensure that the generated current can be considered uniform over the water depth during the model test the current generation system produced a stable flow field its current velocity was measured and verified by the acoustic doppler velocimeter adv v2 the collection frequency of the three component dynamometer was 200 hz when the wave flow field was stable 10 cycles of waveforms and force data were conducted twice for each wave only or wave current case 3 theory and data analysis 3 1 wave field in currents due to the interaction of wave and current the current will affect the propagation of the wave and then change the characteristics of wave e g wave height and wavelength meanwhile the current flow field will also be affected by the surface wave a number of researchers have investigated the wave current interactions e g li 1990 and hegdes and lee 1992 here several research conclusions from their studies will be applied in the following section as mentioned before the generated current in the wave flume can be considered steady and uniform over the entire water depth thus based on linear wave theory and the wave action flux conservation principle the transformation of the wave height h is defined as follows li 1990 1 h h 0 1 u c 0 5 l s l 0 5 a s a d 0 5 1 u c 2 a d a d 0 5 2 a d 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d 3 a s 1 2 k s d sinh 2 k s d where h 0 l s and k s are the static wave height wavelength and wavenumber under wave actions without current respectively additionally l c and d are the current affected wavelength wave celerity and water depth respectively the wave number k is determined by the modified dispersion relation 4 ω k u 2 g k tanh k h according to linear wave theory a designated fluid particle velocity of a uniform current can be applied for the inlet boundary 5 u x u h 2 ω k u cosh k z d sinh k d cos k x ω t 6 u z h 2 ω k u sinh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t where ω 2 π t is the angular frequency k is the current affected wavenumber h is the current affected wave height and t is the wave period the water surface elevation η is written as 7 η h 2 sin k x ω t 3 2 wave current forces calculations the modified semiempirical force model morison et al 1950 is adopted here to evaluate hydrodynamic forces acting on a cylinder taking the effect of currents iwagaki 1984 into account 8 f x 1 2 c d ρ a u w u u w u c m ρ v u w where f x is the horizontal hydrodynamic force acting on the cylinder a is the projected area of the cylinder on the plane perpendicular to the wave propagation v is the volume of the cylinder u w is the wave induced horizontal velocity and u w is the horizontal particle acceleration both assumed to follow the linear airy wave theory with the current affected wave height and wave length u is the current velocity assumed to be uniform in depth u represents the uniform current opposing the direction of wave propagation ρ is the water density and c d and c m are the nondimensional drag and inertia coefficients under wave current actions respectively 3 3 predominant parameters for expressing the hydrodynamic force coefficients the new definition for kc numbers iwagaki et al 1984 is introduced to express hydrodynamic force coefficients in the coexisting wave current field 9 k c u m t d sin φ π φ cos φ u u m k c π u t d u u m where φ arccos u u m u m is the maximum wave induced fluid particle velocity and d is the diameter of the cylinder 10 r e u m u ν d 11 β r e k c where u m is the mean value of the maximum wave induced fluid particle velocity along the water depth ν is the kinematic viscosity and β is the frequency parameter in this study the kc number range of the experimental wave only and wave current cases was 0 8 8 0 the tested range of re numbers was 0 4 1 84 105 and β varied from 2 16 105 to 7 35 105 based on equations 1 8 the theoretical wave only u 0 or wave current forces can be calculated the least square method minimizing the total errors between the theoretical wave only or wave current results and experimental data is applied to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c m 4 test results analysis 4 1 current affected wave height analysis to investigate the effect of the wave periods t and uniform current u on the wave heights twenty three different cases were studied the input values are summarized in table 2 the measured time series of wave elevations at gauge g0 for the cases of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m u 0 0 m s and u 0 4 m s are shown in fig 3 compared with that of wave only actions see fig 3 a the wave amplitudes decrease under the following current actions see fig 3 b as a result the dispersion relation and the corresponding surface elevation formula are modified under combined wave current actions ryu et al 2003 fig 4 a shows the wave height change against different wave periods t with different wave current parameters compared with the wave only condition w the wave height h current affected wave height under owc changes by approximately 30 and 20 when t is equal to 1 0 s and 1 8 s respectively the wave deformation with a shorter period is affected more by the current velocity due to nonlinear wave current interactions fig 4 b shows the wave height change against various current velocities with different wave current parameters as shown in fig 4 b the opposing current u 0 amplifies the wave height and the current affected wave height h changes by approximately 11 and 40 when u is equal to 0 1 m s and 0 2 m s respectively t 1 4 s h 0 0 12 m the current affected wave height decreases more substantially due to the fwc actions as the current velocity u increases for example compared with the case of the wave only condition t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m the current affected wave height h changes by approximately 6 and 26 when u equals 0 1 m s and 0 4 m s respectively fig 4 c shows the relationship between the current affected wave height and kc numbers under different wave current conditions the plot of fig 3 c shows that the current affected wave height change exhibits more scatter under opposing current waves compared to the case under following current waves the current affected wave height decreases as the kc numbers increase under following current wave actions 4 2 hydrodynamic force analysis 4 2 1 hydrodynamic coefficients analysis in this section the modified morison formula equation 8 is adopted to evaluate the drag and inertia coefficients of the dumbbell shaped cylinder under combined wave current actions in which the current affected wave parameters are calculated by equations 1 6 the drag and inertia coefficients versus the kc numbers under different flow conditions are presented in fig 5 including the w actions owc actions and fwc actions fig 5 a indicates that c m exhibits more scatter under the action of opposing current waves with the increase in the kc numbers under the following current wave action both c m and c d values are concentrated and have a good correlation with the kc numbers this reflects that c d under wave only actions is more dispersed especially under low kc numbers showing that throughout the range of the kc number tested the inertia coefficients c m exhibit less scatter than that of the drag coefficients c d in this section we changed the wave periods t between 0 85 s and 1 8 s with the same wave height h 0 0 08 m to consider various kc numbers which range from 0 8 to 2 5 the inertia coefficient c m increases with increasing kc numbers when the kc number exceeds 1 0 c m approaches a steady value of 1 30 the drag coefficients c d decrease with increasing kc and exhibit larger values at low kc numbers refer to fig 5 b the time history curves of in line wave only and wave current forces obtained with the computed c d and c m values for the dumbbell shaped cylinder are provided as well for four kc numbers kc 0 92 2 01 3 52 8 04 in fig 6 a d to increase the data readability and clarity of the figures it is noted that only 4 cycles of measured results are given after the wave only or wave current interaction reached a steady state in the following sections the measured force time series agrees well with the generated wave only and wave current forces obtained by the modified morison equations 1 to 8 to verify the accuracy of the computed c d and c m the peak values of computed and measured wave only and wave current forces acquired by substituting the hydrodynamic coefficients in equation 8 are also shown in fig 7 through the comparison it can be concluded that the modified morison equations can properly evaluate the peak forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder 4 2 2 comparison of simple wave current force estimation methods in this section the measured wave current forces wc are compared with linear summation of the measured wave only w and current only forces c on the dumbbell shaped cylinder fig 8 a b compares the wave current force time series θ 0 with the same wave current parameters of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 2 m s and 0 4 m s it is shown that the measured wave current force is clearly smaller than a linear combination of the wave only and current only forces linear sum due to nonlinear wave current interactions when the current velocity u is relatively small little difference can be found between them refer to fig 8 a where u 0 2 m s as the current velocity u increases a greater difference can be observed especially for the minimum wave current forces as shown in fig 8 b where u 0 4 m s to better quantify the difference fig 8 c shows the measured peak value of horizontal wave current forces and the linear summation of the wave only and current only forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder θ 0 here each point represents the mean value over a complete time series this reveals that the positive or negative forces may be overestimated or underestimated by the simple linear summation of wave only and current only forces to clarify an overall measurement error the following ratios are defined ψ f x w c max f x w max f x c f x w c max 100 12 ξ f x w c min f x w min f x c f x w c min 100 where f x w c max and f x w c min are the measured peak wave current forces in the x direction f x w max and f x w min are the measured peak wave only forces and f x c is the measured steady current only force the peak forces are calculated from the average peak values over a complete time series the variation in the ratios versus incident angles θ is shown in fig 8 d e this reflects that the ratio of ψ reaches approximately 36 19 under different wave current actions the ratio of ξ shows a large value for the minimum forces especially for larger current velocities e g it even approaches more than 80 for the case of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 4 m s the results indicate that the linear summation of the wave only and current only forces overestimates the actual peak wave current forces including the maximum and minimum values acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder for fwc comparatively the linear summation values may underestimate the actual peak wave current forces for most cases of owc in practice this overestimation or underestimation would bring about unnecessary economic waste and unfavorable factors when considering the wave current forces on bridge cofferdams by simple superposition 5 numerical simulation in this section a 3d numerical model based on a multiple layer σ coordinate three dimensional model and immersed boundary method kang et al 2015 was applied to investigate the wave current interactions with the dumbbell shaped cylinder the numerical results were compared with the experimental data and used to further investigate the mechanics of wave current forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder after model validation 5 1 mathematical model a developed multiple layer σ coordinate three dimensional model lin 2006 based on the navier stokes equations is adopted to prescribe the motions of incompressible wave and current fluid particles based on this

transformation model can capture the free surface wave well lin 2006 to verify its accuracy the nonuniform grid system is adopted in the horizontal domain in this section it is noted that all the numerical models are based on the same model scale as the test model the numerical convergence tests of the mesh and time interval discretization were conducted with the case of static wave height h 0 0 12 m wave period t 1 6 s and u 0 0 m s to accurately simulate wave elevations without the structure three different meshes were used a coarse mesh 40 meshes per wavelength an intermediate mesh 50 meshes per wavelength and a fine mesh 60 meshes per wavelength fig 9 shows the time history of the free surface at gauge g0 under three different meshes in all three cases above 20 meshes were applied across the depth of the numerical wave flume with the first layer depth h 1 d d 0 0 6 m the meshes of first layer n1 14 the second layer depth h 2 0 0 m the meshes of second layer n2 0 and the third layer depth h 3 d 0 0 2 m the meshes of third layer n3 6 comparatively a lower wave elevation amplitude can be found when the course mesh 40 meshes per wavelength was adopted the intermediate and fine meshes can capture the wave elevations well indicating that an intermediate mesh is sufficient for application to properly simulate the wave forces acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder as before mesh convergence tests were performed to determine the optimal finest mesh size near the structure surfaces three cases of dxmin dymin 0 025 m 0 0125 m and 0 00625 m near the structure surface were considered for all cases the time step dt should be restricted by the courant number kang et al 2015 showing that dt 0 001 s performs good enough to obtain steady results for better observation the grids information with coarse intermediate and finer grid sizes closed to the cylinder zone are given in fig 10 a c fig 10 d shows the time history of horizontal wave forces acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder under the three above different meshes for the mesh case of dxmin dymin 0 025 m the wave force values were lower than those of the experimental data there was no significant difference in the simulation force results between the case of dxmin dymin 0 0125 m and that of dxmin dymin 0 00625 m therefore the final grid resolutions for the following numerical cases adopted were as follows dx l 50 was used for the near velocity inlet zone main computational zone and far field from the main computational zone dxmin dymin 0 0125 m was used near the structure surface accordingly the intermediate meshes 50 meshes per wavelength were then applied to simulate nonlinear wave current actions near the structure surface the finest grid size of dxmin dymin 0 0125 m was adopted for the numerical simulation of wave current interactions with a dumbbell shaped cylinder the numerical and measured time histories of wave elevations at gauge g0 0 0 m 0 0 m without structure are shown in fig 11 a taking the case of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 4 m s as an example the comparison indicates that the present numerical model can accurately simulate wave current interactions thus we further investigate wave current forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder fig 11 b shows the time histories of the horizontal force in the x direction fx acting on the cylinder under the abovementioned wave current parameters it is found that the present numerical model can compute the horizontal wave current forces fx on the dumbbell shaped cylinder accurately to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics better for the dumbbell shaped cylinder the hydrodynamic coefficients of a typical circular cylinder diameter 0 25 m draught 0 2 m with the same projected area are also measured and compared in this study the variations in the horizontal drag and inertia coefficients versus kc for the circular and dumbbell shaped cylinders are shown in fig 12 the results show that the change in hydrodynamic coefficients in the kc numbers for the circular cylinder is similar to that in the previous study bearman et al 1985 comparatively the inertia coefficient c m of the dumbbell shaped cylinder is lower than that of the circular cylinder fig 12 a from the plot of fig 12 b it can be found that the drag coefficients c d decrease with increasing kc and exhibit larger values at low kc numbers for both circular and dumbbell shaped cylinders fig 13 a d shows the time histories of the measured computed wave and wave current forces including the drag force and inertial force on the dumbbell shaped cylinder and circular cylinder t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m u 0 0 m s and 0 4 m s from the plot of fig 13 a and c it can be found that inertial force plays a dominant role for wave only cases on both cylinders as the current velocity increases u 0 4 m s the drag force contributes more to the total wave current forces as shown in fig 13 b and d which can be explained in fig 14 fig 14 a h shows the three dimensional free surface elevation and vortex distribution around the two cylinders when the wave crest is approaching in front of the cylinder taking the dumbbell shaped cylinder as an example when u 0 0 m s only a small amount of corresponding free surface deformation around the cylinder and almost no vortex shedding can be found as shown in fig 14 a and b for the wave current conditions with u 0 4 m s symmetrical vortex shedding occurs in the downstream zone of the cylinder which will result in a larger drag force fig 14 d as is common knowledge in the separation zone the free surface may be sucked down since the pressure is relatively low lin 2003 thus we can clearly observe the low free surface especially near the front corner side around the cylinder fig 14 c the same phenomenon can be found on the circular cylinder fig 14 e h fig 14 d h shows the 3d vorticity fields around the two cylinders vortex separations occur on the front side of both cylinders the symmetrical vorticity in the wake region of the dumbbell shaped cylinder is wider than that of the circular cylinder in addition vortex shedding occurs at different positions in the downstream zone for both cylinders from the plots of fig 14 c and g we can see that it takes longer for the same wave current conditions to propagate along the dumbbell shaped cylinder compared with that of the circular cylinder thus different vortex distributions and free surface deformations around the two cylinders may lead to wave only or wave current force differences including inertial and drag forces 5 3 further simulation by the established numerical model 5 3 1 influence of current velocity u some narrow strait crossing bridges may be exposed to stronger current actions potentially accompanied by large waves induced by extreme typhoon weather therefore in this section additional numerical simulations of the dumbbell shaped cylinder θ 0 interactions with more extreme wave current conditions are conducted the detailed numerical wave only and wave current parameters are shown in table 3 it is noted that only following current waves are considered in the following sections fig 15 shows the relationship between the hydrodynamic coefficients of the dumbbell shaped cylinder and the kc number under the numerical wave current cases of table 3 as seen from fig 15 kc is between 1 and 20 for the present cases fig 15 a reflects that with increasing kc number the c m value tends to be stable with an average value of 1 1 however when the kc number is located between 1 and 10 the c d value fluctuates greatly this is because the inertial forces play a dominant role in the morison equation for low kc numbers thus the error function is not sensitive to the other error in c d with the least square approach in other words minimizing the difference between the calculated and numerical forces will not be able to determine the drag force coefficients c d accurately yuan and huang 2010 thus irregularity can be discovered in the drag coefficients c d with increasing kc numbers with the continuous increase in the kc number the c d value tends to stabilize and the average value is close to 0 6 which can be observed from fig 15 b fig 15 c indicates that the peak computed wave current forces including the maximum and minimum values estimated by the modified morison equations equation 1 to 7 are in good agreement with the numerical simulation results in this study fig 16 shows the comparisons of the three dimensional free surface elevation around the cylinder when the wave crest is approaching the cylinder e g t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 0 m s 0 2 m s and 0 4 m s due to the shelter effect of the cylinder the free surface displacement is obviously visible at the front and back sides of the cylinder for the wave only case only a slight amount of corresponding free surface deformation occurs around the cylinder as shown in fig 16 a as is common knowledge in the separation zone the free surface may be sucked down since the pressure is relatively low lin 2003 thus we can observe clearly the low free surface for the cases of u 0 2 m s and u 0 4 m s especially near the front corner side around the cylinder as shown in fig 16 b c which will further determines the exact wave current forces on the cylinder fig 17 a c presents the time history of numerical wave current forces acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder according to the construction unit bridge foundation construction is usually designed assuming a symmetrical wave current force acting on the bridge cofferdam i e the maximum values are assumed to be the same as the absolute value of minimum wave current forces however in this study wave current forces display obvious asymmetry on the cylinder i e the maximum values are obviously larger than the absolute value of the minimum wave current forces under the fwc conditions for example at the current velocity u 0 8 m s and the static wave height h 0 0 12 m fig 17 a shows that the time series of the wave current forces exhibits asymmetry as the wave periods t increase additionally at the current velocity u 0 8 m s and the wave period t 1 8 s fig 17 b reveals that with higher crest values and trough values the time series of the wave current forces shows stronger asymmetric characteristics as static wave height h 0 decreases from h 0 0 08 m to h 0 0 12 m fig 17 c reflects a similar pattern as that of fig 17 b with the static wave height h 0 0 12 m and the wave period t 1 8 s as the current velocity u increases to better quantify the asymmetry the following ratio is defined 20 α f x w c max f x w c max f x w c min fig 17 d shows variations in the asymmetry coefficient α versus different kc numbers the asymmetry coefficient α presents an almost linear increasing relation with kc numbers when the kc numbers approach 18 20 the asymmetry coefficient α is extremely close to 1 0 insight into the asymmetric characteristics of peak wave current forces is conducive to better formulating bridge foundation construction schemes especially for sea crossing bridges an attempt is made to draw a best fit curve with the combined measured and numerical hydrodynamic force coefficients as shown in fig 18 and the empirical expressions for the best fit curves are offered below the following expressions can be applied to calculate the inertial and drag wave current forces on a dumbbell shaped cylinder θ 0 within the range of kc numbers between 0 8 and 20 c m 1 231 k c 0 056 21 c d 1 999 k c 0 6833 5 3 2 influence of the incident flow directions θ in practical sea crossing bridges the axis of the bridge piers is not always perpendicular to the main flow direction i e wave or wave current may act obliquely on the bridge cofferdam as the dumbbell shaped cylinder is not a completely symmetrical structure the influence of flow incident directions θ on the wave only or wave current forces should be investigated for bridge cofferdam design and construction issues however due to the limitation of experimental conditions i e the wave flume width the bridge cofferdam sizes the actual wave current conditions and the scale ratio the influence of the blockage ratio for such a structure type seems to be inevitable especially for several cases of large incident flow directions the width ratios between the model and the flume are larger than 1 10 as suggested by the ocean engineering committee of the international towing tank conference ittc thus it is necessary to explore the influence of incident flow directions on the wave or wave current forces on the dumbbell shaped cylinder experimentally and numerically in this study 7 cases of θ 0 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 were researched experimentally the validated numerical model was then adopted to reproduce the experimental cases and investigate the blockage effect and wall effect for the present experimental cases the following fixed wave current parameters were used wave period t 1 6 s static wave height h 0 0 12 m and current velocity u 0 0 m s and 0 4 m s it is noted that in all the experiments oblique wave or wave current actions were simulated equivalently by turning the cylinder model around a certain angle as shown in fig 2 c in the numerical model three different widths of the numerical wave flume 2 0 m 4 0 m and 6 0 m for different incident directions θ were considered fig 19 gives the numerical inertia and drag coefficients versus sinθ under three different flume widths together with the experimental data of wave only and wave current cases it can be concluded that the numerical results of c d and c m for the cases of θ 0 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 width 2 0 m are in good agreement with the experimental data in addition c d and c m coefficients increase with incident angles θ which is due to the increasing projected length in the vertical wave propagation direction and the horizontal wave only or wave current force with θ comparing the given wave only cases there is no significant difference in the inertia coefficient c m with different numerical flume widths this indicates that the blockage effect and wall effect have little influence on the hydrodynamic performance under the given wave only condition the numerical results can also indirectly ensure the reliability of the experimental data however for the wave current cases it can be observed that due to the blockage effect and wall effect the experimental and numerical results width 2 0 m of inertia coefficient c m versus sinθ may be underestimated the numerical results remain almost the same for the cases of width 4 0 m and width 6 0 m in which all the cases meet the requirements of the blockage ratio the relative difference in the c m numerical results between the case of width 2 0 m and the cases of width 4 0 m and width 6 0 m is 4 17 as shown in fig 19 a d both the c d and c m coefficients have benign regularity versus sinθ we try to fit the numerical results of c d and c m for the cases of width 6 0 m it is indicated that c d and c m are both quadratically correlated with the sine value of the incident angle θ the study results can better guide bridge engineers to quickly estimate oblique wave only or wave current forces acting on dumbbell shaped bridge cofferdams fig 20 shows the isosurfaces of vorticity around the dumbbell shaped cylinder at t 0 0 t when the wave crest is approaching the front side of the structure and t 0 5 t when the wave trough is approaching the front side of the structure for the case of t 1 6 s h 0 0 12 m and u 0 4 m s taking various flow directions θ 0 30 60 and 90 as examples it reveals that the intensity shape and position of the vortices around the structure differ from each other under different flow directions for θ 0 a visibly symmetrical vortex structure can be found around the cylinder at these two moments as the wave current propagates from t 0 0 t to t 0 5 t obvious periodic vortex shedding arises especially in the downstream zone of the cylinder fig 20 a b as the flow direction θ increases asymmetric and disorganized vortex structures around the cylinder can be observed at θ 30 fig 20 c d comparing the vortices at t 0 0 t and t 0 5 t vortex shedding occurs at the rear corner of the cylinder similarly more extensive and complicated vortex structures can be discovered at the rear side of the structure when θ 60 fig 20 e f i e in the downstream zone of the cylinder for θ 90 a visibly symmetrical vortex can also be observed around the cylinder where vortex separation occurs on the front side of the structure surface fig 20 g h vortex shedding takes place in the positions on the structure surface that are tangent to the direction of the wave current propagation as a result of the different shelter effects of the cylinder and nonlinear wave current body interactions more complicated vortex structures can be discovered especially in the further downstream zone around the cylinder thus the vortex structure may have a direct influence on the wave current induced run up and dynamic pressure distributions finally resulting in different wave current forces on the cylinder 6 conclusions wave only and wave current force measurements were carried out on a vertical truncated dumbbell shaped cylinder in a wave flume the dumbbell shaped cylinder was tested at a water depth of 0 8 m and was constructed with its axis to incident flow angles θ equal to 0 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 horizontal forces induced by regular waves opposing current waves and following current waves were measured drag and inertia coefficients were evaluated based on modified morison equations and linear wave theory the relevant conclusions drawn from this study are summarized below 1 the test results show that the inertia coefficient c m exhibits more scatter under opposing current wave action it is also the same as drag coefficients c d under wave only actions especially under low kc numbers however hydrodynamic force coefficients have a good correlation with kc numbers under the actions of the following current waves compared with those of the circular cylinder of the same submergence depth and projected area the mean values of c m and c d of the dumbbell shaped cylinder are obviously lower 2 the study indicates that the linear summation of wave only and current only forces will overestimate actual peak wave current forces including the maximum and minimum values acting on the dumbbell shaped cylinder under fwc comparatively the linear summation values may underestimate the actual peak wave current forces for most cases of owc thus this approach seems to not be a reasonable way to estimate the wave current forces especially under combined waves and stronger current actions 3 the transient flow patterns including the free surface deformation and vortex distribution around the cylinder are analyzed by the established and validated numerical model further numerical simulations of the dumbbell shaped cylinder under extreme wave current conditions are conducted the empirical equation fit for the hydrodynamic force coefficients c m and c d of the dumbbell shaped cylinder are obtained according to the numerical simulation and experimental data 4 the hydrodynamic force coefficients c m and c d grow with increasing incident flow direction θ from 0 to 90 the drag and inertia coefficients are both quadratically correlated with sinθ the variation in hydrodynamic coefficients with sinθ can be used to quickly

21734,knowledge of coastal storm regimes is essential to ensure an economic and sustainable development in the coastal area in recent decades wave storms have been responsible for several fatalities and economic losses along the algiers coast the aim of this paper is to present a detailed analysis on wave storm events during the past 40 years including an assessment of the potential impacts of various storm events along the algiers coasts according to their intensity and direction based on the different historical events thus this paper gives an estimation of return periods of extreme significant wave heights and extreme storm events for this purpose the wave storm events occurring in the algiers coasts based on the storm power index spi developed by dolan and davis 1992 were characterized and classified five storm categories were defined in terms of their power index subdivided into 31 categories taking into consideration their propagation directions the temporal analysis shows a progressive increase in the number of storm events and their intensity during the last decade which explains the increased damage recorded recently in the algiers coastlines a spatial analysis of these extreme and catastrophic storms being responsible in these damages has shown that the nature of coastal storm damages on the local scale depends on several factors mainly power of these storms and their direction in view of the complex morphology of the algiers coastlines these two factors were considered during the extreme value analysis and allowed us to estimate the return period of the storm events already observed based on their spi and direction a return period of 59 years has been estimated for the catastrophic storm of 2015 which caused significant erosion resulting a loss of more than 15 000 m2 of coastal lands keywords coastal storms coastal hazard wave storm climate extreme wave analysis algiers coast sw mediterranean 1 introduction as in most countries of the world algeria is characterized by a high population concentration in its coastline linked to the high tourist and economic activities that occur in this area the pressure exerted by these coastal activities in addition to climate change makes it exposed to high natural hazard si mav et al 2013 on the other hand the various coastal studies and developments related to these activities require a good knowledge of storm regimes guisado pintado et al 2014 and of the return levels of extreme wave heights sulis et al 2017 in order to ensure economic and sustainable reinforcement and design of ports and coastal protection infrastructures and to identify vulnerable coastal areas exposed to high natural hazards in recent decades marine storms have caused several economic property and human disasters in the central algerian coasts the coastal infrastructure damage extensive coastal erosion demolished coastal building destabilizing cliffs shipwrecks with fatalities and port flooding have been recorded fig 1 the several recent studies seghir et al 2018 salem cherif et al 2019 otmani et al 2019 2020 have reported that the algiers coastline was subject of considerable coastal erosion according to otmani et al 2020 the eastern algiers zone has experienced an increase in the erosion rate between 2003 and 2017 indeed several authors mihoubi et al 2014 atroune et al 2018 rabehi et al 2018 have stated that the algiers coastline experiences a high degree of vulnerability currently in only 150 km of coastline more than 70 coastal protection structure have been installed or under installation to counter the power of the destructive wave storms this damage can considerably affect the country s economy considering the high cost required by the reconstruction of the affected areas and requires that the scale of these storms are be anticipated in order to take the necessary precautions against the natural disaster akpınar et al 2017 wave storms have the ability to significantly modify the coastal landscape dolan et al 1978 maouche et al 2009 sanchez vidal et al 2012 in the mediterranean sea several studies maouche et al 2009 jimenez et al 2009 bosom and jiménez 2011 bertotti et al 2012 armaroli et al 2012 katz and mushkin 2013 sartini et al 2017 sulis et al 2017 have focused on the assessment of the extreme waves wave storm events and possible tsunami events in the central algerian coasts as presented by maouche et al 2009 several large block accumulations have been suspected of being a result of catastrophic storm or tsunami event according to sartini et al 2017 the highest return levels of extreme wave heights are estimated in the algerian basin it is therefore difficult to determine the event causing the boulders accumulation in the algiers coasts if they are caused by a tsunami or by extreme waves thus the algerian basin is exposed both to violent storm events nacef et al 2016 and to the different cyclonic activities of the mediterranean sea sartini et al 2017 this work aims to investigate in detail the coastal storm events occurring on the algiers coasts and to assess and estimate the potential impacts of extreme and catastrophic storms and their likely return periods in order to achieve these objectives we have based on 40 year wave hindcast dataset developed for the assessment of wave energy resources on the algerian coast amarouche et al 2020 using the swan wind wave model booij et al 1999 calibrated based on wave measurements carried out on the algerian coast and validated for the whole western mediterranean basin amarouche et al 2019 this wave hindcast database was used mainly for the characterization and classification of storms occurring off the algiers coast based on the storm power index spi of dolan and davis 1992 this index represents a simple means to obtain storm intensity mendoza and jimenez 2005 and has been used and recommended by several authors nicholls and hoozemans 1996 mendoza et al 2013 quevauviller 2014 guisado pintado et al 2014 karunarathna et al 2014 anfuso et al 2016 martzikos et al 2018 carvalho et al 2020 barletta and calliari n d the characterized and classified storm cluster was subjected to extensive statistical analysis over different time scales taking into consideration both storm intensity and direction thus the storms resulting in significant damage on the algiers coasts including catastrophic and extreme storms were the subject of a spatio temporal simulation in order to determine its potential in the impacted zones and in order to situate the most exposed coastal zones against these storms for an accurate and high spatial resolution simulation of storm wave propagation we evolved from the coarse swan grid model with 3 km resolution amarouche et al 2019 to a local grid model 200 m resolution using the downscaling methodology based on the telescopic nested grid system as presented in bingölbali et al 2019 at last for the estimation of the different return periods of extreme significant wave heights and extreme storm power index spi two methods were used the peak over threshold adjusted to the generalized pareto distribution pot gpd and the annual maximum adjusted to the generalized extreme value distribution am gev these two methods are currently the most widely used and recommended by researchers kapelonis et al 2015 samayam et al 2017 sartini et al 2017 thus the return periods of severe storms have been estimated in terms of their intensity and direction considering that the direction of storm waves exerts a large influence on their propagation along the coastline 2 study area the algiers coast located in the center of the algerian coast extends along a 150 km coastal line from cap chenoua 2 39 e to cap djennat 3 72 w this area has the highest population pressure in algeria fig 2 with its three provinces algiers capital tipaza and boumerdes it has an important economic area that supports various investments in the different sectors tourism industry and fisheries the algiers coast is characterized by a very complex morphology with the presence of 3 distinct bays bouisimail bay in the west is an open bay oriented towards the north west with 62 km of coastline thus this bay is characterized by a considerable continental shelf compared to other bays which extends about 11 km from the shoreline the bay of algiers unlike the bay of bouismail is a small and semi enclosed bay with an entrance of 16 km exposed to the north and a coastline of 28 km zemourie bay which is also different as compared to the other two bays with its wide northward orientation is characterized by a narrower continental shelf compared to bouismail bay this complex morphology of the algiers coast leads to the unbalanced distribution of wave energy near the coast which is also influenced both by the direction and the amplitude of the waves along these coasts some areas are likely to experience significant concentrations of wave energy due to diffraction and refraction phenomena the map fig 2 shows the geographical location of the study area as well as the position of the wave measurement buoys b1 tamentfoust used for the calibration of the swan model which is locally embedded in the regional swan model that covers all of the western mediterranean 3 wave hindcast database the wave hindcast database used in this study was developed using the calibrated swan model for the evaluation of wave energy resource along the algerian coast amarouche et al 2020 the swan model was calibrated by authors amarouche et al 2019 for the algerian coast based on one year s wave measurement of azeffoun buoy b2 and validated against 11 buoys installed throughout the west mediterranean basin fig 2 the used buoys characteristic and depth are detailed in table 1 and the validation results for each buoy are summarized in table 2 for the significant wave height it was recorded a mean bias of 0 04 m a mean scatter index of 30 and a mean rmse of 0 31 m for the mean wave period it was observed an average bias of 0 36 s a mean scatter index of 19 and a mean rmse of 0 83 s on the other hand by comparing the maximum values obtained by the swan model and the maximum values measured by the buoys a slight overestimation by the swan model that we consider favorable is noticed for coastal hazard prediction and extreme wave analysis studies to ensure maximum safety and sustainable development during the design of offshore and coastal structures the performance of the calibrated swan model during several storm periods is also compared by the authors amarouche et al 2019 against several models previously implemented for the mediterranean sea by ardhuin et al 2007 bolaños sanchez et al 2007 and martínez asensio et al 2013 the calibrated swan model used in this study was found to be more efficient and very accurate in predicting the growth and decline of storm peaks fig 3 illustrates clearly the persistence of the calibrated swan model during the simulation of individual and successive storms thus a significant difference can be observed between the results of the default swan model and the calibrated swan model during these storms the calibrated swan model was implemented in the third generation nonstationary and 2d two dimensional mode with a time step of 30 min and with a maximum of 4 iterations per time step using the stopc convergence criterion requiring 99 of the active grid points to be converged the model domain covers the entire west mediterranean sea discretized with a regular grid of 0 033 0 033 3 km in spherical coordinates from 17 e to 6 w and from 35 n to 45 n as shown in fig 2 the directional wave energy density spectrum was discretized using 35 frequency bins between 0 033 hz and 1 0 hz and 36 directional bins with constant increment the numerical scheme was the slightly dispersive scheme bsbt first order upwind backward in space backward in time concerning physical setting selected based on the calibration results the most adapted formulas in the west mediterranean basin are komen et al 1994 for the exponential wind wave growth and janssen 1991 1989 for the whitecapping with a dissipation coefficient of cds 1 0 thus the jonswap bottom friction formulation was activated according to zijlema et al 2012 with cfjon 0 038 m2s 3 and according to the bore model of battjes and janssen 1978 the depth limited wave breaking was modelled using α 1 and γ 0 73 concerning the quadruplet wave wave interactions it was activated using the discrete interaction approximation dia of hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 with λ 0 25 and cnl4 3 107 the output data are generated for each grid point with a time interval of 3 h for 2 d spectra frequency direction for block files geographic distribution and for spectral output used for subsequent nested computations 4 local grid model implementation in order to ensure an accurate simulation of the extreme and catastrophic storm waves and to evaluate their potentiality in the affected areas along the algiers coasts an operational nested grid model swan with a high spatial resolution 200 m was implemented for the algiers coast fig 2 the local grid model was nested on the coarse grid swan model presented in the previous section the nested model as well as the coarse grid swan model used for the generation of boundary conditions were both forced by wind fields from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr the cfsr wind fields saha et al 2010 2014 was developed by the ncep and provided by the research data archive website of the university corporation for atmospheric research and the national centers for environmental prediction https rda ucar edu this data field was approved by several recent studies cox et al 2011 chawla et al 2012 donatini et al 2015 van vledder and akpınar 2015 çakmak et al 2019 using different wind wave models according to tiberi wadier et al 2016 the high temporal resolution 1 h of the cfsr is considered to be important for the estimation of storm peaks furthermore the cfsr wind fields are characterized by a high spatial resolution of 0 3125 0 3125 between 1979 and 2011 saha et al 2010 and 0 225 0 225 since 2011 saha et al 2014 compared the cfsr wind field using during this study to the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf several studies signell et al 2005 chelton and freilich 2005 ardhuin et al 2011 campos and guedes soares 2017 rusu et al 2017 showed that ecmwf wind speeds are slightly underestimated unlike the cfsr wind speeds however the use of ecmwf winds as forcing of the wind wave models induces a slight underestimation of significant wave heights unlike the ncep cfsr winds by referring to the global maps of the normalized bias related to the significant wave heights realized by stopa and cheung 2014 we observe clearly this situation in the mediterranean sea as it is mentioned above in order to ensure maximum safety and sustainable development it is considered that a slight overestimation of wind speeds and significant wave heights may be favorable for storm and coastal hazard studies and for the estimation of the extreme return period with consideration of the statistical error of the prediction model the same approach used for the calibration of the coarse grid model was used for the calibration of the nested grid model this calibration was based on the wave dissipation due to whitecapping which is the least known term in wave models pallares et al 2014 by decreasing and increasing the default value of dissipation coefficient empirical coefficient of proportionality cds the default values of the whitecapping coefficient cds are defined as 4 5 for janssen 2 36 10 5 for komen and 5 10 5 for westhuysen thus a sensitivity test was done for three different combinations of the exponential wind wave growth and the whitecapping source term formulas which are respectively komen et al 1984 komen et al 1984 komen et al 1984 janssen 1989 1991 and yan 1987 van der westhuysen 2007 the newer term entitled st6 formulation in swan have been calibrated and evaluated by the authors amarouche et al 2019 during the implementation of the coarse grid model and it is observed that the error statistics obtained using the calibrated source term package st6 remained slightly greater than the error statistics results obtained using the exponential wind wave growth formula of komen et al 1984 thus the simulation period using the st6 is 1 5 times greater than the simulation period with the previous wind wave growth formula therefore it is concluded that it is preferable to use previous wind wave growth formula during the small spatial scale simulations for high spatial resolution grid and for the long term simulation in order to select the best physical setting adapted for the algiers coast a statistical error analysis was performed to evaluate the simulation results obtained during the model calibration against 6 month wave measurement provided by the onsm offıce national de signalisation maritime from tamentfoust buoy b1 fig 2 between 01 10 1998 and 31 03 1999 a period considered to be the most dynamic throughout the year in terms of wave climate the calibration results are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 showing successively the taylor diagrams taylor 2001 and rmse versus bias plots of the simulated significant wave heights hm0 and mean wave periods tm02 compared against wave measurements the formulas used for the determination of the statistical error parameters are presented in appendix a the taylor diagram is used to plot three statistical parameters that indicate the correspondence of the model output to the observations referring to the crmsd centered root mean square difference which depends on the difference in variance and the correlation coefficient it can therefore be used to observe which of the latter two parameters has the greatest influence on the growth of the rms difference the results figs 4 and 5 showed that the modifications made on the dissipation coefficient cds coefficient have a significant effect in the nested model results which depends to the whitecapping and the exponential wind wave growth formulations it is notable in figs 4 and 5 that the increase in cds leads to a slight improvement in the model s performance in terms of significant wave height estimation for the different combinations of exponential wind wave growth and whitecapping source term formulas this finding is explained by a decrease in the crmsd and an increase in the correlation coefficient r fig 4 with a decline in the absolute of bias and rmse fig 5 on the other hand this slight improvement in the results of a significant wave height simulation was disadvantageous in terms of the mean wave period results for both komen et al 1984 and janssen 1989 1991 whitecapping formulas it is shown in figs 4 and 5 that using these two formulas the crmsd rmse and bias of the mean wave period increases slightly according to the cds however using the formula yan ab combination of van der westhuysen 2007 it is observed that the increase in cds coefficient is expressed by a slight increase in the correlation coefficient and a decrease in bias whereas the crmsd remains stable due to an increase of the difference in variance figs 4 and 5 considering both the calibration results of significant wave heights and those of the mean wave periods the exponential wind wave growth of yan 1987 and the whitecapping source term formulas of van der westhuysen 2007 with a coefficient cds2 10 0e 5 was considered as the best setting for the nested swan model in the algiers coast the best physical settings selected were detailed in table 3 the present calibration of the nested local grid model has improved the results of the default mode recommended by swan team 2018 particularly in terms of the mean wave period results the scatter plot fig 6 show a homogeneous distribution between the predicted data and the observed data for both significant wave height and mean wave period for the significant wave height it is recorded a bias of 0 14 m a scatter index of 29 and a rmse of 0 36 m for the mean wave period it is observed a bias of 0 005 s a scatter index of 15 and a rmse of 0 71 s these error statistics are considered very satisfactory for a coastal wind wave model thus the coefficient of correlation is also very acceptable it is 0 92 for significant wave heights and 0 86 for mean wave periods 5 storm characterization and classification a wave storm is generally defined as a marine storm event where the waves exceed a threshold wave height hs threshold and persists through a considerable time period in this study the dolan and davis 1992 scale to characterize and classify the wave storm events based on a simplified approach mendoza and jimenez 2005 anfuso et al 2016 was used the storm power index spi of dolan and davis 1992 is computed according to the following formulation 1 s p i h s 2 t where t is the persistence of the storm in hours and the significant wave height hs must exceed a given significant wave height threshold hs threshold the significant wave height threshold of a wave storm as given by dolan and davis 1992 is limited to 1 5 m in deep waters for the middle atlantic in this study the significant wave height threshold according to ojeda et al 2017 which specifies that it is appropriate to define the hs threshold based on the local characteristics of the wave regime was determined the hs threshold is computed using the equation proposed by birkemeier et al 1999 and described by walker and basco 2011 and mendoza et al 2013 as follows 2 h s t h r e s h o l d x 2 σ where x is the long term mean significant wave height in deep waters and σ is the standard deviation in the algiers coast the hthreshold calculated based on this formula is 2 7 m in station s1 fig 2 this station was chosen for the long term analysis according to its position in the middle of the study area 3 20 e x 36 89 n at a depth of 1512 m from a distance of 10 km from the coast and close to the validation buoy b1 the mean and standard deviation of the significant wave heights in station s1 are respectively 1 17 m and 0 77 m concerning the minimum period between two storm events a 48 h period was used following ojeda et al 2017 two successive storm events are considered separate and independent the significant wave heights do not exceed the hthreshold during a period of 48 h between two events based on the wave storm characterization criteria 729 marine storm events with a mean spi ranging from 21 m2 h to 3002 m2 h were filtered from a statistical point of view it is more practical to classify these storms according to their spi following dolan and david s methodology five classes from weak storm events to the extreme storm events were developed based on storm power index using the hierarchical agglomerative clustering method the results of this classification including the storm number and the average spi for each storm class are presented in table 4 6 statistical analysis of wave storm events at the shoreline scale impact of the wave storms can vary both according to the storm s power index and to storms wave propagation direction overall mean wave direction therefore the five storm classes characterized in the previous section have been subdivided into 31 storm event categories taking into account their direction the storm direction considered is the dominant wave direction during the storm passage the results presented in table 5 provide a simple statistical summary of wave storms observed during the period 1979 2018 at the offshore station s1 the storm events were summed according to their spi and direction classes furthermore the mean significant wave heights the mean wave energy period and the average of the maximum significant wave heights corresponding to each storm class were given according to these results it is observed that the algiers coasts are exposed to six cases of extensive storm events seven cases of extreme storm events and three cases of catastrophic storm events with a maximum significant wave height of 8 13 m off the algiers coast and a maximum persistence of 192 h in addition the results show that the most dominant and the most powerful storm events are those originating from the wnw and nne as presented in the wave rose fig 7 with 60 of the total storm events thus storm events from these two directions and those from the north and west present the most violent events hindcasted in recent decades and during which the highest extreme wave heights are observed for catastrophic storm events three different origins were recorded n nne and wnw fig 7 these results constitute an important benchmark for decision making in the fields of navigation maritime safety and coastal and offshore engineering in order to ensure sustainable future developments in the following part the temporal variation of the wave storm events occurred during the past 40 years is presented the analysis of monthly seasonal annual mid decadal and decadal variations was carried out taking into consideration the different storm classes 6 1 monthly and seasonal variation of storm events concerning the monthly variation of occurrence frequency event number of storm event fig 8 it is observed that these events are more frequent during december with 17 5 of total storm events including 63 of weak storms 3 extreme storms class iv and no catastrophic storms class v on the other hand it is also observed that the month of february has the lowest occurrence probability of weak storms class 1 and the highest occurrence probability of extreme storm event class iv with 5 events and no catastrophic storm class v the three catastrophic class v storm events were recorded separately during january march and november fig 8 these results allow us to conclude that on a monthly scale the increase in wave storm events do not reflect an increase in the extreme or catastrophic storms on a seasonal scale it is observed that for class i to class iv storms the wave storm events are more frequent during the winter season and are also considerable during the spring and autumn seasons however the three catastrophic storms observed were recorded separately during these three seasons the summer period unlike the other seasons is characterized by a very low number of wave storm events with only 23 weak events class i recorded over 40 years fig 8 this season is considered the most suitable for the construction of sensitive coastal engineering projects 6 2 annual variation of storm events the long term variation of storm events fig 9 shows a strong inter annual variation both in total storm event occurrences as well as in storm class occurrences the maximum number of storm events was recorded during 2013 with 32 events in which no events of class iv and v were seen fig 9 on the other hand the minimum number of storm events was recorded during 1995 with only 10 storms of class i and ii fig 9 this result shows a very large difference in the occurrence of inter annual storm events therefore the inter annual occurrence distribution of storm classes does not depend on the total number of events the risk of having an extreme or catastrophic storm does not depend on the total number of annual events for example the three cases of catastrophic storm were observed during the years 2001 2007 and 2015 for which the total annual number of storm events did not exceed 16 events fig 9 variation of the inter annual storm events shows an increasing tendency in the storm frequency more specifically for the extensive the extreme and the catastrophic storms this increase is clearly observed by assessing the mid decadal decadal and 20 year storm events variations fig 9 over the past ten years and even more during the past twenty years it is observed a considerable growth in the extensive wave storm events frequency class iii with a rate of 81 in the extreme storm events frequency class iv with a rate of 16 and in the catastrophic storm events with a rate of 100 since no cases were recorded between 1979 and 2001 fig 9 these increases recorded at decennial and twenty year scales can be a consequence of the climate change phenomenon reported by several authors in the mediterranean sea in terms of temperature variation precipitation sea level ex giorgi and lionello 2008 mariotti et al 2015 cramer et al 2018 negro et al 2018 according to cramer et al 2018 the significant increase in risks related to climate change must be taken into account in the sustainable development policies of mediterranean countries particularly those bordering the southern coast which are lacking in information compared to the northern coastlines 7 extreme and catastrophic wave storm potential impacts in this section we focus on the simulation results of the nested swan model regarding extreme and catastrophic storms occurring over the past 40 years and on the potential impacts observed along the algiers coast caused as a result of these two storm classes originating from different directions with respect to the study area the seven storm events with significant recorded damage were simulated using the swan nested model stated in section 4 the wave propagation during storm peaks was mapped to assess the causalities and impacts of the wave storm events and to locate the most exposed areas affected by the particular storms the storm events analyzed in this section were responsible for property economic and human disasters the first storm analyzed was a catastrophic class v storm not shown here which persisted for more than 4 days between 09 11 2001 and 13 11 2001 with an spi of 2747 1 m2 h and a maximum offshore significant wave height greater than 8 m during this marine storm originated from the northern sector a catastrophic inundation was recorded at bab el oued this flood was not of marine origin but resulted from a torrential rainfall over the bab el oued watershed of 261 6 mm in only 24 h as recorded by the meteorological station of bouzareah machane et al 2008 during the same period the considerable sea level elevation due to the wave oscillation wave setup has caused a huge drainage problem accompanied with a coastal flooding observed in the lowest land coasts of el kettani bab el oued fig 1a according to the results of the wave propagation simulation during this storm the waves reach frontally the bab el oued shoreline with a significant height of 3 m thus at only 500 m from the bab el oued coast waves with a significant heights greater than 3 m have persisted during more than 48 h please watch the archived video here https www dailymotion com video xa0y6f this event has been the subject of several research studies djellouli and saci 2003 machane et al 2008 menad et al 2012 which focused on the different causes responsible for this disaster but none of these researches focused on the effect and the impact of the marine storm observed during this event according to menad 2012 oued m kacel discharges its water flows into the sea through two main outlets the first is directly connected to the sea and the second outlet consists of 4 oval pipes a meter in diameter that discharge the run off water directly onto the sandy beach of el kettani during the winter period the waves break directly against these run off outlets menad 2012 owing to their low elevation above the shoreline which can influence the discharge flow during rainfall periods for that reason we have raised the same question given by menad 2012 what is the effect of a wave storm on the ability to evacuate floods at the watershed outlet or at the discharge points of hydraulic drainage systems the magnitude of this marine storm has considerably amplified the direct damage caused by the rainfall flooding and complicated the recovery of human remains drained to the sea during this rainfall flooding there was a dramatic number of human and material losses with 781 deaths 115 missing and 3 271 destroyed or damaged buildings menad 2012 these rainfall flooding events present a very critical and exceptional circumstance that deserves a focused and detailed study about the wave storm effect on the rainfall flooding phenomena in coastal areas including the storm surge and the tide effect this event was a very exceptional coincidence between two disastrous weather phenomena including the wave storm event class v originated from the north observed only one time over the past 40 years and an exceptional precipitation exceeding 260 mm in 24 h which was the first observed since 1908 at the weather station of bouzeria menad 2012 the second catastrophic storm observed on the algiers coast was of north north east origin with an spi of 2836 8 m2 h and a maximum offshore significant wave height greater than 8 m fig 10 this storm has persisted for more than four days from 07 03 2007 to 12 03 2007 the impact of this storm was observed in the tipaza port where significant material damages were recorded as a consequence of a coastal flooding fig 1b the significant wave heights exceeding 3 m was estimated near the main port sea wall fig 10 no human losses were reported during this storm among the main damages recorded during this event it can be highlighted the destruction of the port entrance lighthouses and the damage of several boats as illustrated by the only archived youtube video of this event https youtu be spq97bnmt8c according to the time series plot of significant wave heights estimated during the storm at a distance of only 200 m from the main harbor seawall waves with a significant height greater than 3 m have persisted more than 12 h the wave propagation map along the algiers coast relating to this storm fig 10 indicates that the most affected coasts are located in the west of bou ismail bay near tipaza harbor the waves reached the coast frontally with a significant height exceeding 4 m fig 10 and have also exceeded 6 m in this coastal area during the catastrophic storms of 2001 in this area an accumulation of large and small boulders has been the subject of a detailed study by maouche et al 2009 which raised issues about the possibility that these boulder accumulations were caused by tsunamis or by coastal storm events the authors maouche et al 2009 of this study imply the existence of significant and possibly catastrophic waves in the past that have triggered these accumulations the 2007 2001 catastrophic storm events can therefore be among the storms being responsible of these boulders accumulations the third and last catastrophic storm hindcasted in the algiers coasts was persisted for 8 days from 29 01 2015 to 05 02 2015 with an spi of 3001 3 m2 h and a maximum significant wave height of 7 55 m offshore from a wnw sector this storm is considered as the most violent storm recorded over the past 40 years during this storm a very significant erosion was recorded on surcouf beach located in the western part of zemmour bay fig 1c and 11 this erosion has caused the demolition of two buildings and the damage of several coastal infrastructure this considerable erosion affected a beach area of 15 000 m2 and a cliff area of 4757 m2 fig 11 no human losses were reported as a result of this remarkable erosion but significant material and economic damage was recorded a 600 m longitudinal protection structure was implemented for the reinforcement of this eroded area in order to protect habitats at risk of collapse referring to the simulation results of wave conditions along the algiers coast at the peak of this catastrophic storm fig 12 it was noted that this storm was not very energetic in the eroded area although it was preceded two days earlier by two successive storm events of class iii and i originated from a ne sector fig 12 during more than four days the storm waves had frontal attack on the eroded area with a significant height of 1 5 3 m as shown in the storm wave propagation map fig 12 the most likely hypothesis is that the two successive ne wave storms were responsible of the instability and brittleness of the beach and the micro cliff therefore the catastrophic wnw storm wave that attacked the eroded area with slight obliquity to the shoreline was responsible in generating a strong longshore drift that persisted during the 8 day storm period causing a massive transport of sediment up to the micro cliff whatever the maximum storm wave power estimated for a given coastal area the persistence of storms and their wave directions is a very important factor in the assessment of coastal hazards to ensure a sustainable and an economical coastal development the knowledge of extreme waves heights e g waves with 100 year return period is not a sufficient parameter in the absence of their directions and the most probable persistence of these events it can be more interesting to consider directions of the waves during the extreme wave analysis at the different time scales during the last two decades several other damages caused by wave storm events have been recorded the extreme storm class iv of 14 11 2004 from an nne sector with an spi of 1515 8 m2 h and a maximum significant wave height of 7 55 m offshore was at the origin of the bechar shipwreck a cargo ship of 134 9 m length and the beaching of the batna a bulk of 156 m length these incidents fig 1d1 have caused 16 fatalities of bechar crews and no victims have been recorded in relation to the batna fig 1d2 considering the wave directions of this storm it is considered as a very rare for a storm event of class iv recorded only one time during the last 40 years as shown in fig 1d1 and in the youtube video https youtu be 9iptysxubg the bechar was stranded and collided with the harbor dike before it sank due to the powerful wave impacts based on the simulation of the wave conditions during the stranding of the bechar at 18 00h the same time as the wave storm peak fig 13 it was noted that waves of 4 5 m are breaking on the seawall of the algiers port fig 13 moreover the time series plot of significant wave heights close to the algiers port fig 13 shows a sudden increase in significant wave heights which grew from 2 5 m at 12h00 to 4 5 m at 18h00 this fast variation in sea state can be one of the main causes of this disaster the same evolution of the chronological profile of the wave heights and directions was also observed during the storm of 09 12 2014 fig 1e which killed 3 algerian seafarers during the sinking of the pilot boat of the algiers port and the death of an ukrainian seafarer who was attempting to tighten the vessel s anchor in algiers port the similarities between chronological profiles of these storms occur in a change in wave direction from nne to n nnw at least two days before the storm event and then a quick increase in the significant wave height that exceeded 5 5 m at the northern seawall of algiers port during the storm of 09 12 2014 class iii with a maximum offshore significant wave height of 7 8 m the wave chronological profile that preceded these two nne storms can provide an alert signature for the prevention of other similar risks for a verification of these assumptions a detailed climate study focusing on these two storm events may provide valuable insights this damage may indicate limited accuracy in forecasting such wave storms which requires further investigation the last two analyzed storms are extreme class iv storms that caused flooding in two different fishing harbors the first storm of 2016 02 14 originating from the western sector with an spi of 1587 8 m2 h has induced flooding in the harbor and on the beach of el djamila where several fishing boats were damaged fig 1f based on the wave propagation map of the storm peak fig 14 it was observed that the main harbor dike was exposed to extreme significant wave heights of 3 4 m moreover the sea level rise wave set up resulting by oscillation of the short period wave groups nakaza and hino 1991 was computed using miche s formula in the second order of approximation defined by larras 1991 as 3 ζ m π 2 h m 0 2 2 g t m 02 2 1 3 2 s i n h 2 2 π d l c o t h 2 2 π d l the wave set up results illustrated in fig 15 shows an elevation of 0 5 m at the main seawall of el djamila port over the last 40 years only 4 similar storm events class iv from western sector have been recorded the second storm recently hindcasted on march 20 2018 was the only storm events of class iv from nw sector observed over the past 40 years this storm caused an enormous damage in the port of tamentfoust several small fishing boats were damaged inside the port and several of them were sunk fig 1g this port although located in a sheltered area in the east of algiers bay was exposed to a high wave of 2 m 3 m fig 14 with a wave set up of 0 5 m fig 15 the impact recorded by this storm which was considered rare in terms of its wave s direction and not in terms of its spi confirms the importance that the direction of the waves should be considered during the extreme wave analysis in the different temporal scales sea level rise caused by the storm surge tide or by the inverse barometer effects may also amplify the coastal hazards during these wave storm events in algiers coast the upper tidal level does not exceed 30 cm ferrarin et al 2018 and the storm surge index the average of the three highest independent storm surge maxima per year does not exceed 20 cm conte and lionello 2014 androulidakis et al 2015 therefore these phenomena were not considered during this study because they are thought to have a small effect 8 extreme value analysis as noted during the analysis of the temporal variations of storms and their potential impact along the algiers coast it was concluded that the impact of a storm is not only determined by the maximum height of the storm waves but also by the spi and by its direction the objectives of this analysis are to determine the extreme return values for significant wave heights and storm power index in relation to different occurring directions the results of this analysis will allow us to predict the return periods of the different disasters recorded in the past on the algiers coast section 8 2 for the extreme wave analysis ewa several theoretical distribution functions are used these distribution functions allow a statistical fit of the observed data goda 2000 as well as according to mathiesen et al 1994 there is no theoretical evidence to establish a preferable distribution for the model the preferred distribution depends on the distribution of the retrospective wave data it is known that the peak over the threshold pot model fitting to the generalized pareto distribution gpd provides a good estimation for wave climate analysis cañellas et al 2007 this model as well as the generalized extreme value gev model are widely used and recommended by several researchers notably in the mediterranean sea cañellas et al 2007 sartini et al 2015 saeed far and abd wahab 2016 sulis et al 2017 during the present study the pot model fitted to the generalized pareto distribution pot gpd and the annual maxima method fitted to the generalized extreme value distribution am gev for the estimation of significant wave height with different return periods and for the estimation of storm return periods according to their spi and to their direction were used in the pot gpd model it is considered that the distribution function of a series of values xi xn observed independently only storm peaks was used and exceeding a specific threshold u to be adjusted to the generalized pareto distribution given by 4 f y 1 1 ξ y σ 1 ξ i f ξ 0 1 e x p y σ i f ξ 0 where the shape parameter ξ ξ and the scale parameter σ σ 0 are the two parameters of gpd the gpd is considered having a tail type i exponential distribution when ξ 0 when ξ 0 the gpd is reported to have a tail type ii which corresponds to the pareto distribution if ξ 0 the tail is type iii a special case of the beta distribution for the estimation of the shape ξ and the scale σ parameters of gpd it was based on the maximum likelihood ml estimators considered to be suitable for extreme wave analysis mathiesen et al 1994 the principle of this method is to determine the distribution parameters that maximize the likelihood function eq 4 using an iterative numerical scheme mathiesen et al 1994 goda 2010 5 l x 1 x n a 1 a m m 1 n f x i a 1 a m where f is the probability density function maximized by the parameters ai and x is the observed data values as recommended by mathiesen et al 1994 the choice of threshold value must be based on the meteorological information of the study area the number of data above the selected threshold must be lower than the number of storm events as the observed value must be independents therefore the threshold values uhs must be higher than h s t h r e s h o l d value selected for the characterization of the storm events as presented and discussed in section 5 for the choice of the model threshold values it is used a technique described by coles 2001 which consists to observe the stability of the shape parameters ξ and the modified scale σ σu ξu with respect to an increasing series of threshold values u the selected u threshold value is the value for which the estimated parameters remain near constant before it becomes quite variable due to the reduction in the sample size caires 2016 in the present study a threshold value of 3 75 m based on the whole data was selected using the pot gpd method the estimation of the probable return values over a return period m is to determine the maximum value of x which is likely to return at least once during m years by the resolution of the following function 6 f x m ζ u 1 ξ x m u σ 1 ξ 1 m where f x is the probability density function for the generalized pareto distribution and the equation below summarizes the solution 7 x m u σ ξ m ζ u ξ 1 i f ξ 0 u σ l o g m ζ u i f ξ 0 where ζ u is the probability that the value x exceeds the threshold value u as well as using the pot model m considers as a mean number of events during a return period m saeed far and abd wahab 2016 the am gev is one of the most used methods for the extreme wave analysis this method consists in adjusting the annual maxima values with the generalized extreme value gev cumulative distribution the gev distribution family is a combination of three distribution families the gumbel frechet and weibull families the cumulative distribution function of the gev is described by 8 g x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where the shape parameter ξ ξ the scale parameter σ σ 0 and location parameter μ are the three parameters of the gev distribution it is considered having a tail type ii frechet distribution families when ξ 0 the gev is reported to have a tail type iii that corresponds to the weibull distribution families when ξ 0 if ξ 0 the tail is type i which corresponds to the gumbel family the distribution function in this case is described by 9 g x exp exp x μ σ for the estimation of the gev distribution parameters it is also based on maximum likelihood ml estimators based on the am gev method the estimation of the probable return values zm over a period of m years is defined by the following equation 10 z m μ σ ξ 1 l o g 1 1 m ξ i f ξ 0 μ σ ln l o g 1 1 m i f ξ 0 currently there are no preferred and recommended theoretical distribution functions for a statistical adjustment of the storm power index dolan and davis 1992 for the analysis of the storm return period according to their spi and direction the analysis of extreme values for different directions independently using the pot model requires a selection of threshold values for each direction separately which means that the number of used data and the accuracy of the results obtained by each direction are quite heterogeneous the use of the am gev method allows the user to analyze the same amount of data at each time and allows comparison between the different return levels of each direction on the other hand the most dominant storm directions that have been observed each year in the last 40 years were analyzed this condition is only applicable to the three most occurring directions nne wnw and w 40 years of wave storm data is considered to be insufficient for a reliable analysis of extreme storm return values originating from n ne e and nw directions due to the limited number of storm events off the algiers coast 8 1 extreme wave analysis results for significant wave heights the results of the extreme wave analysis presented in this section are obtained using the most widely used models in eva pot gpd and am gev these results have been developed based on 40 years of high temporal resolution wave hindcasts and provide an important aid in coastal risk assessment and an essential basis to ensure the sustainability of coastal and port developments the results presented in fig 16 illustrate the significant wave heights estimated with different returns periods off the algiers coast 1512 m in depth exactly in station s1 fig 2 these results show a remarkable difference between the estimates of the am gev model and those of the pot gpd model for return values below 8 25 m it can be seen that the pot gpd model fitted very smoothly with the hindcast data unlike the pot gpd model which overestimates return values below 8 25 m nevertheless it correctly estimated the 40 year return value which exceeds 9 m and which was only observed one time statistically it is found that the pot gpd model has a good performance compared to the am gev model operationally it is found that the result of am gev can be recommended with regard to the estimations beyond a return period of 20 years in order to insure a minimum risk furthermore the maximum difference between the two models is 0 5 m for a return period of 100 years the results of this analysis carried out off the algerian coast station s1 show that this area can be exposed to extreme significant wave heights exceeding 8 m with a return period of 20 years and may reach a height of approximately 10 m with a return period of 100 years fig 16 these wave heights have the potential to induce significant coastal damage such as that already recorded during extreme and catastrophic storms knowing that the maximum significant wave heights corresponding to extreme and catastrophic storms are respectively 5 66 m and 7 36 m on average table 5 and the return values corresponding to these two heights are estimated with return periods of 7 and 8 years successively 8 2 extreme wave analysis results for the storm events the results obtained from the extreme value analysis concerning the storm power index allowed us to define the probable return periods of the different storm classes by taking into consideration the storm direction the storm direction is an important factor that influences on the wave propagation along the algiers coast and constitutes a crucial information to ensure the most economical and sustainable development of coastal and harbor structures by knowing the direction of the return storms the engineers will be able to design an optimal orientation and conception of the different coastal dikes thus these results are used to estimate the return periods of extreme and catastrophic storms that have already caused significant damage over the past 40 years fig 17 shows the extreme return values of spi estimated as a function of three different directions with return periods up to 100 years as mentioned above this estimation was developed using the am gev model by comparing the estimation results with the used annual maxima shown in the same plot the same observation is noted as the one noted using the am gev model for the analysis of the extreme significant wave heights this observation consists in an overestimation of the extreme values corresponding to return periods less than 20 years and a good estimate of the return periods of 40 years this situation may be explained by the significant difference between the two strongest storms estimated for each direction for a distribution based on 40 values this fact may have a remarkable effect unlike distributions based on a considerable number of values exceeding a given threshold the extreme spi analysis result shows that the most frequent storms of class i and class ii are estimated with a return period of less than one year concerning the return periods for extensive storms from the wnw nne and w sectors it is estimated return periods of 1 5 1 8 and 2 1 years respectively for extreme and catastrophic storms it was noted that the return period of the wnw storms is significantly earlier than the return period of the w and nne sectors it is recommended for sustainable and economic management to focus more on wnw waves in the design of coastal structures the return periods of the wnw nne and w storms are 4 2 6 4 and 7 4 years respectively for extreme storms class iv and 12 2 18 and 18 6 years respectively for catastrophic storms class v the eva results allowed us to estimate the return periods table 6 of some storms that have caused severe damage over the past 40 years on the algiers coast a return period of 59 years is estimated for the most severe catastrophic storm with an spi of 3001 m2 h that was observed in 2015 9 conclusion this work involves a detailed analysis of behavior of the wave storm events along the algiers coast from a spatial and temporal aspect as part of this process a characterization and classification of wave storms over the last 40 years has been established based on the storm power index spi of dolan and davis 1992 off the algiers coast station 1 this method allowed us to classify 729 storm events into five classes in terms of their spi including 13 extreme events and three catastrophic events and 31 storm events in terms of both spi and direction to carry out a spatial analysis of extreme and catastrophic storms along the algiers coasts a local grid swan model nested in the coarse grid swan model that has been implemented for the entire mediterranean basin amarouche et al 2019 was used the nested swan model is calibrated against the wave measurement performed by the tamentfoust buoy in the center of our study area for the significant wave height it is recorded a bias of 0 14 m a scatter index of 29 and a rmse of 0 36 m for the mean wave period it is recorded an average bias of 0 005 s a mean scatter index of 15 and a mean rmse of 0 71 s these results highlight the high accuracy of the local swan model results this local swan model was used to simulate storm waves that have caused significant damage in recent decades resulting in human infra structure and economic losses the spatial simulation of wave climates during these storms allowed us to quantify their intensity in the damaged coastal areas according to the simulation results and in view of the damage caused by the simulated storm events it is concluded that the storm influence in a coastal area depends on several factors including mainly the storm power index the ratio between the persistence of the storm and the average significant wave height the storm direction and also the storm succession a consideration of these different factors will allow us to identify the most vulnerable area against the different storm events in the future and to estimate the probable hazards and damages according to the temporal variation analysis of storm events over different time scales it is observed that the month of february has the highest occurrence probability of extreme storm event class iv with 5 events during 40 years the three catastrophic class v storm events were recorded separately during january march and november and that on a monthly and seasonal scale the increase in wave storm events do not reflect an increase in the extreme or catastrophic storm hazard on the annual scale it is observed a trend towards an increase in the number of storm events and in the intensity of the severe storms in recent years thus the storms that have caused damage over the last two decades are considered very rare in terms of their direction and most of them have been observed only once in the last 40 years by assessing the damage caused by extreme and catastrophic storms over the last two decades it is found that depending on the power persistence and direction these storm events are able to induce massive erosion coastal flooding shipwreck and also may increase the flooding risk if it will be followed by an extreme rainfall as observed during the inundations of bab el oued in november 2001 in order to ensure prevention against the risk caused by the various wave storm events an extreme values analysis for significant wave heights and storm power index considering their direction was developed this analysis allowed us to estimate the return value of significant wave height using two different methods am gev and pot gpd and to estimate the return period corresponding to five storm classes originating from the most dominant directions w wnw n using am gev method the return periods of 4 2 and 12 2 years are estimated successively for extreme and catastrophic storms based on the spi returned values fig 17 thus the return period of wnw storms is considerably earlier than the return period of nw and w storms knowing that 37 of storm events observed over the last 40 years are originated from the wnw sector fig 7 including the most powerful storm of 2015 it is recommended to focus on the wnw storm events in the future coastal protection projects and in the design of coastal and port structures to ensure sustainable and economic development in the algiers coastlines credit authorship contribution statement khalid amarouche conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis writing original draft adem akpınar

21734,knowledge of coastal storm regimes is essential to ensure an economic and sustainable development in the coastal area in recent decades wave storms have been responsible for several fatalities and economic losses along the algiers coast the aim of this paper is to present a detailed analysis on wave storm events during the past 40 years including an assessment of the potential impacts of various storm events along the algiers coasts according to their intensity and direction based on the different historical events thus this paper gives an estimation of return periods of extreme significant wave heights and extreme storm events for this purpose the wave storm events occurring in the algiers coasts based on the storm power index spi developed by dolan and davis 1992 were characterized and classified five storm categories were defined in terms of their power index subdivided into 31 categories taking into consideration their propagation directions the temporal analysis shows a progressive increase in the number of storm events and their intensity during the last decade which explains the increased damage recorded recently in the algiers coastlines a spatial analysis of these extreme and catastrophic storms being responsible in these damages has shown that the nature of coastal storm damages on the local scale depends on several factors mainly power of these storms and their direction in view of the complex morphology of the algiers coastlines these two factors were considered during the extreme value analysis and allowed us to estimate the return period of the storm events already observed based on their spi and direction a return period of 59 years has been estimated for the catastrophic storm of 2015 which caused significant erosion resulting a loss of more than 15 000 m2 of coastal lands keywords coastal storms coastal hazard wave storm climate extreme wave analysis algiers coast sw mediterranean 1 introduction as in most countries of the world algeria is characterized by a high population concentration in its coastline linked to the high tourist and economic activities that occur in this area the pressure exerted by these coastal activities in addition to climate change makes it exposed to high natural hazard si mav et al 2013 on the other hand the various coastal studies and developments related to these activities require a good knowledge of storm regimes guisado pintado et al 2014 and of the return levels of extreme wave heights sulis et al 2017 in order to ensure economic and sustainable reinforcement and design of ports and coastal protection infrastructures and to identify vulnerable coastal areas exposed to high natural hazards in recent decades marine storms have caused several economic property and human disasters in the central algerian coasts the coastal infrastructure damage extensive coastal erosion demolished coastal building destabilizing cliffs shipwrecks with fatalities and port flooding have been recorded fig 1 the several recent studies seghir et al 2018 salem cherif et al 2019 otmani et al 2019 2020 have reported that the algiers coastline was subject of considerable coastal erosion according to otmani et al 2020 the eastern algiers zone has experienced an increase in the erosion rate between 2003 and 2017 indeed several authors mihoubi et al 2014 atroune et al 2018 rabehi et al 2018 have stated that the algiers coastline experiences a high degree of vulnerability currently in only 150 km of coastline more than 70 coastal protection structure have been installed or under installation to counter the power of the destructive wave storms this damage can considerably affect the country s economy considering the high cost required by the reconstruction of the affected areas and requires that the scale of these storms are be anticipated in order to take the necessary precautions against the natural disaster akpınar et al 2017 wave storms have the ability to significantly modify the coastal landscape dolan et al 1978 maouche et al 2009 sanchez vidal et al 2012 in the mediterranean sea several studies maouche et al 2009 jimenez et al 2009 bosom and jiménez 2011 bertotti et al 2012 armaroli et al 2012 katz and mushkin 2013 sartini et al 2017 sulis et al 2017 have focused on the assessment of the extreme waves wave storm events and possible tsunami events in the central algerian coasts as presented by maouche et al 2009 several large block accumulations have been suspected of being a result of catastrophic storm or tsunami event according to sartini et al 2017 the highest return levels of extreme wave heights are estimated in the algerian basin it is therefore difficult to determine the event causing the boulders accumulation in the algiers coasts if they are caused by a tsunami or by extreme waves thus the algerian basin is exposed both to violent storm events nacef et al 2016 and to the different cyclonic activities of the mediterranean sea sartini et al 2017 this work aims to investigate in detail the coastal storm events occurring on the algiers coasts and to assess and estimate the potential impacts of extreme and catastrophic storms and their likely return periods in order to achieve these objectives we have based on 40 year wave hindcast dataset developed for the assessment of wave energy resources on the algerian coast amarouche et al 2020 using the swan wind wave model booij et al 1999 calibrated based on wave measurements carried out on the algerian coast and validated for the whole western mediterranean basin amarouche et al 2019 this wave hindcast database was used mainly for the characterization and classification of storms occurring off the algiers coast based on the storm power index spi of dolan and davis 1992 this index represents a simple means to obtain storm intensity mendoza and jimenez 2005 and has been used and recommended by several authors nicholls and hoozemans 1996 mendoza et al 2013 quevauviller 2014 guisado pintado et al 2014 karunarathna et al 2014 anfuso et al 2016 martzikos et al 2018 carvalho et al 2020 barletta and calliari n d the characterized and classified storm cluster was subjected to extensive statistical analysis over different time scales taking into consideration both storm intensity and direction thus the storms resulting in significant damage on the algiers coasts including catastrophic and extreme storms were the subject of a spatio temporal simulation in order to determine its potential in the impacted zones and in order to situate the most exposed coastal zones against these storms for an accurate and high spatial resolution simulation of storm wave propagation we evolved from the coarse swan grid model with 3 km resolution amarouche et al 2019 to a local grid model 200 m resolution using the downscaling methodology based on the telescopic nested grid system as presented in bingölbali et al 2019 at last for the estimation of the different return periods of extreme significant wave heights and extreme storm power index spi two methods were used the peak over threshold adjusted to the generalized pareto distribution pot gpd and the annual maximum adjusted to the generalized extreme value distribution am gev these two methods are currently the most widely used and recommended by researchers kapelonis et al 2015 samayam et al 2017 sartini et al 2017 thus the return periods of severe storms have been estimated in terms of their intensity and direction considering that the direction of storm waves exerts a large influence on their propagation along the coastline 2 study area the algiers coast located in the center of the algerian coast extends along a 150 km coastal line from cap chenoua 2 39 e to cap djennat 3 72 w this area has the highest population pressure in algeria fig 2 with its three provinces algiers capital tipaza and boumerdes it has an important economic area that supports various investments in the different sectors tourism industry and fisheries the algiers coast is characterized by a very complex morphology with the presence of 3 distinct bays bouisimail bay in the west is an open bay oriented towards the north west with 62 km of coastline thus this bay is characterized by a considerable continental shelf compared to other bays which extends about 11 km from the shoreline the bay of algiers unlike the bay of bouismail is a small and semi enclosed bay with an entrance of 16 km exposed to the north and a coastline of 28 km zemourie bay which is also different as compared to the other two bays with its wide northward orientation is characterized by a narrower continental shelf compared to bouismail bay this complex morphology of the algiers coast leads to the unbalanced distribution of wave energy near the coast which is also influenced both by the direction and the amplitude of the waves along these coasts some areas are likely to experience significant concentrations of wave energy due to diffraction and refraction phenomena the map fig 2 shows the geographical location of the study area as well as the position of the wave measurement buoys b1 tamentfoust used for the calibration of the swan model which is locally embedded in the regional swan model that covers all of the western mediterranean 3 wave hindcast database the wave hindcast database used in this study was developed using the calibrated swan model for the evaluation of wave energy resource along the algerian coast amarouche et al 2020 the swan model was calibrated by authors amarouche et al 2019 for the algerian coast based on one year s wave measurement of azeffoun buoy b2 and validated against 11 buoys installed throughout the west mediterranean basin fig 2 the used buoys characteristic and depth are detailed in table 1 and the validation results for each buoy are summarized in table 2 for the significant wave height it was recorded a mean bias of 0 04 m a mean scatter index of 30 and a mean rmse of 0 31 m for the mean wave period it was observed an average bias of 0 36 s a mean scatter index of 19 and a mean rmse of 0 83 s on the other hand by comparing the maximum values obtained by the swan model and the maximum values measured by the buoys a slight overestimation by the swan model that we consider favorable is noticed for coastal hazard prediction and extreme wave analysis studies to ensure maximum safety and sustainable development during the design of offshore and coastal structures the performance of the calibrated swan model during several storm periods is also compared by the authors amarouche et al 2019 against several models previously implemented for the mediterranean sea by ardhuin et al 2007 bolaños sanchez et al 2007 and martínez asensio et al 2013 the calibrated swan model used in this study was found to be more efficient and very accurate in predicting the growth and decline of storm peaks fig 3 illustrates clearly the persistence of the calibrated swan model during the simulation of individual and successive storms thus a significant difference can be observed between the results of the default swan model and the calibrated swan model during these storms the calibrated swan model was implemented in the third generation nonstationary and 2d two dimensional mode with a time step of 30 min and with a maximum of 4 iterations per time step using the stopc convergence criterion requiring 99 of the active grid points to be converged the model domain covers the entire west mediterranean sea discretized with a regular grid of 0 033 0 033 3 km in spherical coordinates from 17 e to 6 w and from 35 n to 45 n as shown in fig 2 the directional wave energy density spectrum was discretized using 35 frequency bins between 0 033 hz and 1 0 hz and 36 directional bins with constant increment the numerical scheme was the slightly dispersive scheme bsbt first order upwind backward in space backward in time concerning physical setting selected based on the calibration results the most adapted formulas in the west mediterranean basin are komen et al 1994 for the exponential wind wave growth and janssen 1991 1989 for the whitecapping with a dissipation coefficient of cds 1 0 thus the jonswap bottom friction formulation was activated according to zijlema et al 2012 with cfjon 0 038 m2s 3 and according to the bore model of battjes and janssen 1978 the depth limited wave breaking was modelled using α 1 and γ 0 73 concerning the quadruplet wave wave interactions it was activated using the discrete interaction approximation dia of hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 with λ 0 25 and cnl4 3 107 the output data are generated for each grid point with a time interval of 3 h for 2 d spectra frequency direction for block files geographic distribution and for spectral output used for subsequent nested computations 4 local grid model implementation in order to ensure an accurate simulation of the extreme and catastrophic storm waves and to evaluate their potentiality in the affected areas along the algiers coasts an operational nested grid model swan with a high spatial resolution 200 m was implemented for the algiers coast fig 2 the local grid model was nested on the coarse grid swan model presented in the previous section the nested model as well as the coarse grid swan model used for the generation of boundary conditions were both forced by wind fields from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr the cfsr wind fields saha et al 2010 2014 was developed by the ncep and provided by the research data archive website of the university corporation for atmospheric research and the national centers for environmental prediction https rda ucar edu this data field was approved by several recent studies cox et al 2011 chawla et al 2012 donatini et al 2015 van vledder and akpınar 2015 çakmak et al 2019 using different wind wave models according to tiberi wadier et al 2016 the high temporal resolution 1 h of the cfsr is considered to be important for the estimation of storm peaks furthermore the cfsr wind fields are characterized by a high spatial resolution of 0 3125 0 3125 between 1979 and 2011 saha et al 2010 and 0 225 0 225 since 2011 saha et al 2014 compared the cfsr wind field using during this study to the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf several studies signell et al 2005 chelton and freilich 2005 ardhuin et al 2011 campos and guedes soares 2017 rusu et al 2017 showed that ecmwf wind speeds are slightly underestimated unlike the cfsr wind speeds however the use of ecmwf winds as forcing of the wind wave models induces a slight underestimation of significant wave heights unlike the ncep cfsr winds by referring to the global maps of the normalized bias related to the significant wave heights realized by stopa and cheung 2014 we observe clearly this situation in the mediterranean sea as it is mentioned above in order to ensure maximum safety and sustainable development it is considered that a slight overestimation of wind speeds and significant wave heights may be favorable for storm and coastal hazard studies and for the estimation of the extreme return period with consideration of the statistical error of the prediction model the same approach used for the calibration of the coarse grid model was used for the calibration of the nested grid model this calibration was based on the wave dissipation due to whitecapping which is the least known term in wave models pallares et al 2014 by decreasing and increasing the default value of dissipation coefficient empirical coefficient of proportionality cds the default values of the whitecapping coefficient cds are defined as 4 5 for janssen 2 36 10 5 for komen and 5 10 5 for westhuysen thus a sensitivity test was done for three different combinations of the exponential wind wave growth and the whitecapping source term formulas which are respectively komen et al 1984 komen et al 1984 komen et al 1984 janssen 1989 1991 and yan 1987 van der westhuysen 2007 the newer term entitled st6 formulation in swan have been calibrated and evaluated by the authors amarouche et al 2019 during the implementation of the coarse grid model and it is observed that the error statistics obtained using the calibrated source term package st6 remained slightly greater than the error statistics results obtained using the exponential wind wave growth formula of komen et al 1984 thus the simulation period using the st6 is 1 5 times greater than the simulation period with the previous wind wave growth formula therefore it is concluded that it is preferable to use previous wind wave growth formula during the small spatial scale simulations for high spatial resolution grid and for the long term simulation in order to select the best physical setting adapted for the algiers coast a statistical error analysis was performed to evaluate the simulation results obtained during the model calibration against 6 month wave measurement provided by the onsm offıce national de signalisation maritime from tamentfoust buoy b1 fig 2 between 01 10 1998 and 31 03 1999 a period considered to be the most dynamic throughout the year in terms of wave climate the calibration results are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 showing successively the taylor diagrams taylor 2001 and rmse versus bias plots of the simulated significant wave heights hm0 and mean wave periods tm02 compared against wave measurements the formulas used for the determination of the statistical error parameters are presented in appendix a the taylor diagram is used to plot three statistical parameters that indicate the correspondence of the model output to the observations referring to the crmsd centered root mean square difference which depends on the difference in variance and the correlation coefficient it can therefore be used to observe which of the latter two parameters has the greatest influence on the growth of the rms difference the results figs 4 and 5 showed that the modifications made on the dissipation coefficient cds coefficient have a significant effect in the nested model results which depends to the whitecapping and the exponential wind wave growth formulations it is notable in figs 4 and 5 that the increase in cds leads to a slight improvement in the model s performance in terms of significant wave height estimation for the different combinations of exponential wind wave growth and whitecapping source term formulas this finding is explained by a decrease in the crmsd and an increase in the correlation coefficient r fig 4 with a decline in the absolute of bias and rmse fig 5 on the other hand this slight improvement in the results of a significant wave height simulation was disadvantageous in terms of the mean wave period results for both komen et al 1984 and janssen 1989 1991 whitecapping formulas it is shown in figs 4 and 5 that using these two formulas the crmsd rmse and bias of the mean wave period increases slightly according to the cds however using the formula yan ab combination of van der westhuysen 2007 it is observed that the increase in cds coefficient is expressed by a slight increase in the correlation coefficient and a decrease in bias whereas the crmsd remains stable due to an increase of the difference in variance figs 4 and 5 considering both the calibration results of significant wave heights and those of the mean wave periods the exponential wind wave growth of yan 1987 and the whitecapping source term formulas of van der westhuysen 2007 with a coefficient cds2 10 0e 5 was considered as the best setting for the nested swan model in the algiers coast the best physical settings selected were detailed in table 3 the present calibration of the nested local grid model has improved the results of the default mode recommended by swan team 2018 particularly in terms of the mean wave period results the scatter plot fig 6 show a homogeneous distribution between the predicted data and the observed data for both significant wave height and mean wave period for the significant wave height it is recorded a bias of 0 14 m a scatter index of 29 and a rmse of 0 36 m for the mean wave period it is observed a bias of 0 005 s a scatter index of 15 and a rmse of 0 71 s these error statistics are considered very satisfactory for a coastal wind wave model thus the coefficient of correlation is also very acceptable it is 0 92 for significant wave heights and 0 86 for mean wave periods 5 storm characterization and classification a wave storm is generally defined as a marine storm event where the waves exceed a threshold wave height hs threshold and persists through a considerable time period in this study the dolan and davis 1992 scale to characterize and classify the wave storm events based on a simplified approach mendoza and jimenez 2005 anfuso et al 2016 was used the storm power index spi of dolan and davis 1992 is computed according to the following formulation 1 s p i h s 2 t where t is the persistence of the storm in hours and the significant wave height hs must exceed a given significant wave height threshold hs threshold the significant wave height threshold of a wave storm as given by dolan and davis 1992 is limited to 1 5 m in deep waters for the middle atlantic in this study the significant wave height threshold according to ojeda et al 2017 which specifies that it is appropriate to define the hs threshold based on the local characteristics of the wave regime was determined the hs threshold is computed using the equation proposed by birkemeier et al 1999 and described by walker and basco 2011 and mendoza et al 2013 as follows 2 h s t h r e s h o l d x 2 σ where x is the long term mean significant wave height in deep waters and σ is the standard deviation in the algiers coast the hthreshold calculated based on this formula is 2 7 m in station s1 fig 2 this station was chosen for the long term analysis according to its position in the middle of the study area 3 20 e x 36 89 n at a depth of 1512 m from a distance of 10 km from the coast and close to the validation buoy b1 the mean and standard deviation of the significant wave heights in station s1 are respectively 1 17 m and 0 77 m concerning the minimum period between two storm events a 48 h period was used following ojeda et al 2017 two successive storm events are considered separate and independent the significant wave heights do not exceed the hthreshold during a period of 48 h between two events based on the wave storm characterization criteria 729 marine storm events with a mean spi ranging from 21 m2 h to 3002 m2 h were filtered from a statistical point of view it is more practical to classify these storms according to their spi following dolan and david s methodology five classes from weak storm events to the extreme storm events were developed based on storm power index using the hierarchical agglomerative clustering method the results of this classification including the storm number and the average spi for each storm class are presented in table 4 6 statistical analysis of wave storm events at the shoreline scale impact of the wave storms can vary both according to the storm s power index and to storms wave propagation direction overall mean wave direction therefore the five storm classes characterized in the previous section have been subdivided into 31 storm event categories taking into account their direction the storm direction considered is the dominant wave direction during the storm passage the results presented in table 5 provide a simple statistical summary of wave storms observed during the period 1979 2018 at the offshore station s1 the storm events were summed according to their spi and direction classes furthermore the mean significant wave heights the mean wave energy period and the average of the maximum significant wave heights corresponding to each storm class were given according to these results it is observed that the algiers coasts are exposed to six cases of extensive storm events seven cases of extreme storm events and three cases of catastrophic storm events with a maximum significant wave height of 8 13 m off the algiers coast and a maximum persistence of 192 h in addition the results show that the most dominant and the most powerful storm events are those originating from the wnw and nne as presented in the wave rose fig 7 with 60 of the total storm events thus storm events from these two directions and those from the north and west present the most violent events hindcasted in recent decades and during which the highest extreme wave heights are observed for catastrophic storm events three different origins were recorded n nne and wnw fig 7 these results constitute an important benchmark for decision making in the fields of navigation maritime safety and coastal and offshore engineering in order to ensure sustainable future developments in the following part the temporal variation of the wave storm events occurred during the past 40 years is presented the analysis of monthly seasonal annual mid decadal and decadal variations was carried out taking into consideration the different storm classes 6 1 monthly and seasonal variation of storm events concerning the monthly variation of occurrence frequency event number of storm event fig 8 it is observed that these events are more frequent during december with 17 5 of total storm events including 63 of weak storms 3 extreme storms class iv and no catastrophic storms class v on the other hand it is also observed that the month of february has the lowest occurrence probability of weak storms class 1 and the highest occurrence probability of extreme storm event class iv with 5 events and no catastrophic storm class v the three catastrophic class v storm events were recorded separately during january march and november fig 8 these results allow us to conclude that on a monthly scale the increase in wave storm events do not reflect an increase in the extreme or catastrophic storms on a seasonal scale it is observed that for class i to class iv storms the wave storm events are more frequent during the winter season and are also considerable during the spring and autumn seasons however the three catastrophic storms observed were recorded separately during these three seasons the summer period unlike the other seasons is characterized by a very low number of wave storm events with only 23 weak events class i recorded over 40 years fig 8 this season is considered the most suitable for the construction of sensitive coastal engineering projects 6 2 annual variation of storm events the long term variation of storm events fig 9 shows a strong inter annual variation both in total storm event occurrences as well as in storm class occurrences the maximum number of storm events was recorded during 2013 with 32 events in which no events of class iv and v were seen fig 9 on the other hand the minimum number of storm events was recorded during 1995 with only 10 storms of class i and ii fig 9 this result shows a very large difference in the occurrence of inter annual storm events therefore the inter annual occurrence distribution of storm classes does not depend on the total number of events the risk of having an extreme or catastrophic storm does not depend on the total number of annual events for example the three cases of catastrophic storm were observed during the years 2001 2007 and 2015 for which the total annual number of storm events did not exceed 16 events fig 9 variation of the inter annual storm events shows an increasing tendency in the storm frequency more specifically for the extensive the extreme and the catastrophic storms this increase is clearly observed by assessing the mid decadal decadal and 20 year storm events variations fig 9 over the past ten years and even more during the past twenty years it is observed a considerable growth in the extensive wave storm events frequency class iii with a rate of 81 in the extreme storm events frequency class iv with a rate of 16 and in the catastrophic storm events with a rate of 100 since no cases were recorded between 1979 and 2001 fig 9 these increases recorded at decennial and twenty year scales can be a consequence of the climate change phenomenon reported by several authors in the mediterranean sea in terms of temperature variation precipitation sea level ex giorgi and lionello 2008 mariotti et al 2015 cramer et al 2018 negro et al 2018 according to cramer et al 2018 the significant increase in risks related to climate change must be taken into account in the sustainable development policies of mediterranean countries particularly those bordering the southern coast which are lacking in information compared to the northern coastlines 7 extreme and catastrophic wave storm potential impacts in this section we focus on the simulation results of the nested swan model regarding extreme and catastrophic storms occurring over the past 40 years and on the potential impacts observed along the algiers coast caused as a result of these two storm classes originating from different directions with respect to the study area the seven storm events with significant recorded damage were simulated using the swan nested model stated in section 4 the wave propagation during storm peaks was mapped to assess the causalities and impacts of the wave storm events and to locate the most exposed areas affected by the particular storms the storm events analyzed in this section were responsible for property economic and human disasters the first storm analyzed was a catastrophic class v storm not shown here which persisted for more than 4 days between 09 11 2001 and 13 11 2001 with an spi of 2747 1 m2 h and a maximum offshore significant wave height greater than 8 m during this marine storm originated from the northern sector a catastrophic inundation was recorded at bab el oued this flood was not of marine origin but resulted from a torrential rainfall over the bab el oued watershed of 261 6 mm in only 24 h as recorded by the meteorological station of bouzareah machane et al 2008 during the same period the considerable sea level elevation due to the wave oscillation wave setup has caused a huge drainage problem accompanied with a coastal flooding observed in the lowest land coasts of el kettani bab el oued fig 1a according to the results of the wave propagation simulation during this storm the waves reach frontally the bab el oued shoreline with a significant height of 3 m thus at only 500 m from the bab el oued coast waves with a significant heights greater than 3 m have persisted during more than 48 h please watch the archived video here https www dailymotion com video xa0y6f this event has been the subject of several research studies djellouli and saci 2003 machane et al 2008 menad et al 2012 which focused on the different causes responsible for this disaster but none of these researches focused on the effect and the impact of the marine storm observed during this event according to menad 2012 oued m kacel discharges its water flows into the sea through two main outlets the first is directly connected to the sea and the second outlet consists of 4 oval pipes a meter in diameter that discharge the run off water directly onto the sandy beach of el kettani during the winter period the waves break directly against these run off outlets menad 2012 owing to their low elevation above the shoreline which can influence the discharge flow during rainfall periods for that reason we have raised the same question given by menad 2012 what is the effect of a wave storm on the ability to evacuate floods at the watershed outlet or at the discharge points of hydraulic drainage systems the magnitude of this marine storm has considerably amplified the direct damage caused by the rainfall flooding and complicated the recovery of human remains drained to the sea during this rainfall flooding there was a dramatic number of human and material losses with 781 deaths 115 missing and 3 271 destroyed or damaged buildings menad 2012 these rainfall flooding events present a very critical and exceptional circumstance that deserves a focused and detailed study about the wave storm effect on the rainfall flooding phenomena in coastal areas including the storm surge and the tide effect this event was a very exceptional coincidence between two disastrous weather phenomena including the wave storm event class v originated from the north observed only one time over the past 40 years and an exceptional precipitation exceeding 260 mm in 24 h which was the first observed since 1908 at the weather station of bouzeria menad 2012 the second catastrophic storm observed on the algiers coast was of north north east origin with an spi of 2836 8 m2 h and a maximum offshore significant wave height greater than 8 m fig 10 this storm has persisted for more than four days from 07 03 2007 to 12 03 2007 the impact of this storm was observed in the tipaza port where significant material damages were recorded as a consequence of a coastal flooding fig 1b the significant wave heights exceeding 3 m was estimated near the main port sea wall fig 10 no human losses were reported during this storm among the main damages recorded during this event it can be highlighted the destruction of the port entrance lighthouses and the damage of several boats as illustrated by the only archived youtube video of this event https youtu be spq97bnmt8c according to the time series plot of significant wave heights estimated during the storm at a distance of only 200 m from the main harbor seawall waves with a significant height greater than 3 m have persisted more than 12 h the wave propagation map along the algiers coast relating to this storm fig 10 indicates that the most affected coasts are located in the west of bou ismail bay near tipaza harbor the waves reached the coast frontally with a significant height exceeding 4 m fig 10 and have also exceeded 6 m in this coastal area during the catastrophic storms of 2001 in this area an accumulation of large and small boulders has been the subject of a detailed study by maouche et al 2009 which raised issues about the possibility that these boulder accumulations were caused by tsunamis or by coastal storm events the authors maouche et al 2009 of this study imply the existence of significant and possibly catastrophic waves in the past that have triggered these accumulations the 2007 2001 catastrophic storm events can therefore be among the storms being responsible of these boulders accumulations the third and last catastrophic storm hindcasted in the algiers coasts was persisted for 8 days from 29 01 2015 to 05 02 2015 with an spi of 3001 3 m2 h and a maximum significant wave height of 7 55 m offshore from a wnw sector this storm is considered as the most violent storm recorded over the past 40 years during this storm a very significant erosion was recorded on surcouf beach located in the western part of zemmour bay fig 1c and 11 this erosion has caused the demolition of two buildings and the damage of several coastal infrastructure this considerable erosion affected a beach area of 15 000 m2 and a cliff area of 4757 m2 fig 11 no human losses were reported as a result of this remarkable erosion but significant material and economic damage was recorded a 600 m longitudinal protection structure was implemented for the reinforcement of this eroded area in order to protect habitats at risk of collapse referring to the simulation results of wave conditions along the algiers coast at the peak of this catastrophic storm fig 12 it was noted that this storm was not very energetic in the eroded area although it was preceded two days earlier by two successive storm events of class iii and i originated from a ne sector fig 12 during more than four days the storm waves had frontal attack on the eroded area with a significant height of 1 5 3 m as shown in the storm wave propagation map fig 12 the most likely hypothesis is that the two successive ne wave storms were responsible of the instability and brittleness of the beach and the micro cliff therefore the catastrophic wnw storm wave that attacked the eroded area with slight obliquity to the shoreline was responsible in generating a strong longshore drift that persisted during the 8 day storm period causing a massive transport of sediment up to the micro cliff whatever the maximum storm wave power estimated for a given coastal area the persistence of storms and their wave directions is a very important factor in the assessment of coastal hazards to ensure a sustainable and an economical coastal development the knowledge of extreme waves heights e g waves with 100 year return period is not a sufficient parameter in the absence of their directions and the most probable persistence of these events it can be more interesting to consider directions of the waves during the extreme wave analysis at the different time scales during the last two decades several other damages caused by wave storm events have been recorded the extreme storm class iv of 14 11 2004 from an nne sector with an spi of 1515 8 m2 h and a maximum significant wave height of 7 55 m offshore was at the origin of the bechar shipwreck a cargo ship of 134 9 m length and the beaching of the batna a bulk of 156 m length these incidents fig 1d1 have caused 16 fatalities of bechar crews and no victims have been recorded in relation to the batna fig 1d2 considering the wave directions of this storm it is considered as a very rare for a storm event of class iv recorded only one time during the last 40 years as shown in fig 1d1 and in the youtube video https youtu be 9iptysxubg the bechar was stranded and collided with the harbor dike before it sank due to the powerful wave impacts based on the simulation of the wave conditions during the stranding of the bechar at 18 00h the same time as the wave storm peak fig 13 it was noted that waves of 4 5 m are breaking on the seawall of the algiers port fig 13 moreover the time series plot of significant wave heights close to the algiers port fig 13 shows a sudden increase in significant wave heights which grew from 2 5 m at 12h00 to 4 5 m at 18h00 this fast variation in sea state can be one of the main causes of this disaster the same evolution of the chronological profile of the wave heights and directions was also observed during the storm of 09 12 2014 fig 1e which killed 3 algerian seafarers during the sinking of the pilot boat of the algiers port and the death of an ukrainian seafarer who was attempting to tighten the vessel s anchor in algiers port the similarities between chronological profiles of these storms occur in a change in wave direction from nne to n nnw at least two days before the storm event and then a quick increase in the significant wave height that exceeded 5 5 m at the northern seawall of algiers port during the storm of 09 12 2014 class iii with a maximum offshore significant wave height of 7 8 m the wave chronological profile that preceded these two nne storms can provide an alert signature for the prevention of other similar risks for a verification of these assumptions a detailed climate study focusing on these two storm events may provide valuable insights this damage may indicate limited accuracy in forecasting such wave storms which requires further investigation the last two analyzed storms are extreme class iv storms that caused flooding in two different fishing harbors the first storm of 2016 02 14 originating from the western sector with an spi of 1587 8 m2 h has induced flooding in the harbor and on the beach of el djamila where several fishing boats were damaged fig 1f based on the wave propagation map of the storm peak fig 14 it was observed that the main harbor dike was exposed to extreme significant wave heights of 3 4 m moreover the sea level rise wave set up resulting by oscillation of the short period wave groups nakaza and hino 1991 was computed using miche s formula in the second order of approximation defined by larras 1991 as 3 ζ m π 2 h m 0 2 2 g t m 02 2 1 3 2 s i n h 2 2 π d l c o t h 2 2 π d l the wave set up results illustrated in fig 15 shows an elevation of 0 5 m at the main seawall of el djamila port over the last 40 years only 4 similar storm events class iv from western sector have been recorded the second storm recently hindcasted on march 20 2018 was the only storm events of class iv from nw sector observed over the past 40 years this storm caused an enormous damage in the port of tamentfoust several small fishing boats were damaged inside the port and several of them were sunk fig 1g this port although located in a sheltered area in the east of algiers bay was exposed to a high wave of 2 m 3 m fig 14 with a wave set up of 0 5 m fig 15 the impact recorded by this storm which was considered rare in terms of its wave s direction and not in terms of its spi confirms the importance that the direction of the waves should be considered during the extreme wave analysis in the different temporal scales sea level rise caused by the storm surge tide or by the inverse barometer effects may also amplify the coastal hazards during these wave storm events in algiers coast the upper tidal level does not exceed 30 cm ferrarin et al 2018 and the storm surge index the average of the three highest independent storm surge maxima per year does not exceed 20 cm conte and lionello 2014 androulidakis et al 2015 therefore these phenomena were not considered during this study because they are thought to have a small effect 8 extreme value analysis as noted during the analysis of the temporal variations of storms and their potential impact along the algiers coast it was concluded that the impact of a storm is not only determined by the maximum height of the storm waves but also by the spi and by its direction the objectives of this analysis are to determine the extreme return values for significant wave heights and storm power index in relation to different occurring directions the results of this analysis will allow us to predict the return periods of the different disasters recorded in the past on the algiers coast section 8 2 for the extreme wave analysis ewa several theoretical distribution functions are used these distribution functions allow a statistical fit of the observed data goda 2000 as well as according to mathiesen et al 1994 there is no theoretical evidence to establish a preferable distribution for the model the preferred distribution depends on the distribution of the retrospective wave data it is known that the peak over the threshold pot model fitting to the generalized pareto distribution gpd provides a good estimation for wave climate analysis cañellas et al 2007 this model as well as the generalized extreme value gev model are widely used and recommended by several researchers notably in the mediterranean sea cañellas et al 2007 sartini et al 2015 saeed far and abd wahab 2016 sulis et al 2017 during the present study the pot model fitted to the generalized pareto distribution pot gpd and the annual maxima method fitted to the generalized extreme value distribution am gev for the estimation of significant wave height with different return periods and for the estimation of storm return periods according to their spi and to their direction were used in the pot gpd model it is considered that the distribution function of a series of values xi xn observed independently only storm peaks was used and exceeding a specific threshold u to be adjusted to the generalized pareto distribution given by 4 f y 1 1 ξ y σ 1 ξ i f ξ 0 1 e x p y σ i f ξ 0 where the shape parameter ξ ξ and the scale parameter σ σ 0 are the two parameters of gpd the gpd is considered having a tail type i exponential distribution when ξ 0 when ξ 0 the gpd is reported to have a tail type ii which corresponds to the pareto distribution if ξ 0 the tail is type iii a special case of the beta distribution for the estimation of the shape ξ and the scale σ parameters of gpd it was based on the maximum likelihood ml estimators considered to be suitable for extreme wave analysis mathiesen et al 1994 the principle of this method is to determine the distribution parameters that maximize the likelihood function eq 4 using an iterative numerical scheme mathiesen et al 1994 goda 2010 5 l x 1 x n a 1 a m m 1 n f x i a 1 a m where f is the probability density function maximized by the parameters ai and x is the observed data values as recommended by mathiesen et al 1994 the choice of threshold value must be based on the meteorological information of the study area the number of data above the selected threshold must be lower than the number of storm events as the observed value must be independents therefore the threshold values uhs must be higher than h s t h r e s h o l d value selected for the characterization of the storm events as presented and discussed in section 5 for the choice of the model threshold values it is used a technique described by coles 2001 which consists to observe the stability of the shape parameters ξ and the modified scale σ σu ξu with respect to an increasing series of threshold values u the selected u threshold value is the value for which the estimated parameters remain near constant before it becomes quite variable due to the reduction in the sample size caires 2016 in the present study a threshold value of 3 75 m based on the whole data was selected using the pot gpd method the estimation of the probable return values over a return period m is to determine the maximum value of x which is likely to return at least once during m years by the resolution of the following function 6 f x m ζ u 1 ξ x m u σ 1 ξ 1 m where f x is the probability density function for the generalized pareto distribution and the equation below summarizes the solution 7 x m u σ ξ m ζ u ξ 1 i f ξ 0 u σ l o g m ζ u i f ξ 0 where ζ u is the probability that the value x exceeds the threshold value u as well as using the pot model m considers as a mean number of events during a return period m saeed far and abd wahab 2016 the am gev is one of the most used methods for the extreme wave analysis this method consists in adjusting the annual maxima values with the generalized extreme value gev cumulative distribution the gev distribution family is a combination of three distribution families the gumbel frechet and weibull families the cumulative distribution function of the gev is described by 8 g x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where the shape parameter ξ ξ the scale parameter σ σ 0 and location parameter μ are the three parameters of the gev distribution it is considered having a tail type ii frechet distribution families when ξ 0 the gev is reported to have a tail type iii that corresponds to the weibull distribution families when ξ 0 if ξ 0 the tail is type i which corresponds to the gumbel family the distribution function in this case is described by 9 g x exp exp x μ σ for the estimation of the gev distribution parameters it is also based on maximum likelihood ml estimators based on the am gev method the estimation of the probable return values zm over a period of m years is defined by the following equation 10 z m μ σ ξ 1 l o g 1 1 m ξ i f ξ 0 μ σ ln l o g 1 1 m i f ξ 0 currently there are no preferred and recommended theoretical distribution functions for a statistical adjustment of the storm power index dolan and davis 1992 for the analysis of the storm return period according to their spi and direction the analysis of extreme values for different directions independently using the pot model requires a selection of threshold values for each direction separately which means that the number of used data and the accuracy of the results obtained by each direction are quite heterogeneous the use of the am gev method allows the user to analyze the same amount of data at each time and allows comparison between the different return levels of each direction on the other hand the most dominant storm directions that have been observed each year in the last 40 years were analyzed this condition is only applicable to the three most occurring directions nne wnw and w 40 years of wave storm data is considered to be insufficient for a reliable analysis of extreme storm return values originating from n ne e and nw directions due to the limited number of storm events off the algiers coast 8 1 extreme wave analysis results for significant wave heights the results of the extreme wave analysis presented in this section are obtained using the most widely used models in eva pot gpd and am gev these results have been developed based on 40 years of high temporal resolution wave hindcasts and provide an important aid in coastal risk assessment and an essential basis to ensure the sustainability of coastal and port developments the results presented in fig 16 illustrate the significant wave heights estimated with different returns periods off the algiers coast 1512 m in depth exactly in station s1 fig 2 these results show a remarkable difference between the estimates of the am gev model and those of the pot gpd model for return values below 8 25 m it can be seen that the pot gpd model fitted very smoothly with the hindcast data unlike the pot gpd model which overestimates return values below 8 25 m nevertheless it correctly estimated the 40 year return value which exceeds 9 m and which was only observed one time statistically it is found that the pot gpd model has a good performance compared to the am gev model operationally it is found that the result of am gev can be recommended with regard to the estimations beyond a return period of 20 years in order to insure a minimum risk furthermore the maximum difference between the two models is 0 5 m for a return period of 100 years the results of this analysis carried out off the algerian coast station s1 show that this area can be exposed to extreme significant wave heights exceeding 8 m with a return period of 20 years and may reach a height of approximately 10 m with a return period of 100 years fig 16 these wave heights have the potential to induce significant coastal damage such as that already recorded during extreme and catastrophic storms knowing that the maximum significant wave heights corresponding to extreme and catastrophic storms are respectively 5 66 m and 7 36 m on average table 5 and the return values corresponding to these two heights are estimated with return periods of 7 and 8 years successively 8 2 extreme wave analysis results for the storm events the results obtained from the extreme value analysis concerning the storm power index allowed us to define the probable return periods of the different storm classes by taking into consideration the storm direction the storm direction is an important factor that influences on the wave propagation along the algiers coast and constitutes a crucial information to ensure the most economical and sustainable development of coastal and harbor structures by knowing the direction of the return storms the engineers will be able to design an optimal orientation and conception of the different coastal dikes thus these results are used to estimate the return periods of extreme and catastrophic storms that have already caused significant damage over the past 40 years fig 17 shows the extreme return values of spi estimated as a function of three different directions with return periods up to 100 years as mentioned above this estimation was developed using the am gev model by comparing the estimation results with the used annual maxima shown in the same plot the same observation is noted as the one noted using the am gev model for the analysis of the extreme significant wave heights this observation consists in an overestimation of the extreme values corresponding to return periods less than 20 years and a good estimate of the return periods of 40 years this situation may be explained by the significant difference between the two strongest storms estimated for each direction for a distribution based on 40 values this fact may have a remarkable effect unlike distributions based on a considerable number of values exceeding a given threshold the extreme spi analysis result shows that the most frequent storms of class i and class ii are estimated with a return period of less than one year concerning the return periods for extensive storms from the wnw nne and w sectors it is estimated return periods of 1 5 1 8 and 2 1 years respectively for extreme and catastrophic storms it was noted that the return period of the wnw storms is significantly earlier than the return period of the w and nne sectors it is recommended for sustainable and economic management to focus more on wnw waves in the design of coastal structures the return periods of the wnw nne and w storms are 4 2 6 4 and 7 4 years respectively for extreme storms class iv and 12 2 18 and 18 6 years respectively for catastrophic storms class v the eva results allowed us to estimate the return periods table 6 of some storms that have caused severe damage over the past 40 years on the algiers coast a return period of 59 years is estimated for the most severe catastrophic storm with an spi of 3001 m2 h that was observed in 2015 9 conclusion this work involves a detailed analysis of behavior of the wave storm events along the algiers coast from a spatial and temporal aspect as part of this process a characterization and classification of wave storms over the last 40 years has been established based on the storm power index spi of dolan and davis 1992 off the algiers coast station 1 this method allowed us to classify 729 storm events into five classes in terms of their spi including 13 extreme events and three catastrophic events and 31 storm events in terms of both spi and direction to carry out a spatial analysis of extreme and catastrophic storms along the algiers coasts a local grid swan model nested in the coarse grid swan model that has been implemented for the entire mediterranean basin amarouche et al 2019 was used the nested swan model is calibrated against the wave measurement performed by the tamentfoust buoy in the center of our study area for the significant wave height it is recorded a bias of 0 14 m a scatter index of 29 and a rmse of 0 36 m for the mean wave period it is recorded an average bias of 0 005 s a mean scatter index of 15 and a mean rmse of 0 71 s these results highlight the high accuracy of the local swan model results this local swan model was used to simulate storm waves that have caused significant damage in recent decades resulting in human infra structure and economic losses the spatial simulation of wave climates during these storms allowed us to quantify their intensity in the damaged coastal areas according to the simulation results and in view of the damage caused by the simulated storm events it is concluded that the storm influence in a coastal area depends on several factors including mainly the storm power index the ratio between the persistence of the storm and the average significant wave height the storm direction and also the storm succession a consideration of these different factors will allow us to identify the most vulnerable area against the different storm events in the future and to estimate the probable hazards and damages according to the temporal variation analysis of storm events over different time scales it is observed that the month of february has the highest occurrence probability of extreme storm event class iv with 5 events during 40 years the three catastrophic class v storm events were recorded separately during january march and november and that on a monthly and seasonal scale the increase in wave storm events do not reflect an increase in the extreme or catastrophic storm hazard on the annual scale it is observed a trend towards an increase in the number of storm events and in the intensity of the severe storms in recent years thus the storms that have caused damage over the last two decades are considered very rare in terms of their direction and most of them have been observed only once in the last 40 years by assessing the damage caused by extreme and catastrophic storms over the last two decades it is found that depending on the power persistence and direction these storm events are able to induce massive erosion coastal flooding shipwreck and also may increase the flooding risk if it will be followed by an extreme rainfall as observed during the inundations of bab el oued in november 2001 in order to ensure prevention against the risk caused by the various wave storm events an extreme values analysis for significant wave heights and storm power index considering their direction was developed this analysis allowed us to estimate the return value of significant wave height using two different methods am gev and pot gpd and to estimate the return period corresponding to five storm classes originating from the most dominant directions w wnw n using am gev method the return periods of 4 2 and 12 2 years are estimated successively for extreme and catastrophic storms based on the spi returned values fig 17 thus the return period of wnw storms is considerably earlier than the return period of nw and w storms knowing that 37 of storm events observed over the last 40 years are originated from the wnw sector fig 7 including the most powerful storm of 2015 it is recommended to focus on the wnw storm events in the future coastal protection projects and in the design of coastal and port structures to ensure sustainable and economic
