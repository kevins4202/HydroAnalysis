21940,the design and operational planning of an offshore installation must consider environmental challenges along with additional difficulties that arise due to remoteness among the major operational issues logistics support during routine operations and emergencies is critical the logistics support from an onshore base to a remote and harsh environment offshore production facility is not sufficiently reliable and quick in this study the concept of an intermediate offshore resource centre orc as a potential solution to the logistics problem is presented the purpose functional requirements and the conceptual design of an orc with an illustrative example are discussed a modular volume limited ship design concept is adopted here to determine the principal particulars of the orc in the concept design phase the required functional elements of the orc are identified and then the physical space required for each element is represented graphically as a scaled block with the required volume the principal dimensions are determined after arranging these functional blocks within a ship shaped envelope finally the concept design of the vessel system is tested and validated with an analysis of the vessel stability and mooring requirements keywords offshore resource centre remote operation emergency management offshore logistic harsh environment offshore risk analysis 1 introduction extraction of hydrocarbon in northern offshore regions poses significant challenges due to extreme physical environmental conditions hamilton 2011 khan et al 2014 meling 2013 necci et al 2019 in addition to the environmental challenge regular logistics support and emergency response become more and more difficult for remote platforms long distance operation of helicopters is particularly risky nascimento et al 2015 oil and gas 2013a also the use of a helicopter is limited when weather is not favorable the idea of an intermediate offshore resource centre orc originated when considering these issues in previous studies rahman et al 2020 2019 the logistical challenges of remote offshore operations are identified these papers present a probabilistic risk analysis using the fault tree rahman et al 2019 and the bayesian network rahman et al 2020 that essentially estimated the risk of logistics support operation failure in a remote harsh environment in the main these risks are shown to be most significantly associated with the distance from shore based support particularly the extended flying distance for helicopter based supply and crew transfer additional risk of logistics failure is associated with the difficulty in providing timely emergency response and in mobilizing shore based equipment and assets in response to a remote offshore incident one practical solution to mitigate both these risks is to provide an intermediate platform or vessel that allows aircraft an intermediate landing refueling location and at the same time provides a forward staging point for emergency response equipment in the current study the space requirement and thus the overall dimensions of the orc are estimated to meet the functional requirements for logistics supply to single remote platform however the concept and the approach remain the same for supporting multiple oil field operations the space requirement to support multiple platforms can be determined using the same approach to that presented in this study thus the concept remains the same but the size may increase such a platform probably becomes more and more economically efficient as it services a greater number of offshore installations an orc reduces the risk for daily operations in addition to providing a forward base for emergency response thus the orc has two primary mission requirements for cases where an offshore development is exceptionally remote from land based support provide an intermediate point for helicopter operations that enables refueling alternate landing and shorter transit distance provide a forward staging or response asset for emergency response in case of fire spill sinking or ice damage this study is part of a larger research project aimed at identifying risks and risk reduction measures including the economic costs and benefits of the risk reduction measures with a particular emphasis on remote offshore operations in harsh environments the objective of this component of the larger study is to develop one particular risk reduction measure which addresses the most significant risks identified in earlier parts of the study the concept of an intermediate offshore base for various logistics support is not entirely new the us military studied the idea of a mobile offshore base mob for helicopter and fixed wing cargo aircraft operation maintenance and other military logistical supports the mission requirements for fixed wing aircraft needed a very large floating structure of approximately 1500 m in length the technical and financial feasibility were both significant concerns associated with such an enormous floating structure mcallister 1997 naval facilities engineering service center 2000 remmers et al 1998 nordbø 2013 presented mathematical models to study the feasibility of intermediate bulk storage to support multiple remote hydrocarbon production facilities the concept of such a logistics hub for personnel accommodation is found in moyano 2016 vilameá et al 2011 accommodation vessels and semi submersibles also referred to as floatels are often used near or together with the production facilities for accommodating offshore workers floatel international group 2019 prosafe 2019 pérez et al 2012 none of the above concepts provide a suitable starting point for the proposed orc and thus a concept is developed from basic requirements the conceptual model of an offshore resource centre starts with defining functional requirements and environmental constraints followed by selection of the type of structure that can be suitable for these requirements space requirements are estimated for each of the functional requirements to determine the overall space requirement for the orc fig 1 illustrates the basic functional concept of an intermediate distance offshore resource centre orc for logistics support of one or more offshore platforms in particular offshore personnel are carried on off the orc from the onshore base and the production platform by helicopters preferable and weather permitted or marine vessels the orc thus needs to be equipped with facilities to accommodate in transit personnel during their transit hours a more detailed study would be required to model scheduling of such transfer operations that is not included here this paper aims to outline the requirements of the orc platform and provide a conceptual design outline for a moored vessel that meets the identified requirements 2 orc performance requirements performance requirements for the orc stem from the previous risk analysis rahman et al 2020 2019 and from the operating environment the risk reduction objectives for the platforms are to reduce the effective flying distance to the production platform and to provide more timely emergency response these objectives are largely independent of operating location and are covered in more detail in the following section environmental conditions are location specific and in the present study we have chosen the north west atlantic as an illustrative operational scenario this environment presents a number of challenges this choice is also driven by current consideration of a remote location for offshore oil production 2 1 risk reduction objectives the main operational function of the orc is to serve as a helicopter intermediate landing point this function requires that the orc be positioned at a fixed location to provide an intermediate stopping point for regularly scheduled helicopter operations to and from the remote production facility this would incorporate the ability to land and refuel two helicopters simultaneously and potentially provide service to one the concept of an orc as a mid way stopping point for one or more remote platforms means that it is entirely likely that one helicopter would be inbound while another is outbound furthermore in the case of emergency it would be advantageous to be able to operate two transports and have some redundancy in the system as part of the role of intermediate landing point the orc would also provide temporary accommodation with required amenities for in transit offshore personnel this will be used as a station for the personnel of the production platform on their way to from the production installation the final regular function of the orc would be to provide local and regional communications with the production facilities nearby vessels and other installations in the vicinity rescue craft and coast stations the second primary function of the orc is as an emergency response centre in this mode the orc would respond to emergency incidents such as fire explosions leak spills human or weather induced damages equipment failure etc response equipment particularly for spill containment would be stored on board the orc to speed reaction to offshore incidents by supply and standby vessels the orc would also provide in case of platform abandonment the capacity to accommodate evacuated personnel in emergency conditions this would include the ability to deal with casualties a possible scenario is considered to be that the orc moves temporarily closer to the location of a disaster while standby and other vessels deal with the actual events using equipment and supplies drawn from that stored on the orc this may be augmented by transferring an emergency logistics support team to respond to an incident from the shore base to the orc however this mode of response may not be optimum if it limits flight operations by increasing the flying distance to the orc rather than preclude this response possibility at this concept stage the system is conceived to provide the ability to move off station for emergency response in either mode of response on or off station the orc is configured to acts as a local command centre for emergency response hence the performance requirements of the orc can be summarized as maintain position at a fixed location with an ability to move provide a base for helicopter landing refueling and service provide short term in transit accommodation for regular passengers have the ability to move off station in the event of emergency provide short term accommodation for emergency responders provide forward storage and distribution of emergency response equipment and supplies accommodate personnel from the production platform in case of evacuation provide medical facilities for emergency treatment provide local and regional communications with the production facilities nearby vessels and other installations in the vicinity rescue craft and coast stations act as an incident command centre for emergency response 2 2 environmental conditions the flemish pass basin is chosen for a case study to illustrate the concept design development of the orc although some aspects of an orc are site independent other aspects would be dependent on location thus the basic functions are dictated by the distance of the supported platform from shore but environmental conditions are site specific and thus it is necessary to have an example location to fully develop the concept other locations would maintain the basic concept and concept development process but exhibit different characteristics based on the requirements of the specific location the flemish pass basin is located approximately 480 km east of st john s newfoundland and labrador equinor canada ltd equinor is proposing to conduct an exploration drilling project in the flemish pass basin between 2019 and 2027 canada impact assessment act 2019 in this study the proposed orc would be located at an intermediate location between the shore st john s base and the drilling sites although the flemish pass is a deep water location at the edge of the continental shelf the orc is likely to be located on the grand banks which is part of the continental shelf as that is the intermediate location see fig 2 this example location is immediately relevant as the region is in the early stages of consideration for development and the distance from land is likely to be the most challenging aspect of the development this provides a real life example that fits the orc concept in addition this region lacks the density of existing offshore installations that can provide mutual support such as would be available in other regions such as the north sea information about physical environmental conditions off newfoundland near the grand banks and flemish pass regions is extracted from iso 19906 2010 nalcor energy 2017 these regions are considered to be harsh environments conditions due to the likelihood of intense storms and the presence of seasonal ice pack ice and icebergs ice accretion on marine structures can also occur between december and march because of temperature wind and wave conditions during the spring and summer months poor visibility often occurs due to fog restricted visibility may also occur during winter months caused by snow in addition to fog and mist representative physical environmental conditions are presented in table 1 the harshness index suggests that the flemish pass region has more extreme environmental conditions than the grand banks which has higher wind speed wave height water depth although data shows that there are fewer icebergs in the flemish pass area than grand banks the physical environment of both these areas is considered for the orc design since it would be operated in both these regions 3 concept development 3 1 platform type based on the requirements outlined above several platform options were evaluated including a fixed platform a semi submersible platform and a ship shaped platform since one of the functions of the orc is that it should be able to respond during emergency conditions it must be a floating structure with a propulsion system this eliminates the idea of a fixed platform although a semi submersible has lower motions than a ship shaped vessel a ship shaped vessel is preferable to a semi submersible in ice conditions although motion stability needs to be considered for determining the principal dimensions of a vessel to ensure crew comfort and safer helicopter operation in expected sea conditions furthermore it is expected that a ship would achieve faster response for emergency support 3 2 positioning the orc is expected to be moored at an intermediate location on the grand banks and thus in relatively shallow approximately 75 m 125 m water the vessel may also operate in deep water 550 1200 m and will be subject to high wind and waves also there is a likelihood of the presence of pack ice and icebergs over the operating region either dynamic positioning dp or anchor mooring can be used for station keeping in this water depth range the life cycle cost of a full time dp system is relatively expensive there are regulatory requirements for system redundancy and equipment space that introduce significant initial cost in comparison the initial cost of an anchor mooring system is lower but costs associated with the on site installation offset some of the lower equipment cost the more significant drawback is that during operation a full time dp system requires continuous fuel supply to keep the system active which adds to the operating costs in terms of both fuel costs and delivery the requirement to minimize vessel motions and mooring loads leads to a preference for a weathervaning system rather than a spread mooring this led to consideration of a scaled down turret mooring which would provide the weathervaning capability but did not require the fluid transfer capability fitted in most offshore turret moorings in a turret mooring system several mooring legs are attached to a turret that includes bearings to allow the vessel to rotate 360 around the anchor legs turret moorings are mostly used for weathervaning monohulled vessels this enables the vessel to change heading into the dominant weather thus minimizing environmental loads and vessel motions a turret may be mounted outside the bow or inside the forward half of the vessel hull in an internal turret configuration the internal configuration is preferable for more severe environments particularly those with ice as the mooring components are protected from ice impact a disconnectable version of a turret mooring provides for the stated requirements to move off station in emergencies disconnectable versions of the internal turret consist of a submerged spider buoy coupled to the lower portion of the rotating turret and supporting the individual mooring lines when the buoy is disconnected it sinks to a predetermined depth and supports the mooring lines above the seabed making reconnection relatively straightforward chakrabarti 2005 a typical example of a disconnectable internal turret is the terra nova fpso turret system duggal et al 2000 the terra nova fpso operates in similar environmental conditions the basic ideas of this system can be adopted for the orc concept however the mission and size of the orc is substantially different from the terra nova fpso and thus the details of the orc mooring system would be relatively simpler and smaller in summary considering the required functions of the orc and the example environmental conditions a full time dp system was judged to be too operationally and environmentally expensive as the positioning system and a passive weathervaning anchor mooring was judged to be preferable the possible use of a dp system for mooring assist or for position maintenance when off the mooring is incorporated into the concept but in this case the system is supplementary to the main passive mooring system 3 3 vessel development having established the basic requirements for a ship shaped platform on a passive weathervaning and disconnectable mooring the layout of the vessel itself was developed the orc has elements of widely varying ship types and there is no single historical basis ship type to start the concept design process the mission requirements of orc partially match those of offshore support standby vessels accommodation vessels flotels and military fleet support ships the orc needs much larger capacity than an offshore supply vessel accommodation vessels or flotels are specifically designed for passenger accommodation and not designed for emergency support the orc has a requirement to accommodate in transit platform crew or possibly evacuees generally for short periods but possibly for longer periods of up to a day or two floatels provide longer term accommodation and food service for a similar client group and thus some of the features of floatels were considered in developing the orc fleet replenishment vessels are larger ships used by the military to provide logistics support to combat vessels these vessels are frequently based on ro ro vessels due to a requirement to deliver land forces which is not a mission requirement of the orc since there is exactly no basis ship for orc but there are elements of orc in a number of existing ship types the concept design is developed using a process where the desired particulars and design features of all these types of ships are used 3 3 1 helicopter operation the orc includes two helicopter platforms to meet the functional requirements helicopters are used for two purposes depending on weather conditions and the mode of orc operation transporting crews to from the onshore base and production platform and emergency support such as search and rescue operations since regular helicopter operation would be conducted in two directions there would be a significant number of inbound and outbound flights to the orc in addition in the situation when one helideck is occupied by a helicopter then another landing area would be required if another helicopter needs to land based on this demand the orc would have two full sized helidecks in addition there is an expectation that helicopters may need to be serviced or wait out inclement weather so a hangar is fitted to one of the helicopter decks for storage of one or more of the helicopters the proposed relatively high frequency of helicopter operations requires consideration of a control tower for regional air traffic management and for landing and takeoff control this space would ideally have visual contact with both of the helicopter decks and so would be located centrally in the vessel either above or just below the bridge deck this has been incorporated into the concept current operations on the east coast of canada are generally conducted using sikorsky s92 helicopters 2019 a relatively large aircraft with characteristics provided in table 2 data from sikorsky s 92 specifications are collected from sikorsky s 92 helicopter 2019 dimensioning of the helidecks and hangars is based on this aircraft consideration of helideck arrangements are presented in the following ship motion and air turbulence should be minimum for the safe landing of a helicopter a vessel has relatively lesser motions at the amidships however this competes with other systems installed topside for example deckhouse intakes and uptakes lamb 2004 hence forward and aft locations are more readily available and provide better approaches for landing and taking off an aft location is typical for naval ships but helidecks are usually fitted at the fore part or above the wheelhouse in offshore supply vessels a helideck can be placed at the aft and another at the forepart of the orc an advantage of arranging separate helidecks at the fore and aft is a safer design that isolates hazards or accidents on one deck from the other offshore vessels with helicopter refueling systems have special design and construction requirements since the orc would be equipped with a helicopter refueling system the concept is compliant with existing regulations indicated by the regulatory bodies such as civil aviation authority classification societies etc hence the space for fuel storage and refueling equipment area fire safety system and electrical system is notionally included in the concept but would be detailed during a later design phase 3 3 2 emergency equipment as one of the important functional requirements the orc would be equipped with emergency response er equipment and supplies and an arrangement for deploying them when required for the present concept the orc would operate as a kind of mothership that would coordinate operations with other vessels during emergencies under this scenario the orc could move to the accident site for er and work with other available assets or remain on station in either case the orc would serve as the command and control centre for the coordinated response significant space under the main deck is included to store the equipment and space and crane capacity is provided on the main deck for deployment in addition the orc would have a designated space on the deck to safely recover persons from the water and or other craft a list of stored emergency equipment is provided below cnlopb 2018 oil and gas 2013b oil recovery equipment space is allocated in the orc to store recovered oil with a capacity of 10 000 bbl storage survivor rescue equipment the orc would be equipped with fast rescue craft frc and launching arrangements survivor retrieval devices climbing aids rescue hooks and lifebuoys to meet the requirements of the lsa code section 2 1 firefighting equipment the design criteria and functional requirements would be adopted from firefighting ships and the guidelines are available in class rules e g abs ffv 1 ffv 2 or ffv 3 3 3 3 command centre a specific operational space located above the bridge deck is provided with communications capability and physical layout for the vessel to be a command and control vessel or a primary response vessel 3 4 layout dimensions and functional relationships the required elements of the ship platform are identified considering the main features above and the more routine aspects of a vessel the physical size of each element is estimated based on similar functional spaces in other vessels offshore platforms or from land based installations these space area volume requirements are represented graphically as a scaled block with the required size data for individual functional blocks are drawn from existing examples with the desired functionality and individually scaled to fit the expected requirement of the orc for example the disconnectable mooring turret dimensions are based on turret systems fitted to grand banks fpsos but scaled down by estimated ship size and reduced by the exclusion of fluid piping and swivels a graphical example of estimating the dimension of a hospital block is presented in fig 3 the main functional blocks considered in the concept development are illustrated in fig 4 the individual blocks are then logically arranged in terms of functional requirements relationships and a ship envelope created around the scaled blocks fig 5 in this way the initial size of the overall orc vessel is estimated and where necessary the size of functional blocks such as engine propulsion fuel turret adjusted up or down based on the overall size of the orc vessel this in turn lead to refinement of the overall ship envelope but the process converges much the same way a conventional ship design spiral converges this is a variation of the design spiral process adapted to allow functional elements to be drawn from different ship types and incorporated into a design with a novel combination of features a list of all the functional blocks are provided in table 3 the development of the space requirements for the hospital mooring system and helicopter operation are described in some detail in the following sections these three functions were chosen as examples due to their relative importance in the orc concept they also illustrate the methods used to adapt functions from other vessels to the orc concept 3 4 1 hospital as a functional requirement the orc would have provision for medical support from a medical practitioner at any time the medical facilities consist of the followings norwegian maritime medical centre 2006 a medical unit with pharmacy and medical equipment a treatment room for ill or injured persons one to three medical practitioners who in cooperation with doctors onshore will be responsible for medical first aid and medical treatment a designated decontamination space for cleaning survivors upon retrieval and prevent contamination of the orc s medical or living spaces an enclosed area for survivor reception triage with access to the accommodations that are designated for registration distribution of sundries etc a designated space for storing non survivors which should be cool ventilated and illuminated the following elements are considered when locating the ship hospital the ability to carry an injured person on a stretcher from the most likely places of injury to the hospital the chance of getting an injured person from the production facility is higher than inbound traffic from shore the distance from the helipad to the hospital facility should be a minimum there should be easy access for patient ingress egress from the helideck and rescue zone to the hospital preferably avoiding stairs ladders also the location of and angles between corridors and doors are considered stable enough to carry out any medical procedure if required sufficient hvac including space for the equipment is provided to regulate internal temperatures of the hospital space the area of each function of the hospital is estimated based on a hospital ship lsd 48 uss ashland whidbey island class ship carey et al 2002 and provided in table 4 however the numbers required are scaled down as the orc is not specifically a hospital ship and the capacity requirements are much lower 3 4 2 mooring system the use of a disconnectable turret mooring in the orc is a novel approach as the reduced size and lack of fluid transfer functions make it somewhat different from existing examples the space requirement is estimated based on the terra nova fpso mooring system the terra nova fpso has a disconnectable turret mooring system and this is operated in a similar environmental condition the turret position influences the mooring line tensions weathervaning capability and the arrangement of other design blocks it is easier to weathervane when the turret is moved further forward from the midship although the vertical motions will increase and that will increase mooring line tensions the turret location is chosen between the forward helideck and the accommodation blocks in the midship estimate space for turret at the early stage of the orc design not much information is available and initially assumptions are made the functional space requirement can be updated as the concept develops at the beginning of the concept development the mooring system space is estimated by comparing the size displacement of the terra nova fpso and a royal canadian navy joint support ship having a few similar functionalities to the orc table 5 provides the turret specification is estimated after a few iterations for the projected orc displacement further details of the terra nova fpso turret system are available in duggal et al 2000 buoy similar to the terra nova fpso a spider buoy will be connected at the lower portion of the orc turret spaces must be provided for arranging the buoy retrieval system and load transfer mechanism at the lower turret the displacement ratio of the fpso and the orc is similarly used to estimate the buoy specifications 3 4 3 helicopter operation helidecks there are two helidecks fore and aft on the orc the helidecks require large deck areas and unobstructed approach paths the spaces are determined based on the type size of the helicopter that would be landing according to abs 2015 a helicopter deck containing a circle must have a minimum diameter equal to the overall length d or d value of the largest helicopter using the helicopter deck the approach departure sector must be at least 210 free of obstruction the required minimum deck lengths for the helidecks are given in table 6 hangar the orc requires a helicopter hangar to support embarked helicopters the size of the hangar is dictated by the dimensions of the helicopter and clearances for access there are three basic types of hangars fixed or telescoping at the landing deck level and below decks lamb 2004 a fixed hangar is placed adjacent to the aft helideck at the same deck level the required dimension is determined based on the specification of example helicopter sikorsky s92a the estimated hangar size is given in table 7 3 5 arrangement of functional blocks and overall sizing after determining all the functional block dimensions using the methodology above the blocks are arranged in a ship shaped envelope when arranging these blocks the following relationships are considered accommodation and hospital spaces are located above the main deck in a deckhouse to minimize noise and ensure habitability and safety according to the international labor organization ilo regulations on crew accommodation and international convention for safety of life solas helipad and hangar are adjacent and located at the same level hospital is located close to the helideck for easy access tanks and other heavier items are placed on lower decks within the hull the orc length is dictated by required functional deck lengths where the helidecks hangar accommodation block mooring emergency response equipment need to be placed bridge command centre and control tower are located such that visual obstructions are minimized helidecks are placed such that enough clearance is provided to mitigate effects from shipped green water or wave spray emergency equipment storage is located below the emergency equipment deployment area to ensure that these are easily accessible the breadth of the orc is dictated by the helideck specification and vessel stability requirements based on these considerations several iterations were performed moving from the functional block diagram of fig 5 to the concept general arrangement for the proposed orc presented in fig 6 and fig 7 the estimated dimensions resulting from this assembly are overall length 159 63 m breadth 22 50 m design draft 5 80 m 4 validation of concept two preliminary analyses were conducted to validate the orc concept these were the vessel stability and an analysis of the mooring loads stability analysis was performed to ensure that the dimensions of the vessel as derived from the assembly of functional blocks would provide a vessel concept with reasonable form and stability characteristics this is a practical check on the dimensions of the overall vessel the mooring analysis was performed to provide a check on the initial mooring dimensions derived from the functional block estimate for the mooring system the platform development is an iterative process and these analyses provide the next iteration on the initial scoping provided by the functional block process with the completion of these two analyses the concept is validated as a credible platform concept that answers the requirements developed from the originally referenced risk analysis further refinement would be possible in later stages without changing the basic ideas embodied in the concept 4 1 vessel stability the intact stability criteria are typically evaluated early in a ship development process as principal dimensions are strongly influenced by stability criteria the orc platform should be compliant with general intact stability criteria for ships imo 2008 the area under the righting lever curve gz curve shall not be less than 0 055 m radians up to θ 30 angle of heel and not less than 0 09 m radians up to θ 40 or the angle of flooding θf if this angle is less than 40 additionally the area under the righting lever curve between the angles of heel of 30 and 40 or between 30 and θf if this angle is less than 40 shall not be less than 0 03 m radians the righting lever gz shall be at least 0 20 m at an angle of heel equal to or greater than 30 the maximum righting lever should occur at an angle of heel preferably exceeding 30 but not less than 25 the initial metacentric height gm0 shall not be less than 0 15 m several additional criteria should be satisfied vessel specific rules i e offshore service vessel imo 2008 standby vessel dnv 2015 severe wind and rolling criterion weather criterion considering the operating environment of the orc imo 2008 icing considerations imo 2008 although many of the normal inputs such as the loading conditions weights and positions of all items bulkhead arrangements etc are not firm at this stage estimates for cg and weight distribution are based on similar sized and function vessels using the particulars developed in the concept design a 3d hull model is generated the initial hydrostatic particulars are presented in fig 8 based on this analysis the stability of the vessel is shown to be within the regulatory requirements with the overall dimensions established for the concept orc 4 2 mooring analysis a numerical analysis of the orc mooring system is conducted using orcaflex the numerical model of the chain mooring layout consists of three groups of two mooring lines hence a total of 6 catenary mooring lines attached to the turret buoy the estimated particulars of the vessel and turret buoy in earlier sections are used to provide the vessel model each group of catenary lines or anchor legs is 120 apart and each leg consists of studless grade r4 chain 70 mm diameter terminating in an anchor pile a simplified schematic diagram of the orc mooring arrangement is provided in fig 9 the model is simulated for a water depth of 150 m a total of four simulations were conducted for a combination of extreme and operational environmental conditions at 0 and 180 heading of environmental loads these two headings provided cases where the combined wind wave current load acted either on a single mooring line group or was applied between two groups of mooring lines the vessel was oriented bow to weather for all the simulation cases the model input parameters are provided in table 8 the turret and buoy are connected to the orc through a constraint object that allows the vessel to rotate about the z axis only this enables the vessel to weathervane without rotating the mooring lines with it the effects of wave load 1st order wave drift load 2nd order wave drift damping added mass and damping current load and wind load are considered in the simulation three dof static analysis is also included that solves the vessel position to equilibrium before dynamic simulation starts suitable added mass and damping coefficients are chosen based on previous similar sized vessels for each case simulation is run for 1800 s and the time series data of leg 3 tensions for the most extreme condition case 4 extreme weather and 0 heading is provided in fig 10 the graph shows several peak tensions at the mooring line crossing 150 ton force tef and the maximum value reaches 320 11 tef in 1290 s due to a large wave where a major portion of environmental load is transmitted to leg 3 this represents the worst possible scenario as it is seen from fig 11 that maximum tensions are significantly lower than this value for other cases also the maximum tension never exceeds the chain proof load there is no doubt that the mooring concept can be further refined and considerations such as dp assist for extreme load cases might also be considered in future iterations as a means of reducing the chain size or length however this analysis establishes a reasonable first indication of an appropriate mooring concept for the orc platform 5 discussion in this study a vessel of approximately 160 m length is developed and demonstrated to be a viable conceptual solution to reduce the risk associated with isolated or low density offshore operations located at extreme distances from shore bases the main characteristics of the orc are summarized in table 9 the proposed concept provides an intermediate landing refueling location for long range helicopter operations and a safe haven in case of changing weather mechanical or personnel emergency in the absence of any other landing or staging point between a shore base and a remote offshore platform a floating vessel type platform specifically developed for the intended purpose may provide the enabling technology for distant offshore developments in the particular case studied here a ship shaped platform is selected due to favorable operating characteristics in ice prone environments since there is no previous basis ship or platform which has the complete similarity of all the functional requirements of the concept orc the functional requirements of the orc are identified and the space requirements for each functional block are estimated the blocks are logically arranged to determine the required overall size of the orc vessel this method has proven to be a quick and accurate means of concept development for a novel installation and leads to consideration of the required functionality before consideration of vessel size or type this method for combining capabilities from different marine platforms is shown to be a convenient and workable tool it offers flexibility in concept development which can be modified based on the relative importance of various attributes of the orc and the environmental conditions the method also allows alternative approaches to be considered for platform development for example it may be possible to convert an existing vessel to an orc as an alternative to a new construction the process of establishing blocks of functional space requirements would allow alternatives such as conversion to be evaluated in comparison to the purpose built concept presented here the two key functionalities considered in this study and concept development are helicopter operations and the disconnectable mooring system a disconnectable turret mooring system is proposed for station keeping that consists of 3 2 catenary chain mooring lines and a small spider buoy connected to an internal rotating turret there is some remaining engineering uncertainty around smaller scale turret mooring system as there are no similar scale vessel systems in existence but no obvious technical obstacles are found in this analysis the concept of using a disconnectable turret mooring system for station keeping is a mature technology with similar mooring systems used for the terra nova and searose fpsos operating in similar environmental conditions the weathervaning capability improves the orc operability in the expected sea states and the disconnectable buoy enables the vessel to relocate when required proportionally less space is needed on the orc vessel for the turret installation due to the lack of fluid transfer preliminary design analysis shows that the ship size and dimensions are reasonable and that the conceptually developed mooring size is practical a static and dynamic analysis of the concept mooring system is conducted using the numerical analysis software orcaflex result show that mooring line tensions are within the chain limits although it is recognized that there is likely still considerable room for further refinement seasonal ice management may also be used to reduce mooring loads and provide access of supply vessels for cargo handling operations or emergency response helicopter operations are incorporated as two full sized landing areas at bow and stern of the vessel with a hangar located at the stern helicopter deck this provides various options for landing multi helicopter operations and provision for servicing if required the vessel size of the orc provides a more stable landing platform than a smaller supply vessel and the availability of two landing options should provide operational weather limits comparable to the much larger fpso vessels low height helideck arrangements are expected to give better operating capabilities compared to supply vessels or fpsos where helidecks are often placed above the height of the wheelhouse the aft helideck is likely to provide more favorable landing conditions than the forward helideck due to the weathervaning of the vessel providing a generally into the wind approach the presence of a hangar can facilitate the storage of helicopter s during storm conditions emergency response functionality is also incorporated into the orc concept as this is also identified as a high risk issue for remote platform operations the concept is developed as a forward base for response equipment and as a command and control centre for emergency response both these functions serve to improve response time which is essentially a risk mitigation strategy more so than the prevention strategy embodied in the idea of an intermediate helicopter base thus the platform provides two risk reduction approaches for two of the major risks identified in the previous analysis of long range offshore production operations the installation of an orc with these capabilities in the presented example location provides a single leg journey distance that is well within the current operating experience and operational limits for existing floating production platforms in the same region the orc incorporates accommodations for in transit personnel and reserves the required resources to support emergencies this addresses the major challenges for distant offshore operation in harsh environmental conditions and provides a platform to meet the previously identified risk reduction objectives this orc concept and indeed the overall idea of reducing the logistical support or emergency incident risk factors by the installation of an auxiliary platform located at an intermediate location represents a conceptually simple idea to enable more remote offshore operations the orc concept is shown to fit within a reasonable sized ship envelope bigger than a supply vessel but much smaller than a production platform i e fpso capital and operational costs for such a platform would be significant but the development of a viable platform concept provides the first step in a full evaluation of the costs and benefits of such a risk reduction strategy further design iteration would firm up the concept and allow more detailed analysis of the orc as a risk reduction strategy including life cycle costs as a technologically straightforward solution for supporting remote offshore operations in the north atlantic the orc concept should be further analyzed and considered 6 conclusion as follow on from a previous risk analysis of permanent offshore production operations in remote and environmentally challenging locations this study presents the conceptual development of a moored vessel that can be used as an intermediate offshore base for regular logistic support operations and emergency response in a remote harsh environment the proposed orc concept study outlines the following unique ideas the concept of this floating vessel may reduce many operational challenges and risks further offshore particularly in ice covered regions since there is no existing vessel platform that can meet the required missions a modular block ship design concept is applied where the space requirements of each functional block are estimated from similar ship data in the process of concept development relevant regulations and guidelines for the vessel design are explored that may guide in the future for the physical development of this concept the concept design of the orc suggests some unique design features such as a disconnectable turret mooring system and helideck configurations the basis of these design features is also described this concept development can be furthered by collecting more practical data and input from the industry but the concept is shown to be technically viable a cost benefit analysis should be conducted to study the economic implications of this proposed risk reduction strategy this could lead to a framework to optimize the platform concept in both economic and technology terms the concept here presents a start point for further analysis of what is thought to be one of the very few viable alternatives for the considered operational scenario credit authorship contribution statement md samsur rahman conceptualization methodology formal analysis

21940,the design and operational planning of an offshore installation must consider environmental challenges along with additional difficulties that arise due to remoteness among the major operational issues logistics support during routine operations and emergencies is critical the logistics support from an onshore base to a remote and harsh environment offshore production facility is not sufficiently reliable and quick in this study the concept of an intermediate offshore resource centre orc as a potential solution to the logistics problem is presented the purpose functional requirements and the conceptual design of an orc with an illustrative example are discussed a modular volume limited ship design concept is adopted here to determine the principal particulars of the orc in the concept design phase the required functional elements of the orc are identified and then the physical space required for each element is represented graphically as a scaled block with the required volume the principal dimensions are determined after arranging these functional blocks within a ship shaped envelope finally the concept design of the vessel system is tested and validated with an analysis of the vessel stability and mooring requirements keywords offshore resource centre remote operation emergency management offshore logistic harsh environment offshore risk analysis 1 introduction extraction of hydrocarbon in northern offshore regions poses significant challenges due to extreme physical environmental conditions hamilton 2011 khan et al 2014 meling 2013 necci et al 2019 in addition to the environmental challenge regular logistics support and emergency response become more and more difficult for remote platforms long distance operation of helicopters is particularly risky nascimento et al 2015 oil and gas 2013a also the use of a helicopter is limited when weather is not favorable the idea of an intermediate offshore resource centre orc originated when considering these issues in previous studies rahman et al 2020 2019 the logistical challenges of remote offshore operations are identified these papers present a probabilistic risk analysis using the fault tree rahman et al 2019 and the bayesian network rahman et al 2020 that essentially estimated the risk of logistics support operation failure in a remote harsh environment in the main these risks are shown to be most significantly associated with the distance from shore based support particularly the extended flying distance for helicopter based supply and crew transfer additional risk of logistics failure is associated with the difficulty in providing timely emergency response and in mobilizing shore based equipment and assets in response to a remote offshore incident one practical solution to mitigate both these risks is to provide an intermediate platform or vessel that allows aircraft an intermediate landing refueling location and at the same time provides a forward staging point for emergency response equipment in the current study the space requirement and thus the overall dimensions of the orc are estimated to meet the functional requirements for logistics supply to single remote platform however the concept and the approach remain the same for supporting multiple oil field operations the space requirement to support multiple platforms can be determined using the same approach to that presented in this study thus the concept remains the same but the size may increase such a platform probably becomes more and more economically efficient as it services a greater number of offshore installations an orc reduces the risk for daily operations in addition to providing a forward base for emergency response thus the orc has two primary mission requirements for cases where an offshore development is exceptionally remote from land based support provide an intermediate point for helicopter operations that enables refueling alternate landing and shorter transit distance provide a forward staging or response asset for emergency response in case of fire spill sinking or ice damage this study is part of a larger research project aimed at identifying risks and risk reduction measures including the economic costs and benefits of the risk reduction measures with a particular emphasis on remote offshore operations in harsh environments the objective of this component of the larger study is to develop one particular risk reduction measure which addresses the most significant risks identified in earlier parts of the study the concept of an intermediate offshore base for various logistics support is not entirely new the us military studied the idea of a mobile offshore base mob for helicopter and fixed wing cargo aircraft operation maintenance and other military logistical supports the mission requirements for fixed wing aircraft needed a very large floating structure of approximately 1500 m in length the technical and financial feasibility were both significant concerns associated with such an enormous floating structure mcallister 1997 naval facilities engineering service center 2000 remmers et al 1998 nordbø 2013 presented mathematical models to study the feasibility of intermediate bulk storage to support multiple remote hydrocarbon production facilities the concept of such a logistics hub for personnel accommodation is found in moyano 2016 vilameá et al 2011 accommodation vessels and semi submersibles also referred to as floatels are often used near or together with the production facilities for accommodating offshore workers floatel international group 2019 prosafe 2019 pérez et al 2012 none of the above concepts provide a suitable starting point for the proposed orc and thus a concept is developed from basic requirements the conceptual model of an offshore resource centre starts with defining functional requirements and environmental constraints followed by selection of the type of structure that can be suitable for these requirements space requirements are estimated for each of the functional requirements to determine the overall space requirement for the orc fig 1 illustrates the basic functional concept of an intermediate distance offshore resource centre orc for logistics support of one or more offshore platforms in particular offshore personnel are carried on off the orc from the onshore base and the production platform by helicopters preferable and weather permitted or marine vessels the orc thus needs to be equipped with facilities to accommodate in transit personnel during their transit hours a more detailed study would be required to model scheduling of such transfer operations that is not included here this paper aims to outline the requirements of the orc platform and provide a conceptual design outline for a moored vessel that meets the identified requirements 2 orc performance requirements performance requirements for the orc stem from the previous risk analysis rahman et al 2020 2019 and from the operating environment the risk reduction objectives for the platforms are to reduce the effective flying distance to the production platform and to provide more timely emergency response these objectives are largely independent of operating location and are covered in more detail in the following section environmental conditions are location specific and in the present study we have chosen the north west atlantic as an illustrative operational scenario this environment presents a number of challenges this choice is also driven by current consideration of a remote location for offshore oil production 2 1 risk reduction objectives the main operational function of the orc is to serve as a helicopter intermediate landing point this function requires that the orc be positioned at a fixed location to provide an intermediate stopping point for regularly scheduled helicopter operations to and from the remote production facility this would incorporate the ability to land and refuel two helicopters simultaneously and potentially provide service to one the concept of an orc as a mid way stopping point for one or more remote platforms means that it is entirely likely that one helicopter would be inbound while another is outbound furthermore in the case of emergency it would be advantageous to be able to operate two transports and have some redundancy in the system as part of the role of intermediate landing point the orc would also provide temporary accommodation with required amenities for in transit offshore personnel this will be used as a station for the personnel of the production platform on their way to from the production installation the final regular function of the orc would be to provide local and regional communications with the production facilities nearby vessels and other installations in the vicinity rescue craft and coast stations the second primary function of the orc is as an emergency response centre in this mode the orc would respond to emergency incidents such as fire explosions leak spills human or weather induced damages equipment failure etc response equipment particularly for spill containment would be stored on board the orc to speed reaction to offshore incidents by supply and standby vessels the orc would also provide in case of platform abandonment the capacity to accommodate evacuated personnel in emergency conditions this would include the ability to deal with casualties a possible scenario is considered to be that the orc moves temporarily closer to the location of a disaster while standby and other vessels deal with the actual events using equipment and supplies drawn from that stored on the orc this may be augmented by transferring an emergency logistics support team to respond to an incident from the shore base to the orc however this mode of response may not be optimum if it limits flight operations by increasing the flying distance to the orc rather than preclude this response possibility at this concept stage the system is conceived to provide the ability to move off station for emergency response in either mode of response on or off station the orc is configured to acts as a local command centre for emergency response hence the performance requirements of the orc can be summarized as maintain position at a fixed location with an ability to move provide a base for helicopter landing refueling and service provide short term in transit accommodation for regular passengers have the ability to move off station in the event of emergency provide short term accommodation for emergency responders provide forward storage and distribution of emergency response equipment and supplies accommodate personnel from the production platform in case of evacuation provide medical facilities for emergency treatment provide local and regional communications with the production facilities nearby vessels and other installations in the vicinity rescue craft and coast stations act as an incident command centre for emergency response 2 2 environmental conditions the flemish pass basin is chosen for a case study to illustrate the concept design development of the orc although some aspects of an orc are site independent other aspects would be dependent on location thus the basic functions are dictated by the distance of the supported platform from shore but environmental conditions are site specific and thus it is necessary to have an example location to fully develop the concept other locations would maintain the basic concept and concept development process but exhibit different characteristics based on the requirements of the specific location the flemish pass basin is located approximately 480 km east of st john s newfoundland and labrador equinor canada ltd equinor is proposing to conduct an exploration drilling project in the flemish pass basin between 2019 and 2027 canada impact assessment act 2019 in this study the proposed orc would be located at an intermediate location between the shore st john s base and the drilling sites although the flemish pass is a deep water location at the edge of the continental shelf the orc is likely to be located on the grand banks which is part of the continental shelf as that is the intermediate location see fig 2 this example location is immediately relevant as the region is in the early stages of consideration for development and the distance from land is likely to be the most challenging aspect of the development this provides a real life example that fits the orc concept in addition this region lacks the density of existing offshore installations that can provide mutual support such as would be available in other regions such as the north sea information about physical environmental conditions off newfoundland near the grand banks and flemish pass regions is extracted from iso 19906 2010 nalcor energy 2017 these regions are considered to be harsh environments conditions due to the likelihood of intense storms and the presence of seasonal ice pack ice and icebergs ice accretion on marine structures can also occur between december and march because of temperature wind and wave conditions during the spring and summer months poor visibility often occurs due to fog restricted visibility may also occur during winter months caused by snow in addition to fog and mist representative physical environmental conditions are presented in table 1 the harshness index suggests that the flemish pass region has more extreme environmental conditions than the grand banks which has higher wind speed wave height water depth although data shows that there are fewer icebergs in the flemish pass area than grand banks the physical environment of both these areas is considered for the orc design since it would be operated in both these regions 3 concept development 3 1 platform type based on the requirements outlined above several platform options were evaluated including a fixed platform a semi submersible platform and a ship shaped platform since one of the functions of the orc is that it should be able to respond during emergency conditions it must be a floating structure with a propulsion system this eliminates the idea of a fixed platform although a semi submersible has lower motions than a ship shaped vessel a ship shaped vessel is preferable to a semi submersible in ice conditions although motion stability needs to be considered for determining the principal dimensions of a vessel to ensure crew comfort and safer helicopter operation in expected sea conditions furthermore it is expected that a ship would achieve faster response for emergency support 3 2 positioning the orc is expected to be moored at an intermediate location on the grand banks and thus in relatively shallow approximately 75 m 125 m water the vessel may also operate in deep water 550 1200 m and will be subject to high wind and waves also there is a likelihood of the presence of pack ice and icebergs over the operating region either dynamic positioning dp or anchor mooring can be used for station keeping in this water depth range the life cycle cost of a full time dp system is relatively expensive there are regulatory requirements for system redundancy and equipment space that introduce significant initial cost in comparison the initial cost of an anchor mooring system is lower but costs associated with the on site installation offset some of the lower equipment cost the more significant drawback is that during operation a full time dp system requires continuous fuel supply to keep the system active which adds to the operating costs in terms of both fuel costs and delivery the requirement to minimize vessel motions and mooring loads leads to a preference for a weathervaning system rather than a spread mooring this led to consideration of a scaled down turret mooring which would provide the weathervaning capability but did not require the fluid transfer capability fitted in most offshore turret moorings in a turret mooring system several mooring legs are attached to a turret that includes bearings to allow the vessel to rotate 360 around the anchor legs turret moorings are mostly used for weathervaning monohulled vessels this enables the vessel to change heading into the dominant weather thus minimizing environmental loads and vessel motions a turret may be mounted outside the bow or inside the forward half of the vessel hull in an internal turret configuration the internal configuration is preferable for more severe environments particularly those with ice as the mooring components are protected from ice impact a disconnectable version of a turret mooring provides for the stated requirements to move off station in emergencies disconnectable versions of the internal turret consist of a submerged spider buoy coupled to the lower portion of the rotating turret and supporting the individual mooring lines when the buoy is disconnected it sinks to a predetermined depth and supports the mooring lines above the seabed making reconnection relatively straightforward chakrabarti 2005 a typical example of a disconnectable internal turret is the terra nova fpso turret system duggal et al 2000 the terra nova fpso operates in similar environmental conditions the basic ideas of this system can be adopted for the orc concept however the mission and size of the orc is substantially different from the terra nova fpso and thus the details of the orc mooring system would be relatively simpler and smaller in summary considering the required functions of the orc and the example environmental conditions a full time dp system was judged to be too operationally and environmentally expensive as the positioning system and a passive weathervaning anchor mooring was judged to be preferable the possible use of a dp system for mooring assist or for position maintenance when off the mooring is incorporated into the concept but in this case the system is supplementary to the main passive mooring system 3 3 vessel development having established the basic requirements for a ship shaped platform on a passive weathervaning and disconnectable mooring the layout of the vessel itself was developed the orc has elements of widely varying ship types and there is no single historical basis ship type to start the concept design process the mission requirements of orc partially match those of offshore support standby vessels accommodation vessels flotels and military fleet support ships the orc needs much larger capacity than an offshore supply vessel accommodation vessels or flotels are specifically designed for passenger accommodation and not designed for emergency support the orc has a requirement to accommodate in transit platform crew or possibly evacuees generally for short periods but possibly for longer periods of up to a day or two floatels provide longer term accommodation and food service for a similar client group and thus some of the features of floatels were considered in developing the orc fleet replenishment vessels are larger ships used by the military to provide logistics support to combat vessels these vessels are frequently based on ro ro vessels due to a requirement to deliver land forces which is not a mission requirement of the orc since there is exactly no basis ship for orc but there are elements of orc in a number of existing ship types the concept design is developed using a process where the desired particulars and design features of all these types of ships are used 3 3 1 helicopter operation the orc includes two helicopter platforms to meet the functional requirements helicopters are used for two purposes depending on weather conditions and the mode of orc operation transporting crews to from the onshore base and production platform and emergency support such as search and rescue operations since regular helicopter operation would be conducted in two directions there would be a significant number of inbound and outbound flights to the orc in addition in the situation when one helideck is occupied by a helicopter then another landing area would be required if another helicopter needs to land based on this demand the orc would have two full sized helidecks in addition there is an expectation that helicopters may need to be serviced or wait out inclement weather so a hangar is fitted to one of the helicopter decks for storage of one or more of the helicopters the proposed relatively high frequency of helicopter operations requires consideration of a control tower for regional air traffic management and for landing and takeoff control this space would ideally have visual contact with both of the helicopter decks and so would be located centrally in the vessel either above or just below the bridge deck this has been incorporated into the concept current operations on the east coast of canada are generally conducted using sikorsky s92 helicopters 2019 a relatively large aircraft with characteristics provided in table 2 data from sikorsky s 92 specifications are collected from sikorsky s 92 helicopter 2019 dimensioning of the helidecks and hangars is based on this aircraft consideration of helideck arrangements are presented in the following ship motion and air turbulence should be minimum for the safe landing of a helicopter a vessel has relatively lesser motions at the amidships however this competes with other systems installed topside for example deckhouse intakes and uptakes lamb 2004 hence forward and aft locations are more readily available and provide better approaches for landing and taking off an aft location is typical for naval ships but helidecks are usually fitted at the fore part or above the wheelhouse in offshore supply vessels a helideck can be placed at the aft and another at the forepart of the orc an advantage of arranging separate helidecks at the fore and aft is a safer design that isolates hazards or accidents on one deck from the other offshore vessels with helicopter refueling systems have special design and construction requirements since the orc would be equipped with a helicopter refueling system the concept is compliant with existing regulations indicated by the regulatory bodies such as civil aviation authority classification societies etc hence the space for fuel storage and refueling equipment area fire safety system and electrical system is notionally included in the concept but would be detailed during a later design phase 3 3 2 emergency equipment as one of the important functional requirements the orc would be equipped with emergency response er equipment and supplies and an arrangement for deploying them when required for the present concept the orc would operate as a kind of mothership that would coordinate operations with other vessels during emergencies under this scenario the orc could move to the accident site for er and work with other available assets or remain on station in either case the orc would serve as the command and control centre for the coordinated response significant space under the main deck is included to store the equipment and space and crane capacity is provided on the main deck for deployment in addition the orc would have a designated space on the deck to safely recover persons from the water and or other craft a list of stored emergency equipment is provided below cnlopb 2018 oil and gas 2013b oil recovery equipment space is allocated in the orc to store recovered oil with a capacity of 10 000 bbl storage survivor rescue equipment the orc would be equipped with fast rescue craft frc and launching arrangements survivor retrieval devices climbing aids rescue hooks and lifebuoys to meet the requirements of the lsa code section 2 1 firefighting equipment the design criteria and functional requirements would be adopted from firefighting ships and the guidelines are available in class rules e g abs ffv 1 ffv 2 or ffv 3 3 3 3 command centre a specific operational space located above the bridge deck is provided with communications capability and physical layout for the vessel to be a command and control vessel or a primary response vessel 3 4 layout dimensions and functional relationships the required elements of the ship platform are identified considering the main features above and the more routine aspects of a vessel the physical size of each element is estimated based on similar functional spaces in other vessels offshore platforms or from land based installations these space area volume requirements are represented graphically as a scaled block with the required size data for individual functional blocks are drawn from existing examples with the desired functionality and individually scaled to fit the expected requirement of the orc for example the disconnectable mooring turret dimensions are based on turret systems fitted to grand banks fpsos but scaled down by estimated ship size and reduced by the exclusion of fluid piping and swivels a graphical example of estimating the dimension of a hospital block is presented in fig 3 the main functional blocks considered in the concept development are illustrated in fig 4 the individual blocks are then logically arranged in terms of functional requirements relationships and a ship envelope created around the scaled blocks fig 5 in this way the initial size of the overall orc vessel is estimated and where necessary the size of functional blocks such as engine propulsion fuel turret adjusted up or down based on the overall size of the orc vessel this in turn lead to refinement of the overall ship envelope but the process converges much the same way a conventional ship design spiral converges this is a variation of the design spiral process adapted to allow functional elements to be drawn from different ship types and incorporated into a design with a novel combination of features a list of all the functional blocks are provided in table 3 the development of the space requirements for the hospital mooring system and helicopter operation are described in some detail in the following sections these three functions were chosen as examples due to their relative importance in the orc concept they also illustrate the methods used to adapt functions from other vessels to the orc concept 3 4 1 hospital as a functional requirement the orc would have provision for medical support from a medical practitioner at any time the medical facilities consist of the followings norwegian maritime medical centre 2006 a medical unit with pharmacy and medical equipment a treatment room for ill or injured persons one to three medical practitioners who in cooperation with doctors onshore will be responsible for medical first aid and medical treatment a designated decontamination space for cleaning survivors upon retrieval and prevent contamination of the orc s medical or living spaces an enclosed area for survivor reception triage with access to the accommodations that are designated for registration distribution of sundries etc a designated space for storing non survivors which should be cool ventilated and illuminated the following elements are considered when locating the ship hospital the ability to carry an injured person on a stretcher from the most likely places of injury to the hospital the chance of getting an injured person from the production facility is higher than inbound traffic from shore the distance from the helipad to the hospital facility should be a minimum there should be easy access for patient ingress egress from the helideck and rescue zone to the hospital preferably avoiding stairs ladders also the location of and angles between corridors and doors are considered stable enough to carry out any medical procedure if required sufficient hvac including space for the equipment is provided to regulate internal temperatures of the hospital space the area of each function of the hospital is estimated based on a hospital ship lsd 48 uss ashland whidbey island class ship carey et al 2002 and provided in table 4 however the numbers required are scaled down as the orc is not specifically a hospital ship and the capacity requirements are much lower 3 4 2 mooring system the use of a disconnectable turret mooring in the orc is a novel approach as the reduced size and lack of fluid transfer functions make it somewhat different from existing examples the space requirement is estimated based on the terra nova fpso mooring system the terra nova fpso has a disconnectable turret mooring system and this is operated in a similar environmental condition the turret position influences the mooring line tensions weathervaning capability and the arrangement of other design blocks it is easier to weathervane when the turret is moved further forward from the midship although the vertical motions will increase and that will increase mooring line tensions the turret location is chosen between the forward helideck and the accommodation blocks in the midship estimate space for turret at the early stage of the orc design not much information is available and initially assumptions are made the functional space requirement can be updated as the concept develops at the beginning of the concept development the mooring system space is estimated by comparing the size displacement of the terra nova fpso and a royal canadian navy joint support ship having a few similar functionalities to the orc table 5 provides the turret specification is estimated after a few iterations for the projected orc displacement further details of the terra nova fpso turret system are available in duggal et al 2000 buoy similar to the terra nova fpso a spider buoy will be connected at the lower portion of the orc turret spaces must be provided for arranging the buoy retrieval system and load transfer mechanism at the lower turret the displacement ratio of the fpso and the orc is similarly used to estimate the buoy specifications 3 4 3 helicopter operation helidecks there are two helidecks fore and aft on the orc the helidecks require large deck areas and unobstructed approach paths the spaces are determined based on the type size of the helicopter that would be landing according to abs 2015 a helicopter deck containing a circle must have a minimum diameter equal to the overall length d or d value of the largest helicopter using the helicopter deck the approach departure sector must be at least 210 free of obstruction the required minimum deck lengths for the helidecks are given in table 6 hangar the orc requires a helicopter hangar to support embarked helicopters the size of the hangar is dictated by the dimensions of the helicopter and clearances for access there are three basic types of hangars fixed or telescoping at the landing deck level and below decks lamb 2004 a fixed hangar is placed adjacent to the aft helideck at the same deck level the required dimension is determined based on the specification of example helicopter sikorsky s92a the estimated hangar size is given in table 7 3 5 arrangement of functional blocks and overall sizing after determining all the functional block dimensions using the methodology above the blocks are arranged in a ship shaped envelope when arranging these blocks the following relationships are considered accommodation and hospital spaces are located above the main deck in a deckhouse to minimize noise and ensure habitability and safety according to the international labor organization ilo regulations on crew accommodation and international convention for safety of life solas helipad and hangar are adjacent and located at the same level hospital is located close to the helideck for easy access tanks and other heavier items are placed on lower decks within the hull the orc length is dictated by required functional deck lengths where the helidecks hangar accommodation block mooring emergency response equipment need to be placed bridge command centre and control tower are located such that visual obstructions are minimized helidecks are placed such that enough clearance is provided to mitigate effects from shipped green water or wave spray emergency equipment storage is located below the emergency equipment deployment area to ensure that these are easily accessible the breadth of the orc is dictated by the helideck specification and vessel stability requirements based on these considerations several iterations were performed moving from the functional block diagram of fig 5 to the concept general arrangement for the proposed orc presented in fig 6 and fig 7 the estimated dimensions resulting from this assembly are overall length 159 63 m breadth 22 50 m design draft 5 80 m 4 validation of concept two preliminary analyses were conducted to validate the orc concept these were the vessel stability and an analysis of the mooring loads stability analysis was performed to ensure that the dimensions of the vessel as derived from the assembly of functional blocks would provide a vessel concept with reasonable form and stability characteristics this is a practical check on the dimensions of the overall vessel the mooring analysis was performed to provide a check on the initial mooring dimensions derived from the functional block estimate for the mooring system the platform development is an iterative process and these analyses provide the next iteration on the initial scoping provided by the functional block process with the completion of these two analyses the concept is validated as a credible platform concept that answers the requirements developed from the originally referenced risk analysis further refinement would be possible in later stages without changing the basic ideas embodied in the concept 4 1 vessel stability the intact stability criteria are typically evaluated early in a ship development process as principal dimensions are strongly influenced by stability criteria the orc platform should be compliant with general intact stability criteria for ships imo 2008 the area under the righting lever curve gz curve shall not be less than 0 055 m radians up to θ 30 angle of heel and not less than 0 09 m radians up to θ 40 or the angle of flooding θf if this angle is less than 40 additionally the area under the righting lever curve between the angles of heel of 30 and 40 or between 30 and θf if this angle is less than 40 shall not be less than 0 03 m radians the righting lever gz shall be at least 0 20 m at an angle of heel equal to or greater than 30 the maximum righting lever should occur at an angle of heel preferably exceeding 30 but not less than 25 the initial metacentric height gm0 shall not be less than 0 15 m several additional criteria should be satisfied vessel specific rules i e offshore service vessel imo 2008 standby vessel dnv 2015 severe wind and rolling criterion weather criterion considering the operating environment of the orc imo 2008 icing considerations imo 2008 although many of the normal inputs such as the loading conditions weights and positions of all items bulkhead arrangements etc are not firm at this stage estimates for cg and weight distribution are based on similar sized and function vessels using the particulars developed in the concept design a 3d hull model is generated the initial hydrostatic particulars are presented in fig 8 based on this analysis the stability of the vessel is shown to be within the regulatory requirements with the overall dimensions established for the concept orc 4 2 mooring analysis a numerical analysis of the orc mooring system is conducted using orcaflex the numerical model of the chain mooring layout consists of three groups of two mooring lines hence a total of 6 catenary mooring lines attached to the turret buoy the estimated particulars of the vessel and turret buoy in earlier sections are used to provide the vessel model each group of catenary lines or anchor legs is 120 apart and each leg consists of studless grade r4 chain 70 mm diameter terminating in an anchor pile a simplified schematic diagram of the orc mooring arrangement is provided in fig 9 the model is simulated for a water depth of 150 m a total of four simulations were conducted for a combination of extreme and operational environmental conditions at 0 and 180 heading of environmental loads these two headings provided cases where the combined wind wave current load acted either on a single mooring line group or was applied between two groups of mooring lines the vessel was oriented bow to weather for all the simulation cases the model input parameters are provided in table 8 the turret and buoy are connected to the orc through a constraint object that allows the vessel to rotate about the z axis only this enables the vessel to weathervane without rotating the mooring lines with it the effects of wave load 1st order wave drift load 2nd order wave drift damping added mass and damping current load and wind load are considered in the simulation three dof static analysis is also included that solves the vessel position to equilibrium before dynamic simulation starts suitable added mass and damping coefficients are chosen based on previous similar sized vessels for each case simulation is run for 1800 s and the time series data of leg 3 tensions for the most extreme condition case 4 extreme weather and 0 heading is provided in fig 10 the graph shows several peak tensions at the mooring line crossing 150 ton force tef and the maximum value reaches 320 11 tef in 1290 s due to a large wave where a major portion of environmental load is transmitted to leg 3 this represents the worst possible scenario as it is seen from fig 11 that maximum tensions are significantly lower than this value for other cases also the maximum tension never exceeds the chain proof load there is no doubt that the mooring concept can be further refined and considerations such as dp assist for extreme load cases might also be considered in future iterations as a means of reducing the chain size or length however this analysis establishes a reasonable first indication of an appropriate mooring concept for the orc platform 5 discussion in this study a vessel of approximately 160 m length is developed and demonstrated to be a viable conceptual solution to reduce the risk associated with isolated or low density offshore operations located at extreme distances from shore bases the main characteristics of the orc are summarized in table 9 the proposed concept provides an intermediate landing refueling location for long range helicopter operations and a safe haven in case of changing weather mechanical or personnel emergency in the absence of any other landing or staging point between a shore base and a remote offshore platform a floating vessel type platform specifically developed for the intended purpose may provide the enabling technology for distant offshore developments in the particular case studied here a ship shaped platform is selected due to favorable operating characteristics in ice prone environments since there is no previous basis ship or platform which has the complete similarity of all the functional requirements of the concept orc the functional requirements of the orc are identified and the space requirements for each functional block are estimated the blocks are logically arranged to determine the required overall size of the orc vessel this method has proven to be a quick and accurate means of concept development for a novel installation and leads to consideration of the required functionality before consideration of vessel size or type this method for combining capabilities from different marine platforms is shown to be a convenient and workable tool it offers flexibility in concept development which can be modified based on the relative importance of various attributes of the orc and the environmental conditions the method also allows alternative approaches to be considered for platform development for example it may be possible to convert an existing vessel to an orc as an alternative to a new construction the process of establishing blocks of functional space requirements would allow alternatives such as conversion to be evaluated in comparison to the purpose built concept presented here the two key functionalities considered in this study and concept development are helicopter operations and the disconnectable mooring system a disconnectable turret mooring system is proposed for station keeping that consists of 3 2 catenary chain mooring lines and a small spider buoy connected to an internal rotating turret there is some remaining engineering uncertainty around smaller scale turret mooring system as there are no similar scale vessel systems in existence but no obvious technical obstacles are found in this analysis the concept of using a disconnectable turret mooring system for station keeping is a mature technology with similar mooring systems used for the terra nova and searose fpsos operating in similar environmental conditions the weathervaning capability improves the orc operability in the expected sea states and the disconnectable buoy enables the vessel to relocate when required proportionally less space is needed on the orc vessel for the turret installation due to the lack of fluid transfer preliminary design analysis shows that the ship size and dimensions are reasonable and that the conceptually developed mooring size is practical a static and dynamic analysis of the concept mooring system is conducted using the numerical analysis software orcaflex result show that mooring line tensions are within the chain limits although it is recognized that there is likely still considerable room for further refinement seasonal ice management may also be used to reduce mooring loads and provide access of supply vessels for cargo handling operations or emergency response helicopter operations are incorporated as two full sized landing areas at bow and stern of the vessel with a hangar located at the stern helicopter deck this provides various options for landing multi helicopter operations and provision for servicing if required the vessel size of the orc provides a more stable landing platform than a smaller supply vessel and the availability of two landing options should provide operational weather limits comparable to the much larger fpso vessels low height helideck arrangements are expected to give better operating capabilities compared to supply vessels or fpsos where helidecks are often placed above the height of the wheelhouse the aft helideck is likely to provide more favorable landing conditions than the forward helideck due to the weathervaning of the vessel providing a generally into the wind approach the presence of a hangar can facilitate the storage of helicopter s during storm conditions emergency response functionality is also incorporated into the orc concept as this is also identified as a high risk issue for remote platform operations the concept is developed as a forward base for response equipment and as a command and control centre for emergency response both these functions serve to improve response time which is essentially a risk mitigation strategy more so than the prevention strategy embodied in the idea of an intermediate helicopter base thus the platform provides two risk reduction approaches for two of the major risks identified in the previous analysis of long range offshore production operations the installation of an orc with these capabilities in the presented example location provides a single leg journey distance that is well within the current operating experience and operational limits for existing floating production platforms in the same region the orc incorporates accommodations for in transit personnel and reserves the required resources to support emergencies this addresses the major challenges for distant offshore operation in harsh environmental conditions and provides a platform to meet the previously identified risk reduction objectives this orc concept and indeed the overall idea of reducing the logistical support or emergency incident risk factors by the installation of an auxiliary platform located at an intermediate location represents a conceptually simple idea to enable more remote offshore operations the orc concept is shown to fit within a reasonable sized ship envelope bigger than a supply vessel but much smaller than a production platform i e fpso capital and operational costs for such a platform would be significant but the development of a viable platform concept provides the first step in a full evaluation of the costs and benefits of such a risk reduction strategy further design iteration would firm up the concept and allow more detailed analysis of the orc as a risk reduction strategy including life cycle costs as a technologically straightforward solution for supporting remote offshore operations in the north atlantic the orc concept should be further analyzed and considered 6 conclusion as follow on from a previous risk analysis of permanent offshore production operations in remote and environmentally challenging locations this study presents the conceptual development of a moored vessel that can be used as an intermediate offshore base for regular logistic support operations and emergency response in a remote harsh environment the proposed orc concept study outlines the following unique ideas the concept of this floating vessel may reduce many operational challenges and risks further offshore particularly in ice covered regions since there is no existing vessel platform that can meet the required missions a modular block ship design concept is applied where the space requirements of each functional block are estimated from similar ship data in the process of concept development relevant regulations and guidelines for the vessel design are explored that may guide in the future for the physical development of this concept the concept design of the orc suggests some unique design features such as a disconnectable turret mooring system and helideck configurations the basis of these design features is also described this concept development can be furthered by collecting more practical data and input from the industry but the concept is shown to be technically viable a cost benefit analysis should be conducted to study the economic implications of this proposed risk reduction strategy this could lead to a framework to optimize the platform concept in both economic and technology terms the concept here presents a start point for further analysis of what is thought to be one of the very few viable alternatives for the considered operational scenario credit authorship contribution statement md samsur rahman conceptualization methodology formal analysis

21941,in this paper we present a parametric model of the hydrodynamic interaction forces for two underwater vehicles operating in close proximity we first review the models for interacting forces in the horizontal plane of surface vessels and empirical approximations that can be potentially applied to underwater vehicles then based on both potential theory and experimentally derived models available in the literature we propose a partially fixed model structure of the hydrodynamic interaction forces this partially fixed model structure is used for the identification of a full parametric model for the hydrodynamic interaction forces the data set considered to validate the model represents a fully submerged hull shape an enlarged explorer auv hull shape that moves holding its course at a forward speed and another hull shape a suboff hull of reduced size that overtakes explorer in a parallel course we exploit the novel model structure together with the experimentally validated data to obtain a parametric model of the interaction forces on the overtaking vessel at different transverse separation distances we estimate the parameters using one dataset and then validate the model for other sets the results obtained are considered accurate for the intended purpose of the model which is the future design of a motion control system for the suboff manoeuvring in close proximity to the explorer keywords hydrodynamic interaction effects overtaking manoeuvring vehicle to vehicle interactions 1 introduction marine operations of underwater vehicles could require manoeuvring in close

2016 to increase the performance and safety of unmanned underwater vehicle uuv operations close to other underwater vehicles it is beneficial to enhance uuv motion controls with further information about the interacting forces a traditional approach to compensate for disturbances and mitigate their undesirable effects on motion consists of using observers estimators and robust controllers many control techniques such as internal model control imc and model predictive control mpc require a model of the disturbance to be able to predict it and make decisions on the controlled motion the work in this paper focuses on the development of a parametric model for the hydrodynamic interacting forces of a uuv manoeuvring in close proximity to another underwear vehicle which could potentially be used in observer and controller designs the literature on the topic of modelling of interacting effects is traditionally split into seakeeping and manoeuvring in calm water and most of the work relates to surface vessels either conducting underway replenishment or manoeuvring in shallow channels there is therefore no parametric model immediately available in the literature for the study of manoeuvring of underwater vehicles in close proximity moreover none of the models found in the literature consider accelerated motion the common scenario studied in the work of varyani et al 2004 and vantorre et al 2002 considers the ship to ship interaction effects in an overtaking manoeuvring another study is considered by varyani and vantorre 2006 where the interacting forces between a moored container ship and a passing tanker ship is formulated skejic 2008 considers non parametric models for ship to ship standard manoeuvres whereby boundary value problems related to potential theory are solved at each step of time domain simulations to compute non parametric hydrodynamic force models the latter is validated against experiments in recent years different scenarios have been considered

motion cannot be neglected yuan et al 2016 consider the case of interaction forces between a berthed ship and a ship passing in its close proximity wang and zou 2014 presents theoretical and numeral studies of the impact of the interaction forces of two ships manoeuvring in waves an extensive analysis of experimental data has been conducted by mousaviraad et al 2016a where the authors considers the interaction forces of ships manoeuvring in both calm waters and waves the analysis is complemented by a numerical simulations in mousaviraad et al 2016b in this paper we consider the scenario of a small uuv overtaking a larger underwater vehicle and we propose a novel parametric model for the hydrodynamic interacting effects in surge sway and yaw we follow the approach in skejic 2008 based on potential theory to formulate a partially fixed structure which corresponds to the structure of an empirical model proposed in varyani et al 2004 based on the experimentally validate cfd data set from leong et al 2015 we propose a novel parametric form for the model and estimate the parameters of a full parametric model the model is then validated using a validation data set different from that used to estimate the parameters we extend our preliminary results in perez et al 2018 by considering all the degrees of freedom in the plane i e surge sway and yaw we also refine the values of the parametric models of the interaction forces the validation of the parametric models show an acceptable accuracy which indicate that the proposed models could be used as part of disturbance observer and model based motion control designs the latter applications are outside the scope of this paper 2 problem characterisation we consider the scenario of an overtaking manoeuvre of a small underwater vehicle a on a large vehicle b as depicted in fig 1 we assume that a is faster than b and we concentrate on the interacting forces experienced by a we consider the dynamics of the vehicles a and b as follows 1 η a j η a ν a 2 m a ν a c a ν a ν a d a ν a τ c a τ a b 3 η b j η b ν b 4 m b ν b c b ν b ν b d b ν b τ c b τ b a where η i is a vector that describes the position and orientation of the vehicle i with i a b ν i is a vector that describes the linear and angular rates of the vehicle i in body coordinates the function m i c i and d i are the mass matrix the coriolis centripetal matrix and the damping matrix respectively for the vehicle i the vector τ c i represents the propulsion and control forces the vector τ a b represents the interacting forces on the vehicle a due to the presence of the vehicle b and vector τ b a represents the interacting forces on the vehicle b due to the presence of vehicle a as discussed in skejic 2008 the interacting forces τ a b and τ b a depend on the size of the vehicles lateral and longitudinal separation of the vehicles speed of the vehicles wetted hull shapes water depth and transverse distance from a channel bank 3 model of hydrodynamic forces 3 1 a potential theory model the theory of tuck and newman 1974 relates to vessels operating in each other s far field that is when their transverse distance ζ is of the order of the vessel s lengths this theory is valid for moderate froude numbers i e f n 0 2 the vessels are assumed to have parallel courses along the x direction seakeeping frame with origin at midship and the relevant kinematics is given by x a x a 0 u a t x b x b 0 u b t x a ξ y b y a ζ z b z a where ξ x a x b is the stagger distance and ζ y b y a is the transverse separation distance which for this study is assumed constant for ξ 0 both vessels are in abeam position with centres aligned and for ζ 0 both centre lines coincide the fluid potential of the vessel a on body fixed coordinates can be represented as φ a u a x a ϕ a x a y a z a ϕ b x b y b z b ϕ a b x a y a z a t where ϕ i are the perturbation potentials of each vessel disregarding the presence of the other and ϕ a b is the interaction velocity potential this potential satisfies the body a exact boundary condition φ a n 0 where n is the unit vector normal to the hull of the body a into the fluid the solution of the boundary value problem bvp above is used in the bernoulli equation to compute the pressure p ρ φ a t ρ 2 φ a 2 1 2 ρ u a 2 the pressure can be written as p p a p b p a b o ϵ 4 then the interacting sway force y a b and yaw

coefficients on ξ and ζ need to be determined from experimental data the validations of the models above reported by skejic 2008 based on panel methods are in good agreement with experimental data for surface vessels however the validations showed a small disagreement which as conjectured by skejic can be potentially attributed to the fact that viscous effects are not captured by the model structure obtained following tuck and newman theory in the next section we discuss an empirical model for the hydrodynamic coefficients that can be tailored to achieve agreement with experimental data such an empirical model may be used to investigate the validity of the model structure discussed above 3 2 empirical parametric models the model of varyani et al 2004 starts by expressing the non

breadth d i is the draught and l i is the length the following model was obtained by varyani et al 2004 using regression on several sets of experimental data for the two vessel overtaking manoeuvre where the vessel a is the fast overtaking vessel and the vessel b is the slow overtaken vessel for the fast vessel c y a b 0 11 1 0 98 ξ e 0 95 ξ 2 sin 0 49 π ξ 0 37 h d a 1 5 1 8 2 ζ l 1 l a l b 1 5

parameter l and it is not clear how to set the parameters α β and δ 4 proposed model structure in this section we propose a structure for the model of the forces and moments experienced by the overtaking vessel a due the presence of the vessel b inspired by the approach proposed by tuck and newman 1974 and reviewed by skejic 2008 we propose a structure of the model for the forces in surge and sway and the moments in yaw similar to the model given by 5 and 6 3 3 the interaction effects in surge has not been studied in skejic 2008 however since the interaction phenomena in surge has the same nature as in the interaction in sway and yaw we propose to use a similar model structure notice also that the structure of the empirical models proposed by varyani et al 2004 is similar to 5 6 we make the following hypotheses which adhere with varyani et al 2004 9 x a b u b 2 ξ ζ γ x x a b u a u b ξ ζ 10 y a b u b 2 ξ ζ γ y y a b u a u b ξ ζ 11 n a b u b 2 ξ ζ γ n n a b u a u b ξ ζ then we propose the structure of the force in sway and the moment in yaw as follows 12 x a b x a b u a u b ξ ζ γ x u b 2 u a u b 13 y a b y a b u a u b ξ ζ γ y u b 2 u a u b 14 n a b n a b u a u b ξ ζ γ n u b 2 u a u b if we normalise 12 14 based on the speed and dimensions of the vessel a we obtain 15 c x a b f x ξ ζ γ x u b 2 u a 2 u b u a 16 c y a b f y ξ ζ γ y u b 2 u a 2 u b u a 17 c n a b f n ξ ζ γ n u b 2 u a 2 u b u a we propose the following factorisation for f i ξ ζ i x y n 18 f i ξ ζ f ξ i ξ f ζ i ζ and the following parametric models 19 f ξ i ξ 1 2 θ 1 i exp 1 2 ξ θ 2 i 2 θ 3 i 2 1 erf θ 4 i ξ θ 2 i θ 3 i 1 2 θ 5 i exp 1 2 ξ θ 6 i 2 θ 7 i 2 1 erf θ 8 i ξ θ 6 i θ 7 i 1 2 θ 9 i exp 1 2 ξ θ 10 i 2 θ 11 i 2 1 erf θ 12 i ξ θ 10 i θ 11 i 1 2 θ 13 i exp 1 2 ξ θ 14 i 2 θ 15 i 2 1 erf θ 16 i ξ θ 14 i θ 15 i where erf is the standard error function erf x 2 π 0 x e t 2 d t and 20 f ζ i ζ θ 17 i exp θ 18 i ζ θ 19 i the function 19 is made of two terms each of which is based on the skew normal function proposed by o hagan and leonard 1976 see also azzalini 2005 this mixture of skew normal functions presents a flexible shape that approximates well the observed data in addition the parameter of the skew normal functions θ i hold a very intuitive relation to the shape of the functions where θ 1 i θ 5 i θ 9 i and θ 13 i are general scaling parameters θ 2 i θ 6 i θ 10 i and θ 14 i determine the location of the peaks θ 3 i θ 7 i θ 11 i and θ 15 i determine the width of the peaks θ 4 i θ 8 i θ 12 i and θ 16 i determine the skew of each peak the function 20 takes into account that the interacting forces reduce as the platforms lateral distance increases 5 parameter estimation and model verification and validation in this section we estimate the model parameters using the experimentally validated cfd data from leong et al 2015 the estimation is done in two parts in the first part we estimate the parameters of the functions 19 using a data set of a single approaching speed and a constant lateral distance this model is then validated for different speeds and a constant lateral distance then the parameters of the functions 20 are estimated using data of a single approaching speed and various lateral distances the data correspond to the overtaking manoeuvre of a suboff on an explorer the displacement of the suboff is 0 807 m 3 its length and diameter are is 4 57 m and 0 53 m respectively and the reynolds number is 7 68 1 0 6 the explorer displacement length and diameter are 2308 9 m 3 56 495 m and 7 8 m respectively and the reynolds number is 9 49 1 0 7 we refer the reader to the work of leong et al 2015 for a detailed explanation of the experimentally validated cfd analysis and data collection used in this paper 5 1 estimation of the longitudinal factor the parameter estimation is done based on the data set for a suboff speed of 3 m s an explorer speed of 1 5 m s and a constant lateral separation distance of 12 m the initial model parameters are adjusted manually based on a visual inspection of the data and these initial parameters are used for a non linear least squares estimation the estimation results are shown in figs 2 4 and the value of the parameters are indicated in table 1 notice that the parameter θ 9 and θ 13 for the interaction force models in sway and surge are zero which implies that the last two terms in 19 are not relevant for these degrees of freedom for all the dof we find that γ x 1 2 γ y 1 2 γ n 1 3 in order to validate the model we compare the estimated model response with the other available cfd data sets for different approach speeds and a single separation distance fig 5 shows the validation results for surge fig 6 shows the validation results for sway while fig 7 shows the validation results for yaw 5 2 estimation of the lateral factor figs 8 10 show respectively the sway force and the yaw moment experienced by the suboff vehicle for different lateral and longitudinal distances as the lateral distance increases the magnitude of the forces reduces this motivates the model structure in 20 in order to estimate the parameters of the lateral factor 20 we consider the normalised data of the principal peaks of the interacting forces as a function of the lateral separation this is displayed in the top panel of figs 8 10 there are two plot regions associated with this data in each top panel one is for the positive peaks and other is for the negative peaks this shows that the reduction of the attraction and the repulsion peak forces are similar we then use the data of the positive force peaks in a non linear least squares optimisation problem to estimate the parameters of 20 the estimates are shown in table 2 and the models response are shown on bottom panels of figs 8 10 6 conclusion in this paper we propose a model structure of the hydrodynamic interaction effects of two underwater vehicles manoeuvring in closed proximity this model structure is based on results from potential theory reported in the literature combined with a proposed flexible parametric model the model proposed captures both the longitudinal interaction effect as a function of the stagger distance and the lateral effect that takes into account the reduction of the interaction forces as the lateral distance between the two vehicles increases the model parameters are estimated using experimentally validated cfd data the estimation procedure uses one data set to obtain the values of the parameters via a non linear least squares optimisation and then the resulting model is validated for the remaining available datasets the results obtained from the parametric model are in agreement with the validated cfd data the model provides a good approximation to accurately represent the interaction effects for the purpose of observer and control design the design of a control system for the suboff manoeuvring in close proximity to the explorer will be a subject of

coefficients on ξ and ζ need to be determined from experimental data the validations of the models above reported by skejic 2008 based on panel methods are in good agreement with experimental data for surface vessels however the validations showed a small disagreement which as conjectured by skejic can be potentially attributed to the fact that viscous effects are not captured by the model structure obtained following tuck and newman theory in the next section we discuss an empirical model for the hydrodynamic coefficients that can be tailored to achieve agreement with experimental data such an empirical model may be used to investigate the validity of the model structure discussed above 3 2 empirical parametric models the model of varyani et al 2004 starts by expressing the non

overtaking vessel a due the presence of the vessel b inspired by the approach proposed by tuck and newman 1974 and reviewed by skejic 2008 we propose a structure of the model for the forces in surge and sway and the moments in yaw similar to the model given by 5 and 6 3 3 the interaction effects in surge has not been studied in skejic 2008 however since the interaction phenomena in surge has the same nature as in the interaction in sway and yaw we propose to use a similar model structure notice also that the structure of the empirical models proposed by varyani et al 2004 is similar to 5 6 we make the following hypotheses which adhere with varyani et al 2004 9 x a b u b 2 ξ ζ γ x x a b u a u b ξ ζ 10 y a b u b 2 ξ ζ γ y y a b u a u b ξ ζ 11 n a b u b 2 ξ ζ γ n n a b u a u b ξ ζ then we

u b 2 u a 2 u b u a we propose the following factorisation for f i ξ ζ i x y n 18 f i ξ ζ f ξ i ξ f ζ i ζ and the following parametric models 19 f ξ i ξ 1 2 θ 1 i exp 1 2 ξ θ 2 i 2 θ 3 i 2 1 erf θ 4 i ξ θ 2 i θ 3 i 1 2 θ 5 i exp 1 2 ξ θ 6 i 2 θ 7 i 2 1 erf θ 8 i ξ θ 6 i θ 7 i 1 2 θ 9 i exp 1 2 ξ θ 10 i 2 θ 11 i 2 1 erf θ 12 i ξ θ 10 i θ 11 i 1 2 θ 13 i exp 1 2 ξ θ 14 i 2 θ 15 i 2 1 erf θ 16 i ξ θ 14 i θ 15 i where erf is the standard error function erf x 2 π 0 x e t 2 d t and 20 f ζ i ζ θ 17 i exp θ 18 i ζ θ 19 i the function 19 is made of two terms each of which is based on the skew normal function proposed by o hagan and leonard 1976 see also azzalini 2005 this mixture of skew normal functions presents a flexible shape that approximates well the observed data in addition the parameter of the skew normal functions θ i hold a very intuitive relation to the shape of the functions where θ 1 i θ 5 i θ 9 i and θ 13 i are general scaling parameters θ 2 i θ 6 i θ 10 i and θ 14 i determine the location of the peaks θ 3 i θ 7 i θ 11 i and θ 15 i determine the width of the peaks θ 4 i θ 8 i θ 12 i and θ 16 i determine the skew of each peak the function 20 takes into account that the interacting forces reduce as the platforms lateral distance increases 5 parameter estimation and model verification and validation in this section we estimate the model parameters using the experimentally validated cfd data from leong et al 2015 the estimation is done in two parts in the first part we estimate the parameters of the functions 19 using a data set of a single approaching speed and a constant lateral distance this model is then validated for different speeds and a constant lateral distance then the parameters of the functions 20 are estimated using data of a single approaching speed and various lateral distances the data correspond to the overtaking manoeuvre of a suboff on an explorer the displacement of the suboff is 0 807 m 3 its length and diameter are is 4 57 m and 0 53 m respectively and the reynolds number is 7 68 1 0 6 the explorer displacement length and diameter are 2308 9 m 3 56 495 m and 7 8 m respectively and the reynolds number is 9 49 1 0 7 we refer the reader to the work of leong et al 2015 for a detailed explanation of the experimentally validated cfd analysis and data collection used in this paper 5 1 estimation of the longitudinal factor the parameter estimation is done based on the data set for a suboff speed of 3 m s an explorer speed of 1 5 m s and a constant lateral separation distance of 12 m the initial model parameters are adjusted manually based on a visual inspection of the data and these initial parameters are used for a non linear least squares estimation the estimation results are shown in figs 2 4 and the value of the parameters are indicated in table 1 notice that the parameter θ 9 and θ 13 for the interaction force models in sway and surge are zero which implies that the last two terms in 19 are not relevant for these degrees of freedom for all the dof we find that γ x 1 2 γ y 1 2 γ n 1 3 in order to validate the model we compare the estimated model response with the other available cfd data sets for different approach speeds and a single separation distance fig 5 shows the validation results for surge fig 6 shows the validation results for sway while fig 7 shows the validation results for yaw 5 2 estimation of the lateral factor figs 8 10 show respectively the sway force and the yaw moment experienced by the suboff vehicle for different lateral and longitudinal distances as the lateral distance increases the magnitude of the forces reduces this motivates the model structure in 20 in order to estimate the parameters of the lateral factor 20 we consider the normalised data of the principal peaks of the interacting forces as a function of the lateral separation this is displayed in the top panel of figs 8 10 there are two plot regions associated with this data in each top panel one is for the positive peaks and other is for the negative peaks this shows that the reduction of the attraction and the repulsion peak forces are similar we then use the data of the positive force peaks in a non linear least squares optimisation problem to estimate the parameters of 20 the estimates are shown in table 2 and the models response are shown on bottom panels of figs 8 10 6 conclusion in this paper we propose a model structure of the hydrodynamic interaction effects of two underwater vehicles manoeuvring in closed proximity this model structure is based on results from potential theory reported in the literature combined with a proposed flexible parametric model the model proposed captures both the longitudinal interaction effect as a function of the stagger distance and the lateral effect that takes into account the reduction of the interaction forces as the lateral distance between the two vehicles increases the model parameters are estimated using experimentally validated cfd data the estimation procedure uses one data set to obtain the values of the parameters via a non linear least squares optimisation and then the resulting model is validated for the remaining available datasets the results obtained from the parametric model are in agreement with the validated cfd data the model provides a good approximation to accurately represent the interaction effects for the purpose of observer and control design the design of a control system for the suboff manoeuvring in close proximity to the explorer will be a subject of

21942,pile foundations in offshore engineering are usually subjected to vertical horizontal load combinations previous researches have discovered that the lateral behaviour of soil pile system could be influenced by axial load due to p δ effect and the change of soil stiffness but the mechanism and influencing factors are still unclear the current p y curve method for laterally loaded piles is independent on vertical loads which is not often applicable for offshore piles in this study numerical analyses with the hypoplastic constitutive model were employed to simulate the vertical horizontal combined loading pile in sand the results of soil pile system under different vertical horizontal load combinations were compared to confirm and further investigate the change of soil stiffness due to vertical loads the mechanism and the influencing factor of the change of soil stiffness were clarified by analysing the change of soil stiffness under pure vertical loading conditions based on the above studies a new p y curve model for vertical horizontal combined loading piles in sand was established the parameter determination method was proposed the effectiveness of the new p y model and the parameters were verified by comparing the back calculated results with those from numerical simulations keywords numerical analysis offshore engineering pile p y curves vertical horizontal load 1 introduction it is well recognized that pile foundations in offshore engineering are subjected to vertical horizontal load combinations especially owing to the rapid development of offshore wind industry the horizontal load from wind plays a significant role to the foundations for instance the monopile foundation of offshore wind turbine is under a considerable vertical gravity combined with lateral thrusts from wind and wave and piles in tripod or jacket foundation for offshore wind turbines bear simultaneous axial compression or tension and horizontal bending lu et al 2017 the lateral responses of soil pile system under vertical horizontal load combinations have been studied by many researchers on one hand it was well recognized that the axial force introduced an additional bending moment after the lateral deformation of the pile which was named p δ effect p δ effect was regarded as the reason for the increase of the lateral deformation and the decrease of the lateral ultimate capacity of the pile under vertical horizontal combined loading reddy and ramasamy 1973 madhav and sarma 1982 meera et al 2007 lee et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 liang et al 2013 on the other hand it was also observed by in situ tests sorochan and bykov 1976 karasev et al 1977 and numerical simulations karthigeyan et al 2006 chatterjee and choudhury 2015 that the vertical compression decreased the deflection and bending moment of the pile in some degree one reasonable explanation was proposed by hussien et al 2014 that the confining pressure in the sand along the upper part of the pile was enhanced due to vertical compression which led to an increase in the lateral pile resistance lu and zhang 2018 conducted a series of centrifuge model tests on monopiles under different vertical horizontal load combinations based on the comparisons of pile deflection and bending moment it was deduced that the p δ effect and the increase of the confining pressure which was defined as soil densification effect were coexisting and interacting under vertical horizontal combined loading besides it was discovered that the lateral pile responses under vertical horizontal combined loading could be influenced by many factors such as the order of loading anagnostopoulos and georgiadis 1993 zheng and wang 2008 the direction of the vertical load which is compression or tension ismael 1989 achmus and thieken 2010 bhardwaj and singh 2016 the rigidity of the pile sastry and meyerhof 1994 and the properties of soil zhukov and balov 1978 karthigeyan et al 2007 however these researches put the focus on behavioral observations further analyses are still required to reveal the mechanism of the influence of vertical loads on the lateral response of pile the most common design approach for lateral loading piles is p y curve method which simplifies the lateral soil pile interaction by a series of nonlinear springs relating the horizontal resistance p to the corresponding displacement y considering the influence of vertical loads on the lateral resistance of neighboring soil from the above researches it is fair to infer that the p y curves may also be affected by vertical loading through centrifuge model tests on jacket pile foundations of offshore wind turbine zhu et al 2014 and numerical simulation on monopile foundation abbas et al 2017 it was discovered that there were significant differences among p y curves under different vertical horizontal load combinations which confirmed the dependency of p y curves on the vertical loads however in the current widely used p y curve models the influence of vertical loads is ignored for example the p y curve model for sand suggested by the american petroleum institute design code api 2000 are described by a hyperbolic tangent function where the parameters are only related to the soil properties thus the api p y curve model is not reliable to calculate the lateral responses of piles under vertical horizontal combined loads on the basis of wedge failure model a modification of the ultimate resistance of sand p u in the api p y model was proposed by mu et al 2017 to consider the additional friction on the soil wedge due to vertical loading but this study only focused on the ultimate state extra efforts are expected to clarify the influence of vertical load on the p y curves under normal working conditions numerical simulation is able to provide full stress and strain fields inside the soil and to simulate various conditions efficiently which has become an essential approach to study the soil pile interactions in this study the finite element method was employed to confirm and further study the influence of the vertical loading on the lateral responses of pile and to establish a new p y curve model considering the influence of vertical load the objectives of this paper include 1 to propose an effective numerical model to simulate vertical horizontal combined loading pile in sand 2 to compare the results of soil pile system under different vertical horizontal load combinations 3 to reveal the mechanism of the change of soil stiffness due to vertical loading 4 to establish an new p y curve model in sand for vertical horizontal combined loading piles 2 numerical method 2 1 hypoplastic model of the sand the sand behaviour was characterized using the hypoplastic constitutive model proposed by von wolffersdorff 1996 the basis of hypoplastic model captures soil behaviours with both reversible and irreversible deformations from the beginning by the linear term l and the nonlinear term n in eq 1 respectively the barotropy factor f b and pycnotropy factors f e and f d are employed to reflect the pressure dependency and density dependency of sand respectively which are all functions of the current void ratio and the stress level 1 σ f b f e l σ ˆ ε f d n σ ˆ ε the hypoplastic model contains eight basic parameters φ c h s n e d0 e c0 e i0 α and β and five extensional parameters m t m r r β r and χ for small strain stiffness and the recent stress history niemunis and herle 1997 the internal shearing angle φ c was calibrated using the angle of repose test parameters h s and n that describe the shape of limiting void ratio curves were determined by oedometric tests on loose sand shown in fig 1 a parameters e c0 e max e d0 e min and e i0 1 15e max were empirically estimated herle and gudehus 1999 with the measured maximum and minimum void ratios at zero stress level that are 0 78 and 0 47 respectively parameters α β m t m r r β r and χ were calibrated from a series of consolidated drained triaxial tests shown in fig 1 b c the summary of parameters for hypoplastic model in this study is shown in table 1 2 2 method and verification the hypoplastic constitutive model was involved into a three dimensional finite element method that was conducted using the commercial software abaqus the parameters of hypoplastic model for sand that have been calibrated in section 2 1 are shown in table 1 the pile was simulated by a linearly elastic model with a young s modulus of 72 gpa and a poisson ratio of 0 2 the interaction between soil and pile was set as hard contact in normal direction and penalty friction in shearing direction the proposed numerical method was applied to simulate two centrifuge model tests on monopole under 50 g level lu and zhang 2018 one is purely lateral loading the other is lateral loading after pre vertical compression half model was used in both centrifuge model tests to measure the displacements of the pile and neighboring soil in the purely lateral loading test a hydraulic cylinder was used to apply horizontal load step by step from 0 to 400 n at 50 g level that is equal to 1 mn at prototype scale in another test several steel pieces were fixed onto the pile head to create a 1000 n vertical compressional load at 50 g that is equal to 2 5 mn at prototype scale and the same horizontal load was applied subsequently by the hydraulic cylinder the displacement and bending moment of the pile were measured in the centrifuge tests two influences of vertical load on the horizontal behaviour of pile p δ effect and soil densification effect were discovered based on the analyses of test data in order to maintain the consistency with centrifuge model tests the numerical models in this study were half models with the same size of soil base and pile the model was meshed by c3d8 elements with the element length from 0 1d to 1 5d m d pile diameter as shown in fig 2 according to the interface shear tests lehane et al 2011 the friction coefficient of the soil pile interface was assumed as 0 55 that equals to the tangent of the effective friction angle of the sand minus 5 during the calculation an initial stress field was first applied on the soil based to balance the self gravity of the soil under 1 g then the gravity acceleration was gradually increased to 50 g to follow the procedure of centrifuge tests afterwards the vertical and horizontal loads were exerted onto the pile in the numerical analyses the p δ effect was taken into account by using the geometry nonlinearity option nlgeom in abaqus the nlgeom means to consider the deformation gradient tensor by using green lagrange strain instead of cauchy strain during the calculation in this way the change of external loads due to material deformation can be taken into account which is the additional bending moment due to pile s lateral deformation for the vertical horizontal combined loading pile meanwhile the change of soil stiffness due to vertical loading was characterized by hypoplastic constitutive model with its advantages of pressure dependency and density dependency in this paper the soil stiffness is quantified by the shear modulus g and the lame constant λ namely λ 2g fig 3 compares the load displacement curves and the profiles of bending moment of the pile from fem and centrifuge tests at model scale it is learnt that the numerical results are very close to the test data which validates the proposed numerical method in simulating vertical horizontal combined loading pile in sand the rapid increase of pile displacement at large horizontal load shows the nonlinearity of the soil pile system 2 3 numerical analyses scheme in order to compare the lateral responses of pile under different vertical horizontal load combinations and to analyze the mechanism a series of numerical analyses was conducted with different pile diameters 0 5 m 1 m and 2 m different pile embedment lengths 16 5 m 30 m and 60 m different sand friction angles 31 34 37 and 40 and different friction angles between the pile and sand 0 5 0 55 0 6 0 65 for each condition a displacement control vertical loading compression or tension were conducted first to determine the ultimate vertical bearing capacities including compression and tension of the pile v u afterwards four loading methods were applied independently pure vertical loading termed as v condition pure lateral loading termed as h condition pre ultimate compression followed by horizontal loading termed as hc condition pre ultimate tension and horizontal loading termed as ht condition the loading point is 6 25 m above the ground level the detailed numerical analyses scheme is shown in table 2 where different cases are identified using three markers separated by two hyphens the three markers represent the loading conditions the pile embedment length and the friction angles the default pile diameter and the interface friction coefficient are respectively 1 m and 0 55 the additional brackets with numbers stand for the cases with different pile diameters or interface friction coefficients 3 numerical observations the displacement and bending moment with different pile lengths and different loading conditions were compared the soil resistance and the p y curves under different load combinations were analysed to investigate the influence of vertical load on the horizontal responses of soil pile system 3 1 response of soil the contour lines of the mean stress of soil under hc and ht loading conditions are shown in fig 4 it is observed that the stress concentrates at the upper left part near the ground level and the lower right part near the pile tip for the short pile l 16 5 m which is induced by the flexible deformation and rigid rotation of the pile meanwhile for the long pile l 30 m the mean stress in soil is mainly restricted at the upper left region this is because the embedment effect is stronger for slender piles and the lower part of pile and soil bear less influence from horizontal load besides there are also stress concentrations beneath the pile tip in fig 4 a and c due to vertical compressions fig 5 shows the contour lines of lateral displacement of soil where the leftward displacement is taken as positive generally speaking the horizontal soil movement is mainly restricted within a certain area near the ground level under all conditions which could be named as the influence region which is about 3 8d wide and 0 6l deep for short pile l 16 5 m and 3 7d wide and 0 3l deep for long pile l 30 m such observations are consistent with the statement by reese and van impe 2001 that the upper part of the soil near the ground level 5 10d in depth is the most important in soil pile interaction due to lateral loading it is fair to infer that the change of soil in the influence domain makes bigger differences than that in the other region in this study the influencing domain was taken as a cylinder soil area neighboring the pile with a diameter of 4 times of the pile diameter besides the difference between hc and ht loading conditions is not fairly obvious for both short and long piles except for an extra movement of soil beneath the pile tip in fig 5 a 3 2 response of pile fig 6 a provides vertical profiles of the pile deflection under different conditions where solid curves stand for hc condition and dash curves represent ht condition for the short pile l 16 5 m there are both flexible deformation and a slight rigid rotation with a rotating center at about 10 m deep but for long piles l d 30 and 60 the rigid rotation is barely noticeable because of a stronger embedment effect of the lower part of soil besides it is observed that the deflection under ht loading condition is smaller than that under hc condition but the difference for short pile is less significant than that for long piles according to the analyses by lu and zhang 2018 the p δ effect and the soil densification effect were coexisting and interacting under vertical horizontal combined loading on one hand the p δ effect could increase the lateral deformation and decrease the lateral ultimate capacity of the pile under vertical horizontal combined loading on the other hand the soil densification effect due to the vertical compression could decrease the deflection and bending moment of the pile in some degree therefore the results in fig 6 are the integrated results under these two effects it can be seen that the p δ effect is weaker for short piles but it becomes stronger and stronger with the increasing pile embedment length bending moments along the pile shaft are shown in fig 6 b where a nearly triangular distribution is observed for all the conditions with the maximum value at the upper part of the pile it can be seen that the longer the pile the more the inflexes of the curves which is the difference between rigid and slender piles besides the bending moment under hc condition is larger than that under ht condition for the same pile which results from the interplay of the p δ effect and the change of soil stiffness due to vertical loading 3 3 response of soil pile interaction the contact forces act at the pile surface in the horizontal loading direction at 2 m deep under a lateral load of 0 2 mn in the test h 16 5 34 are shown in fig 7 it can be observed that due to the horizontal load the normal contact force of the nodes cnormf at the left side of the pile increases while that at the right side decreases meanwhile the shearing contact force of the nodes cshearf at the upper and lower sides increases because of the lateral deflection of the pile it is well recognized that the resultant soil resistance in the horizontal loading direction is a superposition of the normal and shearing contact forces therefore the soil resistance at this depth could be calculated using the following equation 2 p n 1 n 24 c n o r m f c s h e a r f h where h is the height of the pile element that is 0 01 m in this study the vertical distribution of the soil resistance along the pile shaft could be gained by repeating the same procedure at different depths the vertical profile of the soil resistance could be gained by repeating the same procedure at different depths shown in fig 8 it is obvious that the longer the pile the more the inflection points of the soil resistance curve besides the soil resistance under hc conditions is larger than that under ht condition with the same horizontal load which confirms the statement that the lateral soil pile interaction can be influenced by the vertical loading condition the time history curves of the soil resistance and the lateral deflection of the pile at a certain depth during horizontal loading were derived and combined to get the p y curve the p y curves under different loading conditions for the pile with a length of 16 5 m are shown in fig 9 it is clear to see that comparing with p y curves for h condition the p y curves under hc condition are higher while those under ht condition are lower since the stiffness of the p y spring is the integrated performance of the stiffness of all the soil element in the influencing domain it can be concluded that soil under hc condition is hardened by the vertical compression while that under ht condition is softened by tension the harden and soften stated here refer to that the modulus of the soil increases and decreases which is dependent not only on the basic physical behaviour and consolidation but also on the stress state and stress history under vertical compression the shearing stress in the soil pile interface increases as well as the confining stress of the soil neighboring the pile due to the compressive hardening of sand the increase of confining stress leads to an increase of sand stiffness which makes the sand harder similar mechanism could be used to explain the soil softening under ht condition such observations are consistent with the soil densification effect proposed by lu and zhang 2018 from centrifuge model tests but it should be noted that this study mainly focuses on the change of soil stiffness due to the vertical load rather than the change of soil density 4 mechanism analyses the above comparisons show the influences of vertical load on the horizontal responses of soil pile system which are speculated to be the results of p δ effect and the change of soil stiffness in this section direct analyses were conducted on the change of soil stiffness under pure vertical loading to verify the speculation and to study the mechanisms and influencing factors 4 1 soil stiffness change fig 10 shows the change of soil stiffness after vertical loading it should be noted that the soil stiffness discussed here is the first term of the stiffness matrix λ 2g where g and λ respectively represent the shear modulus and the lame constant of the sand λ 2g could represent the horizontal modulus of the soil to describe the soil stiffness from the soil element view that treats the soil as continuous medium instead of springs the macro horizontal modulus such as the stiffness of the p y spring is the integrated performance of the stiffness of all the soil element in the influencing domain it can be seen in fig 10 a that the stiffness of the soil all around the pile decreases after tensioning and the closer to the pile the larger the decrement of the soil stiffness in contrast after compression the soil stiffness near the ground level increases but that around the pile tip decreases as shown in fig 10 b the stiffness of the soil beneath the pile tip dramatically increases under compression which is not plotted here several soil columns with different distances from the pile were picked up from fig 10 to further analyze the rate of soil stiffness change along depth shown in fig 11 it can be observed that the greatest rate of stiffness change of soil occurs near the ground level and it gradually decreases along depth besides the change ratio under tension eventually becomes zero near the pile tip while that under compression reversely increases near the pile tip moreover comparing the results of different soil columns it is clear that the influence of vertical load on the stiffness of soil is gradually weaken with the increasing distance between soil and pile 4 2 element analyses two soil elements in the symmetry plane with 1 m horizontal distance from the pile e 1 and e 2 were studied after vertical loading where e 1 is 1 m from the ground level and e 2 is 1 m from the pile tip fig 12 a shows the change of stress state of e 1 in mohr circles after the application of compression or tension it can be seen that under vertical compression both maximum and minimum principle stress of e 1 are enlarged because of the additional friction at the soil pile interface so is the mean stress on the contrary the principle stress components of e 1 under vertical tension are decreased due to the extra negative friction meanwhile the changes of void ratio of e 1 and e 2 are so small that can be ignorable it is well recognized that the sand modulus increases with the increasing confining pressure and the decreasing void ratio therefore the stiffness of soil close to the ground level enhances under compression and reduces under tension as shown in figs 10 and 11 the status changes of e 2 are provided in fig 12 b similar with e 1 the principle stress of e 2 also decreases under vertical tension for the same reason so the stiffness of soil neighboring the pile tip also reduces under t condition however the change of stress states of e 2 under compression is opposite to those of e 1 it is inferred that after compressing the pile the soil beneath the pile tip is strongly compressed and moves downwards but the soil above this region isn t compressed equally and cannot move downwards synchronously therefore the density of soil in such a cavity decreases so are the horizontal and vertical normal stresses this is considered to be the reason of the decrease of soil stiffness around pile tip after compression figs 10 and 11 it should be noted that fig 12 ignores the middle principle σ 2 in the mohr circles but the values of trσ takes σ 2 into consideration 4 3 influencing factors the average change rate of soil stiffness within the influencing domain k stiff was regarded as the characteristic value at each depth to reflect the influence of vertical load on the lateral soil stiffness it can be calculated by the following equation 3 k s t i f f δ λ 2 g a v e λ 2 g 0 where λ 2g 0 is the original soil stiffness δ λ 2g ave is the average change of soil stiffness within the influencing domain with an envelope wide of 4 times of the pile diameter in this study the vertical distributions of k stiff under tension and compression for a 16 5 m long pile are shown in fig 13 consistent with the above observations k stiff curves shows the decrease of soil stiffness all along the pile under tension and the increases near the ground level and decrease near the pile tip under compression as shown in figs 13 17 the vertical distributions of k stiff under different conditions were compared to study the influencing factors generally speaking the amplitude of k stiff increases with the increasing vertical load the pile diameter the internal friction angle and the interface friction coefficient under both tension and compression fig 13 indicates that k stiff under different magnitudes of tension or compression share similar shapes with different amplitudes considering the nonlinearity of soil near the ultimate state an exponential relationship between the amplitude of soil stiffness change and the magnitude of vertical load could be assumed in this study fig 16 presents the vertical distributions of k stiff under different friction coefficients of the sand pile interface it is seen that the amplitude of k stiff slightly increases with the increasing interface friction coefficient due to the increase of friction force but the changes are not that significant moreover comparing the distributions of k stiff with different pile lengths the influence of tension on the neighboring soil mainly concentrates on the upper part fig 17 a while the influence of compression on the soil stiffness could be divided into three parts increased near the ground level constant in the middle and decreased near the pile tip fig 17 b however the amplitude of soil stiffness change is almost independent on the pile length under ultimate vertical loading this is because the change of soil stiffness mainly depends on the lateral friction of pile soil interface under the action of ultimate vertical force the soil pile interface at the same depth reaches the same ultimate stress state so the magnitude of the change of soil stiffness is the same for different embedment length of piles 5 new p y model based on the mechanism analyses a new p y curve model was established for the vertical horizontal combined loading conditions 5 1 framework for the convenience of engineering application the new p y model is established with the same framework of api p y model the fundamental idea is to introduce a couple loading factor k vh into the p y curve model for pure lateral loading condition to characterize the influence of vertical loads on the p y curves eq 4 because p y curves mainly depend on the lateral stiffness of soil k vh was assumed to be a function of the change rate of the soil stiffness due to vertical loading k stiff which is also named as stiffness factor besides from the micro soil element level to the macro p y curve level a modification is required between k vh and k stiff which is the modifying factor b shown in eq 5 it should be noted that because the upper portion of the soil is of predominant importance in soil pile interaction due to lateral loading reese and van impe 2001 only the p y curves within the upper half part of the pile were modified in this study 4 p k v h f y 5 k v h f k s t i f f b z 0 5 l 5 2 pure lateral loading the api p y curve model for sand has been proven to be inaccurate under many conditions klinkvort and hededal 2014 zhu et al 2014 therefore different p y models and different parameter calibration methods have been established to describe different types of soil under different loading conditions in this paper the api p y model for sand was slightly adjusted to make a better curve fitting with pure lateral loading centrifuge model test results the modified equations for pure lateral loading condition are as follows 6 p a p u tanh k i n i z i l 0 8 a p u y 7 p u min c 1 z c 2 d γ z c 3 d γ z 8 a 3 5 0 8 z d 0 9 where z is depth l is pile embedment length d is pile diameter i l is the unit length that was taken as 1 m for nondimensionalization c 1 c 2 and c 3 are dimensionless parameters that depend on the soil properties k ini is a parameter with the unit of pa 5 3 vertical horizontal combined loading according to the above analyses the average change rate of soil stiffness within the influencing domain k stiff varies along depth and is influenced by the vertical load the diameter and slenderness ratio of the pile and the friction angle of the soil therefore a unified formula of k stiff for both hc and ht loading conditions was established to fit the results in figs 13 17 with considerations of theses influencing factors 9 k s t i f f k 1 tanh z k 2 i l k 3 d i l z l k 4 v v u k 5 z 0 5 l where z represents the depths v and v u are respectively the applied and the ultimate vertical load on the pile d is the pile diameter i l is the unit length that was taken as 1 m for nondimensionalization k 1 to k 5 are dimensionless coefficients by adjusting the values of k 1 to k 5 the distributions of k stiff under vertical tension and compression in figs 13 17 could be correctly described it was found that k 2 and k 4 are only related to the vertical loading direction so that they can be taken as constants for compression and tension respectively meanwhile k 1 and k 3 are influenced by not only vertical loading direction but also the friction angle for simplification a unified dimensionless parameter k g was employed to describe the relationship between k 1 and k 3 besides a unified value of k 5 0 7 was used for both hc and ht conditions for good curve fittings the summary of the final equation of k stiff and the coefficients is shown as follows 10 k s t i f f k g tanh z 2 8 i l k g d i l z 0 07 l v v u 0 7 h c z 0 5 l k g tanh z 2 5 i l k g 0 9 d i l z 2 l v v u 0 7 h t z 0 5 l the curve fitting results of k stiff using eq 10 for the sand with a friction angle of 34 are shown in fig 18 the modifying factor b is an adjustment of the mapping relation of k vh and k stiff from micro soil element level to the macro p y curve level which was simplified to be linearly varied along depth 11 b b 1 b 2 z l z 0 5 l where b 1 and b 2 are coefficients that were determined to make the modified p y curves close to the p y curves gained from numerical simulations under vertical horizontal combined loading after adjusting the values of b 1 and b 2 for a better curve fitting these two coefficients were finally determined as constant for ht and hc conditions respectively as shown as follows 12 b 4 3 z l h c z 0 5 l 8 z l h t z 0 5 l the foregoing analyses focus on the vh loading condition where the vertical loading is prior to the horizontal loading vh loading condition is suitable for monopile foundation for offshore structures that bears vertical self weight prior to the horizontal wind and wave the formula of k vh for vh loading condition was assumed as follows 13 k v h b k s t i f f 1 however for the multiple foundations for offshore wind turbines such as tripod or jacket the horizontal wind acting on the superstructure is converted into a combination of vertical and horizontal load on every individual pile lu et al 2017 in such a situation the vertical and horizontal loads increase simultaneously which is more like an inclined loading condition during inclined loading the change of soil stiffness progressively develops along with the increasing vertical load component therefore the couple loading factor k vh for inclined loading conditions was modified with an additional term tanh k ini z d 0 0 8 a p u y that gradually increases from 0 to 1 with the increasing pile deflection y 14 k v h b k s t i f f tanh k i n i z d 0 0 8 a p u y 1 considering the above two loading conditions a unified form of k vh was given with an exponent a 15 k v h b k s t i f f tanh k i n

lateral behaviours of the pile under vertical horizontal combined loading condition 5 4 parameters determination first the numerical simulation of pure lateral loading condition was used to determine the basic parameters k ini c 1 c 2 and c 3 the values of basic parameters were adjusted to make the p y curves using eq 6 match well with those from numerical calculations the adjusted parameters for different friction angles are plotted in fig 19 a and b afterwards numerical simulations of pure vertical loading condition with different friction angles were employed to find appropriate values of k g to fit the distributions of k stiff under vertical tension and compression respectively the recommended values of k g for different friction angles are shown in fig 19 c 6 validation of the new p y model fig 3 has shown that the numerical analysis method predicted the soil pile responses in good agreements with the centrifuge model test results under vertical horizontal combined loading conditions this indicates that the numerical analysis results which provide various practical cases of the piles are effective to validate the new p y curve model by numerical analyses results in this section the numerical results with the sand dry density of 1 65 g cm3 and sand internal friction angle of 34 were taken as examples to verify the effectiveness of the new p y model and the parameters it is learnt in fig 19 that the dimensionless parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 are respectively 5 8 and 22 and k ini is 1 5 mpa the dimensionless parameters k g for hc and ht loading conditions are 0 18 and 0 14 respectively 6 1 pure lateral loading for pure lateral loading condition the basic parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 and k ini are introduced into the eqs 6 8 to get the modified p y curves the comparison of p y curves from eq 6 and numerical results are presented in fig 20 which are in good agreements then both new p y curves and api p y curves were employed in a back calculation program www yongtechnology com to back calculate the deflection and bending moment of the pile with different pile embedment lengths the results were compared with numerical results in fig 21 because the api p y curves overestimate the lateral modulus of soil it can be seen that the back calculated deflections of the pile using api p y model dash lines are smaller than numerical simulations while the back calculated bending moments are larger in the upper part and smaller in the lower part on the contrary the back calculated results using new p y curves solid lines agree well with numerical calculations which indicates the effectiveness of the new p y equations and adjusted basic parameters in simulating the horizontal responses of the pile under pure lateral loading 6 2 vh loading for vh loading conditions parameter k g was first put up into eq 10 to calculate the vertical distributions of k stiff and to compare with numerical results then eq 16 and 17 was employed with parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 k ini and k g to get the new p y curves under vertical horizontal loading condition the comparisons of new p y curves and fem p y curves are shown in fig 22 under ht and hc conditions the new p y curve model with the consideration of soil densification effect was used in the back calculation program to get the horizontal responses of the pile under vh loading conditions it should be noted that p δ effect induced by vertical load was also considered in this back calculation program by introducing the term of axial force into the differential equation of winkler beam therefore the back calculated results shown in fig 23 under vh loading condition are integrated reflections of both p δ effect and soil densification effect and exhibit good agreements with the fem results which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed p y curve model besides the back calculated results under h condition are also shown in fig 23 as benchmarks which did not consider effect of combination of vertical loading either p δ effect or soil densification effect it can be seen that the results of this case are far different from the fem results this demonstrated that the effect of the combination of vertical loading is fairly evident and should be considered it is known that the loading location above the ground influences the magnitude of p δ effect which changes the lateral response of piles accordingly the new p y model was used to calculate the pile responses under different loading locations and compared to fem results fig 24 because of the increase of loading location the additional bending moment due to p δ effect also increases with the same vertical load therefore the bending moment and lateral deflection of the pile increase with the increasing load location under hc loading condition fig 24 a b while those under ht condition decrease fig 24 c d besides the good agreement between back calculated results using the new p y model and fem indicates the effectiveness of the proposed p y model for different loading locations 7 conclusions 1 a finite element model was set up to simulate vertical horizontal combined loading pile in sand where the hypoplastic constitutive model was employed to capture the sand with its pressure dependency and density dependency the p δ effect induced by vertical load was taken into account by considering geometry nonlinearity in the numerical model the effectiveness of the proposed numerical model was confirmed by comparing the predictions with centrifuge model test observations 2 the proposed numerical method was applied to analyze the response of piles under with different horizontal vertical loading conditions the upper part of the soil was found dominated in soil pile interaction due to lateral loading which is defined as influencing domain the p y curve of the pile under vertical compression condition is steeper than the one under vertical tension condition 3 the change of soil stiffness was analysed by considering different influencing factors such as the magnitude of vertical load and the length and diameter of the pile it was found that the stiffness of soil in the influencing domain enhances under compression and reduces under tension that determines the change of the p y curve 4 a new p y curve model was proposed for the vertical horizontal combined loading conditions by characterizing the influence of vertical loads in the macro level with a function of the stiffness of soil in the micro level the suggested values of parameters are summarized for the convenience of engineering application through a few series of numerical analysis 5 the back calculated results using new p y curves fit better with the numerical analysis results under various loading conditions the new p y model were confirmed to be reasonable credit authorship contribution statement wenjun lu conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft

21942,pile foundations in offshore engineering are usually subjected to vertical horizontal load combinations previous researches have discovered that the lateral behaviour of soil pile system could be influenced by axial load due to p δ effect and the change of soil stiffness but the mechanism and influencing factors are still unclear the current p y curve method for laterally loaded piles is independent on vertical loads which is not often applicable for offshore piles in this study numerical analyses with the hypoplastic constitutive model were employed to simulate the vertical horizontal combined loading pile in sand the results of soil pile system under different vertical horizontal load combinations were compared to confirm and further investigate the change of soil stiffness due to vertical loads the mechanism and the influencing factor of the change of soil stiffness were clarified by analysing the change of soil stiffness under pure vertical loading conditions based on the above studies a new p y curve model for vertical horizontal combined loading piles in sand was established the parameter determination method was proposed the effectiveness of the new p y model and the parameters were verified by comparing the back calculated results with those from numerical simulations keywords numerical analysis offshore engineering pile p y curves vertical horizontal load 1 introduction it is well recognized that pile foundations in offshore engineering are subjected to vertical horizontal load combinations especially owing to the rapid development of offshore wind industry the horizontal load from wind plays a significant role to the foundations for instance the monopile foundation of offshore wind turbine is under a considerable vertical gravity combined with lateral thrusts from wind and wave and piles in tripod or jacket foundation for offshore wind turbines bear simultaneous axial compression or tension and horizontal bending lu et al 2017 the lateral responses of soil pile system under vertical horizontal load combinations have been studied by many researchers on one hand it was well recognized that the axial force introduced an additional bending moment after the lateral deformation of the pile which was named p δ effect p δ effect was regarded as the reason for the increase of the lateral deformation and the decrease of the lateral ultimate capacity of the pile under vertical horizontal combined loading reddy and ramasamy 1973 madhav and sarma 1982 meera et al 2007 lee et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 liang et al 2013 on the other hand it was also observed by in situ tests sorochan and bykov 1976 karasev et al 1977 and numerical simulations karthigeyan et al 2006 chatterjee and choudhury 2015 that the vertical compression decreased the deflection and bending moment of the pile in some degree one reasonable explanation was proposed by hussien et al 2014 that the confining pressure in the sand along the upper part of the pile was enhanced due to vertical compression which led to an increase in the lateral pile resistance lu and zhang 2018 conducted a series of centrifuge model tests on monopiles under different vertical horizontal load combinations based on the comparisons of pile deflection and bending moment it was deduced that the p δ effect and the increase of the confining pressure which was defined as soil densification effect were coexisting and interacting under vertical horizontal combined loading besides it was discovered that the lateral pile responses under vertical horizontal combined loading could be influenced by many factors such as the order of loading anagnostopoulos and georgiadis 1993 zheng and wang 2008 the direction of the vertical load which is compression or tension ismael 1989 achmus and thieken 2010 bhardwaj and singh 2016 the rigidity of the pile sastry and meyerhof 1994 and the properties of soil zhukov and balov 1978 karthigeyan et al 2007 however these researches put the focus on behavioral observations further analyses are still required to reveal the mechanism of the influence of vertical loads on the lateral response of pile the most common design approach for lateral loading piles is p y curve method which simplifies the lateral soil pile interaction by a series of nonlinear springs relating the horizontal resistance p to the corresponding displacement y considering the influence of vertical loads on the lateral resistance of neighboring soil from the above researches it is fair to infer that the p y curves may also be affected by vertical loading through centrifuge model tests on jacket pile foundations of offshore wind turbine zhu et al 2014 and numerical simulation on monopile foundation abbas et al 2017 it was discovered that there were significant differences among p y curves under different vertical horizontal load combinations which confirmed the dependency of p y curves on the vertical loads however in the current widely used p y curve models the influence of vertical loads is ignored for example the p y curve model for sand suggested by the american petroleum institute design code api 2000 are described by a hyperbolic tangent function where the parameters are only related to the soil properties thus the api p y curve model is not reliable to calculate the lateral responses of piles under vertical horizontal combined loads on the basis of wedge failure model a modification of the ultimate resistance of sand p u in the api p y model was proposed by mu et al 2017 to consider the additional friction on the soil wedge due to vertical loading but this study only focused on the ultimate state extra efforts are expected to clarify the influence of vertical load on the p y curves under normal working conditions numerical simulation is able to provide full stress and strain fields inside the soil and to simulate various conditions efficiently which has become an essential approach to study the soil pile interactions in this study the finite element method was employed to confirm and further study the influence of the vertical loading on the lateral responses of pile and to establish a new p y curve model considering the influence of vertical load the objectives of this paper include 1 to propose an effective numerical model to simulate vertical horizontal combined loading pile in sand 2 to compare the results of soil pile system under different vertical horizontal load combinations 3 to reveal the mechanism of the change of soil stiffness due to vertical loading 4 to establish an new p y curve model in sand for vertical horizontal combined loading piles 2 numerical method 2 1 hypoplastic model of the sand the sand behaviour was characterized using the hypoplastic constitutive model proposed by von wolffersdorff 1996 the basis of hypoplastic model captures soil behaviours with both reversible and irreversible deformations from the beginning by the linear term l and the nonlinear term n in eq 1 respectively the barotropy factor f b and pycnotropy factors f e and f d are employed to reflect the pressure dependency and density dependency of sand respectively which are all functions of the current void ratio and the stress level 1 σ f b f e l σ ˆ ε f d n σ ˆ ε the hypoplastic model contains eight basic parameters φ c h s n e d0 e c0 e i0 α and β and five extensional parameters m t m r r β r and χ for small strain stiffness and the recent stress history niemunis and herle 1997 the internal shearing angle φ c was calibrated using the angle of repose test parameters h s and n that describe the shape of limiting void ratio curves were determined by oedometric tests on loose sand shown in fig 1 a parameters e c0 e max e d0 e min and e i0 1 15e max were empirically estimated herle and gudehus 1999 with the measured maximum and minimum void ratios at zero stress level that are 0 78 and 0 47 respectively parameters α β m t m r r β r and χ were calibrated from a series of consolidated drained triaxial tests shown in fig 1 b c the summary of parameters for hypoplastic model in this study is shown in table 1 2 2 method and verification the hypoplastic constitutive model was involved into a three dimensional finite element method that was conducted using the commercial software abaqus the parameters of hypoplastic model for sand that have been calibrated in section 2 1 are shown in table 1 the pile was simulated by a linearly elastic model with a young s modulus of 72 gpa and a poisson ratio of 0 2 the interaction between soil and pile was set as hard contact in normal direction and penalty friction in shearing direction the proposed numerical method was applied to simulate two centrifuge model tests on monopole under 50 g level lu and zhang 2018 one is purely lateral loading the other is lateral loading after pre vertical compression half model was used in both centrifuge model tests to measure the displacements of the pile and neighboring soil in the purely lateral loading test a hydraulic cylinder was used to apply horizontal load step by step from 0 to 400 n at 50 g level that is equal to 1 mn at prototype scale in another test several steel pieces were fixed onto the pile head to create a 1000 n vertical compressional load at 50 g that is equal to 2 5 mn at prototype scale and the same horizontal load was applied subsequently by the hydraulic cylinder the displacement and bending moment of the pile were measured in the centrifuge tests two influences of vertical load on the horizontal behaviour of pile p δ effect and soil densification effect were discovered based on the analyses of test data in order to maintain the consistency with centrifuge model tests the numerical models in this study were half models with the same size of soil base and pile the model was meshed by c3d8 elements with the element length from 0 1d to 1 5d m d pile diameter as shown in fig 2 according to the interface shear tests lehane et al 2011 the friction coefficient of the soil pile interface was assumed as 0 55 that equals to the tangent of the effective friction angle of the sand minus 5 during the calculation an initial stress field was first applied on the soil based to balance the self gravity of the soil under 1 g then the gravity acceleration was gradually increased to 50 g to follow the procedure of centrifuge tests afterwards the vertical and horizontal loads were exerted onto the pile in the numerical analyses the p δ effect was taken into account by using the geometry nonlinearity option nlgeom in abaqus the nlgeom means to consider the deformation gradient tensor by using green lagrange strain instead of cauchy strain during the calculation in this way the change of external loads due to material deformation can be taken into account which is the additional bending moment due to pile s lateral deformation for the vertical horizontal combined loading pile meanwhile the change of soil stiffness due to vertical loading was characterized by hypoplastic constitutive model with its advantages of pressure dependency and density dependency in this paper the soil stiffness is quantified by the shear modulus g and the lame constant λ namely λ 2g fig 3 compares the load displacement curves and the profiles of bending moment of the pile from fem and centrifuge tests at model scale it is learnt that the numerical results are very close to the test data which validates the proposed numerical method in simulating vertical horizontal combined loading pile in sand the rapid increase of pile displacement at large horizontal load shows the nonlinearity of the soil pile system 2 3 numerical analyses scheme in order to compare the lateral responses of pile under different vertical horizontal load combinations and to analyze the mechanism a series of numerical analyses was conducted with different pile diameters 0 5 m 1 m and 2 m different pile embedment lengths 16 5 m 30 m and 60 m different sand friction angles 31 34 37 and 40 and different friction angles between the pile and sand 0 5 0 55 0 6 0 65 for each condition a displacement control vertical loading compression or tension were conducted first to determine the ultimate vertical bearing capacities including compression and tension of the pile v u afterwards four loading methods were applied independently pure vertical loading termed as v condition pure lateral loading termed as h condition pre ultimate compression followed by horizontal loading termed as hc condition pre ultimate tension and horizontal loading termed as ht condition the loading point is 6 25 m above the ground level the detailed numerical analyses scheme is shown in table 2 where different cases are identified using three markers separated by two hyphens the three markers represent the loading conditions the pile embedment length and the friction angles the default pile diameter and the interface friction coefficient are respectively 1 m and 0 55 the additional brackets with numbers stand for the cases with different pile diameters or interface friction coefficients 3 numerical observations the displacement and bending moment with different pile lengths and different loading conditions were compared the soil resistance and the p y curves under different load combinations were analysed to investigate the influence of vertical load on the horizontal responses of soil pile system 3 1 response of soil the contour lines of the mean stress of soil under hc and ht loading conditions are shown in fig 4 it is observed that the stress concentrates at the upper left part near the ground level and the lower right part near the pile tip for the short pile l 16 5 m which is induced by the flexible deformation and rigid rotation of the pile meanwhile for the long pile l 30 m the mean stress in soil is mainly restricted at the upper left region this is because the embedment effect is stronger for slender piles and the lower part of pile and soil bear less influence from horizontal load besides there are also stress concentrations beneath the pile tip in fig 4 a and c due to vertical compressions fig 5 shows the contour lines of lateral displacement of soil where the leftward displacement is taken as positive generally speaking the horizontal soil movement is mainly restricted within a certain area near the ground level under all conditions which could be named as the influence region which is about 3 8d wide and 0 6l deep for short pile l 16 5 m and 3 7d wide and 0 3l deep for long pile l 30 m such observations are consistent with the statement by reese and van impe 2001 that the upper part of the soil near the ground level 5 10d in depth is the most important in soil pile interaction due to lateral loading it is fair to infer that the change of soil in the influence domain makes bigger differences than that in the other region in this study the influencing domain was taken as a cylinder soil area neighboring the pile with a diameter of 4 times of the pile diameter besides the difference between hc and ht loading conditions is not fairly obvious for both short and long piles except for an extra movement of soil beneath the pile tip in fig 5 a 3 2 response of pile fig 6 a provides vertical profiles of the pile deflection under different conditions where solid curves stand for hc condition and dash curves represent ht condition for the short pile l 16 5 m there are both flexible deformation and a slight rigid rotation with a rotating center at about 10 m deep but for long piles l d 30 and 60 the rigid rotation is barely noticeable because of a stronger embedment effect of the lower part of soil besides it is observed that the deflection under ht loading condition is smaller than that under hc condition but the difference for short pile is less significant than that for long piles according to the analyses by lu and zhang 2018 the p δ effect and the soil densification effect were coexisting and interacting under vertical horizontal combined loading on one hand the p δ effect could increase the lateral deformation and decrease the lateral ultimate capacity of the pile under vertical horizontal combined loading on the other hand the soil densification effect due to the vertical compression could decrease the deflection and bending moment of the pile in some degree therefore the results in fig 6 are the integrated results under these two effects it can be seen that the p δ effect is weaker for short piles but it becomes stronger and stronger with the increasing pile embedment length bending moments along the pile shaft are shown in fig 6 b where a nearly triangular distribution is observed for all the conditions with the maximum value at the upper part of the pile it can be seen that the longer the pile the more the inflexes of the curves which is the difference between rigid and slender piles besides the bending moment under hc condition is larger than that under ht condition for the same pile which results from the interplay of the p δ effect and the change of soil stiffness due to vertical loading 3 3 response of soil pile interaction the contact forces act at the pile surface in the horizontal loading direction at 2 m deep under a lateral load of 0 2 mn in the test h 16 5 34 are shown in fig 7 it can be observed that due to the horizontal load the normal contact force of the nodes cnormf at the left side of the pile increases while that at the right side decreases meanwhile the shearing contact force of the nodes cshearf at the upper and lower sides increases because of the lateral deflection of the pile it is well recognized that the resultant soil resistance in the horizontal loading direction is a superposition of the normal and shearing contact forces therefore the soil resistance at this depth could be calculated using the following equation 2 p n 1 n 24 c n o r m f c s h e a r f h where h is the height of the pile element that is 0 01 m in this study the vertical distribution of the soil resistance along the pile shaft could be gained by repeating the same procedure at different depths the vertical profile of the soil resistance could be gained by repeating the same procedure at different depths shown in fig 8 it is obvious that the longer the pile the more the inflection points of the soil resistance curve besides the soil resistance under hc conditions is larger than that under ht condition with the same horizontal load which confirms the statement that the lateral soil pile interaction can be influenced by the vertical loading condition the time history curves of the soil resistance and the lateral deflection of the pile at a certain depth during horizontal loading were derived and combined to get the p y curve the p y curves under different loading conditions for the pile with a length of 16 5 m are shown in fig 9 it is clear to see that comparing with p y curves for h condition the p y curves under hc condition are higher while those under ht condition are lower since the stiffness of the p y spring is the integrated performance of the stiffness of all the soil element in the influencing domain it can be concluded that soil under hc condition is hardened by the vertical compression while that under ht condition is softened by tension the harden and soften stated here refer to that the modulus of the soil increases and decreases which is dependent not only on the basic physical behaviour and consolidation but also on the stress state and stress history under vertical compression the shearing stress in the soil pile interface increases as well as the confining stress of the soil neighboring the pile due to the compressive hardening of sand the increase of confining stress leads to an increase of sand stiffness which makes the sand harder similar mechanism could be used to explain the soil softening under ht condition such observations are consistent with the soil densification effect proposed by lu and zhang 2018 from centrifuge model tests but it should be noted that this study mainly focuses on the change of soil stiffness due to the vertical load rather than the change of soil density 4 mechanism analyses the above comparisons show the influences of vertical load on the horizontal responses of soil pile system which are speculated to be the results of p δ effect and the change of soil stiffness in this section direct analyses were conducted on the change of soil stiffness under pure vertical loading to verify the speculation and to study the mechanisms and influencing factors 4 1 soil stiffness change fig 10 shows the change of soil stiffness after vertical loading it should be noted that the soil stiffness discussed here is the first term of the stiffness matrix λ 2g where g and λ respectively represent the shear modulus and the lame constant of the sand λ 2g could represent the horizontal modulus of the soil to describe the soil stiffness from the soil element view that treats the soil as continuous medium instead of springs the macro horizontal modulus such as the stiffness of the p y spring is the integrated performance of the stiffness of all the soil element in the influencing domain it can be seen in fig 10 a that the stiffness of the soil all around the pile decreases after tensioning and the closer to the pile the larger the decrement of the soil stiffness in contrast after compression the soil stiffness near the ground level increases but that around the pile tip decreases as shown in fig 10 b the stiffness of the soil beneath the pile tip dramatically increases under compression which is not plotted here several soil columns with different distances from the pile were picked up from fig 10 to further analyze the rate of soil stiffness change along depth shown in fig 11 it can be observed that the greatest rate of stiffness change of soil occurs near the ground level and it gradually decreases along depth besides the change ratio under tension eventually becomes zero near the pile tip while that under compression reversely increases near the pile tip moreover comparing the results of different soil columns it is clear that the influence of vertical load on the stiffness of soil is gradually weaken with the increasing distance between soil and pile 4 2 element analyses two soil elements in the symmetry plane with 1 m horizontal distance from the pile e 1 and e 2 were studied after vertical loading where e 1 is 1 m from the ground level and e 2 is 1 m from the pile tip fig 12 a shows the change of stress state of e 1 in mohr circles after the application of compression or tension it can be seen that under vertical compression both maximum and minimum principle stress of e 1 are enlarged because of the additional friction at the soil pile interface so is the mean stress on the contrary the principle stress components of e 1 under vertical tension are decreased due to the extra negative friction meanwhile the changes of void ratio of e 1 and e 2 are so small that can be ignorable it is well recognized that the sand modulus increases with the increasing confining pressure and the decreasing void ratio therefore the stiffness of soil close to the ground level enhances under compression and reduces under tension as shown in figs 10 and 11 the status changes of e 2 are provided in fig 12 b similar with e 1 the principle stress of e 2 also decreases under vertical tension for the same reason so the stiffness of soil neighboring the pile tip also reduces under t condition however the change of stress states of e 2 under compression is opposite to those of e 1 it is inferred that after compressing the pile the soil beneath the pile tip is strongly compressed and moves downwards but the soil above this region isn t compressed equally and cannot move downwards synchronously therefore the density of soil in such a cavity decreases so are the horizontal and vertical normal stresses this is considered to be the reason of the decrease of soil stiffness around pile tip after compression figs 10 and 11 it should be noted that fig 12 ignores the middle principle σ 2 in the mohr circles but the values of trσ takes σ 2 into consideration 4 3 influencing factors the average change rate of soil stiffness within the influencing domain k stiff was regarded as the characteristic value at each depth to reflect the influence of vertical load on the lateral soil stiffness it can be calculated by the following equation 3 k s t i f f δ λ 2 g a v e λ 2 g 0 where λ 2g 0 is the original soil stiffness δ λ 2g ave is the average change of soil stiffness within the influencing domain with an envelope wide of 4 times of the pile diameter in this study the vertical distributions of k stiff under tension and compression for a 16 5 m long pile are shown in fig 13 consistent with the above observations k stiff curves shows the decrease of soil stiffness all along the pile under tension and the increases near the ground level and decrease near the pile tip under compression as shown in figs 13 17 the vertical distributions of k stiff under different conditions were compared to study the influencing factors generally speaking the amplitude of k stiff increases with the increasing vertical load the pile diameter the internal friction angle and the interface friction coefficient under both tension and compression fig 13 indicates that k stiff under different magnitudes of tension or compression share similar shapes with different amplitudes considering the nonlinearity of soil near the ultimate state an exponential relationship between the amplitude of soil stiffness change and the magnitude of vertical load could be assumed in this study fig 16 presents the vertical distributions of k stiff under different friction coefficients of the sand pile interface it is seen that the amplitude of k stiff slightly increases with the increasing interface friction coefficient due to the increase of friction force but the changes are not that significant moreover comparing the distributions of k stiff with different pile lengths the influence of tension on the neighboring soil mainly concentrates on the upper part fig 17 a while the influence of compression on the soil stiffness could be divided into three parts increased near the ground level constant in the middle and decreased near the pile tip fig 17 b however the amplitude of soil stiffness change is almost independent on the pile length under ultimate vertical loading this is because the change of soil stiffness mainly depends on the lateral friction of pile soil interface under the action of ultimate vertical force the soil pile interface at the same depth reaches the same ultimate stress state so the magnitude of the change of soil stiffness is the same for different embedment length of piles 5 new p y model based on the mechanism analyses a new p y curve model was established for the vertical horizontal combined loading conditions 5 1 framework for the convenience of engineering application the new p y model is established with the same framework of api p y model the fundamental idea is to introduce a couple loading factor k vh into the p y curve model for pure lateral loading condition to characterize the influence of vertical loads on the p y curves eq 4 because p y curves mainly depend on the lateral stiffness of soil k vh was assumed to be a function of the change rate of the soil stiffness due to vertical loading k stiff which is also named as stiffness factor besides from the micro soil element level to the macro p y curve level a modification is required between k vh and k stiff which is the modifying factor b shown in eq 5 it should be noted that because the upper portion of the soil is of predominant importance in soil pile interaction due to lateral loading reese and van impe 2001 only the p y curves within the upper half part of the pile were modified in this study 4 p k v h f y 5 k v h f k s t i f f b z 0 5 l 5 2 pure lateral loading the api p y curve model for sand has been proven to be inaccurate under many conditions klinkvort and hededal 2014 zhu et al 2014 therefore different p y models and different parameter calibration methods have been established to describe different types of soil under different loading conditions in this paper the api p y model for sand was slightly adjusted to make a better curve fitting with pure lateral loading centrifuge model test results the modified equations for pure lateral loading condition are as follows 6 p a p u tanh k i n i z i l 0 8 a p u y 7 p u min c 1 z c 2 d γ z c 3 d γ z 8 a 3 5 0 8 z d 0 9 where z is depth l is pile embedment length d is pile diameter i l is the unit length that was taken as 1 m for nondimensionalization c 1 c 2 and c 3 are dimensionless parameters that depend on the soil properties k ini is a parameter with the unit of pa 5 3 vertical horizontal combined loading according to the above analyses the average change rate of soil stiffness within the influencing domain k stiff varies along depth and is influenced by the vertical load the diameter and slenderness ratio of the pile and the friction angle of the soil therefore a unified formula of k stiff for both hc and ht loading conditions was established to fit the results in figs 13 17 with considerations of theses influencing factors 9 k s t i f f k 1 tanh z k 2 i l k 3 d i l z l k 4 v v u k 5 z 0 5 l where z represents the depths v and v u are respectively the applied and the ultimate vertical load on the pile d is the pile diameter i l is the unit length that was taken as 1 m for nondimensionalization k 1 to k 5 are dimensionless coefficients by adjusting the values of k 1 to k 5 the distributions of k stiff under vertical tension and compression in figs 13 17 could be correctly described it was found that k 2 and k 4 are only related to the vertical loading direction so that they can be taken as constants for compression and tension respectively meanwhile k 1 and k 3 are influenced by not only vertical loading direction but also the friction angle for simplification a unified dimensionless parameter k g was employed to describe the relationship between k 1 and k 3 besides a unified value of k 5 0 7 was used for both hc and ht conditions for good curve fittings the summary of the final equation of k stiff and the coefficients is shown as follows 10 k s t i f f k g tanh z 2 8 i l k g d i l z 0 07 l v v u 0 7 h c z 0 5 l k g tanh z 2 5 i l k g 0 9 d i l z 2 l v v u 0 7 h t z 0 5 l the curve fitting results of k stiff using eq 10 for the sand with a friction angle of 34 are shown in fig 18 the modifying factor b is an adjustment of the mapping relation of k vh and k stiff from micro soil element level to the macro p y curve level which was simplified to be linearly varied along depth 11 b b 1 b 2 z l z 0 5 l where b 1 and b 2 are coefficients that were determined to make the modified p y curves close to the p y curves gained from numerical simulations under vertical horizontal combined loading after adjusting the values of b 1 and b 2 for a better curve fitting these two coefficients were finally determined as constant for ht and hc conditions respectively as shown as follows 12 b 4 3 z l h c z 0 5 l 8 z l h t z 0 5 l the foregoing analyses focus on the vh loading condition where the vertical loading is prior to the horizontal loading vh loading condition is suitable for monopile foundation for offshore structures that bears vertical self weight prior to the horizontal wind and wave the formula of k vh for vh loading condition was assumed as follows 13 k v h b k s t i f f 1 however for the multiple foundations for offshore wind turbines such as tripod or jacket the horizontal wind acting on the superstructure is converted into a combination of vertical and horizontal load on every individual pile lu et al 2017 in such a situation the vertical and horizontal loads increase simultaneously which is more like an inclined loading condition during inclined loading the change of soil stiffness progressively develops along with the increasing vertical load component therefore the couple loading factor k vh for inclined loading conditions was modified with an additional term tanh k ini z d 0 0 8 a p u y that gradually increases from 0 to 1 with the increasing pile deflection y 14 k v h b k s t i f f tanh k i n i z d 0 0 8 a p u y 1 considering the above two loading conditions a unified form of k vh was given with an exponent a 15 k v h b k s t i f f tanh k i n i z i l 0 8 a p u y a 1 where a 0 represents vh loading and a 1 stands for inclined loading combining the above equations the new p y curve model is described as follow 16 p k v h a p u tanh k i n i z i l 0 8 a p u y 17 k v h 4 3 z l k g tanh z 2 8 i l k g d i l z 0 07 l v v u 0 7 tanh k i n i z i l 0 8 a p u y a 1 h c z 0 5 l 8 z l k g tanh z 2 5 i l k g 0 9 d i l z 2 l v v u 0 7 tanh k i n i z i l 0 8 a p u y a 1 h t z 0 5 l 1 z 0 5 l comparing with the current api p y model there is only one additional parameter k g in the new model to account for the influence of vertical load on the lateral behaviours of the pile under vertical horizontal combined loading condition 5 4 parameters determination first the numerical simulation of pure lateral loading condition was used to determine the basic parameters k ini c 1 c 2 and c 3 the values of basic parameters were adjusted to make the p y curves using eq 6 match well with those from numerical calculations the adjusted parameters for different friction angles are plotted in fig 19 a and b afterwards numerical simulations of pure vertical loading condition with different friction angles were employed to find appropriate values of k g to fit the distributions of k stiff under vertical tension and compression respectively the recommended values of k g for different friction angles are shown in fig 19 c 6 validation of the new p y model fig 3 has shown that the numerical analysis method predicted the soil pile responses in good agreements with the centrifuge model test results under vertical horizontal combined loading conditions this indicates that the numerical analysis results which provide various practical cases of the piles are effective to validate the new p y curve model by numerical analyses results in this section the numerical results with the sand dry density of 1 65 g cm3 and sand internal friction angle of 34 were taken as examples to verify the effectiveness of the new p y model and the parameters it is learnt in fig 19 that the dimensionless parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 are respectively 5 8 and 22 and k ini is 1 5 mpa the dimensionless parameters k g for hc and ht loading conditions are 0 18 and 0 14 respectively 6 1 pure lateral loading for pure lateral loading condition the basic parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 and k ini are introduced into the eqs 6 8 to get the modified p y curves the comparison of p y curves from eq 6 and numerical results are presented in fig 20 which are in good agreements then both new p y curves and api p y curves were employed in a back calculation program www yongtechnology com to back calculate the deflection and bending moment of the pile with different pile embedment lengths the results were compared with numerical results in fig 21 because the api p y curves overestimate the lateral modulus of soil it can be seen that the back calculated deflections of the pile using api p y model dash lines are smaller than numerical simulations while the back calculated bending moments are larger in the upper part and smaller in the lower part on the contrary the back calculated results using new p y curves solid lines agree well with numerical calculations which indicates the effectiveness of the new p y equations and adjusted basic parameters in simulating the horizontal responses of the pile under pure lateral loading 6 2 vh loading for vh loading conditions parameter k g was first put up into eq 10 to calculate the vertical distributions of k stiff and to compare with numerical results then eq 16 and 17 was employed with parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 k ini and k g to get the new p y curves under vertical horizontal loading condition the comparisons of new p y curves and fem p y curves are shown in fig 22 under ht and hc conditions the new p y curve model with the consideration of soil densification effect was used in the back calculation program to get the horizontal responses of the pile under vh loading conditions it should be noted that p δ effect induced by vertical load was also considered in this back calculation program by introducing the term of axial force into the differential equation of winkler beam therefore the back calculated results shown in fig 23 under vh loading condition are integrated reflections of both p δ effect and soil densification effect and exhibit good agreements with the fem results which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed p y curve model besides the back calculated results under h condition are also shown in fig 23 as benchmarks which did not consider effect of combination of vertical loading either p δ effect or soil densification effect it can be seen that the results of this case are far different from the fem results this demonstrated that the effect of the combination of vertical loading is fairly evident and should be considered it is known that the loading location above the ground influences the magnitude of p δ effect which changes the lateral response of piles accordingly the new p y model was used to calculate the pile responses under different loading locations and compared to fem results fig 24 because of the increase of loading location the additional bending moment due to p δ effect also increases with the same vertical load therefore the bending moment and lateral deflection of the pile increase with the increasing load location under hc loading condition fig 24 a b while those under ht condition decrease fig 24 c d besides the good agreement between back calculated results using the new p y model and fem indicates the effectiveness of the proposed p y model for different loading locations 7 conclusions 1 a finite element model was set up to simulate vertical horizontal combined loading pile in sand where the hypoplastic constitutive model was employed to capture the sand with its pressure dependency and density dependency the p δ effect induced by vertical load was taken into account by considering geometry nonlinearity in the numerical model the effectiveness of the proposed numerical model was confirmed by comparing the predictions with centrifuge model test observations 2 the proposed numerical method was applied to analyze the response of piles under with different horizontal vertical loading conditions the upper part of the soil was found dominated in soil pile interaction due to lateral loading which is defined as influencing domain the p y curve of the pile under vertical compression condition is steeper than the one under vertical tension condition 3 the change of soil stiffness was analysed by considering different influencing factors such as the magnitude of vertical load and the length and diameter of the pile it was found that the stiffness of soil in the influencing domain enhances under compression and reduces under tension that determines the change of the p y curve 4 a new p y curve model was proposed for the vertical horizontal combined loading conditions by characterizing the influence of vertical loads in the macro level with a function of the stiffness of soil in the micro level the suggested values of parameters are summarized for the convenience of engineering application through a few series of numerical analysis 5 the back calculated results using new p y curves fit better with the numerical analysis results under various loading conditions the new p y model were confirmed to be reasonable credit authorship contribution statement wenjun lu conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft

21943,traditional methods for evaluating the dynamic response of floating structures to irregular waves have been performed in either the frequency or the time domain whereas the computed response from the frequency domain method is merely the steady state response implementing the time domain method is usually time consuming in this article an efficient pole residue method operated in the laplace domain to compute transient response of floating structures to irregular waves is developed given that the frequency domain data has been obtained from running a standard hydrodynamic package the proposed method requires both the irregular waves and the transfer functions associated with the wave structure system be in their pole residue forms from those pole residue form of the response can be obtained by simple pole residue operations once the poles and residues of the response are known the response time history is readily obtained in the numerical studies this article considers a sdof model for the heave motion of a spar platform excited by regular and irregular waves respectively numerical studies demonstrated that the proposed method is more efficient and accurate than the traditional time domain method keywords floating structures transient response laplace domain poles residues 1 introduction the interaction between ocean waves and oscillating systems such as ships and ocean platforms is a subject of interest in ocean engineering traditionally computing dynamic response of such structures to waves has been often carried out in the frequency domain by running standard hydrodynamic packages e g wamit 2006 these packages were developed based on a potential theory approach newman 1977 faltinsen 1990 specifically on computing the frequency response function of the structure motion to wave elevation the motion response for each frequency has been obtained by solving a set of simultaneous linear equations with constant coefficients while it is very efficient in computational time a major limitation of the frequency domain approach is that the computed response is merely the steady state response without the transient part this paper develops a new approach for computing the transient motion response of floating structures to arbitrary irregular waves based on the frequency domain results which have been obtained from using a frequency domain hydrodynamic package in mathematics when the transient response is desired the motion analysis for floating structures should be conducted in the time domain however in practice modified frequency domain approaches have also been developed to compute the transient response clough and penzien 2003 a classical time domain method to obtain the motion of floating structures in waves has been based on the cummins equation cummins 1962 in which a convolution term is included to represent the component of the radiation forces associated with fluid memory effects whereas the convolution kernel function can be calculated directly from a time dependent green function stoker 1958 a more popular approach to calculate this kernel function is by taking fourier transform of the frequency domain solutions ogilvie 1964 unfortunately even after the convolution kernel function has been obtained implementing the convolution term directly is not convenient for analysis fossen 2002 perez 2002 also time domain simulations with the convolution integrals are costly in computational time depending on the time step simulation length and degrees of freedom of the model holappa and falzarano 1998 kashiwagi 2004 to improve the efficiency of the dynamic analysis of floating structures various methods have been developed by replacing the convolution integral in the cummins equation with state space formulations schmiechen 1973 jefferys 1984 yu and falnes 1995 kristiansen et al 2005 perez and fossen 2006 in addition other solution approaches including the singularity expansion method meylan and tomic 2012 meylan and fitzgerald 2018 laplace transform method ursell 1964 meylan 2014 wolgamot et al 2017 and generalized eigenfunction method fitzgerald and meylan 2011 meylan and fitzgerald 2014 have also been proposed to the time dependent problems of hydrodynamic systems based on the frequency domain data available from using a standard hydrodynamic package this paper proposes a novel pole residue approach operated in the complex plane laplace domain to compute the transient response of floating structures under arbitrary irregular waves an irregular wave signal can be expressed in terms of its poles and residues so are transfer functions associated with the wave structure system for structural vibration analysis hu et al 2016 pointed out that 1 the poles and residues of the output can be obtained from those of the input and system transfer functions by simple algebraic operation and 2 once the output poles and residues are available the corresponding time history can be readily obtained in the present study the same concept of the pole residue method is utilized and the key of the proposed method lies in how to obtain the poles and residues of the system transfer functions of floating structures to obtain the pole residue forms of system transfer functions is actually a system identification task based on the frequency domain data a similar task is also required in a classical state space method to determine rational frequency response functions perez and fossen 2011 however when a frequency domain approach is employed in a classical state space method it automatically imposes the periodic assumption for both the input and the output due to the usage of fourier transforms in contrast the proposed pole residue method does not impose the unwanted periodic feature this paper will provide two numerical examples to verify the correctness and demonstrate the effectiveness as well of the newly developed method to illustrate the detailed procedure of the new method on computing transient motion response the first numerical example considers a single degree of freedom sdof model of a spar platform to regular waves the second numerical example extends the first example on the wave condition from regular waves to irregular waves the investigation includes the comparison between the proposed method and a traditional time domain method on both accuracy and computational efficiency 2 preliminaries this section reviews the background material of importance to this article including system functions of a linear system signal decomposition using complex exponential functions and the pole residue form in the laplace domain it also intends to acquaint the reader with the notation convention to be used throughout this paper functions depending on time t are in lower cases their laplace transforms on s denoted by the same letters with a tilde and their fourier transforms on ω denoted by the same capital letters for example y s and y ω denote the laplace transform and fourier transform of y t respectively 2 1 system functions of a linear system commonly used system functions include impulse response function irf frequency response function frf and transfer function tf they characterize the relationship between the response output and the excitation input of a linear time invariant system in the time domain frequency domain and laplace domain respectively let u t and y t denote the input and the output signals for a linear system respectively they are related as a convolution integral in the time domain 1 y t h t τ u τ d τ where h t is the impulse response function in the frequency domain the counterpart of eq 1 is 2 y ω h ω u ω where h ω is the frequency response function which is the fourier transform ft of h t 3 h ω f h t h t e i ω t d t where f denotes the fourier transform operator and i 1 is the imaginary number thus h t is the inverse fourier transform ift of h ω namely 4 h t f 1 h ω 1 2 π h ω e i ω t d ω if the system is causal that is h t 0 for t 0 and the input signal starts at t 0 one writes the input output relationship in the laplace domain as 5 y s h s u s where h s is the transfer function which is the laplace transform lt of h t 6 h s l h t 0 h t e s t d t where l denotes the laplace transform operator note that the frf h ω can be obtained from the tf h s by substituting s i ω namely 7 h ω h i ω 2 2 signal decomposition using complex exponential functions an arbitrary signal y t can always be approximated as the sum of a finite number of complex exponential components prony 1795 8 y t ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ exp λ ℓ t 0 t t where n ℓ number of components α ℓ and λ ℓ are constant coefficients since y t is a real valued signal λ ℓ must either be real numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs the coefficients α ℓ corresponding to complex numbers λ ℓ must also appear in complex conjugate pairs when a signal y t is sampled at equally spaced times the prony ss method has been proposed to perform the decomposition of eq 8 hu et al 2013 in the prony ss method a first order matrix difference equation a state space model is used to replace a high order difference equation used in prony s method besides the advantage that it avoids the ill conditioned problem of solving the roots of a high order polynomial trefethen and david 1997 required in prony s method the prony ss method also has better conditioning stability and accuracy over prony s method 2 3 pole residue form in the laplace domain since functions α e λ t and α s λ form a laplace transform pair from eq 8 one shows 9 y s ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ s λ ℓ the expression of eq 9 in the laplace domain is often called a partial fraction form or pole residue form with poles λ ℓ and the corresponding residues α ℓ if a pole residue form such as eq 9 is given originally the inverse laplace transform ilt of eq 9 will result in eq 8 clearly once poles and residues of a function are known one can present this function in both the laplace and time domains 3 motion analysis in the frequency and time domains for simplicity the following presentation will focus on a sdof system however the same principle and approach can be applied to the full 6 dof system for a rigid floating structure as well 3 1 motion analysis in the frequency domain motion analysis of floating structures has often been carried out in the frequency domain with the governing motion equation ogilvie 1964 10 ω 2 m a ω x ω i ω b ω x ω c x ω h f η ω η ω where x ω is the response in the frequency domain m is the body mass and c is the linearized hydrostatic restoring force coefficient a ω and b ω are the frequency dependent added mass and damping respectively h f η ω is the elevation to force frf and η ω is the wave elevation in the frequency domain the hydrodynamic coefficients a ω and b ω as well as h f η ω can be computed from linear frequency potential theory newman 1977 from eq 10 one writes 11 x ω h x f ω h f η ω η ω where h x f ω is the force to motion frf 12 h x f ω ω 2 m a ω i ω b ω c 1 in this study three frfs for the linear relationships among wave elevation wave force and motion response are employed the elevation to force frf h f η ω the force to motion frf h x f ω and the elevation to motion frf h x η ω in accordance with the operations in the frequency domain one writes h x η ω h x f ω h f η ω 3 2 motion analysis in the time domain traditionally the motion analysis for floating structures must be conducted in the time domain if the transient response is desired having assumed that the system is linear the equation of motion of any rigid floating structure in the time domain may be written in a form which was proposed by cummins known as the c u m m i n s e q u a t i o n cummins 1962 considering the sdof motion of a floating structure in waves with zero forward speed the motion response x t of the floating structure to the force f t caused by the wave elevation η t is expressed as 13 m a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ c x t f t where 14 f t h f η t τ η τ d τ in eq 13 a is a constant added mass the convolution term on the left hand side captures the effect that the changes in momentum of the fluid at a particular time affect the motion at subsequent times which is known as the fluid effect the kernel of the convolution term k t is the so called retardation function which depends only on the geometry of the floating structure in case of zero forward speed cummins 1962 in eq 14 it shows that the wave force of a floating structure subjected to wave elevation η t is computed through h f η t which is the irf from η t to f t referring to eq 4 h x f t is the inverse fourier transform of h x f ω as the force to motion system is causal cummins 1962 its irf h x f t 0 for t 0 however the elevation to force system has been known to be not causal thus its irf h f η t 0 for t 0 the non causality of the elevation to force system is related to the fact that the chosen input is not the cause of the output falnes 1995 the real cause of the output as well as of the input may be a distant storm or a wavemaker in the laboratory the non causality may be partly attributed to the fact that the incident wave elevation may hit the body and exert a wave force before the elevation could reach the origin point in the body fixed coordinate system tick 1959 it was presented in ogilvie 1964 that a ω and b ω are related to k t as 15 a ω a 1 ω 0 k t sin ω t d t and 16 b ω 0 k t cos ω t d t if a ω and b ω are computed first one can obtain a and k t by 17 a lim ω a ω a and 18 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω numerically when all parameters in eq 13 were known the equation of motion for a floating structure could be solved by using the fourth order runge kutta method kara 2010 4 motion analysis in the laplace domain in this section the transient response of a floating structure under irregular wave elevation will be derived through pole residue operations in view of the similarity between eqs 2 and 5 one expects an equation in the laplace domain which ought to be in a form similar to eq 11 in the frequency domain 4 1 non causal elevation to force system as the elevation to force system is non causal it has been proposed to introduce a causalizing time t c such that h f η t is zero or negligible for t t c yu and falnes 1995 imposing a time shift of t c to h f η t one writes 19 h f η c t h f η t t c where the superscript c represents a quantity associated with a causalized system as h f η c t 0 for t 0 after introducing the causalizing time t c if the input elevation η t began at t 0 that is η t 0 for t 0 both the wave force f t and motion response x t would begin at t t c 4 2 causal force to response system it is useful to introduce the time shifting force function f c t f t t c and response function x c t x t t c so that f c t and x c t would start at t 0 referring to eqs 13 and 14 and realizing that the force to response system is causal one thus writes 20 m a x c t 0 t k t τ x c τ d τ c x c t f c t t 0 where 21 f c t 0 t h f η c t τ η τ d τ under the assumption that the system is initially at rest that is x c 0 0 and x c 0 0 conducting the laplace transform of eqs 20 and 21 yields 22 m a s 2 x c s k s s x c s c x c s f c s and 23 f c s h f η c s η s from eq 22 one writes 24 x c s h x f s f c s where 25 h x f s m a s 2 k s s c 1 combining eqs 23 and 24 gives 26 x c s h x f s h f η c s η s notice the similarity between eqs 11 and 26 but eq 26 must be operated in a causalized system the proposed procedure to compute the response in the laplace domain is schematically shown in fig 1 it involves four steps 1 taking the laplace transform of η t to get η s 2 computing x c s after h f η c s and h x f s have been derived see eq 26 3 obtaining the corresponding x c t by performing the inverse laplace transform of x c s and 4 getting the desired x t from x c t with a time shift of t c the key to the success of implementing the proposed method depends on being able to efficiently compute the pole residue form of system transfer functions h f η c s and h x f s then those of x c s 4 3 pole residue forms of system transfer functions given that discretized frequency dependent hydrodynamic functions a ω n b ω n h f η ω n and h x η ω n have been obtained from running a standard hydrodynamic software where ω n n δ ω n 1 2 n efficient ways for calculating the system transfer functions h f η c s and h x f s in their pole residue forms are developed in this section 4 3 1 pole residue form of h f η c s shown in fig 2 is the block diagram for obtaining the pole residue form of h f η c s from a given discretized h f η ω n four sequential steps are implemented as follows 1 computing the non causal irf h f η

obtaining the pole residue form of h x f s from a given b ω n is shown in fig 3 it involves two stages at the end of the first stage an analytical expression for h x f s is obtained but it is not in its pole residue form the task of the second stage is to make h x f s in a pole residue form the first stage consists of four steps as follows 1 computing k t from b ω see eq 18 2 decomposing k t by using the prony ss method 29 k t r 1 n r φ r e ξ r t 3 taking the laplace transform of eq 29 to obtain the pole residue form of k s 30 k s r 1 n r φ r s ξ r and 4 getting the transfer function h x f s

β v e μ v t and 8 taking the laplace transform of eq 32 to obtain the pole residue form of h x f s as 33 h x f s v 1 n v β v s μ v notice that two different forms of h x f ω have been given in eqs 12 and 31 respectively a few comments may help to clarify their differences and purposes while discrete a ω n and b ω n have been initially obtained from running a standard hydrodynamic software the h x f ω n in eq 12 would possess the same frequency resolution in contrast eq 31 is a continuous function of ω it will be explained further in the numerical studies why eq 31 is preferred over eq 12 in the implementation of the proposed method 4 4 pole residue operations on computing response to implement eq 26 on computing x c s an efficient pole residue method is presented in this section in brief the proposed method is to compute the poles and residues of x c s from those of h x f s h f η c s and η s once the pole residue form of x c s is obtained the corresponding x c t is readily available 4 4 1 pole residue operations on computing f c s applying the prony ss method one can decompose η t into a complex exponential form as eq 8 then η s is expressed as 34 η s ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ s λ ℓ substituting eqs 34 and 28 into in eq 23 leads to 35 f c s q 1 n q ε q s σ q ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ s λ ℓ as the common denominator in eq 35 is q 1 n q s σ q ℓ 1 n ℓ s λ ℓ one hence can write eq 35 in a pole residue form 36 f c s m 1 n m ζ m s θ m it is evident that there are total n m n ℓ n q causalized wave force poles θ m originating from the n ℓ elevation excitation poles and n q causalized elevation to force system poles label the first n ℓ poles as the elevation excitation poles i e θ m λ m m 1 n ℓ the last n q poles as the causalized elevation to force system poles i e θ m n ℓ σ m m 1 n q for each causalized wave force pole θ m the corresponding residue can be computed by 37 ζ m lim s θ m s θ m f c s lim s θ m s θ m h f η c s η s thus from eq 37 the residues corresponding to the first n ℓ causalized wave force poles i e at the elevation excitation poles are 38 ζ m lim s θ m s θ m h f η c s ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ s λ ℓ α m h f η c λ m m 1 n ℓ and the residues corresponding to the last n q causalized wave force poles i e at the causalized elevation to force system poles are 39 ζ m n ℓ lim s θ m n ℓ s θ m q 1 n q ε q s σ q η s ε m η σ m m 1 n q from eq 36 one can easily get the wave force time history 40 f t

m ζ m s θ m it follows that eq 41 can be written in the pole residue form as 42 x c s p 1 n p γ p s ν p there are total n p n m n v causalized response poles ν p including n m force poles and n v force to motion system poles as stated previously those n m force poles are originated from the n ℓ elevation poles and n q causalized elevation to force system poles following the same procedure on computing the residues of force one can obtain the residue corresponding to each causalized response pole ν p the residues corresponding to the first n m force poles are 43 γ p ζ p h x f θ p p 1 n m and those corresponding to the last n v force to response system poles are 44 γ p n m β p f c μ p p 1 n v once all the poles and residues of causalized response are computed one can easily obtain the resulting motion response under zero initial conditions to be 45 x t p 1 n ℓ n q n v γ p e ν p t t c u t t c note that the summation of the first n ℓ terms in eq 45 is related to the n ℓ incident wave elevation poles for convenience it is called the steady state response the summation of the remaining n q n v terms in eq 45 is called the transient response when the wave elevation is periodic the steady state response is equivalent to the response obtained by the frequency domain approach hu and gao 2017 5 numerical studies two numerical examples are presented in this article for illustrating the detailed numerical operations of the proposed method on computing the transient response of a floating structure considered first is a sdof model of a spar platform in heave under regular wave in the second example the same system to an irregular wave will be investigated throughout the numerical examples the system of units is the mks meter kilogram second system based on measuring lengths in meters mass in kilograms and time in seconds for briefness explicit units for quantities are omitted in the following presentation 5 1 example 1 sdof heaving spar model to regular wave a sdof heaving spar model under regular wave is chosen for the first example to illustrate the proposed procedure shown in fig 1 the model of the spar platform is one of the examples from the commercial software sesam dnv 2013 developed by det norske veritas norway but only the heave motion is considered here the spar has a diameter of 37 18 a draft of 198 12 and a mass of 22 05427 1 0 7 with the coordinates of the center of gravity cog in global coordinate system of 0 0 102 4 where the x y plane coincides with the still water surface and z axis is vertical upward shown in fig 4 is the geometry of the submerged spar platform modeled in sesam considered first is a regular wave η t cos 0 27 t i e η t 1 2 e i 0 27 t e i 0 27 t thus the poles and residues of this regular elevation are λ 1 λ 2 0 0 0 27 i and α 1 α 2 0 5 0 0 i respectively 5 1 1 pole residue form of h f η c s a discretized h f η ω n ranged from 0 03 to 3 12 with the frequency resolution δ ω 0 03 for this sdof model has been obtained from running sesam the corresponding irf h f η t j with δ t 0 01 is obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of h f η ω n a direct method of implementing the inverse fourier transform has been used 46 h f η t j 1 π n 1 104 re h f η ω n cos ω n t j im h f η ω n sin ω n t j δ ω where re and im are the real part and imaginary part ω n n δ ω t j j δ t j 8000 8000 plotted in fig 5 is the obtained irf h f η t j by observation it is proper to choose the causalizing time t c 30 also plotted is the causalized irf h f η c t namely h f η t 30 using the prony ss method one obtains that h f η c t could be approximated as the sum of eight complex exponential terms i e eight pole residue terms the numerical values of the eight poles σ q and residues ε q are listed in table 1 in turn the corresponding h f η c s can be written in the form of eq 28 with n q 8 because h f η s e s t c h f η c s one writes 47 h f η ω h f η i ω e i ω t c q 1 n q ε q i ω σ q for ensuring the numerical correctness of the obtained h f η s eq 47 is compared against the h f η ω n originally computed from sesam as shown in fig 6 they agree well with each other 5 1 2 pole residue form of h x f s computed from sesam also includes the discrete added mass a ω n and damping b ω n shown in fig 7 they possess the same frequency range and resolution as h f η ω n the numerical procedure to compute a pole residue form of h x f s from a given b ω n has been summarized in fig 3 first the retardation function k t can be computed from b ω in accordance with eq 18 plotted in fig 8 is the computed k t for 80 s conducting the prony ss method on this k t suggests that it can properly be decomposed into six complex componential terms with the values ξ r 0 0818 0 1074 i 0 1097 0 2103 i 0 1218 0 3309 i and the corresponding φ r 0 0189 4 2385 i 1 0 3 6 7161 2 7002 i 1 0 3 1 4860 1 3156 i 1 0 3 respectively also plotted in fig 8 is the reconstructed k t based on those six complex componential terms clearly there is no noticeable difference between the original and reconstructed retardation functions after k s being formulated with six pole residue terms a continuous version of h x f ω can be obtained following eq 31 with n r 6 the corresponding irf h x f t then is obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of h x f ω in the numerical implementation a discrete h x f ω n with the frequency resolution δ ω 0 0001 is generated from the continuous h x f ω and then inverse fast fourier transform ifft algorithm is called to obtain h x f t k as conducting the fourier analysis to get h x f t k automatically imposes the periodic feature of the obtained signal it is necessary to have the obtained h x f t k be long enough so that it would diminish to zero as shown in fig 9 h x f t takes a long time to die out this explains why it is not proper to compute h x f t k directly from the h x f ω n obtained from sesam because the frequency resolution of the h x f ω n from sesam is not small enough carrying out the prony ss method one reveals that h x f t can be approximated nicely by only two pole residue terms the numerical values μ v and the corresponding β v are listed in table 1 besides the discrete irf h x f t k obtained from ifft the reconstructed h x f t with two pole residue terms is also plotted in fig 9 clearly they are in excellent agreement next h x f s can be obtained by following eq 33 with n v 2 for confirming the correctness of the obtained h x f s one gets the corresponding h x f ω as 48 h x f ω h x f i ω v 1 2 β v i ω μ v and compares it to the discrete h x f ω n from sesam as shown in fig 10 they are in excellent agreement at the discrete frequencies 5 1 3 results of motion response inherited directly from the two elevation poles and eight causalized elevation to force system poles the function f c s should have ten poles the corresponding residues are computed from eqs 38 and 39 the numerical results for these ten poles residues are listed in table 2 shown in fig 11 is the continuous force time history f t computed by the pole residue form in eq 40 with n m 10 along with the counterpart by a time domain convolution integral method indeed they are in excellent agreement based on the poles and residues of f c s and those of h x f s the residues of x c s are computed from eqs 43 and 44 tabulated in table 2 are the twelve poles residues of x c s then the corresponding x t is computed by eq 45 with n p 12 plotted in fig 12 is the obtained x t together with the motion response computed by a time domain method clearly there is no noticeable difference between these two motion response signals the total motion response x t in fig 12 should be the sum of the transient response x t t and the steady state response x s t it is of interest to plot x t t and x s t separately as shown in fig 13 two physical insights are gained 1 x t t will take a long time about 1 0 5 seconds to die out and 2 x t t is larger than x s t for roughly the first 1 0 3 seconds the long lasting time of x t t is attributed to the fact that the real part of the poles of h x f s is 0 0002 see table 1 which suggests that the decay of x t t be extremely slow 5 2 example 2 sdof heaving spar model to irregular wave example 2 conducts a similar study as example 1 but changes the wave condition from regular waves to irregular waves in the following numerical study an irregular wave elevation consisting of five sinusoidal components is chosen goda 2010 49 η t w 1 5 h w 2 sin 2 π t w t θ w where h w t w and θ w are listed in table 3 a sketch of eq 49 is shown in fig 14 given the values in table 3 one can easily obtain the corresponding five conjugate pairs of poles residues listed in table 4 given the ten poles residues of η s and the ten poles residues associated with system transfer functions h f η c s and h x f s which have already obtained see table 1 in example 1 one can compute the twenty poles residues of x c s see table 5 from these twenty poles residues one then obtains x c t and x t the resulting x t from the proposed method along with the counterpart computed by a time domain method is plotted in fig 15 the two solutions agree well with each other from table 5 one notices that the residues at system poles are much larger than those at excitation poles in this case the transient response is dominant over the steady state response as shown in 16 although the time domain solution has been used to verify the correctness of the newly developed laplace domain method the accuracy of the new method must be higher than that of any time domain method in general the accuracy of the solution from a time domain method improves when the chosen δ t becomes smaller in contrast the solution of the proposed method is continuous in time the motion response discrepancy between the proposed method and a time domain method with δ t 0 01 δ t 0 5 and δ t 2 is shown in fig 17 it reveals that the discrepancy between the two methods decreases as δ t becomes smaller in other words when δ t is decreasing the computed response by the time domain method improves and is getting closer to that by the proposed method to get a sense of the computational efficiency of the proposed method against the time domain method the computational time required for the current example is investigated for the time domain method the computational time has been counted as the cpu time for numerically solving eq 13 when all parameters in eq 13 are known the computational time for the proposed time has been counted based on the cpu time after the poles and residues of the wave elevation and system transfer functions have been obtained for a total duration of 150 s with different choices of δ t table 6 lists the average cpu time of 10 individual runs while carrying out the proposed method and the time domain method respectively by a laptop computer the computational time for the time domain method significantly increases when the number of time steps n increases in contrast the computational time for the proposed method has little change demonstrating that the proposed method becomes more efficient when n increases 6 concluding remarks for computing the transient response of a floating structure to irregular waves this article developed an efficient pole residue method operated in the laplace domain the proposed method required both the elevation to force and force to motion system transfer functions be in their pole residue forms they were obtained based on the frequency domain data that was the output from running sesam the process of converting the frequency domain data to the desired transfer functions involved the usage of fourier transform and the complex exponential signal decomposition as the elevation to force system was not causal a causalization procedure for dealing this system was developed the correctness of the proposed method was verified through two numerical examples by comparing the motion responses obtained from the proposed method to those obtained by using a time domain method numerical studies demonstrated that the proposed method was more

21943,traditional methods for evaluating the dynamic response of floating structures to irregular waves have been performed in either the frequency or the time domain whereas the computed response from the frequency domain method is merely the steady state response implementing the time domain method is usually time consuming in this article an efficient pole residue method operated in the laplace domain to compute transient response of floating structures to irregular waves is developed given that the frequency domain data has been obtained from running a standard hydrodynamic package the proposed method requires both the irregular waves and the transfer functions associated with the wave structure system be in their pole residue forms from those pole residue form of the response can be obtained by simple pole residue operations once the poles and residues of the response are known the response time history is readily obtained in the numerical studies this article considers a sdof model for the heave motion of a spar platform excited by regular and irregular waves respectively numerical studies demonstrated that the proposed method is more efficient and accurate than the traditional time domain method keywords floating structures transient response laplace domain poles residues 1 introduction the interaction between ocean waves and oscillating systems such as ships and ocean platforms is a subject of interest in ocean engineering traditionally computing dynamic response of such structures to waves has been often carried out in the frequency domain by running standard hydrodynamic packages e g wamit 2006 these packages were developed based on a potential theory approach newman 1977 faltinsen 1990 specifically on computing the frequency response function of the structure motion to wave elevation the motion response for each frequency has been obtained by solving a set of simultaneous linear equations with constant coefficients while it is very efficient in computational time a major limitation of the frequency domain approach is that the computed response is merely the steady state response without the transient part this paper develops a new approach for computing the transient motion response of floating structures to arbitrary irregular waves based on the frequency domain results which have been obtained from using a frequency domain hydrodynamic package in mathematics when the transient response is desired the motion analysis for floating structures should be conducted in the time domain however in practice modified frequency domain approaches have also been developed to compute the transient response clough and penzien 2003 a classical time domain method to obtain the motion of floating structures in waves has been based on the cummins equation cummins 1962 in which a convolution term is included to represent the component of the radiation forces associated with fluid memory effects whereas the convolution kernel function can be calculated directly from a time dependent green function stoker 1958 a more popular approach to calculate this kernel function is by taking fourier transform of the frequency domain solutions ogilvie 1964 unfortunately even after the convolution kernel function has been obtained implementing the convolution term directly is not convenient for analysis fossen 2002 perez 2002 also time domain simulations with the convolution integrals are costly in computational time depending on the time step simulation length and degrees of freedom of the model holappa and falzarano 1998 kashiwagi 2004 to improve the efficiency of the dynamic analysis of floating structures various methods have been developed by replacing the convolution integral in the cummins equation with state space formulations schmiechen 1973 jefferys 1984 yu and falnes 1995 kristiansen et al 2005 perez and fossen 2006 in addition other solution approaches including the singularity expansion method meylan and tomic 2012 meylan and fitzgerald 2018 laplace transform method ursell 1964 meylan 2014 wolgamot et al 2017 and generalized eigenfunction method fitzgerald and meylan 2011 meylan and fitzgerald 2014 have also been proposed to the time dependent problems of hydrodynamic systems based on the frequency domain data available from using a standard hydrodynamic package this paper proposes a novel pole residue approach operated in the complex plane laplace domain to compute the transient response of floating structures under arbitrary irregular waves an irregular wave signal can be expressed in terms of its poles and residues so are transfer functions associated with the wave structure system for structural vibration analysis hu et al 2016 pointed out that 1 the poles and residues of the output can be obtained from those of the input and system transfer functions by simple algebraic operation and 2 once the output poles and residues are available the corresponding time history can be readily obtained in the present study the same concept of the pole residue method is utilized and the key of the proposed method lies in how to obtain the poles and residues of the system transfer functions of floating structures to obtain the pole residue forms of system transfer functions is actually a system identification task based on the frequency domain data a similar task is also required in a classical state space method to determine rational frequency response functions perez and fossen 2011 however when a frequency domain approach is employed in a classical state space method it automatically imposes the periodic assumption for both the input and the output due to the usage of fourier transforms in contrast the proposed pole residue method does not impose the unwanted periodic feature this paper will provide two numerical examples to verify the correctness and demonstrate the effectiveness as well of the newly developed method to illustrate the detailed procedure of the new method on computing transient motion response the first numerical example considers a single degree of freedom sdof model of a spar platform to regular waves the second numerical example extends the first example on the wave condition from regular waves to irregular waves the investigation includes the comparison between the proposed method and a traditional time domain method on both accuracy and computational efficiency 2 preliminaries this section reviews the background material of importance to this article including system functions of a linear system signal decomposition using complex exponential functions and the pole residue form in the laplace domain it also intends to acquaint the reader with the notation convention to be used throughout this paper functions depending on time t are in lower cases their laplace transforms on s denoted by the same letters with a tilde and their fourier transforms on ω denoted by the same capital letters for example y s and y ω denote the laplace transform and fourier transform of y t respectively 2 1 system functions of a linear system commonly used system functions include impulse response function irf frequency response function frf and transfer function tf they characterize the relationship between the response output and the excitation input of a linear time invariant system in the time domain frequency domain and laplace domain respectively let u t and y t denote the input and the output signals for a linear system respectively they are related as a convolution integral in the time domain 1 y t h t τ u τ d τ where h t is the impulse response function in the frequency domain the counterpart of eq 1 is 2 y ω h ω u ω where h ω is the frequency response function which is the fourier transform ft of h t 3 h ω f h t h t e i ω t d t where f denotes the fourier transform operator and i 1 is the imaginary number thus h t is the inverse fourier transform ift of h ω namely 4 h t f 1 h ω 1 2 π h ω e i ω t d ω if the system is causal that is h t 0 for t 0 and the input signal starts at t 0 one writes the input output relationship in the laplace domain as 5 y s h s u s where h s is the transfer function which is the laplace transform lt of h t 6 h s l h t 0 h t e s t d t where l denotes the laplace transform operator note that the frf h ω can be obtained from the tf h s by substituting s i ω namely 7 h ω h i ω 2 2 signal decomposition using complex exponential functions an arbitrary signal y t can always be approximated as the sum of a finite number of complex exponential components prony 1795 8 y t ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ exp λ ℓ t 0 t t where n ℓ number of components α ℓ and λ ℓ are constant coefficients since y t is a real valued signal λ ℓ must either be real numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs the coefficients α ℓ corresponding to complex numbers λ ℓ must also appear in complex conjugate pairs when a signal y t is sampled at equally spaced times the prony ss method has been proposed to perform the decomposition of eq 8 hu et al 2013 in the prony ss method a first order matrix difference equation a state space model is used to replace a high order difference equation used in prony s method besides the advantage that it avoids the ill conditioned problem of solving the roots of a high order polynomial trefethen and david 1997 required in prony s method the prony ss method also has better conditioning stability and accuracy over prony s method 2 3 pole residue form in the laplace domain since functions α e λ t and α s λ form a laplace transform pair from eq 8 one shows 9 y s ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ s λ ℓ the expression of eq 9 in the laplace domain is often called a partial fraction form or pole residue form with poles λ ℓ and the corresponding residues α ℓ if a pole residue form such as eq 9 is given originally the inverse laplace transform ilt of eq 9 will result in eq 8 clearly once poles and residues of a function are known one can present this function in both the laplace and time domains 3 motion analysis in the frequency and time domains for simplicity the following presentation will focus on a sdof system however the same principle and approach can be applied to the full 6 dof system for a rigid floating structure as well 3 1 motion analysis in the frequency domain motion analysis of floating structures has often been carried out in the frequency domain with the governing motion equation ogilvie 1964 10 ω 2 m a ω x ω i ω b ω x ω c x ω h f η ω η ω where x ω is the response in the frequency domain m is the body mass and c is the linearized hydrostatic restoring force coefficient a ω and b ω are the frequency dependent added mass and damping respectively h f η ω is the elevation to force frf and η ω is the wave elevation in the frequency domain the hydrodynamic coefficients a ω and b ω as well as h f η ω can be computed from linear frequency potential theory newman 1977 from eq 10 one writes 11 x ω h x f ω h f η ω η ω where h x f ω is the force to motion frf 12 h x f ω ω 2 m a ω i ω b ω c 1 in this study three frfs for the linear relationships among wave elevation wave force and motion response are employed the elevation to force frf h f η ω the force to motion frf h x f ω and the elevation to motion frf h x η ω in accordance with the operations in the frequency domain one writes h x η ω h x f ω h f η ω 3 2 motion analysis in the time domain traditionally the motion analysis for floating structures must be conducted in the time domain if the transient response is desired having assumed that the system is linear the equation of motion of any rigid floating structure in the time domain may be written in a form which was proposed by cummins known as the c u m m i n s e q u a t i o n cummins 1962 considering the sdof motion of a floating structure in waves with zero forward speed the motion response x t of the floating structure to the force f t caused by the wave elevation η t is expressed as 13 m a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ c x t f t where 14 f t h f η t τ η τ d τ in eq 13 a is a constant added mass the convolution term on the left hand side captures the effect that the changes in momentum of the fluid at a particular time affect the motion at subsequent times which is known as the fluid effect the kernel of the convolution term k t is the so called retardation function which depends only on the geometry of the floating structure in case of zero forward speed cummins 1962 in eq 14 it shows that the wave force of a floating structure subjected to wave elevation η t is computed through h f η t which is the irf from η t to f t referring to eq 4 h x f t is the inverse fourier transform of h x f ω as the force to motion system is causal cummins 1962 its irf h x f t 0 for t 0 however the elevation to force system has been known to be not causal thus its irf h f η t 0 for t 0 the non causality of the elevation to force system is related to the fact that the chosen input is not the cause of the output falnes 1995 the real cause of the output as well as of the input may be a distant storm or a wavemaker in the laboratory the non causality may be partly attributed to the fact that the incident wave elevation may hit the body and exert a wave force before the elevation could reach the origin point in the body fixed coordinate system tick 1959 it was presented in ogilvie 1964 that a ω and b ω are related to k t as 15 a ω a 1 ω 0 k t sin ω t d t and 16 b ω 0 k t cos ω t d t if a ω and b ω are computed first one can obtain a and k t by 17 a lim ω a ω a and 18 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω numerically when all parameters in eq 13 were known the equation of motion for a floating structure could be solved by using the fourth order runge kutta method kara 2010 4 motion analysis in the laplace domain in this section the transient response of a floating structure under irregular wave elevation will be derived through pole residue operations in view of the similarity between eqs 2 and 5 one expects an equation in the laplace domain which ought to be in a form similar to eq 11 in the frequency domain 4 1 non causal elevation to force system as the elevation to force system is non causal it has been proposed to introduce a causalizing time t c such that h f η t is zero or negligible for t t c yu and falnes 1995 imposing a time shift of t c to h f η t one writes 19 h f η c t h f η t t c where the superscript c represents a quantity associated with a causalized system as h f η c t 0 for t 0 after introducing the causalizing time t c if the input elevation η t began at t 0 that is η t 0 for t 0 both the wave force f t and motion response x t would begin at t t c 4 2 causal force to response system it is useful to introduce the time shifting force function f c t f t t c and response function x c t x t t c so that f c t and x c t would start at t 0 referring to eqs 13 and 14 and realizing that the force to response system is causal one thus writes 20 m a x c t 0 t k t τ x c τ d τ c x c t f c t t 0 where 21 f c t 0 t h f η c t τ η τ d τ under the assumption that the system is initially at rest that is x c 0 0 and x c 0 0 conducting the laplace transform of eqs 20 and 21 yields 22 m a s 2 x c s k s s x c s c x c s f c s and 23 f c s h f η c s η s from eq 22 one writes 24 x c s h x f s f c s where 25 h x f s m a s 2 k s s c 1 combining eqs 23 and 24 gives 26 x c s h x f s h f η c s η s notice the similarity between eqs 11 and 26 but eq 26 must be operated in a causalized system the proposed procedure to compute the response in the laplace domain is schematically shown in fig 1 it involves four steps 1 taking the laplace transform of η t to get η s 2 computing x c s after h f η c s and h x f s have been derived see eq 26 3 obtaining the corresponding x c t by performing the inverse laplace transform of x c s and 4 getting the desired x t from x c t with a time shift of t c the key to the success of implementing the proposed method depends on being able to efficiently compute the pole residue form of system transfer functions h f η c s and h x f s then those of x c s 4 3 pole residue forms of system transfer functions given that discretized frequency dependent hydrodynamic functions a ω n b ω n h f η ω n and h x η ω n have been obtained from running a standard hydrodynamic software where ω n n δ ω n 1 2 n efficient ways for calculating the system transfer functions h f η c s and h x f s in their pole residue forms are developed in this section 4 3 1 pole residue form of h f η c s shown in fig 2 is the block diagram for obtaining the pole residue form of h f η c s from a given discretized h f η ω n four sequential steps are implemented as follows 1 computing the non causal irf h f η t by taking the inverse fourier transform of h f η ω 2 getting the causalized irf h f η c t by shifting time t c of h f η t see eq 19 3 decomposing h f η c t by using the prony ss method 27 h f η c t q 1 n q ε q e σ q t and 4 taking the laplace transform of eq 27 to obtain the pole residue form of h f η c s 28 h f η c s q 1 n q ε q s σ q 4 3 2 pole residue form of h x f s the block diagram for obtaining the pole residue form of h x f s from a given b ω n is shown in fig 3 it involves two stages at the end of the first stage an analytical expression for h x f s is obtained but it is not in its pole residue form the task of the second stage is to make h x f s in a pole residue form the first stage consists of four steps as follows 1 computing k t from b ω see eq 18 2 decomposing k t by using the prony ss method 29 k t r 1 n r φ r e ξ r t 3 taking the laplace transform of eq 29 to obtain the pole residue form of k s 30 k s r 1 n r φ r s ξ r and 4 getting the transfer function h x f s from k s see eq 25 in the second stage the analytical h x f s in eq 25 is converted into a pole residue form implemented as follows 5 obtaining the frf h x f ω from h x f s 31 h x f ω h x f i ω m a ω 2 i ω r 1 n r φ r i ω ξ r c 1 6 numerically computing the irf h x f t by taking the inverse fourier transform of h x f ω 7 decomposing h x f t by using the prony ss method to obtain 32 h x f t v 1 n v β v e μ v t and 8 taking the laplace transform of eq 32 to obtain the pole residue form of h x f s as 33 h x f s v 1 n v β v s μ v notice that two different forms of h x f ω have been given in eqs 12 and 31 respectively a few comments may help to clarify their differences and purposes while discrete a ω n and b ω n have been initially obtained from running a standard hydrodynamic software the h x f ω n in eq 12 would possess the same frequency resolution in contrast eq 31 is a continuous function of ω it will be explained further in the numerical studies why eq 31 is preferred over eq 12 in the implementation of the proposed method 4 4 pole residue operations on computing response to implement eq 26 on computing x c s an efficient pole residue method is presented in this section in brief the proposed method is to compute the poles and residues of x c s from those of h x f s h f η c s and η s once the pole residue form of x c s is obtained the corresponding x c t is readily available 4 4 1 pole residue operations on computing f c s applying the prony ss method one can decompose η t into a complex exponential form as eq 8 then η s is expressed as 34 η s ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ s λ ℓ substituting eqs 34 and 28 into in eq 23 leads to 35 f c s q 1 n q ε q s σ q ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ s λ ℓ as the common denominator in eq 35 is q 1 n q s σ q ℓ 1 n ℓ s λ ℓ one hence can write eq 35 in a pole residue form 36 f c s m 1 n m ζ m s θ m it is evident that there are total n m n ℓ n q causalized wave force poles θ m originating from the n ℓ elevation excitation poles and n q causalized elevation to force system poles label the first n ℓ poles as the elevation excitation poles i e θ m λ m m 1 n ℓ the last n q poles as the causalized elevation to force system poles i e θ m n ℓ σ m m 1 n q for each causalized wave force pole θ m the corresponding residue can be computed by 37 ζ m lim s θ m s θ m f c s lim s θ m s θ m h f η c s η s thus from eq 37 the residues corresponding to the first n ℓ causalized wave force poles i e at the elevation excitation poles are 38 ζ m lim s θ m s θ m h f η c s ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ s λ ℓ α m h f η c λ m m 1 n ℓ and the residues corresponding to the last n q causalized wave force poles i e at the causalized elevation to force system poles are 39 ζ m n ℓ lim s θ m n ℓ s θ m q 1 n q ε q s σ q η s ε m η σ m m 1 n q from eq 36 one can easily get the wave force time history 40 f t m 1 n m ζ m e θ m t t c u t t c where u is the heaviside unit step function 4 4 2 pole residue operations on computing motion response from eqs 24 33 and 36 one writes 41 x c s v 1 n v β v s μ v m 1 n m ζ m s θ m it follows that eq 41 can be written in the pole residue form as 42 x c s p 1 n p γ p s ν p there are total n p n m n v causalized response poles ν p including n m force poles and n v force to motion system poles as stated previously those n m force poles are originated from the n ℓ elevation poles and n q causalized elevation to force system poles following the same procedure on computing the residues of force one can obtain the residue corresponding to each causalized response pole ν p the residues corresponding to the first n m force poles are 43 γ p ζ p h x f θ p p 1 n m and those corresponding to the last n v force to response system poles are 44 γ p n m β p f c μ p p 1 n v once all the poles and residues of causalized response are computed one can easily obtain the resulting motion response under zero initial conditions to be 45 x t p 1 n ℓ n q n v γ p e ν p t t c u t t c note that the summation of the first n ℓ terms in eq 45 is related to the n ℓ incident wave elevation poles for convenience it is called the steady state response the summation of the remaining n q n v terms in eq 45 is called the transient response when the wave elevation is periodic the steady state response is equivalent to the response obtained by the frequency domain approach hu and gao 2017 5 numerical studies two numerical examples are presented in this article for illustrating the detailed numerical operations of the proposed method on computing the transient response of a floating structure considered first is a sdof model of a spar platform in heave under regular wave in the second example the same system to an irregular wave will be investigated throughout the numerical examples the system of units is the mks meter kilogram second system based on measuring lengths in meters mass in kilograms and time in seconds for briefness explicit units for quantities are omitted in the following presentation 5 1 example 1 sdof heaving spar model to regular wave a sdof heaving spar model under regular wave is chosen for the first example to illustrate the proposed procedure shown in fig 1 the model of the spar platform is one of the examples from the commercial software sesam dnv 2013 developed by det norske veritas norway but only the heave motion is considered here the spar has a diameter of 37 18 a draft of 198 12 and a mass of 22 05427 1 0 7 with the coordinates of the center of gravity cog in global coordinate system of 0 0 102 4 where the x y plane coincides with the still water surface and z axis is vertical upward shown in fig 4 is the geometry of the submerged spar platform modeled in sesam considered first is a regular wave η t cos 0 27 t i e η t 1 2 e i 0 27 t e i 0 27 t thus the poles and residues of this regular elevation are λ 1 λ 2 0 0 0 27 i and α 1 α 2 0 5 0 0 i respectively 5 1 1 pole residue form of h f η c s a discretized h f η ω n ranged from 0 03 to 3 12 with the frequency resolution δ ω 0 03 for this sdof model has been obtained from running sesam the corresponding irf h f η t j with δ t 0 01 is obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of h f η ω n a direct method of implementing the inverse fourier transform has been used 46 h f η t j 1 π n 1 104 re h f η ω n cos ω n t j im h f η ω n sin ω n t j δ ω where re and im are the real part and imaginary part ω n n δ ω t j j δ t j 8000 8000 plotted in fig 5 is the obtained irf h f η t j by observation it is proper to choose the causalizing time t c 30 also plotted is the causalized irf h f η c t namely h f η t 30 using the prony ss method one obtains that h f η c t could be approximated as the sum of eight complex exponential terms i e eight pole residue terms the numerical values of the eight poles σ q and residues ε q are listed in table 1 in turn the corresponding h f η c s can be written in the form of eq 28 with n q 8 because h f η s e s t c h f η c s one writes 47 h f η ω h f η i ω e i ω t c q 1 n q ε q i ω σ q for ensuring the numerical correctness of the obtained h f η s eq 47 is compared against the h f η ω n originally computed from sesam as shown in fig 6 they agree well with each other 5 1 2 pole residue form of h x f s computed from sesam also includes the discrete added mass a ω n and damping b ω n shown in fig 7 they possess the same frequency range and resolution as h f η ω n the numerical procedure to compute a pole residue form of h x f s from a given b ω n has been summarized in fig 3 first the retardation function k t can be computed from b ω in accordance with eq 18 plotted in fig 8 is the computed k t for 80 s conducting the prony ss method on this k t suggests that it can properly be decomposed into six complex componential terms with the values ξ r 0 0818 0 1074 i 0 1097 0 2103 i 0 1218 0 3309 i and the corresponding φ r 0 0189 4 2385 i 1 0 3 6 7161 2 7002 i 1 0 3 1 4860 1 3156 i 1 0 3 respectively also plotted in fig 8 is the reconstructed k t based on those six complex componential terms clearly there is no noticeable difference between the original and reconstructed retardation functions after k s being formulated with six pole residue terms a continuous version of h x f ω can be obtained following eq 31 with n r 6 the corresponding irf h x f t then is obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of h x f ω in the numerical implementation a discrete h x f ω n with the frequency resolution δ ω 0 0001 is generated from the continuous h x f ω and then inverse fast fourier transform ifft algorithm is called to obtain h x f t k as conducting the fourier analysis to get h x f t k automatically imposes the periodic feature of the obtained signal it is necessary to have the obtained h x f t k be long enough so that it would diminish to zero as shown in fig 9 h x f t takes a long time to die out this explains why it is not proper to compute h x f t k directly from the h x f ω n obtained from sesam because the frequency resolution of the h x f ω n from sesam is not small enough carrying out the prony ss method one reveals that h x f t can be approximated nicely by only two pole residue terms the numerical values μ v and the corresponding β v are listed in table 1 besides the discrete irf h x f t k obtained from ifft the reconstructed h x f t with two pole residue terms is also plotted in fig 9 clearly they are in excellent agreement next h x f s can be obtained by following eq 33 with n v 2 for confirming the correctness of the obtained h x f s one gets the corresponding h x f ω as 48 h x f ω h x f i ω v 1 2 β v i ω μ v and compares it to the discrete h x f ω n from sesam as shown in fig 10 they are in excellent agreement at the discrete frequencies 5 1 3 results of motion response inherited directly from the two elevation poles and eight causalized elevation to force system poles the function f c s should have ten poles the corresponding residues are computed from eqs 38 and 39 the numerical results for these ten poles residues are listed in table 2 shown in fig 11 is the continuous force time history f t computed by the pole residue form in eq 40 with n m 10 along with the counterpart by a time domain convolution integral method indeed they are in excellent agreement based on the poles and residues of f c s and those of h x f s the residues of x c s are computed from eqs 43 and 44 tabulated in table 2 are the twelve poles residues of x c s then the corresponding x t is computed by eq 45 with n p 12 plotted in fig 12 is the obtained x t together with the motion response computed by a time domain method clearly there is no noticeable difference between these two motion response signals the total motion response x t in fig 12 should be the sum of the transient response x t t and the steady state response x s t it is of interest to plot x t t and x s t separately as shown in fig 13 two physical insights are gained 1 x t t will take a long time about 1 0 5 seconds to die out and 2 x t t is larger than x s t for roughly the first 1 0 3 seconds the long lasting time of x t t is attributed to the fact that the real part of the poles of h x f s is 0 0002 see table 1 which suggests that the decay of x t t be extremely slow 5 2 example 2 sdof heaving spar model to irregular wave example 2 conducts a similar study as example 1 but changes the wave condition from regular waves to irregular waves in the following numerical study an irregular wave elevation consisting of five sinusoidal components is chosen goda 2010 49 η t w 1 5 h w 2 sin 2 π t w t θ w where h w t w and θ w are listed in table 3 a sketch of eq 49 is shown in fig 14 given the values in table 3 one can easily obtain the corresponding five conjugate pairs of poles residues listed in table 4 given the ten poles residues of η s and the ten poles residues associated with system transfer functions h f η c s and h x f s which have already obtained see table 1 in example 1 one can compute the twenty poles residues of x c s see table 5 from these twenty poles residues one then obtains x c t and x t the resulting x t from the proposed method along with the counterpart computed by a time domain method is plotted in fig 15 the two solutions agree well with each other from table 5 one notices that the residues at system poles are much larger than those at excitation poles in this case the transient response is dominant over the steady state response as shown in 16 although the time domain solution has been used to verify the correctness of the newly developed laplace domain method the accuracy of the new method must be higher than that of any time domain method in general the accuracy of the solution from a time domain method improves when the chosen δ t becomes smaller in contrast the solution of the proposed method is continuous in time the motion response discrepancy between the proposed method and a time domain method with δ t 0 01 δ t 0 5 and δ t 2 is shown in fig 17 it reveals that the discrepancy between the two methods decreases as δ t becomes smaller in other words when δ t is decreasing the computed response by the time domain method improves and is getting closer to that by the proposed method to get a sense of the computational efficiency of the proposed method against the time domain method the computational time required for the current example is investigated for the time domain method the computational time has been counted as the cpu time for numerically solving eq 13 when all parameters in eq 13 are known the computational time for the proposed time has been counted based on the cpu time after the poles and residues of the wave elevation and system transfer functions have been obtained for a total duration of 150 s with different choices of δ t table 6 lists the average cpu time of 10 individual runs while carrying out the proposed method and the time domain method respectively by a laptop computer the computational time for the time domain method significantly increases when the number of time steps n increases in contrast the computational time for the proposed method has little change demonstrating that the proposed method becomes more efficient when n increases 6 concluding remarks for computing the transient response of a floating structure to irregular waves this article developed an efficient pole residue method operated in the laplace domain the proposed method required both the elevation to force and force to motion system transfer functions be in their pole residue forms they were obtained based on the frequency domain data that was the output from running sesam the process of converting the frequency domain data to the desired transfer functions involved the usage of fourier transform and the complex exponential signal decomposition as the elevation to force system was not causal a causalization procedure for dealing this system was developed the correctness of the proposed method was verified through two numerical examples by comparing the motion responses obtained from the proposed method to those obtained by using a time domain method numerical studies demonstrated that the proposed method was more efficient and accurate than the traditional time domain method 7 notation the following symbols are used in this paper a constant added mass a ω frequency dependent added mass a infinite frequency

21944,obtaining cores by drill sampling is necessary for assessing natural gas hydrates therefore measures must be taken to ensure that they do not decompose during the coring process in this study the working principle of pressure and temperature preservation techniques as well as the history of the application of the drilling tool and some technical deficiencies are reviewed based on the phase equilibrium characteristics of gas hydrates a hole bottom freezing sampling technique hbfs is proposed and a drilling tool is designed the two key functions of cold source storage and freezing core of the drilling tool were tested the results showed that the alcohol dry ice mixture used as a cold source could be stored for 120 min with a cold energy loss rate of only 0 8 the cold source froze the core to the lowest temperature of 241 9 k in 5 min and prevented the hydrate from decomposing within 60 min the drilling tool test results showed that a coring success rate of 90 was achieved in four coring experiments a final core temperature of 263 k was obtained four times in the entire functional experiment which verifies the suitability of the hole bottom freezing sampling technique keywords gas hydrates coring pressure preservation hole bottom freezing sampling drilling tool 1 introduction the key to solving the global energy shortage problem is to find new energy sources that can replace coal oil and natural gas li et al 2016 natural gas hydrates nghs are natural gas resources that have been stable in the seabed and permafrost zone for millions of years they are considered to be a potential alternative energy source and have received widespread attention since their discovery in the 1960s makogon 1965 makogon et al 2007 kvenvolden et al 1993 gornitz and fung 1994 burwicz et al 2011 nghs can only be stable under specific pressure and temperature conditions mazzini et al 2004 popescu et al 2006 according to its phase equilibrium conditions marine gas hydrates exist in the seafloor at depths of more than 3000 m below sea level they are also present in the interior and lower parts of permafrost and in temperatures ranging from 273 15 k to 253 15 k sloan and koh 2007 kerr 2004 collett et al 2009 owing to the different assumptions made by various scientists there is no clear estimate of the amount of natural gas present in hydrate reserves by even the most conservative estimate hydrate deposits contain at least twice as much natural gas as conventional natural gas sources johnson 2011 chong et al 2016 kok and merey 2014 at a standard temperature and pressure a cubic metre of gas hydrate can contain approximately 180 m3 of natural gas which implies that hydrates have a higher energy density than traditional fossil energy sources englezos 1993 therefore the exploration and exploitation of hydrates is considered to be important for meeting the current energy needs of mankind ngh production techniques include depressurisation thermal stimulation gas replacement chemical inhibitor injection and a combination of methods liu et al 2012 xu and li 2015 demirbas 2010 kondori et al 2017 in the past 20 years many countries have performed work in gas hydrate reservoirs under marine and permafrost conditions as shown in fig 1 china obtained hydrate cores from the shenhu area and the pearl river mouth basin in the south china sea in 2007 2013 and 2015 as a result of these drilling explorations the first gas production test was conducted in the shenhu area of the south china sea for more than two months in may 2017 hao et al 2017 chen et al 2018 solid fluidization well testing and production for shallow non diagenetic nghs in deep water was also performed for the first time in the south china sea lu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 to design production wells and select production methods sediment analysis geochemical analysis saturation measurement and rock analysis of the hydrate cores in a reservoir need to be carried out sahay and johnson 2014 core data such as sediment type particle size pressure temperature permeability porosity pore water chlorine content gas hydrate saturation water and gas saturation and rock strength need to be obtained via core analysis de lange and brumsack 1998 bahk et al 2013 suzuki et al 2015 before hydrate production a hydrated core must be obtained and analysed to determine the reservoir characteristic however the phase equilibrium of a core is easily affected by the decomposition of the core because of the increase in temperature or pressure owing to the special metastable state of the hydrate merey 2016 therefore two methods for ensuring that a hydrate does not decompose during the drilling process are proposed lowering the core temperature or maintaining the original temperature and pressure of the core the principle and characteristics of the pressure and temperature preservation techniques are reviewed the hbfs is proposed and a drilling tool was designed for functional testing and application 2 sampling techniques nghs can only exist within specific temperature and pressure ranges and temperatures are positively correlated with their critical decomposition pressures therefore the decomposition of a hydrate can be inhibited by increasing the pressure or lowering the temperature to obtain the hydrate core in the sample drilling process as shown in fig 2 however it is difficult to pressurise a core at the downhole because of the small size of the well and the structural limitations of the drilling tool therefore to inhibit decomposition researchers have proposed that the original temperature and pressure of a hydrate core be maintained at the in situ temperature and pressure state and not be changed during the sampling process this is known as the pressure and temperature preservation ptp technique this is the most ideal and most widely used method another method is to lower the temperature of the hydrate core to lower the critical decomposition pressure of the hydrate and to move the temperature and pressure state of the hydrate to a stable region thereby inhibiting the decomposition of the hydrate this is known as the hbfs it is known that methane gas hydrates can be stored below the melting point of ice at the pressure outside the zone of thermodynamic stability of the hydrates handa 1986 stern et al 2001 takeya et al 2002 kuhs et al 2004 experimental results showed that methane hydrate could survive for a long time in frozen soils at temperature of 268 15 to 266 15 k at below equilibrium pressures ershov and yakushev 1992a chuvilin et al 2011 ershov and yakushev 1992b 2 1 pressure and temperature preservation technique preservation of the pressure and temperature are the two key functions of the ptp technique the pressure is maintained through a mechanical sealing so that the hydrate core in the pressure barrel does not decompose a schematic of the ngh ptp core sampling technique is shown in fig 3 the pressure preservation function of the ptp was performed via a pressure compensation system and a pressure maintaining system the pressure compensation system included an accumulator and a pressure chamber nitrogen gas was flushed into the nitrogen chamber of the accumulator in advance the accumulator was connected to the pressure chamber through a compensating hole the piston inside the pressure chamber was moved up or down to adjust the system pressure if the pressure in the pressure chamber exceeded the preset pressure gas was discharged through the pressure relief valve the pressure maintaining system consisted of a sealing valve and a torsional spring and was connected to the pressure compensation system through a connecting tube as shown in fig 3 a during the drilling process the sealing valve remained open and the core entered the pressure barrel at the same time the pressure in the pressure barrel rose the piston moved up the volume of the nitrogen chamber was compressed and the pressure rose as shown in fig 3 b when the core entered the pressure barrel the sealing valve sealed the pressure barrel under the control of the torsion spring as shown in fig 3 c during the recovery of the drilling tool if the pressure in the pressure chamber rose the pressure relief valve opened and the gas was exhausted the volume of the nitrogen chamber was reduced the volume of the pressure chamber was increased and the pressure was maintained near that of the original state when the pressure in the pressure chamber dropped the piston moved down under the action of high pressure nitrogen the volume of the pressure chamber was compressed and the pressure in the pressure barrel was compensated as shown in fig 3 d abid et al 2015 to reduce the influence of temperature changes on the hydrate core the function of heat preservation was added to the pressure preservation drilling tool one approach to provide heat insulation is to add an outer tube to the outside of the pressure barrel and then evacuate the annular gap between the outer tube and the pressure barrel or to add a heat insulating material to reduce the heat exchange between the core and the environment other approaches include using the thermoelectric cooling effect of a lithium battery or introducing liquid nitrogen into the annular gap to maintain the temperature of the core masayuki et al 2006 the seal of the pressure maintaining system is a ball valve and a flap valve as shown in fig 4 both valves were controlled by a torsion spring or a rack and pinion mechanism that caused the valve ball or valve plate to be reversed to seal the pressure chamber the ball was fixed to the outer tube during the coring process the core barrel was located in the circular hole in the middle of the ball therefore the ball could not rotate a catcher guaranteed that the core did not fall out of the core barrel after the coring was completed the core barrel was lifted out of the centre hole of the ball the ball valve was turned over under the action of the torsional spring to seal the pressure chamber as shown in fig 4 a unlike the ball valve the valve plate in the flap valve mechanism was fixed inside the pressure chamber the valve plate formed a sealing structure with the sealing surface of the pressure chamber under the action of the torsional spring as shown in fig 4 b ball valves are widely used in the ptp technique the earliest form was the pressure core barrel pcb used in the deep sea drilling project used in legs 42 44 62 64 66 72 74 and 76 however the success rate was lower peterson 1984 paull and ussler 2001 to improve the pressure preservation rate in the ocean drilling program odp the pressure core sampler pcs was developed based on the pcb and a ball valve was used to maintain pressure the pcs was applied in odp legs 124 131 139 141 146 164 196 201 and 204 the iodp expedition 311 of the cascadia margin and the national gas hydrate project 01 of india abid et al 2015 paull and ussler 2001 burger et al 2003 the maximum water depth at which the pcs was deployed was during leg 201 of the peru margin at site 1230b where water depths of 5085 5 m were reached the recovery rate of pcs at this site was 60 8 odp 2003 however both pcb and pcs do not have the function of temperature preservation therefore based on the odp pcs technique electronic refrigeration and passive insulation technology were included to develop the pressure temperature core sampler ptcs during the coring process a thermoelectric cooling device cools the core tube and the amount of heat transfer is reduced via the addition of insulation a low temperature drilling fluid is used to achieve insulation the ptcs has been used in the southeast and central parts of the japan nankai trough and in the mallik in canada kawasaki et al 2006 fujii et al 2009 suzuki et al 2008 ohara et al 2000 during the campaigns on the sites of toai oki to kumano nada the ptcs was deployed in 6 wells over 14 days in which ptcs cored a total of 203 5 m of sediment with 163 1m being recovered at near in situ pressure condition a recovery rate of 79 3 yamamoto et al 2012 collett et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the sealing structure of the ptcs was improved with the development of the hybrid pressure coring system hybrid pcs also known as pctb to allow for operation on the chikyu drilling vessel the hybrid pressure coring system was used in the south china sea the eastern nankai trough and the eastern coast of india kumar et al 2019 the recovery rate of the hybrid pcs during expedition 802 was 69 collett et al 2013 in the odp the fugro pressure corer and the hyace rotary corer were developed to improve the pressure coring system for different reservoir characteristics the fugro pressure corer and the hyace rotary corer were used in odp legs 194 201 and 204 the south china sea the gulf of mexico and offshore in korea burger et al 2003 lee et al 2013 ruppel et al 2008 fpc and hrc are currently the pressure coring tools of choice and are used extensively on gas hydrate expeditions fpc and hrc were successfully used during the expedition of ubgh210d in which they had a recovery rate of 66 7 ryu et al 2013 a drilling tool must have a highly efficient sealing structure to maintain the in situ pressure of the core if the mechanical seal structure is damaged the in situ core pressure will not be retained resulting in core failure in addition samplers can only provide small diameter cores because of the ball valve construction burger et al 2003 2 2 hole bottom freezing sampling technique hbfs uses a phase change fluid as a cold source to reduce the hydrate core temperature through a cold source vaporisation endotherm the hydrate core temperature is lowered to reduce the decomposition pressure of the hydrate while the low temperature stimulates the self protection effect of the hydrate ensuring that the hydrate does not decompose during drilling the schematic diagram of the hbfs method for gas hydrate sampling is shown in fig 5 during recovery of the core the hydrate is in a stable zone when the hydrostatic pressure of the core is below the phase equilibrium curve when the hydrostatic pressure of the sample exceeds the phase equilibrium curve and reaches point a the hydrate steady state is destroyed the hydrate can be changed from state a to point b by freezing at which point the core returns to a steady state the advantages of using hbfs are as follows a the hydrate decomposition is suppressed by cooling and a complicated pressure holding mechanism is not required b there is no size limit without the ball valves or flap valves and c the hydrate samples obtained are frozen and do not require a pressure core transfer system the operation of the hole bottom freezing drilling tool is shown in fig 6 a mixture of 195 k alcohol and dry ice was chosen as the cold source of the drilling tool the cold source was stored in the storage chamber during the drilling process the storage chamber and the freezing chamber were isolated by a control valve the insulation material in the storage chamber isolated the heat transfer from the cold source and the environment to avoid loss of cold energy at this time the control valve was supported by the spring in the initial position as shown in fig 6 a after drilling the drilling tool was lifted the control valve moved down to apply pressure to the storage chamber and the piston opened the injection channel between the storage chamber and the freezing chamber opened and the cold source was injected into the freezing chamber as shown in fig 6 b the cold source and the hydrate core underwent a phase change convective heat transfer after which the core temperature decreased rapidly as shown in fig 6 c during this process the co2 gas produced by the dry ice gasification was discharged by the vent valve the insulating material in the freezing chamber isolated the heat exchange of the mixture from the external environment as shown in fig 6 d 3 tests the cold source of the hole bottom freezing drilling tool was stored in the storage chamber for a long time and the core temperature was lowered which was the main function of the drilling tool thus the cold source storage and the freezing function of the drilling tool were tested 3 1 materials a mixture of alcohol and dry ice was used as the cold source liquid nitrogen was injected into 2 l of normal temperature anhydrous ethanol 99 and the temperature was lowered to 163 k then 2 kg of dry ice powder was placed in the cold alcohol dry ice does not vaporise in cold alcohol because the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice at atmospheric pressure is 195 k finally an alcohol dry ice mixture was obtained by constant stirring it is very difficult to form a hydrated core inside the drill and to monitor its temperature and pressure changes the experiment used 10 water containing sand as the simulated core the parameters are listed in table 1 li et al 2010 the density and specific heat capacity of the two samples can be calculated by equations 1 and 2 galushkin 1997 the results are listed in table 2 density of ngh deposits and simulated core 1 ρ 1 ϕ ρ r s h ϕ ρ h s a ϕ ρ w specific heat capacity of ngh deposits and simulated core 2 c ρ r cr 1 ϕ ρ h ch ϕ s ρ w cw ϕ s a ρ the thermophysical properties of the simulated core were similar to those of the gas hydrate deposits in the shenhu area of the south china sea the simulated core had a higher specific heat capacity therefore the cold source needed to absorb more heat from the simulated core to freeze it to the desired temperature the lower thermal conductivity indicated that the heat transfer inside the simulated core was slower and more time was required to freeze the simulated core as a result the simulated core was more difficult to freeze than the hydrate core if the simulated core can be frozen to the desired temperature so too can the hydrate core 3 2 apparatus and procedures the experimental system is shown in fig 7 the system consisted of appliances a well mobile drilling derricks a slush pump a monitor a pipeline and a mud box the mud mixture of pure water and small amount of clay was pumped from the mud box by the slush pump injected into the well by the pipeline and then returned to the mud box from the well to simulate the actual drilling process the mobile drilling derricks provided the rotational power for the drill during the test the temperature and pressure within the equipment were monitored the apparatus consisted of a storage chamber a control mechanism and a freezing chamber the structural parameters of the apparatus are listed in table 3 the cold source was stored inside the storage chamber and the sample was placed in the core barrel a control rod was pushed to open the control valve so that the cold source entered the freezing chamber through the injection channel the co2 generated by the dry ice gasification was discharged through the relief valve the storage chamber and the freezing chamber were wrapped by the insulation layer to prevent the loss of cold energy during the test the temperature and pressure of the cold source in the storage chamber were monitored to calculate the loss of cold energy the temperatures at nine points of the core were monitored to describe the effect of the core being frozen the positions of the monitoring points are shown in fig 8 and its coordinates are listed in table 4 the test procedure involved loading a simulated core into the core barrel and then injecting a cold source into the storage chamber the apparatus was placed in the well by the mobile drilling derricks and the mud was circulated through the mud pump the cold source storage tests took 120 min after 120 min the control valve was opened a cold source was injected into the freezing chamber and the freezing core test was started the test time was 1 h and the sensor monitored the temperature changes at different positions of the core the gas generated during the freezing process was discharged from the relief valve 3 3 results and analysis the cold source storage process refers to the period from the addition of the cold source to the end of the coring the average time taken by the hybrid press coring system in the 18 coring process of the nankai trough was 86 min inada and yamamoto 2015 in the test the storage time of the cold source was assumed to be 120 min to ensure sufficient experimental time the temperature and pressure changes in the chamber during storage are shown in fig 9 during the 120 min period the temperature of the mixture rose from 177 18 k to 200 21 k and the pressure increased from 0 1 mpa to 0 17 mpa it can be seen from the comparison between the p t curve of the mixture in the storage process and the critical decomposition curve of dry ice fig 10 that the critical decomposition pressure of dry ice at 177 18 k was 0 021 mpa which was less than the normal pressure the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice under normal pressure is 195 5 k therefore when the cold source temperature is lower than 195 5 k the dry ice in the mixture will not decompose no decomposition occurred until the temperature of the mixture reached 195 5 k 0 85 min and the pressure in the storage chamber was maintained at normal pressure as shown in fig 9 during this process there was a loss of cold energy from the mud because of the temperature difference between the mixture and the environment the mud temperature was 253 15 k the heat insulating layer outside the storage chamber slowed down the heat exchange therefore the temperature of the mixture rose uniformly in the time range 0 85 min at a rate of 0 22 k min in the range 85 120 min since the mixture temperature was higher than 195 5 k which exceeded the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice under normal pressure the heating rate of the mixture gradually decreased at this time the dry ice in the mixture entered the decomposition zone and the dry ice decomposed as shown in fig 10 dry ice decomposition is an endothermic reaction therefore the rate of temperature increase gradually reduced in the range 85 120 min in addition as the temperature of the mixture increased the temperature difference with the environment decreased resulting in a decrease in heat exchange it can also be seen from the trend of temperature variation in the range 0 85 min that the temperature increase slowly reduced the pressure in the storage chamber gradually increased from 0 1 mpa to 0 17 mpa because of the co2 generated by the decomposition of dry ice as shown in fig 9 when the pressure in the chamber reached 0 15 mpa the temperature of the mixture was 199 62 k which is the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice as the pressure in the chamber was further increased the dry ice gradually entered the stable zone as shown in fig 10 the analysis considers that the heat of vaporisation of dry ice slows down the heating rate of the mixture and the temperature of the mixture gradually decreases below the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice therefore when the chamber pressure was 0 15 mpa the mixture returned to the stable region again however since the temperature sensor reflects the temperature change at a point in the cold storage chamber the temperature in the chamber is not evenly distributed the temperature of the mixture near the wall of the chamber will be higher than the temperature at the centre some dry ice still decomposes in the chamber therefore the pressure in the chamber after the end of the storage test was 0 17 mpa we used cold energy loss as an indicator to evaluate the storage performance the amount of dry ice lost during storage was calculated the ideal gas state equation was used to calculate the loss of dry ice in the cold source storage process 3 n p v z r t where p is the gas pressure v is the gas volume n is the amount of gas substance t is the system temperature r is the proportional coefficient and z is the compressibility factor for co2 the cold source total energy calculation formulae included the following sensible heat q s1 δt 1 vc v latent heat q l1 m 1 r total cold energy q a q s1 q l1 where δt 1 is the change in the temperature of the cold source from 283 k to 163 k v is the total volume of the cold source m 1 is the mass of the cold source m is the mass of the loss of dry ice r is the latent heat of vaporisation of the cold source and c v is the constant pressure specific heat of the cold source the cold energy utilisation efficiency of the cold source storage is 4 η s e 1 q d q a 1 q s d q l d q s 1 q l 1 1 δ t d v c v δ m r δ t 1 v c v m 1 r where q d is the total cold energy loss of the cold source in the storage process q sd is the sensible heat cold energy loss q ld is the latent heat cold energy loss δm is the mass of the cold source lost during storage and δt d is the temperature change of the cold source in the storage process the amount of dry ice lost during storage was 0 41 kg which is for 8 2 of the total dry ice mass the storage rate of cold energy in the storage process was 97 27 therefore there was almost no loss of cold energy in the storage process and the storage capacity of the drilling tool met the requirements the effect of the frozen core of the drilling tool is critical to achieve hbfs after the storage test the control valve of the apparatus was opened the cold source was injected into the freezing chamber and the freezing test was performed the 60 min process of recovering the drilling tool was simulated during the test the temperature curves at different locations of the core during the test are shown in figs 11 13 fig 11 shows the temperature of the upper core the temperature of the core dropped from 285 13 k to 241 9 k in 7 min and the cooling rate was 6 18 k min the temperature rose to 266 14 k in 7 60 min and the heating rate was 0 46 k min fig 12 shows the temperature of the central core the core temperature dropped from 285 26 k to 243 30 k in 6 min and the cooling rate was 6 99 k min the temperature rose to 268 88 k in 6 60 min and the heating rate was 0 47 k min fig 13 shows the temperature of the lower core the core temperature dropped from 285 11 k to 264 05 k in 15 min and the cooling rate was 1 4 k min the temperature rose to 271 77 k in 15 60 min and the heating rate was 0 17 k min figs 11 13 show that the temperature trends of the upper and middle cores were similar the lower core temperature dropped slowly and decreased less because the lower core was in contact with the mud and the heat exchange rate and heat transfer between them were greater than that in the other parts of the core the cold source quickly reduced the temperature of the core and maintained the temperature between 250 k and 270 k for 45 min the p t curve of the hydrate under standard conditions is shown in fig 14 if the hydrate does not decompose between 250 k and 270 k the core pressure needs to be maintained between 1 30 mpa and 2 28 mpa makogon and sloan 1994 this means that in the process of recovering the core the hydrate will decompose when the drilling tool is at a water depth of 130 m although it takes only approximately 3 min to lift the drill from 130 m to the deck it still affects the determination of the hydrate reservoir resources however since natural gas hydrates have an anomalous preservation effect at low temperatures the water produced when hydrates decompose below zero at atmospheric pressure forms an ice film on the surface of the hydrate and prevents its decomposition the hydrate can be maintained for a long time under atmospheric pressure when a hydrate is placed under normal pressure conditions at a temperature of 255 k the hydrate in a metastable state can be maintained for a long time without decomposition the hydrate only decomposed by 0 85 in 10 days gudmundsson et al 1994 istomin and yakushev 1992 the hydrate decomposition curve under the self protection effect is shown in fig 15 the temperature of the core gradually increased from point a to point b and was within the temperature range of anomalous preservation the temperature of the core during the freezing process was mainly in the green area about 45 min the temperature range of the core was the same as that of the anomalous preservation of methane hydrate and the hydrate hardly decomposed in this temperature range moreover the pore water in the core will freeze and block the internal pores of the sediment and hinder the release of pressure and inhibit the decomposition of hydrate wang et al 2018 fan et al 2017 in summary the drilling tool met the requirements of freezing 4 application of drilling tool 4 1 drilling tool and procedures drilling experiments were carried out in the loess layer to verify the full function of the drilling tool the depth of the well was 24 m the coring was taken at 8 16 m and the freezing core experiment was performed at 16 24 m the drilling tool is shown in fig 16 the drill was placed and raised into the well by the recoverer the positioner guaranteed that the drill did not move up during the drilling process the suspended structure ensured that a distance of 2 4 mm was maintained between the bottom surface of the drilling tool and the drill bit the single action structure ensured that the core barrel did not rotate with the drill bit during the coring process ensuring the integrity of the core the adjuster adjusted the overall length of the drill and cooperated with the suspended structure to ensure the position of the drill within the drill pipe at the end of the coring the cold source injection control mechanism caused the cold source to flow out of the storage chamber into the freezing chamber to freeze the core in the core barrel 4 2 operating procedures first the exhaust valve was checked and installed the functioning of the control mechanism and the single action structure were checked two litres of liquid nitrogen was added to 2 l of normal temperature alcohol the temperature of the alcohol was reduced to 163 k after which dry ice was added and the mixture was stirred evenly two litres of liquid nitrogen was used to pre cool the storage chamber after the pre cooling the alcohol dry ice mixture was injected into the storage chamber and the steps involved in the cold source preparation and injection into the cold storage chamber is shown in fig 17 the drilling tool was then placed in the well to begin drilling during the drilling process the cold source was stored in the storage chamber of the drilling tool after drilling the control mechanism was activated and the cold source was injected into the freezing chamber the discharge of air bubbles from the well indicates the start of the freezing process since the freezing process is very rapid the drilling tool can be recovered after the occurrence of bubble discharge after the drill is recovered the frozen core is removed from the core barrel 4 3 results of application first the drilling core function of the drilling tool was tested four coring tests were performed with a core diameter of 50 mm and a core length of 1 m the obtained loess cores are shown in fig 18 and the coring rates are listed in table 5 the results show that the drilling tool had a coring success rate of 90 no bubbles appeared in the well during the 120 min drilling time indicating that the cold source did not decompose in the storage chamber this shows that the drilling tool met the requirements of long term storage of the cold source in the well the positioner and suspended structure enabled the drill to reach the specified position accurately the cold source was smoothly injected into the freezing chamber a large number of bubbles appeared in the well indicating that the cold source was rapidly absorbing heat in the freezing chamber and the core was quickly becoming frozen the infrared temperature of the core after freezing is shown in fig 19 and the core surface temperature was approximately 253 k according to the previous analysis the temperature of the core was in the temperature range of the anomalous preservation effect and ensured that the hydrate core did not decompose during the recovery process 5 conclusion and outlook hbfs can be used not only for sampling gas hydrates in deep seawater but also for sampling subsurface hydrates the coring success rate of ptp is completely dependent on the quality of the mechanical seal but the complex environment at the bottom of the hole makes the mechanical seal too difficult to guarantee success hbfs does not encounter these problems this method inhibits the decomposition of hydrate by lowering the temperature mainly through the heat transfer between the cold source and the core and the mechanical sealing performance requirement of the drill is lower than that of the ptp technique through the functional test results the alcohol dry ice mixture with a temperature of 163 k was stored in the internal storage of the drill for 120 min under the condition of simulating the hydrate formation and the loss rate of cold energy was only 2 73 which proved that the cold source can be stored in the well for a long time the freezing test results show that the cold source can freeze the core to a minimum temperature of 241 9 k and ensure that the temperature of the core is within the temperature range of the anomalous preservation effect within 60 min at which time the hydrate hardly decomposes through the drilling experiment and the freezing core experiment the drilling tool can obtain the core and can freeze the loess core to 263 k which indicates that the drilling tool can effectively retrieve a frozen sample of a hydrate reservoir the principle of the method indicates that the decomposition of the hydrate by lowering the temperature of the core has a side effect that is the low temperature causes the water in the core to freeze resulting in a deviation in the physical property detection of the deposit in order to solve the problem of low success rate of the ptp and at the same time reduce the influence of low temperature on the core properties of hydrate deposits the next step is to incorporate the two methods into one drilling tool and use hbfs as an auxiliary function of ptp during the hydrate sampling process the core is obtained by pressure holding sampling and if the pressure is maintained the freezing function is not triggered if the pressure preservation fails the freezing function is automatically triggered to suppress the decomposition of the temperature of the hydrate core the two measures ensure that the hydrate core does not decompose which can greatly improve the success rate of hydrate coring moreover the degree of influence of this method on the characteristics of hydrate deposits is not clear especially the effects on porosity and permeability which need to be evaluated in future work credit authorship contribution statement guo wei writing

21944,obtaining cores by drill sampling is necessary for assessing natural gas hydrates therefore measures must be taken to ensure that they do not decompose during the coring process in this study the working principle of pressure and temperature preservation techniques as well as the history of the application of the drilling tool and some technical deficiencies are reviewed based on the phase equilibrium characteristics of gas hydrates a hole bottom freezing sampling technique hbfs is proposed and a drilling tool is designed the two key functions of cold source storage and freezing core of the drilling tool were tested the results showed that the alcohol dry ice mixture used as a cold source could be stored for 120 min with a cold energy loss rate of only 0 8 the cold source froze the core to the lowest temperature of 241 9 k in 5 min and prevented the hydrate from decomposing within 60 min the drilling tool test results showed that a coring success rate of 90 was achieved in four coring experiments a final core temperature of 263 k was obtained four times in the entire functional experiment which verifies the suitability of the hole bottom freezing sampling technique keywords gas hydrates coring pressure preservation hole bottom freezing sampling drilling tool 1 introduction the key to solving the global energy shortage problem is to find new energy sources that can replace coal oil and natural gas li et al 2016 natural gas hydrates nghs are natural gas resources that have been stable in the seabed and permafrost zone for millions of years they are considered to be a potential alternative energy source and have received widespread attention since their discovery in the 1960s makogon 1965 makogon et al 2007 kvenvolden et al 1993 gornitz and fung 1994 burwicz et al 2011 nghs can only be stable under specific pressure and temperature conditions mazzini et al 2004 popescu et al 2006 according to its phase equilibrium conditions marine gas hydrates exist in the seafloor at depths of more than 3000 m below sea level they are also present in the interior and lower parts of permafrost and in temperatures ranging from 273 15 k to 253 15 k sloan and koh 2007 kerr 2004 collett et al 2009 owing to the different assumptions made by various scientists there is no clear estimate of the amount of natural gas present in hydrate reserves by even the most conservative estimate hydrate deposits contain at least twice as much natural gas as conventional natural gas sources johnson 2011 chong et al 2016 kok and merey 2014 at a standard temperature and pressure a cubic metre of gas hydrate can contain approximately 180 m3 of natural gas which implies that hydrates have a higher energy density than traditional fossil energy sources englezos 1993 therefore the exploration and exploitation of hydrates is considered to be important for meeting the current energy needs of mankind ngh production techniques include depressurisation thermal stimulation gas replacement chemical inhibitor injection and a combination of methods liu et al 2012 xu and li 2015 demirbas 2010 kondori et al 2017 in the past 20 years many countries have performed work in gas hydrate reservoirs under marine and permafrost conditions as shown in fig 1 china obtained hydrate cores from the shenhu area and the pearl river mouth basin in the south china sea in 2007 2013 and 2015 as a result of these drilling explorations the first gas production test was conducted in the shenhu area of the south china sea for more than two months in may 2017 hao et al 2017 chen et al 2018 solid fluidization well testing and production for shallow non diagenetic nghs in deep water was also performed for the first time in the south china sea lu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 to design production wells and select production methods sediment analysis geochemical analysis saturation measurement and rock analysis of the hydrate cores in a reservoir need to be carried out sahay and johnson 2014 core data such as sediment type particle size pressure temperature permeability porosity pore water chlorine content gas hydrate saturation water and gas saturation and rock strength need to be obtained via core analysis de lange and brumsack 1998 bahk et al 2013 suzuki et al 2015 before hydrate production a hydrated core must be obtained and analysed to determine the reservoir characteristic however the phase equilibrium of a core is easily affected by the decomposition of the core because of the increase in temperature or pressure owing to the special metastable state of the hydrate merey 2016 therefore two methods for ensuring that a hydrate does not decompose during the drilling process are proposed lowering the core temperature or maintaining the original temperature and pressure of the core the principle and characteristics of the pressure and temperature preservation techniques are reviewed the hbfs is proposed and a drilling tool was designed for functional testing and application 2 sampling techniques nghs can only exist within specific temperature and pressure ranges and temperatures are positively correlated with their critical decomposition pressures therefore the decomposition of a hydrate can be inhibited by increasing the pressure or lowering the temperature to obtain the hydrate core in the sample drilling process as shown in fig 2 however it is difficult to pressurise a core at the downhole because of the small size of the well and the structural limitations of the drilling tool therefore to inhibit decomposition researchers have proposed that the original temperature and pressure of a hydrate core be maintained at the in situ temperature and pressure state and not be changed during the sampling process this is known as the pressure and temperature preservation ptp technique this is the most ideal and most widely used method another method is to lower the temperature of the hydrate core to lower the critical decomposition pressure of the hydrate and to move the temperature and pressure state of the hydrate to a stable region thereby inhibiting the decomposition of the hydrate this is known as the hbfs it is known that methane gas hydrates can be stored below the melting point of ice at the pressure outside the zone of thermodynamic stability of the hydrates handa 1986 stern et al 2001 takeya et al 2002 kuhs et al 2004 experimental results showed that methane hydrate could survive for a long time in frozen soils at temperature of 268 15 to 266 15 k at below equilibrium pressures ershov and yakushev 1992a chuvilin et al 2011 ershov and yakushev 1992b 2 1 pressure and temperature preservation technique preservation of the pressure and temperature are the two key functions of the ptp technique the pressure is maintained through a mechanical sealing so that the hydrate core in the pressure barrel does not decompose a schematic of the ngh ptp core sampling technique is shown in fig 3 the pressure preservation function of the ptp was performed via a pressure compensation system and a pressure maintaining system the pressure compensation system included an accumulator and a pressure chamber nitrogen gas was flushed into the nitrogen chamber of the accumulator in advance the accumulator was connected to the pressure chamber through a compensating hole the piston inside the pressure chamber was moved up or down to adjust the system pressure if the pressure in the pressure chamber exceeded the preset pressure gas was discharged through the pressure relief valve the pressure maintaining system consisted of a sealing valve and a torsional spring and was connected to the pressure compensation system through a connecting tube as shown in fig 3 a during the drilling process the sealing valve remained open and the core entered the pressure barrel at the same time the pressure in the pressure barrel rose the piston moved up the volume of the nitrogen chamber was compressed and the pressure rose as shown in fig 3 b when the core entered the pressure barrel the sealing valve sealed the pressure barrel under the control of the torsion spring as shown in fig 3 c during the recovery of the drilling tool if the pressure in the pressure chamber rose the pressure relief valve opened and the gas was exhausted the volume of the nitrogen chamber was reduced the volume of the pressure chamber was increased and the pressure was maintained near that of the original state when the pressure in the pressure chamber dropped the piston moved down under the action of high pressure nitrogen the volume of the pressure chamber was compressed and the pressure in the pressure barrel was compensated as shown in fig 3 d abid et al 2015 to reduce the influence of temperature changes on the hydrate core the function of heat preservation was added to the pressure preservation drilling tool one approach to provide heat insulation is to add an outer tube to the outside of the pressure barrel and then evacuate the annular gap between the outer tube and the pressure barrel or to add a heat insulating material to reduce the heat exchange between the core and the environment other approaches include using the thermoelectric cooling effect of a lithium battery or introducing liquid nitrogen into the annular gap to maintain the temperature of the core masayuki et al 2006 the seal of the pressure maintaining system is a ball valve and a flap valve as shown in fig 4 both valves were controlled by a torsion spring or a rack and pinion mechanism that caused the valve ball or valve plate to be reversed to seal the pressure chamber the ball was fixed to the outer tube during the coring process the core barrel was located in the circular hole in the middle of the ball therefore the ball could not rotate a catcher guaranteed that the core did not fall out of the core barrel after the coring was completed the core barrel was lifted out of the centre hole of the ball the ball valve was turned over under the action of the torsional spring to seal the pressure chamber as shown in fig 4 a unlike the ball valve the valve plate in the flap valve mechanism was fixed inside the pressure chamber the valve plate formed a sealing structure with the sealing surface of the pressure chamber under the action of the torsional spring as shown in fig 4 b ball valves are widely used in the ptp technique the earliest form was the pressure core barrel pcb used in the deep sea drilling project used in legs 42 44 62 64 66 72 74 and 76 however the success rate was lower peterson 1984 paull and ussler 2001 to improve the pressure preservation rate in the ocean drilling program odp the pressure core sampler pcs was developed based on the pcb and a ball valve was used to maintain pressure the pcs was applied in odp legs 124 131 139 141 146 164 196 201 and 204 the iodp expedition 311 of the cascadia margin and the national gas hydrate project 01 of india abid et al 2015 paull and ussler 2001 burger et al 2003 the maximum water depth at which the pcs was deployed was during leg 201 of the peru margin at site 1230b where water depths of 5085 5 m were reached the recovery rate of pcs at this site was 60 8 odp 2003 however both pcb and pcs do not have the function of temperature preservation therefore based on the odp pcs technique electronic refrigeration and passive insulation technology were included to develop the pressure temperature core sampler ptcs during the coring process a thermoelectric cooling device cools the core tube and the amount of heat transfer is reduced via the addition of insulation a low temperature drilling fluid is used to achieve insulation the ptcs has been used in the southeast and central parts of the japan nankai trough and in the mallik in canada kawasaki et al 2006 fujii et al 2009 suzuki et al 2008 ohara et al 2000 during the campaigns on the sites of toai oki to kumano nada the ptcs was deployed in 6 wells over 14 days in which ptcs cored a total of 203 5 m of sediment with 163 1m being recovered at near in situ pressure condition a recovery rate of 79 3 yamamoto et al 2012 collett et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the sealing structure of the ptcs was improved with the development of the hybrid pressure coring system hybrid pcs also known as pctb to allow for operation on the chikyu drilling vessel the hybrid pressure coring system was used in the south china sea the eastern nankai trough and the eastern coast of india kumar et al 2019 the recovery rate of the hybrid pcs during expedition 802 was 69 collett et al 2013 in the odp the fugro pressure corer and the hyace rotary corer were developed to improve the pressure coring system for different reservoir characteristics the

fpc and hrc are currently the pressure coring tools of choice and are used extensively on gas hydrate expeditions fpc and hrc were successfully used during the expedition of ubgh210d in which they had a recovery rate of 66 7 ryu et al 2013 a drilling tool must have a highly efficient sealing structure to maintain the in situ pressure of the core if the mechanical seal structure is damaged the in situ core pressure will not be retained resulting in core failure in addition samplers can only provide small diameter cores because of the ball valve construction burger et al 2003 2 2 hole bottom freezing sampling technique hbfs uses a phase change fluid as a cold source to reduce the hydrate core temperature through a cold source vaporisation endotherm the hydrate core temperature is lowered to reduce the decomposition pressure of the hydrate while the low temperature stimulates the self protection effect of the hydrate ensuring that the hydrate does not decompose during drilling the schematic diagram of the hbfs method for gas hydrate sampling is shown in fig 5 during recovery of the core the hydrate is in a stable zone when the hydrostatic pressure of the core is below the phase equilibrium curve when the hydrostatic pressure of the sample exceeds the phase equilibrium curve and reaches point a the hydrate steady state is destroyed the hydrate can be changed from state a to point b by freezing at which point the core returns to a steady state the advantages of using hbfs are as follows a the hydrate decomposition is suppressed by cooling and a complicated pressure holding mechanism is not required b there is no size limit without the ball valves or flap valves and c the hydrate samples obtained are frozen and do not require a pressure core transfer system the operation of the hole bottom freezing drilling tool is shown in fig 6 a mixture of 195 k alcohol and dry ice was chosen as the cold source of the drilling tool the cold source was stored in the storage chamber during the drilling process the storage chamber and the freezing chamber were isolated by a control valve the insulation material in the storage chamber isolated the heat transfer from the cold source and the environment to avoid loss of cold energy at this time the control valve was supported by the spring in the initial position as shown in fig 6 a after drilling the drilling tool was lifted the control valve moved down to apply pressure to the storage chamber and the piston opened the injection channel between the storage chamber and the freezing chamber opened and the cold source was injected into the freezing chamber as shown in fig 6 b the cold source and the hydrate core underwent a phase change convective heat transfer after which the core temperature decreased rapidly as shown in fig 6 c during this process the co2 gas produced by the dry ice gasification was discharged by the vent valve the insulating material in the freezing chamber isolated the heat exchange of the mixture from the external environment as shown in fig 6 d 3 tests the cold source of the hole bottom freezing drilling tool was stored in the storage chamber for a long time and the core temperature was lowered which was the main function of the drilling tool thus the cold source storage and the freezing function of the drilling tool were tested 3 1 materials a mixture of alcohol and dry ice was used as the cold source liquid nitrogen was injected into 2 l of normal temperature anhydrous ethanol 99 and the temperature was lowered to 163 k then 2 kg of dry ice powder was placed in the cold alcohol dry ice does not vaporise in cold alcohol because the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice at atmospheric pressure is 195 k finally an alcohol dry ice mixture was obtained by constant stirring it is very difficult to form a hydrated core inside the drill and to monitor its temperature and pressure changes the experiment used 10 water containing sand as the simulated core the parameters are listed in table 1 li et al 2010 the density and specific heat capacity of the two samples can be calculated by equations 1 and 2 galushkin 1997 the results are listed in table 2 density of ngh deposits and simulated core 1 ρ 1 ϕ ρ r s h ϕ ρ h s a ϕ ρ w specific heat capacity of ngh deposits and simulated core 2 c ρ r cr 1 ϕ ρ h ch ϕ s ρ w cw ϕ s a ρ the thermophysical properties of the simulated core were similar to those of the gas hydrate deposits in the shenhu area of the south china sea the simulated core had a higher specific heat capacity therefore the cold source needed to absorb more heat from the simulated core to freeze it to the desired temperature the lower thermal conductivity indicated that the heat transfer inside the simulated core was slower and more time was required to freeze the simulated core as a result the simulated core was more difficult to freeze than the hydrate core if the simulated core can be frozen to the desired temperature so too can the hydrate core 3 2 apparatus and procedures the experimental system is shown in fig 7 the system consisted of appliances a well mobile drilling derricks a slush pump a monitor a pipeline and a mud box the mud mixture of pure water and small amount of clay was pumped from the mud box by the slush pump injected into the well by the pipeline and then returned to the mud box from the well to simulate the actual drilling process the mobile drilling derricks provided the rotational power for the drill during the test the temperature and pressure within the equipment were monitored the apparatus consisted of a storage chamber a control mechanism and a freezing chamber the structural parameters of the apparatus are listed in table 3 the cold source was stored inside the storage chamber and the sample was placed in the core barrel a control rod was pushed to open the control valve so that the cold source entered the freezing chamber through the injection channel the co2 generated by the dry ice gasification was discharged through the relief valve the storage chamber and the freezing chamber were wrapped by the insulation layer to prevent the loss of cold energy during the test the temperature and pressure of the cold source in the storage chamber were monitored to calculate the loss of cold energy the temperatures at nine points of the core were monitored to describe the effect of the core being frozen the positions of the monitoring points are shown in fig 8 and its coordinates are listed in table 4 the test procedure involved loading a simulated core into the core barrel and then injecting a cold source into the storage chamber the apparatus was placed in the well by the mobile drilling derricks and the mud was circulated through the mud pump the cold source storage tests took 120 min after 120 min the control valve was opened a cold source was injected into the freezing chamber and the freezing core test was started the test time was 1 h and the sensor monitored the temperature changes at different positions of the core the gas generated during the freezing process was discharged from the relief valve 3 3 results and analysis the cold source storage process refers to the period from the addition of the cold source to the end of the coring the average time taken by the hybrid press coring system in the 18 coring process of the nankai trough was 86 min inada and yamamoto 2015 in the test the storage time of the cold source was assumed to be 120 min to ensure sufficient experimental time the temperature and pressure changes in the chamber during storage are shown in fig 9 during the 120 min period the temperature of the mixture rose from 177 18 k to 200 21 k and the pressure increased from 0 1 mpa to 0 17 mpa it can be seen from the comparison between the p t curve of the mixture in the storage process and the critical decomposition curve of dry ice fig 10 that the critical decomposition pressure of dry ice at 177 18 k was 0 021 mpa which was less than the normal pressure the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice under normal pressure is 195 5 k therefore when the cold source temperature is lower than 195 5 k the dry ice in the mixture will not decompose no decomposition occurred until the temperature of the mixture reached 195 5 k 0 85 min and the pressure in the storage chamber was maintained at normal pressure as shown in fig 9 during this process there was a loss of cold energy from the mud because of the temperature difference between the mixture and the environment the mud temperature was 253 15 k the heat insulating layer outside the storage chamber slowed down the heat exchange therefore the temperature of the mixture rose uniformly in the time range 0 85 min at a rate of 0 22 k min in the range 85 120 min since the mixture temperature was higher than 195 5 k which exceeded the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice under normal pressure the heating rate of the mixture gradually decreased at this time the dry ice in the mixture entered the decomposition zone and the dry ice decomposed as shown in fig 10 dry ice decomposition is an endothermic reaction therefore the rate of temperature increase gradually reduced in the range 85 120 min in addition as the temperature of the mixture increased the temperature difference with the environment decreased resulting in a decrease in heat exchange it can also be seen from the trend of temperature variation in the range 0 85 min that the temperature increase slowly reduced the pressure in the storage chamber gradually increased from 0 1 mpa to 0 17 mpa because of the co2 generated by the decomposition of dry ice as shown in fig 9 when the pressure in the chamber reached 0 15 mpa the temperature of the mixture was 199 62 k which is the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice as the pressure in the chamber was further increased the dry ice gradually entered the stable zone as shown in fig 10 the analysis considers that the heat of vaporisation of dry ice slows down the heating rate of the mixture and the temperature of the mixture gradually decreases below the critical decomposition temperature of dry ice therefore when the chamber pressure was 0 15 mpa the mixture returned to the stable region again however since the temperature sensor reflects the temperature change at a point in the cold storage chamber the temperature in the chamber is not evenly distributed the temperature of the mixture near the wall of the chamber will be higher than the temperature at the centre some dry ice still decomposes in the chamber therefore the pressure in the chamber after the end of the storage test was 0 17 mpa we used cold energy loss as an indicator to evaluate the storage performance the amount of dry ice lost during storage was calculated the ideal gas state equation was used to calculate the loss of dry ice in the cold source storage process 3 n p v z r t where p is the gas pressure v is the gas volume n is the amount of gas substance t is the system temperature r is the proportional coefficient and z is the compressibility factor for co2 the cold source total energy calculation formulae included the following sensible heat q s1 δt 1 vc v latent heat q l1 m 1 r total cold energy q a q s1 q l1 where δt 1 is the change in the temperature of the cold source from 283 k to 163 k v is the total volume of the cold source m 1 is the mass of the cold source m is the mass of the loss of dry ice r is the latent heat of vaporisation of the cold source and c v is the constant pressure specific heat of the cold source the cold energy utilisation efficiency of the cold source storage is 4 η s e 1 q d q a 1 q s d q l d q s 1 q l 1 1 δ t d v c v δ m r δ t 1 v c v m 1 r where q d is the total cold energy loss of the cold source in the storage process q sd is the sensible heat cold energy loss q ld is the latent heat cold energy loss δm is the mass of the cold source lost during storage and δt d is the temperature change of the cold source in the storage process the amount of dry ice lost during storage was 0 41 kg which is for 8 2 of the total dry ice mass the storage rate of cold energy in the storage process was 97 27 therefore there was almost no loss of cold energy in the storage process and the storage capacity of the drilling tool met the requirements the effect of the frozen core of the drilling tool is critical to achieve hbfs after the storage test the control valve of the apparatus was opened the cold source was injected into the freezing chamber and the freezing test was performed the 60 min process of recovering the drilling tool was simulated during the test the temperature curves at different locations of the core during the test are shown in figs 11 13 fig 11 shows the temperature of the upper core the temperature of the core dropped from 285 13 k to 241 9 k in 7 min and the cooling rate was 6 18 k min the temperature rose to 266 14 k in 7 60 min and the heating rate was 0 46 k min fig 12 shows the temperature of the central core the core temperature dropped from 285 26 k to 243 30 k in 6 min and the cooling rate was 6 99 k min the temperature rose to 268 88 k in 6 60 min and the heating rate was 0 47 k min fig 13 shows the temperature of the lower core the core temperature dropped from 285 11 k to 264 05 k in 15 min and the cooling rate was 1 4 k min the temperature rose to 271 77 k in 15 60 min and the heating rate was 0 17 k min figs 11 13 show that the temperature trends of the upper and middle cores were similar the lower core temperature dropped slowly and decreased less because the lower core was in contact with the mud and the heat exchange rate and heat transfer between them were greater than that in the other parts of the core the cold source quickly reduced the temperature of the core and maintained the temperature between 250 k and 270 k for 45 min the p t curve of the hydrate under standard conditions is shown in fig 14 if the hydrate does not decompose between 250 k and 270 k the core pressure needs to be maintained between 1 30 mpa and 2 28 mpa makogon and sloan 1994 this means that in the process of recovering the core the hydrate will decompose when the drilling tool is at a water depth of 130 m although it takes only approximately 3 min to lift the drill from 130 m to the deck it still affects the determination of the hydrate reservoir resources however since natural gas hydrates have an anomalous preservation effect at low temperatures the water produced when hydrates decompose below zero at atmospheric pressure forms an ice film on the surface of the hydrate and prevents its decomposition the hydrate can be maintained for a long time under atmospheric pressure when a hydrate is placed under normal pressure conditions at a temperature of 255 k the hydrate in a metastable state can be maintained for a long time without decomposition the hydrate only decomposed by 0 85 in 10 days gudmundsson et al 1994 istomin and yakushev 1992 the hydrate decomposition curve under the self protection effect is shown in fig 15 the temperature of the core gradually increased from point a to point b and was within the temperature range of anomalous preservation the temperature of the core during the freezing process was mainly in the green area about 45 min the temperature range of the core was the same as that of the anomalous preservation of methane hydrate and the hydrate hardly decomposed in this temperature range moreover the pore water in the core will freeze and block the internal pores of the sediment and hinder the release of pressure and inhibit the decomposition of hydrate wang et al 2018 fan et al 2017 in summary the drilling tool met the requirements of freezing 4 application of drilling tool 4 1 drilling tool and procedures drilling experiments were carried out in the loess layer to verify the full function of the drilling tool the depth of the well was 24 m the coring was taken at 8 16 m and the freezing core experiment was performed at 16 24 m the drilling tool is shown in fig 16 the drill was placed and raised into the well by the recoverer the positioner guaranteed that the drill did not move up during the drilling process the suspended structure ensured that a distance of 2 4 mm was maintained between the bottom surface of the drilling tool and the drill bit the single action structure ensured that the core barrel did not rotate with the drill bit during the coring process ensuring the integrity of the core the adjuster adjusted the overall length of the drill and cooperated with the suspended structure to ensure the position of the drill within the drill pipe at the end of the coring the cold source injection control mechanism caused the cold source to flow out of the storage chamber into the freezing chamber to freeze the core in the core barrel 4 2 operating procedures first the exhaust valve was checked and installed the functioning of the control mechanism and the single action structure were checked two litres of liquid nitrogen was added to 2 l of normal temperature alcohol the temperature of the alcohol was reduced to 163 k after which dry ice was added and the mixture was stirred evenly two litres of liquid nitrogen was used to pre cool the storage chamber after the pre cooling the alcohol dry ice mixture was injected into the storage chamber and the steps involved in the cold source preparation and injection into the cold storage chamber is shown in fig 17 the drilling tool was then placed in the well to begin drilling during the drilling process the cold source was stored in the storage chamber of the drilling tool after drilling the control mechanism was activated and the cold source was injected into the freezing chamber the discharge of air bubbles from the well indicates the start of the freezing process since the freezing process is very rapid the drilling tool can be recovered after the occurrence of bubble discharge after the drill is recovered the frozen core is removed from the core barrel 4 3 results of application first the drilling core function of the drilling tool was tested four coring tests were performed with a core diameter of 50 mm and a core length of 1 m the obtained loess cores are shown in fig 18 and the coring rates are listed in table 5 the results show that the drilling tool had a coring success rate of 90 no bubbles appeared in the well during the 120 min drilling time indicating that the cold source did not decompose in the storage chamber this shows that the drilling tool met the requirements of long term storage of the cold source in the well the positioner and suspended structure enabled the drill to reach the specified position accurately the cold source was smoothly injected into the freezing chamber a large number of bubbles appeared in the well indicating that the cold source was rapidly absorbing heat in the freezing chamber and the core was quickly becoming frozen the infrared temperature of the core after freezing is shown in fig 19 and the core surface temperature was approximately 253 k according to the previous analysis the temperature of the core was in the temperature range of the anomalous preservation effect and ensured that the hydrate core did not decompose during the recovery process 5 conclusion and outlook hbfs can be used not only for sampling gas hydrates in deep seawater but also for sampling subsurface hydrates the coring success rate of ptp is completely dependent on the quality of the mechanical seal but the complex environment at the bottom of the hole makes the mechanical seal too difficult to guarantee success hbfs does not encounter these problems this method inhibits the decomposition of hydrate by lowering the temperature mainly through the heat transfer between the cold source and the core and the mechanical sealing performance requirement of the drill is lower than that of the ptp technique through the functional test results the alcohol dry ice mixture with a temperature of 163 k was stored in the internal storage of the drill for 120 min under the condition of simulating the hydrate formation and the loss rate of cold energy was only 2 73 which proved that the cold source can be stored in the well for a long time the freezing test results show that the cold source can freeze the core to a minimum temperature of 241 9 k and ensure that the temperature of the core is within the temperature range of the anomalous preservation effect within 60 min at which time the hydrate hardly decomposes through the drilling experiment and the freezing core experiment the drilling tool can obtain the core and can freeze the loess core to 263 k which indicates that the drilling tool can effectively retrieve a frozen sample of a hydrate reservoir the principle of the method indicates that the decomposition of the hydrate by lowering the temperature of the core has a side effect that is the low temperature causes the water in the core to freeze resulting in a deviation in the physical property detection of the deposit in order to solve the problem of low success rate of the ptp and at the same time reduce the influence of low temperature on the core properties of hydrate deposits the next step is to incorporate the two methods into one drilling tool and use hbfs as an auxiliary function of ptp during the hydrate sampling process the core is obtained by pressure holding sampling and if the pressure is maintained the freezing function is not triggered if the pressure preservation fails the freezing function is automatically triggered to suppress the decomposition of the temperature of the hydrate core the two measures ensure that the hydrate core does not decompose which can greatly improve the success rate of hydrate coring moreover the degree of influence of this method on the characteristics of hydrate deposits is not clear especially the effects on porosity and permeability which need to be evaluated in future work credit authorship contribution statement guo wei writing
