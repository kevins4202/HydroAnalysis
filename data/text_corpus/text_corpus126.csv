providing estimates of total et possibly distinguishing between evaporation e and transpiration t but these models do not distinguish between green and blue et since irrigation water consumption refers to blue et the question is how these scholars handle this problem one method that has been practised is to estimate blue et as the difference between et under irrigated conditions and et under rainfed conditions e g mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 2011 liu and yang 2010 siebert and döll 2010 hoogeveen et al 2015 this approach is problematic since the rooting depth under rainfed conditions can substantially differ from the rooting depth under irrigated conditions affecting the water uptake by plants so that what is green e and t under rainfed conditions is not the same as green e and t under irrigated conditions mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 2011 partially solved this by simulating the rainfed case with a rooting depth as it would be under irrigated conditions but this approach is still unsatisfactory because irrigation affects the overall soil moisture dynamics over time so that green e and green t under irrigation are not necessarily the same as green e and t under rainfed conditions another problem with this approach is that in many regions rainfed agriculture is not even an alternative to irrigated agriculture so that the reference rainfed case is not available the approach of estimating blue et as total et under irrigated conditions minus total et under rainfed conditions has also been followed by romaguera et al 2014 who used remote sensing products for estimating total et under irrigation conditions and model simulations without irrigation this approach faces the same problem as the studies that compare two different model simulations another method to distinguish between green and blue et is to estimate blue et based on the relative addition to the soil of irrigation water and rainfall over time rost et al 2008 hanasaki et al 2010 fader et al 2011 this is a better way to pursue but the way this has been implemented has thus far been a bit simplistic ignoring the full dynamics within the soil drops of irrigation water or rainwater are not really followed along their pathways through the soil moisture and finally to e or t rost et al 2008 and fader et al 2011 for example distinguish different soil layers without accounting the green

this paper i propose a generic and physically based method for green and blue water accounting in crop cultivation the basis is formed by the underlying soil hydrology that determines the changes in

consumption irrigation efficiency and green and blue water footprints i will conclude by showing how the method presented here solves the ambiguities in green blue water accounting as mentioned above and i will recommend to integrate green blue water accounting in soil water balance models as a standard routine 2 why differentiate between green and blue water consumption the main reason to explicitly distinguish between green and blue water consumption that is consumption of rainwater versus groundwater or surface water is that the two sources of water differ in terms of possibilities for storage and use whereas rainwater is stored in the soil and is primarily used in situ for biomass growth food feed or energy crops production forest groundwater and surface water are stored in natural aquifers lakes and rivers but can also be abstracted or diverted transported and stored in artificial reservoirs and can be used for a variety of purposes from irrigating crops or trees to supplement rainwater to water supply for households municipal purposes and industries the range of beneficial uses for blue water is thus larger than for green water but this does not mean that green water is not beneficially used for our economy there are various reasons why we want to know how much green and blue water resources we consume for what and how efficient let me start with the relevance of irrigation efficiency when we are interested in the question which part of the irrigation water applied to the field benefits the crop we need to know blue t the irrigation efficiency at field level is defined as the fraction of the applied irrigation water volume that benefits the plant burt et al 1997 the volume of irrigation water that benefits the plant is blue t hence we need to be able to estimate that total water consumption in crop production is defined as the et over the growing period from planting to harvest in irrigated crop production the source of soil moisture and et is partly rainwater partly irrigation water and partly capillary rise with hydrological or crop growth models we are used to estimate total e and total t but for assessing irrigation efficiency we really need to know blue t the part of t that stems from irrigation another reason for our interest in blue t as well as blue e is the impact of blue water use on groundwater tables river flows and remaining blue water availability in a catchment which is not captured by the measure of irrigation efficiency perry 2007 contor and taylor 2013 grafton et al 2018 when we are interested in the question how much of the irrigation water gets lost from the catchment that is the part of the irrigation water that evaporates or transpires and does not infiltrate to groundwater or run off to streams again we need to know blue et blue water abstractions are not changing the water available in the catchment as long as we return the water after use to where we abstracted it blue water scarcity in a catchment depends on the volume of blue water consumption in comparison to blue water availability we are also interested in blue water consumption blue et as well as in green water consumption green et to evaluate how much water we consume per unit of crop produced in other words we may be interested to quantify the blue and green water footprint of crop production and analyse the extent to which we can reduce the blue and green water footprint per unit of product by either consuming less water while producing the same or producing more with the same amount of water hoekstra et al 2011 note that reducing the green and blue water footprint per unit of crop is the same as increasing water productivity which is expressed as the amount of crop produced per unit of water consumed molden 2007 in irrigated crop production one may aim to increase production per total amount of green and blue water consumed while in rainfed farming the focus can simply be the increase of production per drop of green water consumed yet another reason why we may be interested in estimating green and blue water consumption is to analyse the trade off between the two adding irrigation water to a crop field changes the water balance as a whole affecting the evaporation and water uptake and transpiration by plants as well chukalla et al 2015 for instance show how adding some irrigation water to an originally rainfed crop can increase green et but increase crop yield even more thus reducing the green water footprint per unit of crop produced perry et al 2009 refer to the case whereby one crop is replaced by another crop with a deeper rooting depth so that more water can be tapped from the soil profile if the crop was irrigated less irrigation blue water will be needed to achieve the same yield but the volume of rainwater green water that will be consumed will increase there are also trade offs at larger scale typically when shifting in a river basin from rainfed to irrigated production or vice versa or when shifting production from a basin with mainly rainfed agriculture to another basin with mostly irrigated farming or vice versa yet another example of shifting between green to blue water consumption is when changing from the cultivation of a rainfed winter crop to growing an irrigated spring crop or the other way around for various reasons we may thus be interested in knowing blue t blue e or blue et as a total to be distinguished from green t green e and green et as a total in reality however e and t appear undifferentiated so green and blue e and green and blue t cannot be measured directly they can only be inferred indirectly green and blue e and green and blue t aren t conventional hydrological concepts because for understanding hydrology it s logic and sufficient to work with total e and total t separating e and t into their green and blue components is useful though as this split unveils the origin of the water that evaporates or transpires green blue water accounts as extension to hydrological accounts thus tell something about the origin of stocks and flows most in particular for e and t or for et as a total it is highly relevant to know which parts come for rainwater and which parts from added irrigation water 3 the principle of tracing green and blue water in the soil water balance the accounting method proposed here is built on the idea that a valid question for any water flux leaving the soil and vegetation is what is the source particularly for nonbeneficial soil evaporation and beneficial crop transpiration we may want to know how much of that was irrigation water and how much rainwater or capillary rise from the groundwater in order to estimate green and blue e and t we need to trace the origin of e and t the e and t flows originate from soil water or water intercepted by vegetation these water stocks in turn originate from either precipitation or irrigation and sometimes partly from capillary rise as well if we know how much of the water in the soil and how much of the water intercepted by vegetation comes from precipitation or irrigation we also know the fractions of green and blue water in e and t therefore i propose a simple accounting method to keep track of the fractions green and blue water in the different soil and vegetation layers on a daily basis as a basis to estimate green and blue water fractions in all fluxes leaving each layer the method is as follows 1 a systematic recording of the green blue water composition is done per soil and vegetation layer the amount of green water in a soil or vegetation layer increases when rainwater enters that layer the amount of blue water in a layer increases when irrigation water or capillary rise enters that layer the green blue composition of the water storage in a layer is continuously updated based on the colours of the various inflows 2 at a certain point in time each water flux e g e or t from a specific soil or vegetation layer is composed of a green and a blue fraction equal to the green blue composition of the water storage in that layer at that point in time this assumes a homogeneous distribution of green and blue water in a layer the extended accounts are not necessarily limited to green and blue water the blue water accounts can be done separately for blue water originating from different sources hoekstra et al 2011 including for example irrigation water from surface water irrigation water from renewable groundwater irrigation water from fossil groundwater irrigation water from harvested rainwater irrigation water from domestic wastewater irrigation water from desalinated seawater and capillary rise from renewable groundwater at catchment scale it could be interesting to know how much blue water is consumed in crop production from these different water sources at the minimum level because of the essentially different soil water dynamics it is recommended to distinguish between blue water from irrigation water added to the field and blue water entering the soil water from below through capillary rise let me make a note here on the treatment of harvested rainwater rainwater harvesting refers to the local capture and storage of rainwater directly when it falls on the ground or shortly after it already has become runoff harvested rainwater is thus blue water which may be confusing given the use of the term rainwater because it is not contained in the soil but instead collected in a water reservoir from which the water can be distributed to any use using this harvested rainwater is thus blue water use and any consumption following from it will be a form of blue water consumption the accounting method presented here is physically based the outcomes could be empirically tested using tracer methods for example if we would add a tracer substance to irrigation water and measure the occurrence of that tracer in the surface runoff evaporative flows and groundwater recharge we could establish which fractions of these water flows originate from the added irrigation water the same is true for the soil water in different soil layers at any moment in time one could measure the occurrence of the tracer in the soil moisture in a particular soil layer and establish which fraction of the soil moisture in that layer apparently originates from irrigation water versus other sources like rain and capillary rise 4 the practice of tracing green and blue water in a soil water balance model how the accounting of green and blue water in crop cultivation is done precisely depends on the schematization of the vertical into one or more soil and vegetation layers and the schematization of water fluxes entering and leaving the various layers here i give a simple example for the case of one soil layer while distinguishing between three inflows infiltration of rainwater infiltration of irrigation water and capillary rise from the groundwater and three outflows evaporation transpiration and percolation to the groundwater besides we distinguish an overland runoff flow which subtracts from rainwater and irrigation water before infiltration into the soil fig 1 note that water entering the soil through capillary rise is blue water because the water originates from groundwater in the soil water balance model as shown in fig 1 the changes in the different components of the soil moisture are given by 1 d s g d t p p p i r o s g s g w r e t 2 d s b i d t i i p i r o s b i s g w r e t 3 d s b c d t c r s b c s g w r e t the

of the soil moisture and is practical also given that the various input data are generally available on a daily basis for any outflow f from the soil moisture e t gwr the part of f that has origin x precipitation irrigation or capillary rise follows at any time from 7 f x t s x t s t f t the example provided here is for the case of a simple soil water balance model with only one soil layer and has been successfully applied in a few case studies already chukalla et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 karandish and hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 in the case of various soil layers the accounting principle remains the same the colour composition of each soil layer is to be recorded over time based on the colour compositions of incoming and outgoing water fluxes the model presented here also doesn t distinguish between evaporation from the soil and evaporation of water intercepted by the leaves and stems of the vegetation if a vegetation layer and the process of interception is added the green blue water accounting principle will need to be applied to this layer as well the green blue water accounting as proposed here does not need any data on top of the data already required for the soil water balance model used the data required depend on the chosen soil water balance model not the extended green blue accounting the only practical issue when applying the proposed accounting method is that an initial green blue composition of the soil water needs to be assumed for each layer when more than one layer is distinguished just like an overall soil moisture content needs to be assumed in simulation studies initialization is a well known problem and the general solutions often chosen in hydrological studies can also be applied for initialising the green blue composition of the soil water one option is to iteratively determine a realistic initial condition see e g chukalla et al 2015 another option is to run a model for two or more subsequent years just for initializing whereby the original assumption does not matter much because any error will not work through more than a few years and use only the simulated years after the initialization period see e g nouri et al 2019 5 from the green blue water accounts to estimating irrigation water consumption irrigation efficiency and green and blue water footprints the generic principle introduced here to distinguish between green and blue e and between green and blue t allows us to more accurately estimate irrigation water consumption irrigation efficiency and green and blue water footprints of crop production than before earlier assessments of blue et in irrigated crop production were rough estimations based on the relative addition to the soil of irrigation water and rainfall over time rost et al 2008 fader et al 2011 hanasaki et al 2010 or on taking the difference between et under rainfed conditions and et under irrigated conditions mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 siebert and döll 2010 an earlier assessment of blue et from capillary rise in production forests was similarly based on a rough assumption regarding the contribution of capillary rise without properly keeping track of the composition of the soil moisture schyns et al 2017 the accounting method presented offers an unambiguous way to estimate irrigation water consumption which refers to what in the accounts comes as blue evapotranspiration from irrigation water eb i tb i it is important to know irrigation water consumption because it is the part of the irrigation water applied to the field that does not return to the catchment through either runoff from the field or drainage it is the consumptive part of irrigation that contributes to blue water scarcity so it is highly relevant to estimate it accurately the accounting method also enables the calculation of irrigation efficiency ie as the ratio of blue transpiration from irrigation water tb i to the applied irrigation water i over the growing period of the crop zhuo and hoekstra 2017 8 i e t b i i it is to be noted here that if next to the harvested crop there are weeds or other forms of vegetation e g the cover under production trees as well one should distinguish between total crop t and weed other t and compute ie based on crop t by providing the distinction between green and blue e and t over the growing period the proposed accounting scheme easily allows the estimation of green and blue water footprints wf per unit of crop harvested by dividing the right components of e and t over the growing period by the crop yield y 9 w f g e g t g y 10 w f b i e b i t b i y 11 w f b c e b c t b c y all water footprints are calculated based on the sum of the beneficial consumption of water t and the nonbeneficial consumption of water e because the water footprint metric intends to show total water consumption related to production and this includes the waste fraction of consumption that is the unproductive evaporation from the soil for the blue wf of irrigation this means that it gets smaller when the unproductive consumption of water gets reduced measures to shift some of the nonbeneficial e to beneficial t e g through soil mulching thus increasing y will reduce the blue wf chukalla et al 2015 the blue wf related to consumption of irrigation water can be split up into different components if different sources of irrigation water are used and explicitly distinguished e g fossil groundwater renewable groundwater rivers lakes and harvested rainwater the blue wf can be split up according to these sources provided that separate tracing is done in the accounting for each of these sources 6 conclusion the confusion in the literature on whether green water refers to rainwater in the soil or to evapotranspiration of rainwater as was mentioned in the introduction has been solved here by acknowledging that green and blue do not refer to one particular stock or flow in the water cycle but are rather labels that tell something about the origin of water green and blue are labels that can be used both for water stored in a soil or vegetation layer and for a water flux that leaves from the soil or vegetation like the evaporation or transpiration flow green thus means originating from rainwater and blue means originating from groundwater or surface water in both cases we refer to the origin in the short term past because water keeps circulating so in the end all water can be traced back in some stage to both rainwater and runoff flows the issue here is whether when we trace for instance e t or soil moisture back to where it comes from we either end up first with rainfall or with groundwater or surface water the proposed green blue water accounting method helps to improve the estimation of irrigation water consumption irrigation efficiency and green and blue water footprints in agriculture although the emphasis has been on crop production the green blue water accounting method is equally applicable for forestry and gardening for all these purposes we need an accurate partitioning of e and t into a green and blue component the proposed method provides in a generic and accurate routine for that while all previous approaches relied on simplistic routines that did not do justice to the soil water dynamics the number of papers published in the field of green and blue water consumption in agriculture and forestry is growing quickly it would be helpful if researchers instead of relying on simplistic assumptions adopt the here proposed physically based tracing method which allows the precise assessment of green and blue fractions of soil moisture and water fluxes leaving the soil the minimum requirement is that the hydrological or crop growth model used includes a daily soil water balance currently there does not exist any hydrological or crop growth model that includes green blue water tracing hence researchers have to rely on post processing of the time series outputs from their model to simulate the colour composition of soil moisture and water fluxes leaving the soil see e g chukalla et al 2015 it is to be recommended to integrate green blue water accounting in soil water balance models which requires little effort other than add some additional coding to systematically keep track of the colour composition of soil moisture and soil water fluxes the interest in tracing the origins of water consumed in crop production increases wada et al 2014 for instance estimated irrigation water consumption distinguishing between irrigation from surface water and irrigation from groundwater at a global scale at a spatial resolution of 0 5 arc degree the next step is to systematically differentiate between irrigation from fossil versus renewable water resources it will be interesting also to map irrigation water consumption from inter basin water transfer schemes since irrigation water consumption is the largest contributor to blue water scarcity throughout the world mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 and since increasing water use efficiency and reducing blue water scarcity are targets in the un sustainable development goals vanham et al 2018 properly estimating irrigation water consumption is gaining in importance

explicitly distinguish between green and blue water consumption that is consumption of rainwater versus groundwater or surface water is that the two sources of water differ in terms of possibilities for storage and use whereas rainwater is stored in the soil and is primarily used in situ for biomass growth food feed or energy crops production forest groundwater and surface water are stored in natural aquifers lakes and rivers but can also be abstracted or diverted transported and stored in artificial reservoirs and can be used for a variety of purposes from irrigating crops or trees to supplement rainwater to water supply for households municipal purposes and industries the range of beneficial uses for blue water is thus larger than for green water but this does not mean that green water is not beneficially used for our economy there are various reasons why we want to know how much green and blue water resources we consume for what and how efficient let me start with the relevance of irrigation efficiency when we are interested in the question which part of the irrigation water applied to the field benefits the crop we need to know blue t the irrigation efficiency at field level is defined as the fraction of the applied irrigation water volume that benefits the plant burt et al 1997 the volume of irrigation water that benefits the plant is blue t hence we need to be able to estimate that total water consumption in crop production is defined as the et over the growing period from planting to harvest in irrigated crop production the source of soil moisture and et is partly rainwater partly irrigation water and partly capillary rise with hydrological or crop growth models we are used to estimate total e and total t but for assessing irrigation efficiency we really need to know blue t the part of t that stems from irrigation another reason for our interest in blue t as well as blue e is the impact of blue water use on groundwater tables river flows and remaining blue water availability in a catchment which is not captured by the measure of irrigation efficiency perry 2007 contor and taylor 2013 grafton et al 2018 when we are interested in the question how much of the irrigation water gets lost from the catchment that is the part of the irrigation water that evaporates or transpires and does not infiltrate to groundwater or run off to streams again we need to know blue et blue water abstractions are not changing the water available in the catchment as long as we return the water after use to where we abstracted it blue water scarcity in a catchment depends on the volume of blue water consumption in comparison to blue water availability we are also interested in blue water consumption blue et as well as in green water consumption green et to evaluate how much water we consume per unit of crop produced in other words we may be interested to quantify the blue and green water footprint of crop production and analyse the extent to which we can reduce the blue and green water footprint per unit of product by either consuming less water while producing the same or producing more with the same amount of water hoekstra et al 2011 note that reducing the green and blue water footprint per unit of crop is the same as increasing water productivity which is expressed as the amount of crop produced per unit of water consumed molden 2007 in irrigated crop production one may aim to increase production per total amount of green and blue water consumed while in rainfed farming the focus can simply be the increase of production per drop of green water consumed yet another reason why we may be interested in estimating green and blue water consumption is to analyse the trade off between the two adding irrigation water to a crop field changes the water balance as a whole affecting the evaporation and water uptake and transpiration by plants as well chukalla et al 2015 for instance show how adding some irrigation water to an originally rainfed crop can increase green et but increase crop yield even more thus reducing the green water footprint per unit of crop produced perry et al 2009 refer to the case whereby one crop is replaced by another crop with a deeper rooting depth so that more water can be tapped from the soil profile if the crop was irrigated less irrigation blue water will be needed to achieve the same yield but the volume of rainwater green water that will be consumed will increase there are also trade offs at larger scale typically when shifting in a river basin from rainfed to irrigated production or vice versa or when shifting production from a basin with mainly rainfed agriculture to another basin with mostly irrigated farming or vice versa yet another example of shifting between green to blue water consumption is when changing from the cultivation of a rainfed winter crop to growing an irrigated spring crop or the other way around for various reasons we may thus be interested in knowing blue t blue e or blue et as a total to be distinguished from green t green e and green et as a total in reality however e and t appear undifferentiated so green and blue e and green and blue t cannot be measured directly they can only be inferred indirectly green and blue e and green and blue t aren t conventional hydrological concepts because for understanding hydrology it s logic and sufficient to work with total e and total t separating e and t into their green and blue components is useful though as this split unveils the origin of the water that evaporates or transpires green blue water accounts as extension to hydrological accounts thus tell something about the origin of stocks and flows most in particular for e and t or for et as a total it is highly relevant to know which parts come for rainwater and which parts from added irrigation water 3 the principle of tracing green and blue water in the soil water balance the accounting method proposed here is built on the idea that a valid question for any water flux leaving the soil and vegetation is what is the source particularly for nonbeneficial soil evaporation and beneficial crop transpiration we may want to know how much of that was irrigation water and how much rainwater or capillary rise from the groundwater in order to estimate green and blue e and t we need to trace the origin of e and t the e and t flows originate from soil water or water intercepted by vegetation these water stocks in turn originate from either precipitation or irrigation and sometimes partly from capillary rise as well if we know how much of the water in the soil and how much of the water intercepted by vegetation comes from precipitation or irrigation we also know the fractions of green and blue water in e and t therefore i propose a simple accounting method to keep track of the fractions green and blue water in the different soil and vegetation layers on a daily basis as a basis to estimate green and blue water fractions in all fluxes leaving each layer the method is as follows 1 a systematic recording of the green blue water composition is done per soil and vegetation layer the amount of green water in a soil or vegetation layer increases when rainwater enters that layer the amount of blue water in a layer increases when irrigation water or capillary rise enters that layer the green blue composition of the water storage in a layer is continuously updated based on the colours of the various inflows 2 at a certain point in time each water flux e g e or t from a specific soil or vegetation layer is composed of a green and a blue fraction equal to the green blue composition of the water storage in that layer at that point in time this assumes a homogeneous distribution of green and blue water in a layer the extended accounts are not necessarily limited to green and blue water the blue water accounts can be done separately for blue water originating from different sources hoekstra et al 2011 including for example irrigation water from surface water irrigation water from renewable groundwater irrigation water from fossil groundwater irrigation water from harvested rainwater irrigation water from domestic wastewater irrigation water from desalinated seawater and capillary rise from renewable groundwater at catchment scale it could be interesting to know how much blue water is consumed in crop production from these different water sources at the minimum level because of the essentially different soil water dynamics it is recommended to distinguish between blue water from irrigation water added to the field and blue water entering the soil water from below through capillary rise let me make a note here on the treatment of harvested rainwater rainwater harvesting refers to the local capture and storage of rainwater directly when it falls on the ground or shortly after it already has become runoff harvested rainwater is thus blue water which may be confusing given the use of the term rainwater because it is not contained in the soil but instead collected in a water reservoir from which the water can be distributed to any use using this harvested rainwater is thus blue water use and any consumption following from it will be a form of blue water consumption the accounting method presented here is physically based the outcomes could be empirically tested using tracer methods for example if we would add a tracer substance to irrigation water and measure the occurrence of that tracer in the surface runoff evaporative flows and groundwater recharge we could establish which fractions of these water flows originate from the added irrigation water the same is true for the soil water in different soil layers at any moment in time one could measure the occurrence of the tracer in the soil moisture in a particular soil layer and establish which fraction of the soil moisture in that layer apparently originates from irrigation water versus other sources like rain and capillary rise 4 the practice of tracing green and blue water in a soil water balance model how the accounting of green and blue water in crop cultivation is done precisely depends on the schematization of the vertical into one or more soil and vegetation layers and the schematization of water fluxes entering and leaving the various layers here i give a simple example for the case of one soil layer while distinguishing between three inflows infiltration of rainwater infiltration of irrigation water and capillary rise from the groundwater and three outflows evaporation transpiration and percolation to the groundwater besides we distinguish an overland runoff flow which subtracts from rainwater and irrigation water before infiltration into the soil fig 1 note that water entering the soil through capillary rise is blue water because the water originates from groundwater in the soil water balance model as shown in fig 1 the changes in the different components of the soil moisture are given by 1 d s g d t p p p i r o s g s g w r e t 2 d s b i d t i i p i r o s b i s g w r e t 3 d s b c d t c r s b c s g w r e t the

of the soil moisture and is practical also given that the various input data are generally available on a daily basis for any outflow f from the soil moisture e t gwr the part of f that has origin x precipitation irrigation or capillary rise follows at any time from 7 f x t s x t s t f t the example provided here is for the case of a simple soil water balance model with only one soil layer and has been successfully applied in a few case studies already chukalla et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 karandish and hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 in the case of various soil layers the accounting principle remains the same the colour composition of each soil layer is to be recorded over time based on the colour compositions of incoming and outgoing water fluxes the model presented here also doesn t distinguish between evaporation from the soil and evaporation of water intercepted by the leaves and stems of the vegetation if a vegetation layer and the process of interception is added the green blue water accounting principle will need to be applied to this layer as well the green blue water accounting as proposed here does not need any data on top of the data already required for the soil water balance model used the data required depend on the chosen soil water balance model not the extended green blue accounting the only practical issue when applying the proposed accounting method is that an initial green blue composition of the soil water needs to be assumed for each layer when more than one layer is distinguished just like an overall soil moisture content needs to be assumed in simulation studies initialization is a well known problem and the general solutions often chosen in hydrological studies can also be applied for initialising the green blue composition of the soil water one option is to iteratively determine a realistic initial condition see e g chukalla et al 2015 another option is to run a model for two or more subsequent years just for initializing whereby the original assumption does not matter much because any error will not work through more than a few years and use only the simulated years after the initialization period see e g nouri et al 2019 5 from the green blue water accounts to estimating irrigation water consumption irrigation efficiency and green and blue water footprints the generic principle introduced here to distinguish between green and blue e and between green and blue t allows us to more accurately estimate irrigation water consumption irrigation efficiency and green and blue water footprints of crop production than before earlier assessments of blue et in irrigated crop production were rough estimations based on the relative addition to the soil of irrigation water and rainfall over time rost et al 2008 fader et al 2011 hanasaki et al 2010 or on taking the difference between et under rainfed conditions and et under irrigated conditions mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 siebert and döll 2010 an earlier assessment of blue et from capillary rise in production forests was similarly based on a rough assumption regarding the contribution of capillary rise without properly keeping track of the composition of the soil moisture schyns et al 2017 the accounting method presented offers an unambiguous way to estimate irrigation water consumption which refers to what in the accounts comes as blue evapotranspiration from irrigation water eb i tb i it is important to know irrigation water consumption because it is the part of the irrigation water applied to the field that does not return to the catchment through either runoff from the field or drainage it is the consumptive part of irrigation that contributes to blue water scarcity so it is highly relevant to estimate it accurately the accounting method also enables the calculation of irrigation efficiency ie as the ratio of blue transpiration from irrigation water tb i to the applied irrigation water i over the growing period of the crop zhuo and hoekstra 2017 8 i e t b i i it is to be noted here that if next to the harvested crop there are weeds or other forms of vegetation e g the cover under production trees as well one should distinguish between total crop t and weed other t and compute ie based on crop t by providing the distinction between green and blue e and t over the growing period the proposed accounting scheme easily allows the estimation of green and blue water footprints wf per unit of crop harvested by dividing the right components of e and t over the growing period by the crop yield y 9 w f g e g t g y 10 w f b i e b i t b i y 11 w f b c e b c t b c y all water footprints are calculated based on the sum of the beneficial consumption of water t and the nonbeneficial consumption of water e because the water footprint metric intends to show total water consumption related to production and this includes the waste fraction of consumption that is the unproductive evaporation from the soil for the blue wf of irrigation this means that it gets smaller when the unproductive consumption of water gets reduced measures to shift some of the nonbeneficial e to beneficial t e g through soil mulching thus increasing y will reduce the blue wf chukalla et al 2015 the blue wf related to consumption of irrigation water can be split up into different components if different sources of irrigation water are used and explicitly distinguished e g fossil groundwater renewable groundwater rivers lakes and harvested rainwater the blue wf can be split up according to these sources provided that separate tracing is done in the accounting for each of these sources 6 conclusion the confusion in the literature on whether green water refers to rainwater in the soil or to evapotranspiration of rainwater as was mentioned in the introduction has been solved here by acknowledging that green and blue do not refer to one particular stock or flow in the water cycle but are rather labels that tell something about the origin of water green and blue are labels that can be used both for water stored in a soil or vegetation layer and for a water flux that leaves from the soil or vegetation like the evaporation or transpiration flow green thus means originating from rainwater and blue means originating from groundwater or surface water in both cases we refer to the origin in the short term past because water keeps circulating so in the end all water can be traced back in some stage to both rainwater and runoff flows the issue here is whether when we trace for instance e t or soil moisture back to where it comes from we either end up first with rainfall or with groundwater or surface water the proposed green blue water accounting method helps to improve the estimation of irrigation water consumption irrigation efficiency and green and blue water footprints in agriculture although the emphasis has been on crop production the green blue water accounting method is equally applicable for forestry and gardening for all these purposes we need an accurate partitioning of e and t into a green and blue component the proposed method provides in a generic and accurate routine for that while all previous approaches relied on simplistic routines that did not do justice to the soil water dynamics the number of papers published in the field of green and blue water consumption in agriculture and forestry is growing quickly it would be helpful if researchers instead of relying on simplistic assumptions adopt the here proposed physically based tracing method which allows the precise assessment of green and blue fractions of soil moisture and water fluxes leaving the soil the minimum requirement is that the hydrological or crop growth model used includes a daily soil water balance currently there does not exist any hydrological or crop growth model that includes green blue water tracing hence researchers have to rely on post processing of the time series outputs from their model to simulate the colour composition of soil moisture and water fluxes leaving the soil see e g chukalla et al 2015 it is to be recommended to integrate green blue water accounting in soil water balance models which requires little effort other than add some additional coding to systematically keep track of the colour composition of soil moisture and soil water fluxes the interest in tracing the origins of water consumed in crop production increases wada et al 2014 for instance estimated irrigation water consumption distinguishing between irrigation from surface water and irrigation from groundwater at a global scale at a spatial resolution of 0 5 arc degree the next step is to systematically differentiate between irrigation from fossil versus renewable water resources it will be interesting also to map irrigation water consumption from inter basin water transfer schemes since irrigation water consumption is the largest contributor to blue water scarcity throughout the world mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 and since increasing water use efficiency and reducing blue water scarcity are targets in the un sustainable development goals vanham et al 2018 properly estimating irrigation water consumption is gaining in importance 
631,soil hydraulic characterization is crucial to describe the retention and transport of water in soil but current methodologies limit its spatial applicability this paper presents a cost effective general beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters best methodology using single ring infiltration experiments to derive soil hydraulic parameters for any unimodal water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions the proposed method relies on the best approach the novelty lies in the use of kosugi hydraulic parameters without need for textural information in addition the method uses a quasi exact formulation that is valid for all times which avoids the use of approximate expansions and related inaccuracy the new best methods were tested against numerically generated data for several contrasting synthetic soils and the results show that these methods provide consistent hydraulic functions close to the target functions the new best method is accurate and can use any water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions keywords soil hydraulic properties single ring infiltration experiments best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters kosugi hydraulic parameters van genuchten hydraulic parameters quasi exact implicit formulation 1 introduction water resource management depends on the predictive ability of spatially distributed hydrological models which require dense information on the sub grid spatial variability of soil hydraulic parameters describing the water retention θ h and the hydraulic conductivity k θ functions referred to as wrhcfs the direct determination of θ h and k θ is based on sampling and laboratory methods that are precise and reliable but scale limited laboratory approaches are often expensive tedious time consuming require specialist equipment and therefore are rather unrealistic for the large scale characterization of soil hydraulic properties particularly limiting for developing countries and non research organisations to circumvent these limitations soil pedotransfer functions have been widely used to estimate soil hydraulic properties van looy et al 2017 by using readily available measurements of soil particle size distribution psd e g nasta et al 2013a b soil bulk density and organic carbon e g balland and pollacco 2008 pollacco 2008 other explanatory variables include soil order classification texture and basic information from functional horizon descriptions mcneill et al 2018 however the accuracy of deriving the hydraulic parameters from pedotransfer functions is constrained by local calibration and they are less accurate than laboratory methods e g patil and singh 2016 another approach involves utilizing water infiltration techniques to characterize soil hydraulic parameters angulo jaramillo et al 2016 several approaches and methods have been developed based on a large array of water infiltration devices among these the beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters referred to as the best method was developed to derive the entire set of hydraulic parameters from beerkan experiments angulo jaramillo et al 2016 lassabatere et al 2006 the best approach involves directly measuring the initial soil water content θini l3l 3 the soil bulk density used to derive the saturated soil water content θs l3l 3 the psd and the cumulative infiltration through a single ring under near zero pressure head i l three main best methods were developed including the original one lassabatere et al 2006 its adaptation to coarse soils yilmaz et al 2013 and its adaptation to those cases when only the final steady water infiltration can be obtained bagarello et al 2014 all these methods consider the van genuchten 1980 water retention curve θ h with the burdine condition km 2 and the brooks and corey 1964 hydraulic conductivity function k θ table 1 the residual water content θ r l3l 3 is set at zero the saturated water content θ s is equal to the soil porosity the shape parameter n related to the van genuchten model table 1 referred to as vg is estimated from the psd using the pedotransfer functions detailed in lassabatere et al 2006 lastly the remaining scale parameters for hydraulic pressure head h vg l and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks l t 1 are derived from analysis of the infiltration data with the analytical approximate expansions proposed by haverkamp et al 1994 for steady and transient states the differences between the three models described above involve how they fit the transient and steady state models to the experimental infiltration curves the main advantage of the best approach is that the overall experiments are relatively fast robust low cost and easy to perform in addition field infiltration techniques sample large volumes of undisturbed soils thus improving the representativeness and accuracy of the estimated effective parameters in comparison to laboratory methods using small cores e g anderson and bouma 1973 carrick et al 2010 lauren et al 1988 the best method has been applied worldwide e g angulo jaramillo et al 2016 bagarello et al 2014 2017 di prima 2015 2016 lassabatere et al 2006 2013 but presents the following drawbacks it only works with a specific set of hydraulic functions the van genuchten 1980 model with burdine condition for θ h and the brooks and corey 1964 model for k θ that are not frequently used for modelling or even implemented in major modelling tools and software for instance this set of wrhcfs is not implemented in hydrus which is one of the most frequently used numerical models for flow and solute transfer šimůnek et al 2016 consequently the wrhcfs estimated by the current best methods are not easy to use it requires knowing the soil psd in order to infer the shape parameter n this becomes limiting for widespread application as accurate psd analysis requires specialist equipment and skills in addition the assumptions behind the pedotransfer functions proposed by lassabatere et al 2006 are not valid for all soils and are potentially questionable the best methods make use of approximate expansions that are valid only over restricted ranges and when used outside of their time validity intervals may lead to erroneous estimations to overcome these drawbacks described above we propose a generalization of the existing versions of best lassabatere et al 2009 to enable prediction of hydraulic parameters of any wrhcfs moreover the use of the kosugi hydraulic functions allows for the estimate of hydraulic parameters without psd data the robustness of the proposed universal best method is assessed by comparing the predictions of sorptivity s l t 0 5 ks and θ h derived by a the van genuchten 1980 model with the mualem condition km 1 for the θ h and k θ referred as vg wrhcfs described in table 1 and b the kosugi 1996 θ h and k θ models referred as kg wrhcfs described in table 1 with the robust and accurate quasi exact implicit qei formulation proposed by haverkamp et al 1994 we chose to compare to the qei formulations e g lassabatere et al 2009 latorre et al 2015 moret fernández and latorre 2017 parlange et al 1982 rather than to the original best formulation lassabatere et al 2009 which was derived from the qei formulation since the best formulation is always less accurate and requires psd measurements the manuscript is organised as follows section 2 outlines the theory behind the proposed new best methods section 3 presents the methods for the numerical computations section 4 assesses the validity of the new best methods section 5 summarises the key conclusions and section 6 summarizes recommendations for future work to improve the soil hydraulic parameterization estimated from best methods 2 theory previous best methods have relied on the van genuchten 1980 model with burdine condition along with the brooks and corey 1964 model table 1 estimating the full set of hydraulic parameters θr θs hvg ks n η based on the following 1 θr is considered to be zero and θs is equal to the soil porosity estimated from bulk density measurements 2 the shape parameter n is estimated from soil psd and used to derive the shape parameter η 3 the scale parameter ks is optimized concomitant with soil sorptivity s by fitting the experimental cumulative infiltration to the analytical models and 4 the scale parameter hvg is estimated from previous estimates of s and ks in the new versions we use the kosugi functions kg wrhcfs table 1 with the associated set of hydraulic parameters θr θs hkg ks σ but the proposed approach can work with any hydraulic model as in previous best methods θr is considered to be zero and θs is equal to the soil porosity estimated from bulk density measurements the model used to fit the data is directly described as a function of the soil hydraulic parameters including the sorptivity parameter s consequently the fit allows the direct estimation of parameters hkg ks σ when psd data are not available a particular approach is proposed for the kosugi model using a relation between hkg and σ that is used to define an objective function of with only two input variables reducing non uniqueness of the inverted hydraulic parameters in the following first we present the model and the objective functions that are used to fit experimental cumulative infiltrations in order to derive the hydraulic parameters in the new best methods then we describe how to derive the remaining hydraulic parameters from s and ks 2 1 using the quasi exact implicit formulation in the best method bestqei the bestqei method uses the model developed by haverkamp et al 1990 1994 for the 1d cumulative infiltration i 1d l under a constant zero or negative hydraulic pressure head at the surface into a soil with uniform initial water content the model was extended by smettem et al 1994 to the case of 3d cumulative infiltration i 3d through a disc source leading to the following expression 1a i 3 d t i 1 d t γ r ˇ δ θ s 2 t 1b 2 δ k 2 s 2 t 1 1 β 2 δ k s 2 i 1 d t k 0 t ln exp 2 β δ k s 2 i 1 d t k 0 t β 1 β where the subscripts 1d and 3d refer to the one dimensional and three dimensional cumulative infiltrations respectively δθ θ s θ 0 l3 l 3 corresponds to the difference between the final saturated water content and the initial water content r ˇ l is the ring radius of the infiltrometer and γ is a geometric shape parameter fixed at 0 75 haverkamp et al 1994 the term γ r ˇ δ θ if often denoted as a l 1 lassabatere et al 2013 in eq 1b δk ks k 0 l t 1 which is the difference between final saturated hydraulic conductivity and the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 k θ 0 and β is an integral shape parameter typically fixed at 0 6 haverkamp et al 1994 parlange et al 1982 the set of eq 1a and b yields the 3d cumulative infiltration into a single ring infiltrometer and is referred to as the qei model this model is valid for all times and can be written in a scaled from as proposed by lassabatere et al 2009 and varado et al 2006 2a i 3 d t s 2 2 δ k i s 2 2 δ k 2 t k 0 γ r ˇ δ θ s 2 t with i t being implicitly defined as the root of the

θ r θ s σ hkg ks and the initial water content θ 0 sorptivity s can be computed from the soil hydraulic parameters using the formulation proposed by parlange 1975 3a s θ 0 θ r θ s σ h k g k s θ 0 θ s

data is performed to estimate hkg ks and σ using a specific inverting procedure detailed below first a random set of hydraulic parameters σ hkg ks are selected second the inputs of the qei model are computed from σ hkg and ks the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 is computed from σ and ks using the kosugi hydraulic conductivity function defined in table 1 the sorptivity s σ hkg ks is computed using eq 3a then the observation data t obs i i obs i are scaled on the basis of the following procedure lassabatere et al 2009 4a t o b s i 2 δ k 2 s 2 t o b s i 4b i o b s i 2 δ k s 2 i o b s i k 0

assesses the difference between the right and left terms of eq 2b is defined it is important to note that the data set is split into two parts the transient and the steady states and the relative weights of these two states are determined by the value of w in order to strengthen the inverting procedure to avoid the over weights for the steady state 5 o f best qei σ h k g k s w n t r a n s i 1

for observed and simulated are always closer less discrepancy and smaller errors at the beginning of the infiltration process as for both curves i t 0 0 in order to balance the fit along the entire infiltration process transient and steady state it is necessary to account for the fact that the accumulated errors between these infiltrations are larger for the steady state subsequently if no transformation is performed for the steady state then the fit would preferentially fit the steady state and overlook the transient state therefore a log10 transformation is performed for the steady state which allows the different order of magnitude between transient and steady state errors to be compensated for fine tuning a weighting w is introduced with an optimal value of w 0 2 obtained by trial and error the novelty of the proposed o f best qei is that it is not biased by the ratio of the number of observations in the steady and transient phases the number of data points that belong to the transient and steady states is calculated by comparing the related time with the threshold t trans steady qei t this threshold corresponds to the time at which the infiltration state passes from transient to steady it is directly derived from the experimental cumulative infiltration curve assuming that it separates the two parts of the curves that are concave and linear these parts represent the transient and steady states respectively a linear regression is performed on the last points that align on the final straight line and the related slope and intercept are computed then the next point starting from the end is interpolated and the following condition is tested 6 i 3 d t i 3 d interpolated t δ t p transient steady where δt t is the time step for the cumulative infiltration data and p transient steady was fixed at a value of 0 05 mm s 1 obtained as a threshold representing the deviation from linearity the procedure is stopped as soon as the equation is no longer valid which highlights a too strong deviation of the point from the straight line the transition time is defined by the last point that validates eq 6 the inverting procedure computes the objective function for several sets of hydraulic parameters an optimization algorithm computes the optimum hydraulic parameters note that the objective function o f best qei involves three parameters and may suffer from non uniqueness a specific strategy is defined to reduce the number of parameters and this is detailed in section 2 3 latorre et al 2015 have already implemented the qei model in their inversion algorithm however in this study the objective function is modified to improve the fitting procedure such that it is not biased by the ratio of the number of observations in the steady and transient phases 2 2 a new simplified approximate expansion into the best method bestsa the bestqei algorithm implements the qei model but it needs to be solved numerically therefore a new simplified expansion based on the two term approximation of haverkamp et al 1994 is proposed as follows 7a i 3 d trans t s t a s 2 b k s t 7b i 3 d steady t a s 2 k s t c s 2 k s the a l 1 parameter was already defined above while

steady sa i 3 d steady t a s 2 k s t c t t trans steady sa t trans steady sa s 2 1 b k s 2 this new version of best referred to as bestsa uses this new approximate expansion which has the advantage of being defined for all times in contrast to the original best the inverse modelling is performed in a similar way to that used for the bestqei method the hydraulic parameters σ hkg ks are used to derive all the inputs needed for i 3 d sa t particularly the initial relative hydraulic conductivity k 0 k s which is involved in constants b and c as well as in the sorptivity s through eq 3a the modelled data are then compared to the experimental data using the objective function o f best sa eq 9 this objective function splits the data into transient and steady states similar to o f best qei the objective function is then minimized to define the optimum values of σ hkg and ks 9 o f best sa σ h k g k s w t i t trans steady sa i o b s i i 3 d sa t i 2 t i t trans steady sa i o b s i i o b s

was found by trial and error to be equal to 0 5 the rationale for the logarithm transformation for the second term of the o f best sa is the same as for o f best qei eq 5 as described in section 2 1 2 3 reducing the non uniqueness of the kosugi hydraulic parameters the optimization of the hydraulic parameters using bestqei and bestsa suffers from non uniqueness when simultaneously inverting the three parameters σ hkg ks therefore it is proposed to reduce the non uniqueness of the kosugi parameters σ h kg considering the relationship between h kg and σ found by pollacco et al 2013a according to pollacco et al 2013a there is a positive linear correlation between h kg and σ for most soils larger median pore size small h kg which is characteristic of coarsely structured soils is linked to a smaller standard distribution dispersion of the pore size small σ this relationship can be explained by the fact that when h kg is small the soil tends to be single grain structured monodisperse and so σ tends to be small on the other hand when h kg is increased which is characteristic of finer material the soil structure becomes aggregated or the soil is composed of an array of grain sizes polydisperse and so σ tends to have a larger dispersion pollacco et al 2013a obtained a root mean squared error of 0 45 using a dataset of 73 soils by using the following relationship between h kg cm and σ 10 σ m o d p σ 1 ln h kg 10 1 p σ 2 where p σ1 0 382 and p σ2 1 080 are fitting parameters the optimization of the hydraulic parameters is therefore performed by optimizing only k s and h kg and deriving σ from σ mod as shown in fig 1 the input parameters of eqs 4a b and 8 that are used for the inversion procedure of bestqei and bestsa respectively are written as a function of σ mod hkg hkg ks instead of σ hkg ks thus only hk g and ks are optimized 3 materials and methods 3 1 synthetic soils and cumulative infiltrations this study uses six contrasting synthetic soils investigated by latorre et al 2015 selected from the soil database of carsel and parrish 1988 their wrhcfs are described using the van genuchten 1980 model along with the mualem condition k m 1 and the mualem 1976 capillary model related parameters are listed in table 3 vg column the fit of these hydraulic functions with kg functions led to values of σ between 0 98 and 2 74 simulations from latorre et al 2015 were used to model water infiltration into these soils these authors used a numerical domain 25 cm in radius and 25 cm in depth the mesh is made of 100 width 900 height elements the vertical dimension of cells varies between 0 003 cm near the surface to 0 3 cm at the bottom the cumulative infiltrations correspond to a disc radius of 10 cm a null constant head was applied at the upper boundary below the ring whereas a zero water flux condition was applied to the rest of the boundary initial water content was fixed close to the residual water content the maximum cumulative infiltration was fixed at 50 mm 3 2 equivalence between kg and vg wrhfcs and related hydraulic response one of the crucial points of this work concerns the generality of the best methods in this section we derive the kg wrhcfs from the vg wrhcfs first the target vg wrhcfs were fitted to the kg wrhcfs the kg hydraulic parameters are derived from the vg parameters n and h vg for the mualem model k m 1 by minimizing the objective function o f θ k g which is based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency formulation 11 o f θ k g w i i n s e kg h i s e vg h i 2 i i n s e kg h i s e kg h i 2 w 1 i i n l n k r kg h i ln k r vg h i 2 i i n l n k r kg h i l n k r kg h i 2 where w is a weighting parameter which is equal to 0 5 as recommended by pollacco et al 2013a b and n is the number of discretised s e data points which is equal to 1000 the parameter w rules the relative weights assigned to the fits of the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity curve the feasible range of parameters used for the fits is listed in table 2 these values are based on latorre et al 2015 for ks and on pollacco et al 2013a b for the kosugi σ and hk g as well as the van genuchten n and hv g parameters second the capability of the kg wrhcfs to predict the target cumulative infiltrations is evaluated the optimized kg wrhcfs were used to compute the analytical qei and sa models these analytical data were compared to the numerically generated cumulative infiltration from latorre et al 2015 in addition to an adequate representation of the original θ h and k θ the optimized kg wrhcfs should provide similar cumulative infiltrations to those generated numerically using the vg wrhcfs the agreement between analytically generated data using kg wrhcfs i sim ti and numerically generated data using the vg wrhcfs in the hydrus 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 ihydrus ti was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse i defined as follows 12 n s e i 1 i 1 i n i h y d r u s t i i sim t i 2 i 1 i n i h y d r u s t i i h y d r u s t i 2 where n corresponds to the maximum number of infiltration data the computation of analytically generated data and the performance of the inverting procedure require the computation of s the numerical integration of s eq 3a and b is non trivial because the integration is ill posed since lim θ θ s d θ therefore it is necessary to limit the highest soil water content to θ end θ se 1 10 9 it was found that 10 9 is the smallest value before getting numerical instability the integration was computed in julia programming language using the quadgk package https juliamath github io quadgk jl stable 3 3 inverting procedure related goodness of fit and model accuracy the global optimization of the hydraulic parameters was performed using a robust global optimizer blackboxoptim in julia language https github com robertfeldt blackboxoptim jl due to the imposed constraints it proved successful to use the local optimizer optim optimize goldensection also in julia language https github com robertfeldt blackboxoptim jl mogensen and riseth 2018 which is considerably faster than the global optimizer the goodness of fit of fitted modelled data i sim to match the target numerically generated observations i hydrus was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency formulation nse i described above the accuracy of the different inverting procedures was evaluated considering the relative errors er between estimated and target parameters 13 e r x 1 x est x target x target where x est and x target are the values of any parameter estimated by the inverting procedure and the corresponding target respectively note that the target values for the hydraulic parameters correspond to those derived from the previous fit of kg wrhcfs to the original vg wrhcfs 4 results and discussion the validity of the new best method is assessed using the following steps section 4 1 demonstrates the capability of the optimized kg wrhcfs to fit the target vg wrhcfs section 4 2 shows that the qei and the new best method parameterized with known vg and kg hydraulic parameters could reproduce the target cumulative infiltrations derived with the hydrus 3d model section 4 3 1 derives the accuracy of predicting infiltration transition time saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity by inverting the hydraulic parameters of the qei and the new best method with cumulative infiltration without constraining the hydraulic parameters i e without using the relationship between σ and h kg section 4 3 2 describes the accuracy of the qei and the new best method to predict wrhcfs and the kosugi hydraulic parameters by inverting the hydraulic parameters with cumulative infiltration by constraining the hydraulic parameters with the relationship between σ and h kg 4 1 comparison between vg and kg wrhcfs the capability of the optimized kg wrhcfs to fit observed vg wrhcfs is assessed and depicted in fig 2 with the related optimized parameters listed in table 3 columns h kg and σ along with the observed vg hydraulic parameters the fits clearly align on the target curves in all cases fig 2 and the related values of nse i attest to the quality of fits table 3 column nseθ k although vg and kg correspond to different mathematical expressions they can simulate similar hydraulic functions in particular for σ 2 or n 1 37 the target curves are marginally less accurate for σ 2 with a slight deviation at high suctions fig 2 left these results show that either vg or kg wrhcfs can be used to characterize the wrhcfs for a more comprehensive comparison of vg and kg formulations readers are referred to assouline and or 2013 and cornelis et al 2005 4 2 capability of known kg wrhcfs to reproduce target cumulative infiltrations computed with hydrus 3d the capability of the optimized kg wrhcfs by using bestqei and bestsa to reproduce the target cumulative infiltrations obtained with the hydrus 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 ihydrus ti is assessed the kg parameters were used to compute the analytical model inputs ks k 0 s and the corresponding cumulative infiltration curves fig 3 left column shows that both bestqei kg and bestsa kg are very close to the target numerical cumulative infiltrations ihydrus ti for the case of loam 1 loam 2 and silt σ 0 98 1 60 and 2 00 respectively with values of nse i coefficients equal to unity table 3 columns qei kg nsei and qei vg nsei conversely the fits are less good with lower values for the nse i coefficients but also close to unity for silty loam σ 2 74 silty clay loam σ 1 65 and sandy loam σ 1 79 such inadequacy was already reported by lassabatere et al 2009 where discrepancies between analytical models and target numerical cumulative infiltrations were explained based on the failure of certain conditions needed for the qei model haverkamp et al 1994 in this study an explanation for the discrepancy is based on the shape of the wrhcfs and in particular the steep slope of dk se dse near saturation to illustrate this the indicator δ k θ s is used 14 δ k θ s k s k s e 0 99 1 s e table 3 shows that soils showing less good fit silty clay loam σ 1 65 sandy loam σ 1 79 and silty loam σ 2 74 have large δ k θ s 150 cm h 1 and so the match between the analytical models and the real cumulative infiltration may be questionable for soils with δ k θ s 150 cm h 1 and further investigation may need to be conducted with experimental field data however the worst case in terms of agreement between wrhcfs and related cumulative infiltrations corresponds to silty loam whereas the highest value for δ k θ s is obtained for sandy loam the proposed indicator for the mismatch between wrhcfs and related cumulative infiltrations may be combined in future research with alternative indicators lassabatere et al 2009 proposed indicators based on wrhcfs and the shape parameter β but this aspect will be the subject of further research for completeness fig 3 right column shows good agreement between cumulative infiltration derived with bestqei formulation using observed kg and vg hydraulic parameters we conclude that the computed infiltration by using bestqei and bestsa and hydraulic parameters for vg and kg matches accurately ihydrus ti for soils with δ k θ s 150 cm h 1 nevertheless since bestqei and bestsa have been tested with numerically generated data with hydrus 3d the bestqei and bestsa should be further tested with field experimental data 4 3 accuracy of the inverted bestqei and bestsa in the previous section the capability of kg wrhcfs to adequately model vg wrhcfs and the related computation of cumulative infiltration were investigated this section uses the new bestqei and bestsa methods to invert cumulative infiltrations and derive the corresponding wrhcfs and hydraulic parameters the vg hydraulic parameters of the synthetic soils were used with the hydrus 3d software to numerically generate cumulative infiltrations ihydrus ti then infiltration data were inverted with bestqei and bestsa to derive the full set of hydraulic parameters and the related sorptivity it is expected that both the estimated hydraulic parameters and the fits are less accurate for the cases of silty clay loam sandy loam and silty loam since the kg model has more difficulties depicting the target vg wrhcfs and to model properly the corresponding cumulative infiltrations 4 3 1 unconstrained optimization without using relationship between σ and hkg the use of the relationship between σ and hkg eq 10 does not improve the predictions of infiltration s and ks since there is an infinite combination of σ and hkg which gives similar values of s eq 3a and b their relative errors are equal for the constrained and unconstrained case as shown in table 4 however this relationship is essential for a complete characterization of all the parameters 4 3 1 1 prediction of infiltration and transition time target cumulative infiltrations were properly modelled by the inverted hydraulic parameters obtained with bestqei and bestsa as shown in fig 4 these results validate the methodology and prove the efficiency of both objectives functions o f best qei and o f best sa however the predicted transition times between the transient and steady states t trans stead are not always the same for bestqei and bestsa the reason for this is that the best method assumes that infiltration in the steady state increases linearly with time eq 7b while the qei formulation does not because it considers the non linear lateral flow therefore t trans stead of the best method is overestimated due to ignoring the non linearity of the steady state the inversion of infiltration data using bestqei and bestsa is accurate but t trans stead computed by bestqei is considered more realistic than computed by bestsa in fact bestsa becomes linear faster than bestqei since bestsa is an approximation of bestqei of order 2 this is why t trans stead is always smaller for bestqei than for bestsa 4 3 1 2 ability to predict ks and s ks and s are depicted in fig 5 the results shown in fig 5 left and the values of er ks listed in table 4 confirm the predictions of k s are accurate for both methods indeed most of the points are close to the straight line 1 1 indicating that estimated values are close to the targets the estimates are comparable between bestqei and bestsa the results shown in fig 5 right and er s table 4 confirm that the two methods bestqei and bestsa perform well for the estimation of s with estimates close to target values similar results were obtained by latorre et al 2015 for most soils bestsa and bestqei have comparable estimates note that s is estimated with more accuracy than k s the scales are logarithmic for fig 5 left versus linear for fig 5 right lastly the scattering of data points over both sides of the straight line 1 1 on both subpanels of fig 5 demonstrates there is no trend to overestimate or underestimate the target this is important because it shows the methods do not systematically overestimate or underestimate parameters meaning that they are not biased with the data used the predictions made with bestsa are comparable to those made with bestqei 4 3 2 constrained optimization using relationship between σ and hkg 4 3 2 1 ability to predict wrhcfs the quality of bestsa and bestqei was assessed by comparing the estimated and target wrhcfs and analysing the values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients n s e θ k table 4 estimations of the wrhcfs are close to the target curves in particular for loam 2 silty clay loam sandy loam and silt larger discrepancies are found for loam 1 and silt loam figs 5 and 6 with lower values of n s e θ k as shown in table 4 for all considered soils bestqei and bestsa provide similar estimated wrhcfs less accurate estimates for some soils were expected as stated above it was proven that for some types of soils the computations of the cumulative infiltrations using the analytical models used by bestqei or bestsa methods do not align on the target infiltration curves ihydrus ti consequently the bestqei or bestsa inverting procedure will compensate for such mismatch by mis estimating the hydraulic parameters and related wrhcfs deviating these far from the targets fig 6 therefore implementation of the relation between the scale parameter hkg and the shape parameter σ strengthens the bestqei and bestsa methods the reduction in the number of optimizable parameters facilitates the inverting procedure when three parameters are considered σ hkg ks the objective functions do not define a single minimum but a large zone then depending on the initial values the inverting algorithm may converge towards contrasting sets of optimized parameters and probably contrasting wrhcfs conversely the objective function related to bestqei and bestsa is defined as a function of only two parameters hkg ks the concomitant optimization of two parameters is less sensitive and more robust leading to more accurate estimates to demonstrate this the data were inverted using the same framework for bestqei and bestsa without any constraints i e without the relation σ mod hkg resulting in worse results with lower values for the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient n s e θ k table 4 in fact the implementation of the relation between σ and hkg through eq 10 in the bestqei and bestsa methods is one of the main advantages of the methodologies the use of σ mod hkg enables predictions of wrhcfs for most soils in the absence of psd improved predictions are foreseen when relationships of β are computed as a function of the wrhcfs and when field experimental infiltration is used instead of that computed by hydrus 3d this question has already been raised by lassabatere et al 2009 where the value of the β parameter often fixed at 0 6 was questioned latorre et al 2015 proved that the β parameter plays a role in modelling water infiltration data therefore future studies will determine if varying β would improve the predictions of wrhcfs 4 3 2 2 ability to predict σ and hkg the accuracy of estimating σ and h kg cannot be assessed because the estimated hydraulic parameters are related to kg functions whereas target hydraulic parameters are related to vg functions consequently the values of the hydraulic parameters cannot be directly compared moreover the direct comparison of hydraulic parameters even defined for similar functions may be tricky pollacco et al 2008 showed that there are equally good combinations of hydraulic parameters which are sets of truly linked parameters in other words different combinations of σ and h kg could produce a similar fit of θ h and k θ depicted in fig 6 it is expected that more physical σ and h kg values would be obtained if they were further constrained from the relationship between k s and hydraulic parameters related to θ h pollacco et al 2013a 2017 this issue will be the subject of further investigation in the absence of psd the new best approach relying on eq 10 makes it possible to estimate these parameters but we cannot be sure they correspond to the real values 5 conclusions this paper develops two novel methods bestqei and bestsa which generalize the existing best methods to make predictions of any unimodal θ h and k θ in fact these methods predict the wrhcfs on the basis of kg formulae but it is demonstrated that these functions may depict any of the formulations for wrhcfs including the vg type kg functions were chosen because they are based on physical principles log normal distribution for pore size distributions in the absence of psd the developed bestqei and bestsa allow estimates of the full set of hydraulic parameters from the cumulative infiltration but require a link between the kg parameters i e relationship between σ and h kg as in eq 10 this simplifies the procedures and avoids sources of errors due to the hypotheses behind the use of the pedotransfer functions of the previous best methods the developed new best methods are valid for all times and always manage to provide estimates without any failure this alleviates troubles and dysfunctions often encountered with the previous best methods in addition the objective functions of bestqei or bestsa are improved because they consider both transient and steady states and optimize their related contributions to the global objective function another novelty is the constraint implemented in these objective functions by defining the shape parameter σ as a function of the scale parameter for hydraulic pressure head h kg as explained above the proposed bestqei and bestsa methods were validated using numerically generated cumulative infiltrations with the hydrus 3d model for several synthetic soils following is a summary of the results unconstraining the feasible parameter space the predictions made with bestsa are comparable to those made with bestqei but this needs further testing with real experimental data similar results were obtained by deriving the hydraulic parameters of kg and vg these results suggest that bestqei and bestsa methods are general since they equally well represent any type of wrhcfs the computed infiltration by using bestqei and bestsa and observed hydraulic parameters accurately matches generated cumulative infiltration data with hydrus 3d for soils with a low gradient of hydraulic conductivity close to saturation it is hypothesized that soils exhibiting specific hydraulic properties with high gradients could be inadequate for the use of the best model as already discussed by lassabatere et al 2009 the bestqei and bestsa should be further tested with real experimental data to settle this hypothesis the inversion of infiltration by using bestqei and bestsa is accurate but t trans stead computed by bestqei is considered more realistic than that computed by bestsa bestsa and bestqei make accurate predictions of s and k s with s being predicted slightly more accurately than k s constraining the feasible parameter space to constrain the feasible parameter space or make predictions without psd it is necessary to establish a relationship between the shape and scale hydraulic parameters as in eq 10 although the predictions of wrhcfs are reasonable accurate for most soils σ and h kg exhibit sets of truly linked parameters and therefore their predictions are not unique it is foreseen that more physical σ and h kg values would be obtained with further constraints between k s and the hydraulic parameters of the kg model 6 future work and recommendations to improve best the new best procedure proves quite promising however additional research is needed to clarify the following points the model has been tested with numerically generated data and it should be further tested with real experimental data in addition experimental data could help to understand why some of the soils are less accurately characterized it will be extremely useful to develop automated infiltrometers that allow both multiple replicate measurements and greater measurement precision during the transient state particularly for soils with rapid infiltration and that also allow cumulative infiltration to be sampled for large times which is of interest for very low permeability soils automated infiltrometers often rely on use of pressure transducers with a mariotte type water supply tank however the bubbling within the mariotte tank does introduce considerable uncertainty in the transducer readings particularly under rapid infiltration during the transient phase water supply without the mariotte design would greatly improve the precision of measurements a key advantage of the best procedure is the simple equipment and measurement skills that allows estimation of a quantitative suite of wrhcf parameters however this requires a high mathematical skill to derive these parameters from the field data to achieve the potential widespread application of best measurements easy to use software will need to be developed to allow uptake and application by non soil physicists it will not be feasible to investigate the source of problems e g inaccuracy of computing s without performing an intensive field campaign where infiltration tests are combined with measurements of hydraulic parameters in the laboratory and with 2d axisymmetric modelling of the flow below the infiltrometer réfloch et al 2017 it is also recommended that infiltration experiments be combined with innovative non invasive methods such as ground penetrating radar which can show the wetting front evolution with time during water infiltration iwasaki et al 2016 klenk et al 2015 leger et al 2014a b 2015 salas garcía et al 2017 réfloch et al 2017 also showed that monitoring the extension of the soil moisture stain around the infiltration ring with time is valuable for deriving the horizontal and vertical hydraulic parameters the importance of compiling a worldwide data set with contrasting soils is clear such as the swig database rahmati et al 2018 particularly to improve the constraint of hydraulic parameters lastly analytical development is still needed to define more precisely the values of the infiltration parameters β and γ indeed these were proved to depend on the type of soil lassabatere et al 2009 and to have the potential to affect the values of estimates other approaches have aimed to relate these parameters to the wrhcfs fuentes et al 1992 improved predictions are also foreseen when the relationships of β and γ are obtained as a function of wrhcfs or of the type of soils and validated with experimental field data conflicts of interest there are no conflicts to declare

631,soil hydraulic characterization is crucial to describe the retention and transport of water in soil but current methodologies limit its spatial applicability this paper presents a cost effective general beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters best methodology using single ring infiltration experiments to derive soil hydraulic parameters for any unimodal water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions the proposed method relies on the best approach the novelty lies in the use of kosugi hydraulic parameters without need for textural information in addition the method uses a quasi exact formulation that is valid for all times which avoids the use of approximate expansions and related inaccuracy the new best methods were tested against numerically generated data for several contrasting synthetic soils and the results show that these methods provide consistent hydraulic functions close to the target functions the new best method is accurate and can use any water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions keywords soil hydraulic properties single ring infiltration experiments best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters kosugi hydraulic parameters van genuchten hydraulic parameters quasi exact implicit formulation 1 introduction water resource management depends on the predictive ability of spatially distributed hydrological models which require dense information on the sub grid spatial variability of soil hydraulic parameters describing the water retention θ h and the hydraulic conductivity k θ functions referred to as wrhcfs the direct determination of θ h and k θ is based on sampling and laboratory methods that are precise and reliable but scale limited laboratory approaches are often expensive tedious time consuming require specialist equipment and therefore are rather unrealistic for the large scale characterization of soil hydraulic properties particularly limiting for developing countries and non research organisations to circumvent these limitations soil pedotransfer functions have been widely used to estimate soil hydraulic properties van looy et al 2017 by using readily available measurements of soil particle size distribution psd e g nasta et al 2013a b soil bulk density and organic carbon e g balland and pollacco 2008 pollacco 2008 other explanatory variables include soil order classification texture and basic information from functional horizon descriptions mcneill et al 2018 however the accuracy of deriving the hydraulic parameters from pedotransfer functions is constrained by local calibration and they are less accurate than laboratory methods e g patil and singh 2016 another approach involves utilizing water infiltration techniques to characterize soil hydraulic parameters angulo jaramillo et al 2016 several approaches and methods have been developed based on a large array of water infiltration devices among these the beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters referred to as the best method was developed to derive the entire set of hydraulic parameters from beerkan experiments angulo jaramillo et al 2016 lassabatere et al 2006 the best approach involves directly measuring the initial soil water content θini l3l 3 the soil bulk density used to derive the saturated soil water content θs l3l 3 the psd and the cumulative infiltration through a single ring under near zero pressure head i l three main best methods were developed including the original one lassabatere et al 2006 its adaptation to coarse soils yilmaz et al 2013 and its adaptation to those cases when only the final steady water infiltration can be obtained bagarello et al 2014 all these methods consider the van genuchten 1980 water retention curve θ h with the burdine condition km 2 and the brooks and corey 1964 hydraulic conductivity function k θ table 1 the residual water content θ r l3l 3 is set at zero the saturated water content θ s is equal to the soil porosity the shape parameter n related to the van genuchten model table 1 referred to as vg is estimated from the psd using the pedotransfer functions detailed in lassabatere et al 2006 lastly the remaining scale parameters for hydraulic pressure head h vg l and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks l t 1 are derived from analysis of the infiltration data with the analytical approximate expansions proposed by haverkamp et al 1994 for steady and transient states the differences between the three models described above involve how they fit the transient and steady state models to the experimental infiltration curves the main advantage of the best approach is that the overall experiments are relatively fast robust low cost and easy to perform in addition field infiltration techniques sample large volumes of undisturbed soils thus improving the representativeness and accuracy of the estimated effective parameters in comparison to laboratory methods using small cores e g anderson and bouma 1973 carrick et al 2010 lauren et al 1988 the best method has been applied worldwide e g angulo jaramillo et al 2016 bagarello et al 2014 2017 di prima 2015 2016 lassabatere et al 2006 2013 but presents the following drawbacks it only works with a specific set of hydraulic functions the van genuchten 1980 model with burdine condition for θ h and the brooks and corey 1964 model for k θ that are not frequently used for modelling or even implemented in major modelling tools and software for instance this set of wrhcfs is not implemented in hydrus which is one of the most frequently used numerical models for flow and solute transfer šimůnek et al 2016 consequently the wrhcfs estimated by the current best methods are not easy to use it requires knowing the soil psd in order to infer the shape parameter n this becomes limiting for widespread application as accurate psd analysis requires specialist equipment and skills in addition the assumptions behind the pedotransfer functions proposed by lassabatere et al 2006 are not valid for all soils and are potentially questionable the best methods make use of approximate expansions that are valid only over restricted ranges and when used outside of their time validity intervals may lead to erroneous estimations to overcome these drawbacks described above we propose a generalization of the existing versions of best lassabatere et al 2009 to enable prediction of hydraulic parameters of any wrhcfs moreover the use of the kosugi hydraulic functions allows for the estimate of hydraulic parameters without psd data the robustness of the proposed universal best method is assessed by comparing the predictions of sorptivity s l t 0 5 ks and θ h derived by a the van genuchten 1980 model with the mualem condition km 1 for the θ h and k θ referred as vg wrhcfs described in table 1 and b the kosugi 1996 θ h and k θ models referred as kg wrhcfs described in table 1 with the robust and accurate quasi exact implicit qei formulation proposed by haverkamp et al 1994 we chose to compare to the qei formulations e g lassabatere et al 2009 latorre et al 2015 moret fernández and latorre 2017 parlange et al 1982 rather than to the original best formulation lassabatere et al 2009 which was derived from the qei formulation since the best formulation is always less accurate and requires psd measurements the manuscript is organised as follows section 2 outlines the theory behind the proposed new best methods section 3 presents the methods for the numerical computations section 4 assesses the validity of the new best methods section 5 summarises the key conclusions and section 6 summarizes recommendations for future work to improve the soil hydraulic parameterization estimated from best methods 2 theory previous best methods have relied on the van genuchten 1980 model with burdine condition along with the brooks and corey 1964 model table 1 estimating the full set of hydraulic parameters θr θs hvg ks n η based on the following 1 θr is considered to be zero and θs is equal to the soil porosity estimated from bulk density measurements 2 the shape parameter n is estimated from soil psd and used to derive the shape parameter η 3 the scale parameter ks is optimized concomitant with soil sorptivity s by fitting the experimental cumulative infiltration to the analytical models and 4 the scale parameter hvg is estimated from previous estimates of s and ks in the new versions we use the kosugi functions kg wrhcfs table 1 with the associated set of hydraulic parameters θr θs hkg ks σ but the proposed approach can work with any hydraulic model as in previous best methods θr is considered to be zero and θs is equal to the soil porosity estimated from bulk density measurements the model used to fit the data is directly described as a function of the soil hydraulic parameters including the sorptivity parameter s consequently the fit allows the direct estimation of parameters hkg ks σ when psd data are not available a particular approach is proposed for the kosugi model using a relation between hkg and σ that is used to define an objective function of with only two input variables reducing non uniqueness of the inverted hydraulic parameters in the following first we present the model and the objective functions that are used to fit experimental cumulative infiltrations in order to derive the hydraulic parameters in the new best methods then we describe how to derive the remaining hydraulic parameters from s and ks 2 1 using the quasi exact implicit formulation in the best method bestqei the bestqei method uses the model developed by haverkamp et al 1990 1994 for the 1d cumulative infiltration i 1d l under a constant zero or negative hydraulic pressure head at the surface into a soil with uniform initial water content the model was extended by smettem et al 1994 to the case of 3d cumulative infiltration i 3d through a disc source leading to the following expression 1a i 3 d t i 1 d t γ r ˇ δ θ s 2 t 1b 2 δ k 2 s 2 t 1 1 β 2 δ k s 2 i 1 d t k 0 t ln exp 2 β δ k s 2 i 1 d t k 0 t β 1 β where the subscripts 1d and 3d refer to the one dimensional and three dimensional cumulative infiltrations respectively δθ θ s θ 0 l3 l 3 corresponds to the difference between the final saturated water content and the initial water content r ˇ l is the ring radius of the infiltrometer and γ is a geometric shape parameter fixed at 0 75 haverkamp et al 1994 the term γ r ˇ δ θ if often denoted as a l 1 lassabatere et al 2013 in eq 1b δk ks k 0 l t 1 which is the difference between final saturated hydraulic conductivity and the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 k θ 0 and β is an integral shape parameter typically fixed at 0 6 haverkamp et al 1994 parlange et al 1982 the set of eq 1a and b yields the 3d cumulative infiltration into a single ring infiltrometer and is referred to as the qei model this model is valid for all times and can be written in a scaled from as proposed by lassabatere et al 2009 and varado et al 2006 2a i 3 d t s 2 2 δ k i s 2 2 δ k 2 t k 0 γ r ˇ δ θ s 2 t with i t being implicitly defined as the root of the following equation for any given t 2b t 1 1 β i t ln exp β i t β 1 β the qei model eq 2a and b has the following inputs δθ δk k 0 and s all these inputs can be related to the soil hydraulic parameters θ r θ s σ hkg ks and the initial water content θ 0 sorptivity s can be computed from the soil hydraulic parameters using the formulation proposed by parlange 1975 3a s θ 0 θ r θ s σ h k g k s θ 0 θ s θ s θ 2 θ 0 d θ d θ where the soil water diffusivity is given by 3b d θ k θ d h d θ given these equations the quasi exact implicit model can be written as a function of time t and the set of hydraulic parameters i 3d t i 3d t θ r θ s σ hkg ks considering that θ r and θ s are fixed infiltration depends only on the hydraulic parameters hkg ks and σ consequently the fit of the model to experimental data is performed to estimate hkg ks and σ using a specific inverting procedure detailed below first a random set of hydraulic parameters σ hkg ks are selected second the inputs of the qei model are computed from σ hkg and ks the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 is computed from σ and ks using the kosugi hydraulic conductivity function defined in table 1 the sorptivity s σ hkg ks is computed using eq 3a then the observation data t obs i i obs i are scaled on the basis of the following procedure lassabatere et al 2009 4a t o b s i 2 δ k 2 s 2 t o b s i 4b i o b s i 2 δ k s 2 i o b s i k 0 γ r ˇ δ θ s 2 t o b s i if the set of hydraulic parameters σ hkg ks were properly chosen the obtained scaled data should verify eq 2 consequently a novel objective function o f b e s t q e i which assesses the difference between the right and left terms of eq 2b is defined it is important to note that the data set is split into two parts the transient and the steady states and the relative weights of these two states are determined by the value of w in order to strengthen the inverting procedure to avoid the over weights for the steady state 5 o f best qei σ h k g k s w n t r a n s i 1

infiltration data n stead and n trans are the number of infiltration data for the transient and steady states respectively and n end is the maximum number of data points cumulative infiltration curves for observed and simulated are always closer less discrepancy and smaller errors at the beginning of the infiltration process as for both curves i t 0 0 in order to balance the fit along the entire infiltration process transient and steady state it is necessary to account for the fact that the accumulated errors between these infiltrations are larger for the steady state subsequently if no transformation is performed for the steady state then the fit would preferentially fit the steady state and overlook the transient state therefore a log10 transformation is performed for the steady state which allows the different order of magnitude between transient and steady state errors to be compensated for fine tuning a weighting w is introduced with an optimal value of w 0 2 obtained by trial and error the novelty of the proposed o f best qei is that it is not biased by the ratio of the number of observations in the steady and transient phases the number of data points that belong to the transient and steady states is calculated by comparing the related time with the threshold t trans steady qei t this threshold corresponds to the time at which the infiltration state passes from transient to steady it is directly derived from the experimental cumulative infiltration curve assuming that it separates the two parts of the curves that are concave and linear these parts represent the transient and steady states respectively a linear regression is performed on the last points that align on the final straight line and the related slope and intercept are computed then the next point starting from the end is interpolated and the following condition is tested 6 i 3 d t i 3 d interpolated t δ t p transient steady where δt t is the time step for the cumulative infiltration data and p transient steady was fixed at a value of 0 05 mm s 1 obtained as a threshold representing the deviation from linearity the procedure is stopped as soon as the equation is no longer valid which highlights a too strong deviation of the point from the straight line the transition time is defined by the last point that validates eq 6 the inverting procedure computes the objective function for several sets of hydraulic parameters an optimization algorithm computes the optimum hydraulic parameters note that the objective function o f best qei involves three parameters and may suffer from non uniqueness a specific strategy is defined to reduce the number of parameters and this is detailed in section 2 3 latorre et al 2015 have already implemented the qei model in their inversion algorithm however in this study the objective function is modified to improve the fitting procedure such that it is not biased by the ratio of the number of observations in the steady and transient phases 2 2 a new simplified approximate expansion into the best method bestsa the bestqei algorithm implements the qei model but it needs to be solved numerically therefore a new simplified expansion based on the two term approximation of haverkamp et al 1994 is proposed as follows 7a i 3 d trans t s t a s 2 b k s t 7b i 3 d steady t a s 2 k s t c s 2 k s the a l 1 parameter was already defined above while constants b and c can be written as lassabatere et al 2013 7c a γ r ˇ δ θ 7d b 2 β 3 1 β 3 k 0 k s 7e c 1 2 1 β 1 k 0 k s ln 1 β in this new methodology the two approximate expansions i 3 d trans t and i 3 d steady t are combined into a combined approximate function i 3 d sa t referred to as the shifting approximation this new expression automatically assigns the corresponding approximate function by comparing the time with the threshold shifting between the transient and steady states t trans stead sa if time is higher than t trans stead sa the expression will compute the steady state expansion otherwise it will compute the transient state expansion the proposed shifting approximation model i 3 d s a t can be written as follows 8 i 3 d sa t i 3 d trans t s t a s 2 b k s t t t trans steady sa i 3 d steady t a s 2 k s t c t t trans steady sa t trans steady sa s 2 1 b k s 2 this new version of best referred to as bestsa uses this new approximate expansion which has the advantage of being defined for all times in contrast to the original best the inverse modelling is performed in a similar way to that used for the bestqei method the hydraulic parameters σ hkg ks are used to derive all the inputs needed for i 3 d sa t particularly the initial relative hydraulic conductivity k 0 k s which is involved in constants b and c as well as in the sorptivity s through eq 3a the modelled data are then compared to the experimental data using the objective function o f best sa eq 9 this objective function splits the data into transient and steady states similar to o f best qei the objective function is then minimized to define the optimum values of σ hkg and ks 9 o f best sa σ h k g k s w t i t trans steady sa i o b s i i 3 d sa t i 2 t i t trans steady sa i o b s i i o b s

was found by trial and error to be equal to 0 5 the rationale for the logarithm transformation for the second term of the o f best sa is the same as for o f best qei eq 5 as described in section 2 1 2 3 reducing the non uniqueness of the kosugi hydraulic parameters the optimization of the hydraulic parameters using bestqei and bestsa suffers from non uniqueness when simultaneously inverting the three parameters σ hkg ks therefore it is proposed to reduce the non uniqueness of the kosugi parameters σ h kg considering the relationship between h kg and σ found by pollacco et al 2013a according to pollacco et al 2013a there is a positive linear correlation between h kg and σ for most soils larger median pore size small h kg which is characteristic of coarsely structured soils is linked to a smaller standard distribution dispersion of the pore size small σ this relationship can be explained by the fact that when h kg is small the soil tends to be single grain structured monodisperse and so σ tends to be small on the other hand when h kg is increased which is characteristic of finer material the soil structure becomes aggregated or the soil is composed of an array of grain sizes polydisperse and so σ tends to have a larger dispersion pollacco et al 2013a obtained a root mean squared error of 0 45 using a dataset of 73 soils by using the following relationship between h kg cm and σ 10 σ m o d p σ 1 ln h kg 10 1 p σ 2 where p σ1 0 382 and p σ2 1 080 are fitting parameters the optimization of the hydraulic parameters is therefore performed by optimizing only k s and h kg and deriving σ from σ mod as shown in fig 1 the input parameters of eqs 4a b and 8 that are used for the inversion procedure of bestqei and bestsa respectively are written as a function of σ mod hkg hkg ks instead of σ hkg ks thus only hk g and ks are optimized 3 materials and methods 3 1 synthetic soils and cumulative infiltrations this study uses six contrasting synthetic soils investigated by latorre et al 2015 selected from the soil database of carsel and parrish 1988 their wrhcfs are described using the van genuchten 1980 model along with the mualem condition k m 1 and the mualem 1976 capillary model related parameters are listed in table 3 vg column the fit of these hydraulic functions with kg functions led to values of σ between 0 98 and 2 74 simulations from latorre et al 2015 were used to model water infiltration into these soils these authors used a numerical domain 25 cm in radius and 25 cm in depth the mesh is made of 100 width 900 height elements the vertical dimension of cells varies between 0 003 cm near the surface to 0 3 cm at the bottom the cumulative infiltrations correspond to a disc radius of 10 cm a null constant head was applied at the upper boundary below the ring whereas a zero water flux condition was applied to the rest of the boundary initial water content was fixed close to the residual water content the maximum cumulative infiltration was fixed at 50 mm 3 2 equivalence between kg and vg wrhfcs and related hydraulic response one of the crucial points of this work concerns the generality of the best methods in this section we derive the kg wrhcfs from the vg wrhcfs first the target vg wrhcfs were fitted to the kg wrhcfs the kg hydraulic parameters are derived from the vg parameters n and h vg for the mualem model k m 1 by minimizing the objective function o f θ k g which is based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency formulation 11 o f θ k g w i i n s e kg h i s e vg h i 2 i i n s e kg h i s e kg h i 2 w 1 i i n l n k r kg h i ln k r vg h i 2 i i n l n k r kg h i l n k r kg h i 2 where w is a weighting parameter which is equal to 0 5 as recommended by pollacco et al 2013a b and n is the number of discretised s e data points which is equal to 1000 the parameter w rules the relative weights assigned to the fits of the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity curve the feasible range of parameters used for the fits is listed in table 2 these values are based on latorre et al 2015 for ks and on pollacco et al 2013a b for the kosugi σ and hk g as well as the van genuchten n and hv g parameters second the capability of the kg wrhcfs to predict the target cumulative infiltrations is evaluated the optimized kg wrhcfs were used to compute the analytical qei and sa models these analytical data were compared to the numerically generated cumulative infiltration from latorre et al 2015 in addition to an adequate representation of the original θ h and k θ the optimized kg wrhcfs should provide similar cumulative infiltrations to those generated numerically using the vg wrhcfs the agreement between analytically generated data using kg wrhcfs i sim ti and numerically generated data using the vg wrhcfs in the hydrus 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 ihydrus ti was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse i defined as follows 12 n s e i 1 i 1 i n i h y d r u s t i i sim t i 2 i 1 i n i h y d r u s t i i h y d r u s t i 2 where n corresponds to the maximum number of infiltration data the computation of analytically generated data and the performance of the inverting procedure require the computation of s the numerical integration of s eq 3a and b is non trivial because the integration is ill posed since lim θ θ s d θ therefore it is necessary to limit the highest soil water content to θ end θ se 1 10 9 it was found that 10 9 is the smallest value before getting numerical instability the integration was computed in julia programming language using the quadgk package https juliamath github io quadgk jl stable 3 3 inverting procedure related goodness of fit and model accuracy the global optimization of the hydraulic parameters was performed using a robust global optimizer blackboxoptim in julia language https github com robertfeldt blackboxoptim jl due to the imposed constraints it proved successful to use the local optimizer optim optimize goldensection also in julia language https github com robertfeldt blackboxoptim jl mogensen and riseth 2018 which is considerably faster than the global optimizer the goodness of fit of fitted modelled data i sim to match the target numerically generated observations i hydrus was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency formulation nse i described above the accuracy of the different inverting procedures was evaluated considering the relative errors er between estimated and target parameters 13 e r x 1 x est x target x target where x est and x target are the values of any parameter estimated by the inverting procedure and the corresponding target respectively note that the target values for the hydraulic parameters correspond to those derived from the previous fit of kg wrhcfs to the original vg wrhcfs 4 results and discussion the validity of the new best method is assessed using the following steps section 4 1 demonstrates the capability of the optimized kg wrhcfs to fit the target vg wrhcfs section 4 2 shows that the qei and the new best method parameterized with known vg and kg hydraulic parameters could reproduce the target cumulative infiltrations derived with the hydrus 3d model section 4 3 1 derives the accuracy of predicting infiltration transition time saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity by inverting the hydraulic parameters of the qei and the new best method with cumulative infiltration without constraining the hydraulic parameters i e without using the relationship between σ and h kg section 4 3 2 describes the accuracy of the qei and the new best method to predict wrhcfs and the kosugi hydraulic parameters by inverting the hydraulic parameters with cumulative infiltration by constraining the hydraulic parameters with the relationship between σ and h kg 4 1 comparison between vg and kg wrhcfs the capability of the optimized kg wrhcfs to fit observed vg wrhcfs is assessed and depicted in fig 2 with the related optimized parameters listed in table 3 columns h kg and σ along with the observed vg hydraulic parameters the fits clearly align on the target curves in all cases fig 2 and the related values of nse i attest to the quality of fits table 3 column nseθ k although vg and kg correspond to different mathematical expressions they can simulate similar hydraulic functions in particular for σ 2 or n 1 37 the target curves are marginally less accurate for σ 2 with a slight deviation at high suctions fig 2 left these results show that either vg or kg wrhcfs can be used to characterize the wrhcfs for a more comprehensive comparison of vg and kg formulations readers are referred to assouline and or 2013 and cornelis et al 2005 4 2 capability of known kg wrhcfs to reproduce target cumulative infiltrations computed with hydrus 3d the capability of the optimized kg wrhcfs by using bestqei and bestsa to reproduce the target cumulative infiltrations obtained with the hydrus 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 ihydrus ti is assessed the kg parameters were used to compute the analytical model inputs ks k 0 s and the corresponding cumulative infiltration curves fig 3 left column shows that both bestqei kg and bestsa kg are very close to the target numerical cumulative infiltrations ihydrus ti for the case of loam 1 loam 2 and silt σ 0 98 1 60 and 2 00 respectively with values of nse i coefficients equal to unity table 3 columns qei kg nsei and qei vg nsei conversely the fits are less good with lower values for the nse i coefficients but also close to unity for silty loam σ 2 74 silty clay loam σ 1 65 and sandy loam σ 1 79 such inadequacy was already reported by lassabatere et al 2009 where discrepancies between analytical models and target numerical cumulative infiltrations were explained based on the failure of certain conditions needed for the qei model haverkamp et al 1994 in this study an explanation for the discrepancy is based on the shape of the wrhcfs and in particular the steep slope of dk se dse near saturation to illustrate this the indicator δ k θ s is used 14 δ k θ s k s k s e 0 99 1 s e table 3 shows that soils showing less good fit silty clay loam σ 1 65 sandy loam σ 1 79 and silty loam σ 2 74 have large δ k θ s 150 cm h 1 and so the match between the analytical models and the real cumulative infiltration may be questionable for soils with δ k θ s 150 cm h 1 and further investigation may need to be conducted with experimental field data however the worst case in terms of agreement between wrhcfs and related cumulative infiltrations corresponds to silty loam whereas the highest value for δ k θ s is obtained for sandy loam the proposed indicator for the mismatch between wrhcfs and related cumulative infiltrations may be combined in future research with alternative indicators lassabatere et al 2009 proposed indicators based on wrhcfs and the shape parameter β but this aspect will be the subject of further research for completeness fig 3 right column shows good agreement between cumulative infiltration derived with bestqei formulation using observed kg and vg hydraulic parameters we conclude that the computed infiltration by using bestqei and bestsa and hydraulic parameters for vg and kg matches accurately ihydrus ti for soils with δ k θ s 150 cm h 1 nevertheless since bestqei and bestsa have been tested with numerically generated data with hydrus 3d the bestqei and bestsa should be further tested with field experimental data 4 3 accuracy of the inverted bestqei and bestsa in the previous section the capability of kg wrhcfs to adequately model vg wrhcfs and the related computation of cumulative infiltration were investigated this section uses the new bestqei and bestsa methods to invert cumulative infiltrations and derive the corresponding wrhcfs and hydraulic parameters the vg hydraulic parameters of the synthetic soils were used with the hydrus 3d software to numerically generate cumulative infiltrations ihydrus ti then infiltration data were inverted with bestqei and bestsa to derive the full set of hydraulic parameters and the related sorptivity it is expected that both the estimated hydraulic parameters and the fits are less accurate for the cases of silty clay loam sandy loam and silty loam since the kg model has more difficulties depicting the target vg wrhcfs and to model properly the corresponding cumulative infiltrations 4 3 1 unconstrained optimization without using relationship between σ and hkg the use of the relationship between σ and hkg eq 10 does not improve the predictions of infiltration s and ks since there is an infinite combination of σ and hkg which gives similar values of s eq 3a and b their relative errors are equal for the constrained and unconstrained case as shown in table 4 however this relationship is essential for a complete characterization of all the parameters 4 3 1 1 prediction of infiltration and transition time target cumulative infiltrations were properly modelled by the inverted hydraulic parameters obtained with bestqei and bestsa as shown in fig 4 these results validate the methodology and prove the efficiency of both objectives functions o f best qei and o f best sa however the predicted transition times between the transient and steady states t trans stead are not always the same for bestqei and bestsa the reason for this is that the best method assumes that infiltration in the steady state increases linearly with time eq 7b while the qei formulation does not because it considers the non linear lateral flow therefore t trans stead of the best method is overestimated due to ignoring the non linearity of the steady state the inversion of infiltration data using bestqei and bestsa is accurate but t trans stead computed by bestqei is considered more realistic than computed by bestsa in fact bestsa becomes linear faster than bestqei since bestsa is an approximation of bestqei of order 2 this is why t trans stead is always smaller for bestqei than for bestsa 4 3 1 2 ability to predict ks and s ks and s are depicted in fig 5 the results shown in fig 5 left and the values of er ks listed in table 4 confirm the predictions of k s are accurate for both methods indeed most of the points are close to the straight line 1 1 indicating that estimated values are close to the targets the estimates are comparable between bestqei and bestsa the results shown in fig 5 right and er s table 4 confirm that the two methods bestqei and bestsa perform well for the estimation of s with estimates close to target values similar results were obtained by latorre et al 2015 for most soils bestsa and bestqei have comparable estimates note that s is estimated with more accuracy than k s the scales are logarithmic for fig 5 left versus linear for fig 5 right lastly the scattering of data points over both sides of the straight line 1 1 on both subpanels of fig 5 demonstrates there is no trend to overestimate or underestimate the target this is important because it shows the methods do not systematically overestimate or underestimate parameters meaning that they are not biased with the data used the predictions made with bestsa are comparable to those made with bestqei 4 3 2 constrained optimization using relationship between σ and hkg 4 3 2 1 ability to predict wrhcfs the quality of bestsa and bestqei was assessed by comparing the estimated and target wrhcfs and analysing the values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients n s e θ k table 4 estimations of the wrhcfs are close to the target curves in particular for loam 2 silty clay loam sandy loam and silt larger discrepancies are found for loam 1 and silt loam figs 5 and 6 with lower values of n s e θ k as shown in table 4 for all considered soils bestqei and bestsa provide similar estimated wrhcfs less accurate estimates for some soils were expected as stated above it was proven that for some types of soils the computations of the cumulative infiltrations using the analytical models used by bestqei or bestsa methods do not align on the target infiltration curves ihydrus ti consequently the bestqei or bestsa inverting procedure will compensate for such mismatch by mis estimating the hydraulic parameters and related wrhcfs deviating these far from the targets fig 6 therefore implementation of the relation between the scale parameter hkg and the shape parameter σ strengthens the bestqei and bestsa methods the reduction in the number of optimizable parameters facilitates the inverting procedure when three parameters are considered σ hkg ks the objective functions do not define a single minimum but a large zone then depending on the initial values the inverting algorithm may converge towards contrasting sets of optimized parameters and probably contrasting wrhcfs conversely the objective function related to bestqei and bestsa is defined as a function of only two parameters hkg ks the concomitant optimization of two parameters is less sensitive and more robust leading to more accurate estimates to demonstrate this the data were inverted using the same framework for bestqei and bestsa without any constraints i e without the relation σ mod hkg resulting in worse results with lower values for the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient n s e θ k table 4 in fact the implementation of the relation between σ and hkg through eq 10 in the bestqei and bestsa methods is one of the main advantages of the methodologies the use of σ mod hkg enables predictions of wrhcfs for most soils in the absence of psd improved predictions are foreseen when relationships of β are computed as a function of the wrhcfs and when field experimental infiltration is used instead of that computed by hydrus 3d this question has already been raised by lassabatere et al 2009 where the value of the β parameter often fixed at 0 6 was questioned latorre et al 2015 proved that the β parameter plays a role in modelling water infiltration data therefore future studies will determine if varying β would improve the predictions of wrhcfs 4 3 2 2 ability to predict σ and hkg the accuracy of estimating σ and h kg cannot be assessed because the estimated hydraulic parameters are related to kg functions whereas target hydraulic parameters are related to vg functions consequently the values of the hydraulic parameters cannot be directly compared moreover the direct comparison of hydraulic parameters even defined for similar functions may be tricky pollacco et al 2008 showed that there are equally good combinations of hydraulic parameters which are sets of truly linked parameters in other words different combinations of σ and h kg could produce a similar fit of θ h and k θ depicted in fig 6 it is expected that more physical σ and h kg values would be obtained if they were further constrained from the relationship between k s and hydraulic parameters related to θ h pollacco et al 2013a 2017 this issue will be the subject of further investigation in the absence of psd the new best approach relying on eq 10 makes it possible to estimate these parameters but we cannot be sure they correspond to the real values 5 conclusions this paper develops two novel methods bestqei and bestsa which generalize the existing best methods to make predictions of any unimodal θ h and k θ in fact these methods predict the wrhcfs on the basis of kg formulae but it is demonstrated that these functions may depict any of the formulations for wrhcfs including the vg type kg functions were chosen because they are based on physical principles log normal distribution for pore size distributions in the absence of psd the developed bestqei and bestsa allow estimates of the full set of hydraulic parameters from the cumulative infiltration but require a link between the kg parameters i e relationship between σ and h kg as in eq 10 this simplifies the procedures and avoids sources of errors due to the hypotheses behind the use of the pedotransfer functions of the previous best methods the developed new best methods are valid for all times and always manage to provide estimates without any failure this alleviates troubles and dysfunctions often encountered with the previous best methods in addition the objective functions of bestqei or bestsa are improved because they consider both transient and steady states and optimize their related contributions to the global objective function another novelty is the constraint implemented in these objective functions by defining the shape parameter σ as a function of the scale parameter for hydraulic pressure head h kg as explained above the proposed bestqei and bestsa methods were validated using numerically generated cumulative infiltrations with the hydrus 3d model for several synthetic soils following is a summary of the results unconstraining the feasible parameter space the predictions made with bestsa are comparable to those made with bestqei but this needs further testing with real experimental data similar results were obtained by deriving the hydraulic parameters of kg and vg these results suggest that bestqei and bestsa methods are general since they equally well represent any type of wrhcfs the computed infiltration by using bestqei and bestsa and observed hydraulic parameters accurately matches generated cumulative infiltration data with hydrus 3d for soils with a low gradient of hydraulic conductivity close to saturation it is hypothesized that soils exhibiting specific hydraulic properties with high gradients could be inadequate for the use of the best model as already discussed by lassabatere et al 2009 the bestqei and bestsa should be further tested with real experimental data to settle this hypothesis the inversion of infiltration by using bestqei and bestsa is accurate but t trans stead computed by bestqei is considered more realistic than that computed by bestsa bestsa and bestqei make accurate predictions of s and k s with s being predicted slightly more accurately than k s constraining the feasible parameter space to constrain the feasible parameter space or make predictions without psd it is necessary to establish a relationship between the shape and scale hydraulic parameters as in eq 10 although the predictions of wrhcfs are reasonable accurate for most soils σ and h kg exhibit sets of truly linked parameters and therefore their predictions are not unique it is foreseen that more physical σ and h kg values would be obtained with further constraints between k s and the hydraulic parameters of the kg model 6 future work and recommendations to improve best the new best procedure proves quite promising however additional research is needed to clarify the following points the model has been tested with numerically generated data and it should be further tested with real experimental data in addition experimental data could help to understand why some of the soils are less accurately characterized it will be extremely useful to develop automated infiltrometers that allow both multiple replicate measurements and greater measurement precision during the transient state particularly for soils with rapid infiltration and that also allow cumulative infiltration to be sampled for large times which is of interest for very low permeability soils automated infiltrometers often rely on use of pressure transducers with a mariotte type water supply tank however the bubbling within the mariotte tank does introduce considerable uncertainty in the transducer readings particularly under rapid infiltration during the transient phase water supply without the mariotte design would greatly improve the precision of measurements a key advantage of the best procedure is the simple equipment and measurement skills that allows estimation of a quantitative suite of wrhcf parameters however this requires a high mathematical skill to derive these parameters from the field data to achieve the potential widespread application of best measurements easy to use software will need to be developed to allow uptake and application by non soil physicists it will not be feasible to investigate the source of problems e g inaccuracy of computing s without performing an intensive field campaign where infiltration tests are combined with measurements of hydraulic parameters in the laboratory and with 2d axisymmetric modelling of the flow below the infiltrometer réfloch et al 2017 it is also recommended that infiltration experiments be combined with innovative non invasive methods such as ground penetrating radar which can show the wetting front evolution with time during water infiltration iwasaki et al 2016 klenk et al 2015 leger et al 2014a b 2015 salas garcía et al 2017 réfloch et al 2017 also showed that monitoring the extension of the soil moisture stain around the infiltration ring with time is valuable for deriving the horizontal and vertical hydraulic parameters the importance of compiling a worldwide data set with contrasting soils is clear such as the swig database rahmati et al 2018 particularly to improve the constraint of hydraulic parameters lastly analytical development is still needed to define more precisely the values of the infiltration parameters β and γ indeed these were proved to depend on the type of soil lassabatere et al 2009 and to have the potential to affect the values of estimates other approaches have aimed to relate these parameters to the wrhcfs fuentes et al 1992 improved predictions are also foreseen when the relationships of β and γ are obtained as a function of wrhcfs or of the type of soils and validated with experimental field data conflicts of interest there are no conflicts to declare

632,computational fluid dynamics was used to study the evolution of small patches of vegetation into a vegetated landscape in a channel the growth of new vegetation occurred in regions where the flow velocity was reduced below a threshold value defined as a fraction of the channel average velocity u 0 two threshold values or limiting velocity values lv were used lv 0 5 and 0 7 two initial blockage factors percentage vegetation coverage of the channel were considered 3 and 0 3 chosen to represent cases with and without respectively hydrodynamic interaction between the initial patches the simulation illustrated both positive feedbacks between flow and vegetation which enhanced vegetation expansion and negative feedbacks which led to patch erosion and limited patch growth the most rapid expansion of the vegetated area occurred during the initial simulation steps when the flow blockage due to vegetation was small a higher velocity threshold higher lv produced more rapid initial growth and a higher final coverage of vegetation the patches evolved to one or a few elongated islands extending along the channel keywords vegetation evolution computational fluid dynamics blockage factor

providing several ecological services in aquatic systems such as turbidity reduction jones et al 2012 habitat provision kemp et al 2000 bank stability pollen bankhead and simon 2010 oxygen production and nutrient uptake wilcock et al 1999 schulz et al 2003 these services are the product of dynamic interactions that occur among vegetation flow and sediment in which the vegetation affects the pattern of flow which in turn impacts patterns of sediment deposition and erosion and together the flow and sediment influence vegetation growth tsujimoto 1999 these relationships which can result in positive or negative feedbacks largely control the evolution of low gradient fluvial landscapes and coastal marshes see review by larsen 2019 for example temmerman et al 2007 in fig 1 of their paper present aerial photographs of the westerschelde estuary in the netherlands taken from 1989 to 2001 during this time span individual patches of spartina anglica grew into extensive areas of vegetation interleaved by channels the channels resulted from the plant flow interaction in the way that vegetation acted as erosion agents by concentrating the flow at the patch edges which induced channel erosion similarly tooth and nanson 2000 observed in an ephemeral river in australia that vegetation evolved from dense chaotic shrubs to elongated distributions associated with ridges which partitioned the channel into bare bed anabranches jeffres et al 2008 observed that the vegetation cover ranged from a low value of 26 in march to a high value of 73 in september in the shasta river california they suggested that the vegetation growth started with the establishment of a parent vegetation patch e g e canadensis or r aquatilus which in turn promoted the accumulation of sediment inside and behind the patch providing substrate for the establishment of plants that are better late season performers leading to downstream extension of the parent patch to understand the physical mechanisms that govern the feedbacks between vegetation flow and sediment experimental studies initially focused on a single vegetation patch chen et al 2012 follett and nepf 2012 for a single finite patch of vegetation with diameter d the incoming flow starts to decrease 1 2 diameters upstream of the patch some of the approaching flow is diverted laterally accelerating around the patch fig 1a the arrows with velocity u 2 and typically a small fraction of the flow passes through the patch bleeding into the wake downstream fig 1a the arrows with velocity u 1 the accelerated flow around the patch edges can both reduce sediment deposition and erode the channel inhibiting the expansion of the patch in the lateral direction bouma et al 2009 bennett et al 2008 follett and nepf 2012 in contrast the reduced velocity in the wake of the patch can allow sediment deposition and provide shelter for the establishment of new seedlings encouraging new vegetation growth in the streamwise direction tsujimoto 1999 chen et al 2012 experimental and numerical studies investigated the interactions between a pair of patches and the possible mechanisms for lateral growth that can be derived from those interactions vandenbruwaene et al 2011 meire et al 2014 de lima et al 2015 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 used a pair of side by side patches of spartina anglica in which the patch diameter d and the interpatch distance t were varied when the ratio d t increased which was proposed to occur when the patches are growing the flow velocity increased between them suggesting that the flow would prevent the patches from merging however when d t 6 7 10 the flow acceleration was suppressed between the patches signaling the possibility of patch merger at this condition meire et al 2014 studied the flow field generated by a pair of side by side patches that were separated by a distance t the region of reduced velocity immediately downstream of each patch was similar to that observed for a single patch fig 1b in which the steady wakes behind each patch are similar to the wake in fig 1a but an additional region of low velocity was formed on the centerline between the patches farther downstream fig 1b the region in light grey the authors hypothesized that if new growth occurred in the secondary region of low velocity then the patches would be able to merge finally de lima et al 2015 studied the effects of both lateral l and longitudinal t distances on the wakes of a pair of patches when the patches were far from each other t d 1 5 and l d 5 they acted as isolated patches creating wakes similar in size to an isolated patch e g fig 1a when the patches were very close t d 1 3 the wakes merged downstream similar to fig 1b which increased the growth area of the patch pair to greater than that of two isolated patches however when the patches were placed at intermediate distances t d 1 5 and l d 5 the area of possible growth was reduced relative to that of isolated patches fig 1c the wake of the upstream patch is smaller than the wake in fig 1a meaning that the neighboring patch negatively affected the potential region of new vegetation growth the previous studies of flow and deposition around pairs of patches led to important insights into how the proximity of a neighboring patch can affect vegetation growth the configurations seen in fig 1 are the first step of a vegetation growth process but more steps are required to assess the transition of patches into vegetated landscapes vegetation evolution has been modeled with cellular automata and physics based numerical models cellular models are easy to set up they do not require large quantities of input data and they can perform fast calculations with simple mathematical rules which are sometimes coupled with a simple hydrodynamic model solari et al 2015 larsen and harvey 2011 for example used hydraulic geomorphic and ecological variables to compute the vegetation distribution of a shallow aquatic ecosystem in a cellular automata model the model produced 28 different vegetation mosaics several of which corresponded to landscapes found in the everglades u s more recently kondziolka and nepf 2014 implemented the wake behavior for interacting patches described in meire et al 2014 into a model and simulated vegetation growth based on a velocity threshold three distinct landscapes were obtained sparsely distributed vegetation vegetation cut through by channels and full vegetation coverage although cellular models are useful tools in making a general exploration of vegetation growth they have simplified physics coulthard et al 2007 solari et al 2015 for this reason some studies have adopted more complex physics based numerical models in which the equations of conservation of mass and momentum are numerically solved in one two or three dimensions for example wang et al 2018 used a one dimensional model to investigate the temporal and spatial changes of riparian vegetation and the interactions between flow and riparian vegetation dynamics two dimensional 2 d models have been used to quantify the interaction between vegetation and flow in streams and rivers lotsari et al 2015 verschoren et al 2016 for example used a 2 d flow model to investigate the spatial patterns of in stream submerged macrophytes on the reach scale with the same model verschoren 2017 simulated the growth of submerged vegetation for one growing season using a velocity threshold and a logistic equation to describe vegetation growth marjoribanks et al 2017 used a three dimensional model to study the complex flow spatial heterogeneity within a vegetated channel they modeled vegetation as a sink term in the momentum equations producing the key flow structures associated with submerged vegetation in channels which includes wake regions behind vegetation and high velocity threads in between vegetation similarly anjum et al 2018 used the computational fluid dynamics cfd code fluent fluent inc 2014 to analyze the flow properties like mean velocity profiles and turbulence characteristics through double layered emergent and submerged vegetation and discontinuous vegetation patches in an open channel flow inferring the implications for sedimentation finally lera et al 2019 employed the cfd code delft3d roelvink and van banning 1994 to assess the effects of submersed aquatic vegetation on the morphodynamics of river mouth bars to represent the vegetation they used a hydraulic roughness derived from the height and density of the vegetation however none of these studies simulated vegetation growth the current research explored the evolution of aquatic vegetation in a channel by using cfd to obtain the velocity field and by using a velocity threshold to identify regions of vegetation growth the simulations were used to determine how the vegetation evolution and final vegetation distribution were impacted by 1 the initial vegetation patch distribution 2 the initial degree of vegetation coverage and 3 the velocity threshold 2 methods the computational domain was defined as a two dimensional open rectangular channel with x and y defining the streamwise and lateral coordinates respectively and x 0 at the start of the domain fig 2 a 2 d domain was appropriate because the study only considered emergent vegetation with vertically uniform biomass distribution for which the flow adjustment occurs predominantly in the horizontal plane vegetation patches of diameter d 22 cm were distributed at random positions between x 14d and 84d in a region called effective channel area with area ca the positioning of the patches was restricted in this way to allow the incoming flow to be well developed before interacting with the patches and to provide free space for vegetation to grow to maintain the same effective channel area in each run one patch was placed at x 14d and another patch at x 84d that is at the limits of the effective channel area the entire domain extended 115d in length 2530 cm and 20d in width 440 cm the evolution of vegetation within the channel was evaluated with the following sequence the velocity field associated with the initial vegetation distribution was solved through cfd which is described in more detail below the velocity field was explored to identify the regions into which vegetation might expand or from which vegetation might be removed based on a threshold velocity new vegetation was added or subtracted and the velocity field computed again fig 3 this process was repeated until the change in vegetated coverage was less than a prescribed threshold described in more detail below the use of a threshold velocity for vegetation growth and loss was based on the following previous studies regions of deposition are associated with regions of diminished velocity and regions of deposition provide the nutrient rich substrate that promotes new growth scott et al 1996 sand jensen 1998 gurnell et al 2001 schoelynck et al 2012 further regions of elevated velocity especially above the threshold for sediment motion may dislodge seedlings and inhibit vegetation growth van wesenbeeck et al 2008 bouma et al 2009 to non dimensionalize the problem the limiting velocity was defined as a fraction denoted as lv of the upstream velocity u 0 hence based on the velocity field obtained through cfd new vegetation was added into regions where the normalized total velocity normalized by u 0 was lower than lv and removed from regions where the normalized total velocity was higher than lv recognizing that the threshold velocity will depend on the sediment size smaller particles have a lower threshold velocity two limiting velocities were considered 0 7u 0 and 0 5u 0 i e lv 0 7 and 0 5 representing a bed consisting of coarser and finer material respectively although we cannot connect these velocities to specific sediment sizes they provide an exploratory test of how lv influences the areal extent of enhanced deposition and vegetation growth de lima et al 2015 the vegetation coverage was described by the blockage factor b which defines the fraction of the channel bed area containing vegetation green 2005 2006 specifically for a vegetated area va within the effective channel area ca 1 b v a c a 100 the process of adjusting the vegetation and re computing the velocity field was repeated until the vegetation reached a stable state defined by a change in blockage factor less than 0 5 after three successive computational steps i e b b 0 005 at that point the vegetation was assumed to have evolved to a stable landscape with a final blockage factor bf the number of initial patches was chosen to produce a specific initial blockage factor b 0 two values of b 0 were considered 0 3 6 patches and 3 54 patches the patch distributions were constructed based on the following steps first one patch was assigned at x 14d and another patch at x 84d fixing the limits of the effective channel area ca second a random number generator provided the x y positions for the rest of the patches inside ca the patches could not overlap one another in total ten random configurations were created for each b 0 and each configuration was simulated with lv 0 5 and 0 7 table 1 combinations of b 0 and lv generated 40 scenarios for simulation an average nearest neighbor distance in between patches was defined as the center to center distance to the nearest neighboring patch for each patch averaged over all patches in the case of 0 3 the average nearest neighbor distance between patches was x d 8 5 and y d 4 1 which falls in the range of no interaction see fig 12 of de lima et al 2015 in the case of b 0 3 the average distance was x d 0 9 and y d 0 8 which falls in the range of patch interaction according to fig 12 of de lima et al 2015 the velocity field was obtained using the cfd code fluent fluent inc 2014 the code applies the finite volume method for the spatial discretization of the domain the governing equations are integrated over each control volume so that mass and momentum are conserved the simulations were performed using the two dimensional steady state reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with a k ε model the standard k ε turbulence closure of the rans equations are preferred for vegetated channels compared with more sophisticated turbulence models for being simple having low computational cost farhadi et al 2018 and being able to capture the most important processes determining the flow field around vegetation patches as for example the steady wake characteristics de lima et al 2015 verschoren et al 2016 the flow was considered two dimensional since previous experimental studies using emergent patches showed that three dimensional effects associated with the bottom boundary layer are of second order zong and nepf 2012 and that 2 d models are able to accurately predict the velocity field and the spatial pattern formation of vegetation in rivers verschoren et al 2016 the influence of the water depth upon the velocity and vegetation patterns was neglected as well as 3 d processes that are expected to occur around vegetation patches particularly during the growth of the vegetation initially submerged these assumptions will be discussed in section 4 considering a steady 2 d flow of an incompressible and homogeneous fluid the reynolds averaged equations for conservation of mass and momentum are given by 2 u i x i 0 3 ρ u j u i x j p x i x j 2 μ d i j ρ u i u j s i in which i or j 1 or 2 u 1 u and u 2 v denotes the velocity components in the x 1 x and x 2 y directions respectively dij is the mean strain rate tensor p is the pressure µ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the fluid density ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor in which u and v denote the fluctuating part of the streamwise x and transverse y velocity respectively and the overbar denotes a time average and si is the sink term which will be used to represent the vegetation drag the time mean strain rate tensor is given by 4 d i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i for the calculation of the reynolds stress tensor also denoted by τij the boussinesq approximation is used 5 ρ u i u j τ i j 2 μ t d i j 2 3 ρ k δ i j in which µt is the turbulent viscosity or eddy viscosity δij is the kronecker delta and k is the

and σε 1 3 were adopted in the computations speziale 1991 we caution that these values were not calibrated for channels with distributed vegetation but rather they are standard values of the k ε model wilcox 1994 following lowe et al 2008 and kondziolka and nepf 2014 a porous media model was employed to simulate the vegetation patches specifically the momentum loss term si in eq 3 was 11 s i 1 α μ u i within which α is the permeability of the vegetation the permeability α was calibrated by numerically modeling the experiments of meire et al 2014 described below finally the pressure velocity coupling was achieved using the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations pressure based algorithms a second order upwind scheme was used for spatial discretization of the flow equations because the model is 2 d the water depth was not specified details of the governing equations turbulence model and algorithms can be found in the fluent user s guide the following boundary conditions were defined a uniform flow was imposed at the inlet with streamwise velocity u u 0 9 8 cm s and transverse velocity v 0 the value of u 0 was chosen to match laboratory studies against which the model was calibrated meire et al 2014 and it is representative of some stream environments e g in table 2 of his work green 2006 reported velocities between 6 6 and 17 2 cm s in english streams populated with emergent vegetation nonetheless for an individual patch the size of the wake is predominantly determined by its porosity zong and nepf 2012 so that similar wake geometry and thus wake evolution would be expected over a range of u 0 consistent with this vandenbruwaene et al 2011 found that the relative increase and decrease of velocity in a pair of side by side patches was similar after testing three inlet velocities 10 20 and 30 cm s at the outlet an average static reference pressure of 0 pa was specified this condition has been widely used to calculate flow around bluff 2bodies e g tian et al 2013 the no slip boundary condition was applied at the channel walls at the bed and water surface a symmetry condition was applied which means zero flux of all quantities across these boundaries a mesh interface was created to connect the channel mesh to the porous medium mesh this interface guarantees the passage of fluxes through the cells even if the node locations of the cells between the channel and the porous medium are not identical the numerical model was calibrated with measurements made in a laboratory channel containing two vegetation patches in a side by side arrangement separated by a gap distance of 11 cm in which each patch had ad 1 31 a is the frontal area per unit patch volume and d 22 cm being the patch diameter meire et al 2014 consistent with the laboratory conditions in this case the simulation represented a 10 m long and 1 2 m wide channel with imposed inflow velocity u 0 9 8 cm s a pair of patches of diameter d 22 cm was placed 3 m downstream from the channel entrance the computational patch was a circular region with permeability α which was adjusted to minimize the difference between simulation and measurement we used the experimental data of dimensionless velocity components u u0 and v u0 passing along the centerline of the left patch left hand side considering the flow direction at the channel fig 4 a and the centerline between the pair of patches fig 4b the best fit was achieved with α 1 700 000 m2 for which the maximum difference between simulation and measurement was 6 considering that the calibrated model itself is not sufficient to make predictions lane et al 2005 roache 2009 we performed the validation for our calibrated model using a different patch configuration with the same value of ad specifically we simulated a pair of patches of ad 1 31 in a side by side arrangement separated by a gap distance of 5 cm meire et al 2014 comparing the dimensionless velocity components u u0 and v u0 at the centerline between the patches fig 4c the simulated and experimental data show a maximum difference of 6 to solve the conservation of mass and momentum equations with the solver fluent a new mesh was created at each step of the simulated scenarios automatic meshes were created with ansys mesh software the meshes had around 50 000 elements each to avoid numerical errors associated with the chosen mesh the grid convergence index gci test based on the richardson extrapolation was performed the gci is an index of the uncertainty associated with the solution obtained by the use of meshes with different resolutions the test assumes that it is possible to evaluate if the solution for the flow variables converges monotonically at all points as the grid spacing tends to zero roache 1997 lane et al 2005 celik et al 2008 coarse medium and fine meshes with respectively 5000 20 000 and 50 000 elements were created to model our validation case the simulated streamwise velocity was used to compare the three grids the maximum absolute difference between the medium and coarse meshes was 11 between the fine and medium meshes the difference was 3 considering the solutions for fine medium and coarse grids as ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 respectively and the solution differences for medium fine and coarse medium as ε 21 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 and ε 32 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 respectively the convergence ratio is r ε 21 ε 32 if 0 r 1 monotonic convergence is achieved but if r 0 it indicates oscillatory convergence for all the points tested in our validation 0 r 1 that is the mesh refinements showed monotonic convergence the numerical uncertainty due to the mesh resolution is then obtained by the gci value calculated for the finer grid resolution which for our simulations it was 0 44 for more details about the gci calculations see celik et al 2008 3 results in the initial steps the patches grew predominantly in the streamwise direction forming elongated islands fig 5 the rapid patch growth that occurred initially can be attributed to the formation of wakes which were developed due to the free space between and downstream of the patches e g fig 3 especially for scenarios with b 0 0 3 the patches acted as if they were isolated developing individual wakes that resembled wakes behind a single patch e g see chen et al 2012 as seen in fig 5 scenarios 1 and 2 thus steady wakes play an important role in vegetation growth this is consistent with kondziolka and nepf 2014 who showed that when the wakes were excluded from their simulations the vegetation growth was slower and achieved much smaller final coverage in addition some upstream growth was also observed in scenario 2 the leading edge of the first patch closest to inlet elongates toward the channel entrance deposition ahead of a patch has been observed in previous studies of emergent vegetation e g see in fig 6 in zong and nepf 2010 and fig 6 in ortiz et al 2013 and was attributed to the decrease in velocity that occurred as flow diverges away from the region of high drag starting one to two patch widths upstream of the leading edge e g fig 4 in zong and nepf 2010 for scenarios with b 0 3 the proximity of patches caused their wakes to interact in creating both positive and negative feedbacks meire et al 2014 de lima et al 2015 for example positive feedbacks occurred when side by side wakes also called neighboring wakes created regions of low velocity in between patches which promoted lateral growth and patch merging this can be seen in fig 5 scenario 23 where the blue circles show the lateral merger of neighboring patches between step 0 and step 2 the flow velocity in between the patches decreased in step 1 which allowed merger in the next step patches that were roughly aligned in the x direction also merged as the wake of the upstream patch grew to meet the downstream patch for instance see the merged patches marked with a blue circle in fig 5 scenario 24 on the other hand negative patch to patch feedback occurred when the interaction between patches resulted in smaller growth areas than that of isolated patches to illustrate scenarios 23 and 24 each show a pair of patches circled in red in which one patch within the pair grew less than its neighbor the diminished wake growth was associated with elevated velocity between the neighboring patches reaching almost 1 5u 0 the removal of vegetated area was also the result of negative patch to patch feedbacks for example in scenario 23 step 5 25 near the channel inlet the smaller patches at the center of the channel were progressively reduced and eliminated as the patches along each wall expanded laterally the removal of vegetation patches from regions where adjacent patches promoted accelerated flow was consistent with field observations reported by schoelynck et al 2012 who performed a transplantation experiment in a river placing new vegetation next to existing patches plants transplanted into regions adjacent to existing patches where flow acceleration was high had a low survival rate in the next steps as the patches grew bigger b increased and the fraction unobstructed flow area 1 b 100 decreased as flow was diverted away from the growing vegetation patches into the smaller unobstructed cross section the velocity magnitude increased to satisfy continuity consequently less unvegetated area fell below the limiting velocity slowing the rate of vegetation growth with increasing simulation step as seen in fig 7 in addition the progressive merging of patches reduced the number of vegetation units e g reducing over ten time steps the number of patches from 6 to 3 in scenario 2 and from 54 to 10 in scenario 23 fig 6 for b 0 0 3 the patches became wider with increasing simulation step for b 0 3 the patches were more elongated approaching the channelized state described in kondziolka and nepf 2014 which consisted of vegetation extending through the entire the flow domain with contiguous region of bare bed parallel to the main flow direction and within which the velocity remained sufficiently above lv to inhibit plant growth a pattern similar to scenario 24 was observed in a natural channel with sagittaria sagittifolia fig 8 in sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2005 indicating that the modeled patch evolution produced realistic final distributions finally the pattern of initially rapid growth followed by diminished growth rates has also been observed in large marsh systems for example fig 1 in temmerman et al 2007 presents aerial photographs of the westerschelde estuary in the netherlands taken from 1989 to 2001 during this time individual patches of spartina anglica grew into an extensive area of vegetation interleaved by channels the growth was most rapid in the first four years 0 64 increase in coverage year followed by slower growth over the next eight years 0 32 increase in coverage year to study the evolution of blockage factor scenarios with same b 0 and lv were averaged resulting in four curves of b fig 7 as noted above the rate slope at which b increased declined with increasing b because as the fraction of unobstructed flow area 1 b 100 decreased the mean velocity in those regions increased such that less unvegetated area fell below the limiting velocity slowing the rate of vegetation growth specifically it required only two to five steps to reach half of the final blockage factor b bf 0 5 but required 30 more simulation steps to reach the final blockage bf the values of bf are in table 2 scenarios with lv 0 7 achieved a higher final vegetation coverage higher bf and more rapid expansion than those with lv 0 5 for a constant b 0 see bf in table 2 and the b curves in fig 7 this trend can be used to infer channel response under different velocity conditions recall that lv defines the critical velocity uc below which sediment motion is inhibited and vegetation growth would be encouraged specifically lv uc u 0 the trend of increasing bf with decreasing lv implies the following as u 0 decreases lv uc u 0 increases so that more of the channel area can support vegetation i e bf increases this dependence was observed in the field by chambers et al 1991 who compared three streams within the same watershed same sediment supply and thus same uc but with different u 0 they observed that the growth of macrophytes resulted in greater final coverage in the channel with the lowest u 0 and this was attributed to differences in sediment texture specifically in the channels with lower u 0 lv was higher and it was easier to retain fine sediment that was both higher in nutrient content and provided a more stable substrate for growth because more regions fell below the critical velocity increasing b 0 from 0 3 to 3 caused b to increase more rapidly in the initial steps steps 1 5 in fig 7 as mentioned in section 2 for b 0 3 the average distance to the nearest patch neighbor in the streamwise and transverse direction were respectively x d 0 9 and y d 0 8 these distances were small enough to produce interactions with positive feedbacks between the patches leading to a deposition area 1 1 1 9 bigger than that produced for patches with no interaction see fig 12 at de lima et al 2015 and thus a more rapid patch growth compared to patches with no interaction in the subsequent steps however the growth leveled off and for the same lv the same final coverage was achieved for scenarios starting with b 0 0 3 or 3 within the uncertainty table 2 in summary a higher b 0 promoted more rapid vegetation growth in the initial steps but not a higher bf this can be applied to restoration programs desiring to cover a certain area with vegetation knowing that vegetation will reach bf independently from b 0 those programs can reduce the costs of the patch planting in terms of the number of initial patches the vegetation evolution described in terms of the blockage factor fig 7 follows the von bertalanffy growth model schnute and fournier 1980 12 b b 0 b f b 0 1 ex p r n in which r is the intrinsic growth rate step 1 being related to the fraction by which the gap between the current blockage factor and the asymptotic final blockage factor is reduced each modeling step n r measures the exponential rate of approach to the asymptotic final blockage factor schnute and fournier 1980 the intrinsic growth rate for each scenario was estimated by fitting the growth rate model from eq 12 to the numerical simulation as illustrated for one case in fig 8 and are summarized in table 2 both b 0 and lv impacted the intrinsic growth rate for b 0 3 increasing lv from 0 5 to 0 7 produced an 88 increase in r for b 0 0 3 increasing lv caused a 56 increase in r the smaller increase in r for b 0 0 3 can be attributed to the delayed occurrence of positive feedbacks and patch merging when the initial coverage is small specifically in scenarios with b 0 0 3 the patches were more sparsely distributed in the channel which allowed them to initially grow without the benefit of any positive feedbacks even with high lv 0 7 the delayed occurrence in patch merging inhibited a faster growth for a smaller b 0 in figs 5 and 6 merging first occurs in step 3 for scenario 2 while for scenario 24 it occurs in step 1 and in turn the rate growth r increased less from lv 0 5 0 7 for a constant lv increasing b 0 increased r table 2 this makes physical sense because starting with more initial patches high b 0 created more wakes per step thus a greater growth rate r to further explore dependencies on lv additional simulations using the initial distribution of scenarios 37 and 38 b 0 3 were run for lv 0 6 0 8 and 0 9 as shown in fig 9 both bf and r increased linearly with increasing lv indicating both that bf can be reached in fewer time steps with higher lv and that the final coverage would be higher this reflected the fact that increasing lv generates more area below the critical velocity uc lv u 0 for deposition and growth which encourages more patch growth per step and can support a greater final coverage bf one of the objectives of our modeling study was to determine the degree to which the initial configuration of patches had an influence on the final vegetation coverage specifically ten different random distributions of patches were run for each of the initial vegetation coverage values the modeling results showed that the initial random configurations did not have a strong influence on the final coverage i e each individual random distribution produced roughly the same final coverage to within 11 for lv 0 5 and 10 for lv 0 7 fig 7 to explore the influence of the assumed random distribution a case was also included for which the initial distribution was not random but ordered specifically a case with b 0 0 3 was run with patches deliberately positioned in rows along each side of the wall fig 10 the neighboring patches were a distance of 17 1d apart in the y direction 33 5d in the x direction and 0 45d from the wall the transverse spacing was chosen to be large enough to have no lateral patch interaction based on de lima et al 2015 and vandenbruwaene et al 2011 each streamwise row evolved independently into an island fig 10 confirming that no lateral interaction occurred notably even with the vegetation initially aligned in rows the final vegetation coverage fell within the ranges observed for initially random distributions specifically 40 and 50 for lv 0 5 and 0 7 respectively table 2 this gave further support to the conclusion that the initial vegetation distribution had no influence on the final vegetation coverage the final vegetation coverage depends only on the critical velocity threshold lv table 2 4 discussion the present study coupled the introduction of vegetation to regions of reduced velocity to study the evolution of vegetation coverage in a stream channel under constant flow conditions in contrast kondziolka and nepf 2014 who also coupled vegetation growth to reduced velocity considered an unbounded domain with flow forced by a constant surface bed slope as the vegetation coverage increases the domain scale flow resistance increases so that if the surface slope is constant as in kondziolka and nepf 2014 the domain scale average velocity is reduced making it possible for the velocity over the entire domain to drop below the critical velocity such that full vegetation coverage can be achieved this contrasts with the simulations in a bounded channel done in this study for which full coverage was not achieved for similar conditions of lv this is because continuity of flow within the bounded domain of a stream channel required that velocity in unvegetated regions increased as vegetation coverage increased making it impossible to reach full vegetation coverage although the simulations did not include sediment it is instructive to consider how the model relates to the expected sediment response this can be done by using the hjulström diagram e g christiansen and hamblin 2014 which defines deposition and erosion of sediment as a function of velocity and grain size the parameter values lv 0 5 and u 0 9 8 cm s correspond to a critical velocity uc 4 9 cm s which in turn corresponds to a grain size of 0 9 mm for lv 0 7 the critical velocity is uc 6 9 cm s which corresponds to a grain size of 1 5 mm therefore using lv 0 5 and 0 7 the model identifies regions that can retain particles of diameter 0 9 mm or 1 5 mm respectively which falls between silt and sand as a matter of comparison sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2005 in a river in germany reported that fine sediment was selectively deposited inside the wake of s sagittifolia with d 50 0 8 mm whereas around the patch the sediment was coarser d 50 4 mm indicating that finer material was excluded due to the higher velocity adjacent to the patch so the conditions represented in the model are representative of this field site based on fig 7 and table 2 the value of the final vegetation coverage bf depends only on the limiting velocity lv the physical explanation for this is the following since the velocity within the vegetation is much less than u 0 we can assume it is approximately zero so that continuity estimates the velocity in the unvegetated regions as u unvegetated u 0 1 b hence a higher blockage factor b leads to higher velocity in the unvegetated region as u unvegetated increases the chance of any unvegetated region having a velocity less than uc lv u 0 decreases which in turn decreases the likelihood of more growth by extension when lv is higher the value of u unvegetated for which vegetation growth stops is higher so that bf the value of b when growth stops will also be higher for example within a watershed of uniform grain size distribution same uc this implies that streams with lower velocity smaller u 0 and thus higher lv uc u 0 would be associated with higher vegetation coverage indeed this trend was noted in a field study by chambers et al 1991 specifically higher vegetation coverage was observed in streams with lower velocity one limitation of the model is that it does not track the physical changes in water depth associated with the free surface slope simulations for which the water surface slope becomes significant may not be realized in the field because overtopping of the vegetation or of the bank which would be associated with an increase in the effective channel width would result in different velocity distributions than those generated by the current 2 d model for emergent vegetation in a river the water depth is typically between 50 and 100 cm schoelynck et al 2012 green 2005 cameron et al 2013 naden et al 2006 in this framework an increase in water depth of around 50 100 cm would be significant and may cause upstream overbanking i e water leaves the main channel and expands into the adjacent flood plain and or overtopping of the vegetation green 2006 the risk of overbanking would also depend on the channel morphology if the banks are very steep then the channel may be able to accommodate an increase of water depth of about 1 m given that our model is two dimensional the increase in the water surface slope can be assessed with the difference in pressure between the inlet and the outlet in the simulation the flow rate is constant such that an increase in blockage factor necessitates an increase in the hydrostatic pressure between the inlet and the outlet which translates into a difference in water surface elevation as expected the maximum surface slopes occurred when the vegetation coverage was highest bf and were in the range 2 7 cm 100 m this is in accordance for instance with green 2006 who reported values of 2 4 cm 100 m 108 cm 100 m and 96 cm 100 m of surface slope in river reaches of southern england where the velocity was in the same magnitude as u 0 and the predominant vegetation was emergent see table 2 in the author s paper sites e1 e2 and e3 coincidentally the river reach used in green s work was 25 m long similar to the numerical channel which is 25 3 m long so for the conditions considered in this study the increase in water surface slope with increasing vegetation coverage would not likely overtop the vegetation or the banks the present model did not address how the initial colonization of patches occurred but simply assumed an initial random or aligned distribution of patches previous studies have similarly assumed a random distribution for the initial state of the model kondziolka and nepf 2014 crouzy et al 2016 verschoren 2017 the initial colonization of real plants results from interactions between biological and physical processes including seed dispersal germination establishment burial and physical transport in the field different degrees of randomness in the distribution of new vegetation have been observed for example barrat segretain and amoros 1996 observed three different patterns of patch colonization in the first pattern potamogeton pusillus randomly colonized bare areas that were not necessarily in contact with existing patches in the second pattern groenlandia densa luronium natans and potamogeton natans established in bare areas through propagation from adjacent vegetation a process known as a border effect finally an intermediate colonization pattern between the random dispersion and the border effect was observed for callitriche platycarpa elodea canadensis hippuris vulgaris ranunculus circinatus and sparganium emersum for non vegetated channels in which the initial seeds were dispersed by the flow the deposition and growth of those seeds occurred more frequently in areas of lower elevation of the river van dijk et al 2013 these field observations indicate that different degrees of randomness are present in real systems further the modeling results presented in this study indicated that the initial distribution was not a key factor in determining the final vegetation coverage and specifically that bf was essentially constant to within 10 across ten different initial random distributions and even including an aligned distribution but for the same bo and lv the morphodynamic evolution of the channel was not included in the simulations which limits the present model in terms of the interactions between the channel and the vegetation instead of including sediment in the simulations we linked deposition and subsequent vegetation growth to threshold values of velocity as described in section 2 this approach implies that the vegetated regions of the channel contain more fine sediments than the unvegetated regions consistent with observations that vegetation selectively traps fine sediment e g sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2005 licci et al 2019 the spatial distribution of new growth which the model assumed was driven by new deposition was consistent with other recent studies for example lera et al 2019 numerically studied the effects of submersed aquatic vegetation on the morphodynamic evolution of a river mouth bar the direction of bar progradation was reversed from downstream without vegetation to upstream with vegetation specifically the additional resistance provided by the vegetation caused greater flow deflection upstream of the bar which decreased the bed shear stress and velocity upstream of the bar which in turn promoted sediment deposition on the upstream side of the bar such that the bar progradation was towards the river mouth a similar mechanism was observed in this study for scenarios simulated with lv 0 7 e g fig 6 scenario 2 in which the patch located farthest upstream grew towards the channel inlet i e grew upstream here a single plant density within the patch was considered however as reviewed in larsen 2019 section 3 2 the magnitude in flow divergence upstream of a patch increases with increasing patch size and plant density within the patch such that the potential region of upstream patch growth depends on these patch characteristics further even for cases with enhanced deposition upstream of the patch erosion or diminished deposition can be observed within the leading edge of the patch and this is attributed to stem generated turbulence at the leading edge e g fig 6 zong and nepf 2010 a detailed review of the competing influences of flow divergence and turbulence generation on the morphological evolution near a patch of in stream vegetation is provided in larsen 2019 according to coulthard et al 2007 not considering the bed morphology may be acceptable if the channel form does not change significantly or if the study comprises short periods of time for instance in two straight river reaches in the uk the accumulation of fine sediments was enhanced at vegetated locations but not to the degree of causing significant changes in bed morphology cotton et al 2006 heppell et al 2009 schnauder and sukhodolov 2012 also observed a stable bed morphology in a vegetated lowland river in germany over a 10 month period they observed changes in the distribution of fine organic matter but not in bed elevation similarly sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2005 observed changes in the deposition patterns with the presence of vegetation but not a change in bed morphology sufficient to impact the flow patterns therefore in many cases in the field the alteration to the flow field is dominated by the change in vegetation not in the change in bed morphology and it is these conditions that our method and 2 d model represent to help illustrate the point that small changes in bed elevation do not significantly influence the flow and vegetation pattern we compared the dynamic significance of flow depth alteration to the presence of vegetation specifically the contribution of vegetation drag can be represented by the term μu α see eq 11 and the contribution from bed drag can be represented by ρcfu2 h where cf is the bed drag coefficient and h is the water depth as already mentioned for emergent vegetation in a river the water depth is typically between 50 and 100 cm schoelynck et al 2012 green 2005 cameron et al 2013 naden et al 2006 the bed friction coefficient cf in rivers is typically between 0 01 and 0 06 luhar et al 2008 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2010 green 2006 reported velocities between 6 6 and 17 2 cm s in english streams populated with emergent vegetation for ρ 1000 kg m3 μ 10 3 kg ms α 1 700 000 m2 cf 0 01 u 0 1 m s and h 1 0 m typical field values and similar to our study the contribution from vegetation drag 70 kg m2 s2 is much larger than the bed drag 0 1 kg m2 s2 this means that the addition of vegetation produces a much more significant change in local drag and velocity distribution than a change in depth in fact kondziolka and nepf 2014 showed that the flow resistance feedback typically associated with bathymetry can also be generated by differences in vegetation bare versus vegetated however it is worth noting that other studies have documented important morphodynamic feedbacks associated with vegetation for example feedbacks between vegetation and morphological change were shown to contribute to the formation of alternating bars barenbold et al 2016 bertagni et al 2018 and multiple channels perona et al 2014 the growth pattern that emerged from the model fig 8 was similar to that observed for growth of aquatic vegetation in lakes wilson et al 2005 luo et al 2016 and rivers crouzy et al 2016 verschoren 2017 for example between march and october of 2007 jeffres et al 2008 measured macrophyte distribution at thirteen sites in the shasta river california usa averaged across all transects the blockage factor ranged from 26 in march to 70 in september october the measured growth pattern of the vegetation in the shasta river fig 11 was similar to the growth that emerged in the numerical simulations i e the rate of growth slope of b versus time was greatest in the initial months march to may after may the rate of expansion slowed and eventually b became constant our modeling provides a physical explanation for this growth pattern as described in detail in the context of figs 7 and 8 and table 2 above eq 12 was fit to the data from the shasta river fig 11 yielding a growth rate of r 0 69 month 1 we can connect this result to our simulations we define the total growth period as the time for the blockage factor to go from b 0 to 0 99bf in eq 12 for the shasta river the total growth period is 6 months none of the numerical scenarios achieved bf 70 as in the shasta data however using a linear fit in fig 9 bf 53 24lv 17 59 r 1 06lv 0 19 we predict r 0 85 step 1 for bf 70 for the scenario in fig 9 the evolution from b 0 26 to bf 70 will then occur in 4 9 model steps this implies that for the conditions in the shasta river each model step would correspond to 1 2 month the simulations only represented the evolution of vegetation during growth it did not represent the decay of vegetation later in the season which would result in a decline in blockage factor this later phase of the vegetation cycle is also important to the sediment cycle for instance kleeberg et al 2010 observed that the sediment retained within vegetation patches was finer and looser than the surrounding bare bed so that after decay these sediments were the first to be eroded and carried away downstream in this stream the deposition signature created by the vegetation deposition feedback active in the growing season may be completely erased during senescence on the other hand cotton et al 2006 observed that patches of ranunculus did not completely decay in a headwater reach even during the winter months in this scenario the vegetation deposition growth feedback modeled by the simulation can be maintained from year to year finally the present model assumed that the flow was two dimensional which is a good assumption for emergent vegetation but when vegetation is submerged the regions of enhanced deposition may shift for emergent conditions the distance over which deposition is enhanced le scales with the patch width bp liu et al 2018 however for submerged vegetation with height h less than the water depth the flow structure cannot be considered two dimensional for wide submerged patches h bp a recirculating eddy forms in the streamwise vertical plane establishing the wake length within which the velocity is reduced and deposition is increased liu et al 2018 hu et al 2018 in this case the length of the deposition region is controlled by the patch height liu et al 2018 for river vegetation bp is typically greater than h liu et al 2018 such that a longer deposition region is generated for emergent vegetation this pattern was observed in a study of reed canarygrass specifically elliot et al 2018 observed that with greater flow depth greater submergence the region of deposition and the positive feedbacks for longitudinal expansion of patches decreased these studies suggest that the modeling results produced by the 2 d modeling which assumed emergent vegetation would likely overpredict the rate and degree of patch expansion for submerged vegetation 5 conclusion this study simulated the evolution of emergent vegetation patches in a channel using a cfd simulation of the flow field coupled with a growth model based on a critical velocity we considered how growth rate and final vegetation coverage were impacted by the initial vegetation coverage described by the blockage factor b 0 0 3 and 3 and by the critical velocity below which vegetation growth was assumed to be possible called the limiting velocity lv 0 5 and 0 7 in all cases when reaching the final blockage factor bf the vegetation was distributed in elongated patches the value of the final vegetation coverage bf was not dependendent on either the initial coverage b 0 or on the specific distribution of vegetation random or aligned but depended only on the critical velocity for vegetation growth lv specifically bf increased with increasing lv 0 5 0 9 from 43 to 64 fig 8 positive feedbacks such as the merging of adjacent patches impacted the initial growth rate but not the final vegetation coverage specifically scenarios with b 0 3 promoted early patch interaction allowing small islands to quickly merge into corridors of vegetation the patches in scenarios with b 0 0 3 were more disperse which delayed merging and decreased the growth rate r declarations of interest none competing interests the authors declare no competing interests acknowledgments taís

632,computational fluid dynamics was used to study the evolution of small patches of vegetation into a vegetated landscape in a channel the growth of new vegetation occurred in regions where the flow velocity was reduced below a threshold value defined as a fraction of the channel average velocity u 0 two threshold values or limiting velocity values lv were used lv 0 5 and 0 7 two initial blockage factors percentage vegetation coverage of the channel were considered 3 and 0 3 chosen to represent cases with and without respectively hydrodynamic interaction between the initial patches the simulation illustrated both positive feedbacks between flow and vegetation which enhanced vegetation expansion and negative feedbacks which led to patch erosion and limited patch growth the most rapid expansion of the vegetated area occurred during the initial simulation steps when the flow blockage due to vegetation was small a higher velocity threshold higher lv produced more rapid initial growth

providing several ecological services in aquatic systems such as turbidity reduction jones et al 2012 habitat provision kemp et al 2000 bank stability pollen bankhead and simon 2010 oxygen production and nutrient uptake wilcock et al 1999 schulz et al 2003 these services are the product of dynamic interactions that occur among vegetation flow and sediment in which the vegetation affects the pattern of flow which in turn impacts patterns of sediment deposition and erosion and together the flow and sediment influence vegetation growth tsujimoto 1999 these relationships which can result in positive or negative feedbacks largely control the evolution of low gradient fluvial landscapes and coastal marshes see review by larsen 2019 for example temmerman et al 2007 in fig 1 of their paper present aerial photographs of the westerschelde estuary in the netherlands taken from 1989 to 2001 during this time span individual patches of spartina anglica grew into extensive areas of vegetation interleaved by channels the channels resulted from the plant flow interaction in the way that vegetation acted as erosion agents by concentrating the flow at the patch edges which induced channel erosion similarly tooth and nanson 2000 observed in an ephemeral river in australia that vegetation evolved from dense chaotic shrubs to elongated distributions associated with ridges which partitioned the channel into bare bed anabranches jeffres et al 2008 observed that the vegetation cover ranged from a low value of 26 in march to a high value of 73 in september in the shasta river california they suggested that the vegetation growth started with the establishment of a parent vegetation patch e g e canadensis or r aquatilus which in turn promoted the accumulation of sediment inside and behind the patch providing substrate for the establishment of plants that are better late season performers leading to downstream extension of the parent patch to understand the physical mechanisms that govern the feedbacks between vegetation flow and sediment experimental studies initially focused on a single vegetation patch chen et al 2012 follett and nepf 2012 for a single finite patch of vegetation with diameter d the incoming flow starts to decrease 1 2 diameters upstream of the patch some of the approaching flow is diverted laterally accelerating around the patch fig 1a the arrows with velocity u 2 and typically a small fraction of the flow passes through the patch bleeding into the wake downstream fig 1a the arrows with velocity u 1 the accelerated flow around the patch edges can both reduce sediment deposition and erode the channel inhibiting the expansion of the patch in the lateral direction bouma et al 2009 bennett et al 2008 follett and nepf 2012 in contrast the reduced velocity in the wake of the patch can allow sediment deposition and provide shelter for the establishment of new seedlings encouraging new vegetation growth in the streamwise direction tsujimoto 1999 chen et al 2012 experimental and numerical studies investigated the interactions between a pair of patches and the possible mechanisms for lateral growth that can be derived from those interactions vandenbruwaene et al 2011 meire et al 2014 de lima et al 2015 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 used a pair of side by side patches of spartina anglica in which the patch diameter d and the interpatch distance t were varied when the ratio d t increased which was proposed to occur when the patches are growing the flow velocity increased between them suggesting that the flow would prevent the patches from merging however when d t 6 7 10 the flow acceleration was suppressed between the patches signaling the possibility of patch merger at this condition meire et al 2014 studied the flow field generated by a pair of side by side patches that were separated by a distance t the region of reduced velocity immediately downstream of each patch was similar to that observed for a single patch fig 1b in which the steady wakes behind each patch are similar to the wake in fig 1a but an additional region of low velocity was formed on the centerline between the patches farther downstream fig 1b the region in light grey the authors hypothesized that if new growth occurred in the secondary region of low velocity then the patches would be able to merge finally de lima et al 2015 studied the effects of both lateral l and longitudinal t distances on the wakes of a pair of patches when the patches were far from each other t d 1 5 and l d 5 they acted as isolated patches creating wakes similar in size to an isolated patch e g fig 1a when the patches were very close t d 1 3 the wakes merged downstream similar to fig 1b which increased the growth area of the patch pair to greater than that of two isolated patches however when the patches were placed at intermediate distances t d 1 5 and l d 5 the area of possible growth was reduced relative to that of isolated patches fig 1c the wake of the upstream patch is smaller than the wake in fig 1a meaning that the neighboring patch negatively affected the potential region of new vegetation growth the previous studies of flow and deposition around pairs of patches led to important insights into how the proximity of a neighboring patch can affect vegetation growth the configurations seen in fig 1 are the first step of a vegetation growth process but more steps are required to assess the transition of patches into vegetated landscapes vegetation evolution has been modeled with cellular automata and physics based numerical models cellular models are easy to set up they do not require large quantities of input data and they can perform fast calculations with simple mathematical rules which are sometimes coupled with a simple hydrodynamic model solari et al 2015 larsen and harvey 2011 for example used hydraulic geomorphic and ecological variables to compute the vegetation distribution of a shallow aquatic ecosystem in a cellular automata model the model produced 28 different vegetation mosaics several of which corresponded to landscapes found in the everglades u s more recently kondziolka and nepf 2014 implemented the wake behavior for interacting patches described in meire et al 2014 into a model and simulated vegetation growth based on a velocity threshold three distinct landscapes were obtained sparsely distributed vegetation vegetation cut through by channels and full vegetation coverage although cellular models are useful tools in making a general exploration of vegetation growth they have simplified physics coulthard et al 2007 solari et al 2015 for this reason some studies have adopted more complex physics based numerical models in which the equations of conservation of mass and momentum are numerically solved in one two or three dimensions for example wang et al 2018 used a one dimensional model to investigate the temporal and spatial changes of riparian vegetation and the interactions between flow and riparian vegetation dynamics two dimensional 2 d models have been used to quantify the interaction between vegetation and flow in streams and rivers lotsari et al 2015 verschoren et al 2016 for example used a 2 d flow model to investigate the spatial patterns of in stream submerged macrophytes on the reach scale with the same model verschoren 2017 simulated the growth of submerged vegetation for one growing season using a velocity threshold and a logistic equation to describe vegetation growth marjoribanks et al 2017 used a three dimensional model to study the complex flow spatial heterogeneity within a vegetated channel they modeled vegetation as a sink term in the momentum equations producing the key flow structures associated with submerged vegetation in channels which includes wake regions behind vegetation and high velocity threads in between vegetation similarly anjum et al 2018 used the computational fluid dynamics cfd code fluent fluent inc 2014 to analyze the flow properties like mean velocity profiles and turbulence characteristics through double layered emergent and submerged vegetation and discontinuous vegetation patches in an open channel flow inferring the implications for sedimentation finally lera et al 2019 employed the cfd code delft3d roelvink and van banning 1994 to assess the effects of submersed aquatic vegetation on the morphodynamics of river mouth bars to represent the vegetation they used a hydraulic roughness derived from the height and density of the vegetation however none of these studies simulated vegetation growth the current research explored the evolution of aquatic vegetation in a channel by using cfd to obtain the velocity field and by using a velocity threshold to identify regions of vegetation growth the simulations were used to determine how the vegetation evolution and final vegetation distribution were impacted by 1 the initial vegetation patch distribution 2 the initial degree of vegetation coverage and 3 the velocity threshold 2 methods the computational domain was defined as a two dimensional open rectangular channel with x and y defining the streamwise and lateral coordinates respectively and x 0 at the start of the domain fig 2 a 2 d domain was appropriate because the study only considered emergent vegetation with vertically uniform biomass distribution for which the flow adjustment occurs predominantly in the horizontal plane vegetation patches of diameter d 22 cm were distributed at random positions between x 14d and 84d in a region called effective channel area with area ca the positioning of the patches was restricted in this way to allow the incoming flow to be well developed before interacting with the patches and to provide free space for vegetation to grow to maintain the same effective channel area in each run one patch was placed at x 14d and another patch at x 84d that is at the limits of the effective channel area the entire domain extended 115d in length 2530 cm and 20d in width 440 cm the evolution of vegetation within the channel was evaluated with the following sequence the velocity field associated with the initial vegetation distribution was solved through cfd which is described in more detail below the velocity field was explored to identify the regions into which vegetation might expand or from which vegetation might be removed based on a threshold velocity new vegetation was added or subtracted and the velocity field computed again fig 3 this process was repeated until the change in vegetated coverage was less than a prescribed threshold described in more detail below the use of a threshold velocity for vegetation growth and loss was based on the following previous studies regions of deposition are associated with regions of diminished velocity and regions of deposition provide the nutrient rich substrate that promotes new growth scott et al 1996 sand jensen 1998 gurnell et al 2001 schoelynck et al 2012 further regions of elevated velocity especially above the threshold for sediment motion may dislodge seedlings and inhibit vegetation growth van wesenbeeck et al 2008 bouma et al 2009 to non dimensionalize the problem the limiting velocity was defined as a fraction denoted as lv of the upstream velocity u 0 hence based on the velocity field obtained through cfd new vegetation was added into regions where the normalized total velocity normalized by u 0 was lower than lv and removed from regions where the normalized total velocity was higher than lv recognizing that the threshold velocity will depend on the sediment size smaller particles have a lower threshold velocity two limiting velocities were considered 0 7u 0 and 0 5u 0 i e lv 0 7 and 0 5 representing a bed consisting of coarser and finer material respectively although we cannot connect these velocities to specific sediment sizes they provide an exploratory test of how lv influences the areal extent of enhanced deposition and vegetation growth de lima et al 2015 the vegetation coverage was described by the blockage factor b which defines the fraction of the channel bed area containing vegetation green 2005 2006 specifically for a vegetated area va within the effective channel area ca 1 b v a c a 100 the process of adjusting the vegetation and re computing the velocity field was repeated until the vegetation reached a stable state defined by a change in blockage factor less than 0 5 after three successive computational steps i e b b 0 005 at that point the vegetation was assumed to have evolved to a stable landscape with a final blockage factor bf the number of initial patches was chosen to produce a specific initial blockage factor b 0 two values of b 0 were considered 0 3 6 patches and 3 54 patches the patch distributions were constructed based on the following steps first one patch was assigned at x 14d and another patch at x 84d fixing the limits of the effective channel area ca second a random number generator provided the x y positions for the rest of the patches inside ca the patches could not overlap one another in total ten random configurations were created for each b 0 and each configuration was simulated with lv 0 5 and 0 7 table 1 combinations of b 0 and lv generated 40 scenarios for simulation an average nearest neighbor distance in between patches was defined as the center to center distance to the nearest neighboring patch for each patch averaged over all patches in the case of 0 3 the average nearest neighbor distance between patches was x d 8 5 and y d 4 1 which falls in the range of no interaction see fig 12 of de lima et al 2015 in the case of b 0 3 the average distance was x d 0 9 and y d 0 8 which falls in the range of patch interaction according to fig 12 of de lima et al 2015 the velocity field was obtained using the cfd code fluent fluent inc 2014 the code applies the finite volume method for the spatial discretization of the domain the governing equations are integrated over each control volume so that mass and momentum are conserved the simulations were performed using the two dimensional steady state reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with a k ε model the standard k ε turbulence closure of the rans equations are preferred for vegetated channels compared with more sophisticated turbulence models for being simple having low computational cost farhadi et al 2018 and being able to capture the most important processes determining the flow field around vegetation patches as for example the steady wake characteristics de lima et al 2015 verschoren et al 2016 the flow was considered two dimensional since previous experimental studies using emergent patches showed that three dimensional effects associated with the bottom boundary layer are of second order zong and nepf 2012 and that 2 d models are able to accurately predict the velocity field and the spatial pattern formation of vegetation in rivers verschoren et al 2016 the influence of the water depth upon the velocity and vegetation patterns was neglected as well as 3 d processes that are expected to occur around vegetation patches particularly during the growth of the vegetation initially submerged these assumptions will be discussed in section 4 considering a steady 2 d flow of an incompressible and homogeneous fluid the reynolds averaged equations for conservation of mass and momentum are given by 2 u i x i 0 3 ρ u j u i x j p x i x j 2 μ d i j ρ u i u j s i in which i or j 1

wilcox 1994 following lowe et al 2008 and kondziolka and nepf 2014 a porous media model was employed to simulate the vegetation patches specifically the momentum loss term si in eq 3 was 11 s i 1 α μ u i within which α is the permeability of the vegetation the permeability α was calibrated by numerically modeling the experiments of meire et al 2014 described below finally the pressure velocity coupling was achieved using the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations pressure based algorithms a second order upwind scheme was used for spatial discretization of the flow equations because the model is 2 d the water depth was not specified details of the governing equations turbulence model and algorithms can be found in the fluent user s guide the following boundary conditions were defined a uniform flow was imposed at the inlet with streamwise velocity u u 0 9 8 cm s and transverse velocity v 0 the value of u 0 was chosen to match laboratory studies against which the model was calibrated meire et al 2014 and it is representative of some stream environments e g in table 2 of his work green 2006 reported velocities between 6 6 and 17 2 cm s in english streams populated with emergent vegetation nonetheless for an individual patch the size of the wake is predominantly determined by its porosity zong and nepf 2012 so that similar wake geometry and thus wake evolution would be expected over a range of u 0 consistent with this vandenbruwaene et al 2011 found that the relative increase and decrease of velocity in a pair of side by side patches was similar after testing three inlet velocities 10 20 and 30 cm s at the outlet an average static reference pressure of 0 pa was specified this condition has been widely used to calculate flow around bluff 2bodies e g tian et al 2013 the no slip boundary condition was applied at the channel walls at the bed and water surface a symmetry condition was applied which means zero flux of all quantities across these boundaries a mesh interface was created to connect the channel mesh to the porous medium mesh this interface guarantees the passage of fluxes through the cells even if the node locations of the cells between the channel and the porous medium are not identical the numerical model was calibrated with measurements made in a laboratory channel containing two vegetation patches in a side by side arrangement separated by a gap distance of 11 cm in which each patch had ad 1 31 a is the frontal area per unit patch volume and d 22 cm being the patch diameter meire et al 2014 consistent with the laboratory conditions in this case the simulation represented a 10 m long and 1 2 m wide channel with imposed inflow velocity u 0 9 8 cm s a pair of patches of diameter d 22 cm was placed 3 m downstream from the channel entrance the computational patch was a circular region with permeability α which was adjusted to minimize the difference between simulation and measurement we used the experimental data of dimensionless velocity components u u0 and v u0 passing along the centerline of the left patch left hand side considering the flow direction at the channel fig 4 a and the centerline between the pair of patches fig 4b the best fit was achieved with α 1 700 000 m2 for which the maximum difference between simulation and measurement was 6 considering that the calibrated model itself is not sufficient to make predictions lane et al 2005 roache 2009 we performed the validation for our calibrated model using a different patch configuration with the same value of ad specifically we simulated a pair of patches of ad 1 31 in a side by side arrangement separated by a gap distance of 5 cm meire et al 2014 comparing the dimensionless velocity components u u0 and v u0 at the centerline between the patches fig 4c the simulated and experimental data show a maximum difference of 6 to solve the conservation of mass and momentum equations with the solver fluent a new mesh was created at each step of the simulated scenarios automatic meshes were created with ansys mesh software the meshes had around 50 000 elements each to avoid numerical errors associated with the chosen mesh the grid convergence index gci test based on the richardson extrapolation was performed the gci is an index of the uncertainty associated with the solution obtained by the use of meshes with different resolutions the test assumes that it is possible to evaluate if the solution for the flow variables converges monotonically at all points as the grid spacing tends to zero roache 1997 lane et al 2005 celik et al 2008 coarse medium and fine meshes with respectively 5000 20 000 and 50 000 elements were created to model our validation case the simulated streamwise velocity was used to compare the three grids the maximum absolute difference between the medium and coarse meshes was 11 between the fine and medium meshes the difference was 3 considering the solutions for fine medium and coarse grids as ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 respectively and the solution differences for medium fine and coarse medium as ε 21 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 and ε 32 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 respectively the convergence ratio is r ε 21 ε 32 if 0 r 1 monotonic convergence is achieved but if r 0 it indicates oscillatory convergence for all the points tested in our validation 0 r 1 that is the mesh refinements showed monotonic convergence the numerical uncertainty due to the mesh resolution is then obtained by the gci value calculated for the finer grid resolution which for our simulations it was 0 44 for more details about the gci calculations see celik et al 2008 3 results in the initial steps the patches grew predominantly in the streamwise direction forming elongated islands fig 5 the rapid patch growth that occurred initially can be attributed to the formation of wakes which were developed due to the free space between and downstream of the patches e g fig 3 especially for scenarios with b 0 0 3 the patches acted as if they were isolated developing individual wakes that resembled wakes behind a single patch e g see chen et al 2012 as seen in fig 5 scenarios 1 and 2 thus steady wakes play an important role in vegetation growth this is consistent with kondziolka and nepf 2014 who showed that when the wakes were excluded from their simulations the vegetation growth was slower and achieved much smaller final coverage in addition some upstream growth was also observed in scenario 2 the leading edge of the first patch closest to inlet elongates toward the channel entrance deposition ahead of a patch has been observed in previous studies of emergent vegetation e g see in fig 6 in zong and nepf 2010 and fig 6 in ortiz et al 2013 and was attributed to the decrease in velocity that occurred as flow diverges away from the region of high drag starting one to two patch widths upstream of the leading edge e g fig 4 in zong and nepf 2010 for scenarios with b 0 3 the proximity of patches caused their wakes to interact in creating both positive and negative feedbacks meire et al 2014 de lima et al 2015 for example positive feedbacks occurred when side by side wakes also called neighboring wakes created regions of low velocity in between patches which promoted lateral growth and patch merging this can be seen in fig 5 scenario 23 where the blue circles show the lateral merger of neighboring patches between step 0 and step 2 the flow velocity in between the patches decreased in step 1 which allowed merger in the next step patches that were roughly aligned in the x direction also merged as the wake of the upstream patch grew to meet the downstream patch for instance see the merged patches marked with a blue circle in fig 5 scenario 24 on the other hand negative patch to patch feedback occurred when the interaction between patches resulted in smaller growth areas than that of isolated patches to illustrate scenarios 23 and 24 each show a pair of patches circled in red in which one patch within the pair grew less than its neighbor the diminished wake growth was associated with elevated velocity between the neighboring patches reaching almost 1 5u 0 the removal of vegetated area was also the result of negative patch to patch feedbacks for example in scenario 23 step 5 25 near the channel inlet the smaller patches at the center of the channel were progressively reduced and eliminated as the patches along each wall expanded laterally the removal of vegetation patches from regions where adjacent patches promoted accelerated flow was consistent with field observations reported by schoelynck et al 2012 who performed a transplantation experiment in a river placing new vegetation next to existing patches plants transplanted into regions adjacent to existing patches where flow acceleration was high had a low survival rate in the next steps as the patches grew bigger b increased and the fraction unobstructed flow area 1 b 100 decreased as flow was diverted away from the growing vegetation patches into the smaller unobstructed cross section the velocity magnitude increased to satisfy continuity consequently less unvegetated area fell below the limiting velocity slowing the rate of vegetation growth with increasing simulation step as seen in fig 7 in addition the progressive merging of patches reduced the number of vegetation units e g reducing over ten time steps the number of patches from 6 to 3 in scenario 2 and from 54 to 10 in scenario 23 fig 6 for b 0 0 3 the patches became wider with increasing simulation step for b 0 3 the patches were more elongated approaching the channelized state described in kondziolka and nepf 2014 which consisted of vegetation extending through the entire the flow domain with contiguous region of bare bed parallel to the main flow direction and within which the velocity remained sufficiently above lv to inhibit plant growth a pattern similar to scenario 24 was observed in a natural channel with sagittaria sagittifolia fig 8 in sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2005 indicating that the modeled patch evolution produced realistic final distributions finally the pattern of initially rapid growth followed by diminished growth rates has also been observed in large marsh systems for example fig 1 in temmerman et al 2007 presents aerial photographs of the westerschelde estuary in the netherlands taken from 1989 to 2001 during this time individual patches of spartina anglica grew into an extensive area of vegetation interleaved by channels the growth was most rapid in the first four years 0 64 increase in coverage year followed by slower growth over the next eight years 0 32 increase in coverage year to study the evolution of blockage factor scenarios with same b 0 and lv were averaged resulting in four curves of b fig 7 as noted above the rate slope at which b increased declined with increasing b because as the fraction of unobstructed flow area 1 b 100 decreased the mean velocity in those regions increased such that less unvegetated area fell below the limiting velocity slowing the rate of vegetation growth specifically it required only two to five steps to reach half of the final blockage factor b bf 0 5 but required 30 more simulation steps to reach the final blockage bf the values of bf are in table 2 scenarios with lv 0 7 achieved a higher final vegetation coverage higher bf and more rapid expansion than those with lv 0 5 for a constant b 0 see bf in table 2 and the b curves in fig 7 this trend can be used to infer channel response under different velocity conditions recall that lv defines the critical velocity uc below which sediment motion is inhibited and vegetation growth would be encouraged specifically lv uc u 0 the trend of increasing bf with decreasing lv implies the following as u 0 decreases lv uc u 0 increases so that more of the channel area can support vegetation i e bf increases this dependence was observed in the field by chambers et al 1991 who compared three streams within the same watershed same sediment supply and thus same uc but with different u 0 they observed that the growth of macrophytes resulted in greater final coverage in the channel with the lowest u 0 and this was attributed to differences in sediment texture specifically in the channels with lower u 0 lv was higher and it was easier to retain fine sediment that was both higher in nutrient content and provided a more stable substrate for growth because more regions fell below the critical velocity increasing b 0 from 0 3 to 3 caused b to increase more rapidly in the initial steps steps 1 5 in fig 7 as mentioned in section 2 for b 0 3 the average distance to the nearest patch neighbor in the streamwise and transverse direction were respectively x d 0 9 and y d 0 8 these distances were small enough to produce interactions with positive feedbacks between the patches leading to a deposition area 1 1 1 9 bigger than that produced for patches with no interaction see fig 12 at de lima et al 2015 and thus a more rapid patch growth compared to patches with no interaction in the subsequent steps however the growth leveled off and for the same lv the same final coverage was achieved for scenarios starting with b 0 0 3 or 3 within the uncertainty table 2 in summary a higher b 0 promoted more rapid vegetation growth in the initial steps but not a higher bf this can be applied to restoration programs desiring to cover a certain area with vegetation knowing that vegetation will reach bf independently from b 0 those programs can reduce the costs of the patch planting in terms of the number of initial patches the vegetation evolution described in terms of the blockage factor fig 7 follows the von bertalanffy growth model schnute and fournier 1980 12 b b 0 b f b 0 1 ex p r n in which r is the intrinsic growth rate step 1 being related to the fraction by which the gap between the current blockage factor and the asymptotic final blockage factor is reduced each modeling step n r measures the exponential rate of approach to the asymptotic final blockage factor schnute and fournier 1980 the intrinsic growth rate for each scenario was estimated by fitting the growth rate model from eq 12 to the numerical simulation as illustrated for one case in fig 8 and are summarized in table 2 both b 0 and lv impacted the intrinsic growth rate for b 0 3 increasing lv from 0 5 to 0 7 produced an 88 increase in r for b 0 0 3 increasing lv caused a 56 increase in r the smaller increase in r for b 0 0 3 can be attributed to the delayed occurrence of positive feedbacks and patch merging when the initial coverage is small specifically in scenarios with b 0 0 3 the patches were more sparsely distributed in the channel which allowed them to initially grow without the benefit of any positive feedbacks even with high lv 0 7 the delayed occurrence in patch merging inhibited a faster growth for a smaller b 0 in figs 5 and 6 merging first occurs in step 3 for scenario 2 while for scenario 24 it occurs in step 1 and in turn the rate growth r increased less from lv 0 5 0 7 for a constant lv increasing b 0 increased r table 2 this makes physical sense because starting with more initial patches high b 0 created more wakes per step thus a greater growth rate r to further explore dependencies on lv additional simulations using the initial distribution of scenarios 37 and 38 b 0 3 were run for lv 0 6 0 8 and 0 9 as shown in fig 9 both bf and r increased linearly with increasing lv indicating both that bf can be reached in fewer time steps with higher lv and that the final coverage would be higher this reflected the fact that increasing lv generates more area below the critical velocity uc lv u 0 for deposition and growth which encourages more patch growth per step and can support a greater final coverage bf one of the objectives of our modeling study was to determine the degree to which the initial configuration of patches had an influence on the final vegetation coverage specifically ten different random distributions of patches were run for each of the initial vegetation coverage values the modeling results showed that the initial random configurations did not have a strong influence on the final coverage i e each individual random distribution produced roughly the same final coverage to within 11 for lv 0 5 and 10 for lv 0 7 fig 7 to explore the influence of the assumed random distribution a case was also included for which the initial distribution was not random but ordered specifically a case with b 0 0 3 was run with patches deliberately positioned in rows along each side of the wall fig 10 the neighboring patches were a distance of 17 1d apart in the y direction 33 5d in the x direction and 0 45d from the wall the transverse spacing was chosen to be large enough to have no lateral patch interaction based on de lima et al 2015 and vandenbruwaene et al 2011 each streamwise row evolved independently into an island fig 10 confirming that no lateral interaction occurred notably even with the vegetation initially aligned in rows the final vegetation coverage fell within the ranges observed for initially random distributions specifically 40 and 50 for lv 0 5 and 0 7 respectively table 2 this gave further support to the conclusion that the initial vegetation distribution had no influence on the final vegetation coverage the final vegetation coverage depends only on the critical velocity threshold lv table 2 4 discussion the present study coupled the introduction of vegetation to regions of reduced velocity to study the evolution of vegetation coverage in a stream channel under constant flow conditions in contrast kondziolka and nepf 2014 who also coupled vegetation growth to reduced velocity considered an unbounded domain with flow forced by a constant surface bed slope as the vegetation coverage increases the domain scale flow resistance increases so that if the surface slope is constant as in kondziolka and nepf 2014 the domain scale average velocity is reduced making it possible for the velocity over the entire domain to drop below the critical velocity such that full vegetation coverage can be achieved this contrasts with the simulations in a bounded channel done in this study for which full coverage was not achieved for similar conditions of lv this is because continuity of flow within the bounded domain of a stream channel required that velocity in unvegetated regions increased as vegetation coverage increased making it impossible to reach full vegetation coverage although the simulations did not include sediment it is instructive to consider how the model relates to the expected sediment response this can be done by using the hjulström diagram e g christiansen and hamblin 2014 which defines deposition and erosion of sediment as a function of velocity and grain size the parameter values lv 0 5 and u 0 9 8 cm s correspond to a critical velocity uc 4 9 cm s which in turn corresponds to a grain size of 0 9 mm for lv 0 7 the critical velocity is uc 6 9 cm s which corresponds to a grain size of 1 5 mm therefore using lv 0 5 and 0 7 the model identifies regions that can retain particles of diameter 0 9 mm or 1 5 mm respectively which falls between silt and sand as a matter of comparison sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2005 in a river in germany reported that fine sediment was selectively deposited inside the wake of s sagittifolia with d 50 0 8 mm whereas around the patch the sediment was coarser d 50 4 mm indicating that finer material was excluded due to the higher velocity adjacent to the patch so the conditions represented in the model are representative of this field site based on fig 7 and table 2 the value of the final vegetation coverage bf depends only on the limiting velocity lv the physical explanation for this is the following since the velocity within the vegetation is much less than u 0 we can assume it is approximately zero so that continuity estimates the velocity in the unvegetated regions as u unvegetated u 0 1 b hence a higher blockage factor b leads to higher velocity in the unvegetated region as u unvegetated increases the chance of any unvegetated region having a velocity less than uc lv u 0 decreases which in turn decreases the likelihood of more growth by extension when lv is higher the value of u unvegetated for which vegetation growth stops is higher so that bf the value of b when growth stops will also be higher for example within a watershed of uniform grain size distribution same uc this implies that streams with lower velocity smaller u 0 and thus higher lv uc u 0 would be associated with higher vegetation coverage indeed this trend was noted in a field study by chambers et al 1991 specifically higher vegetation coverage was observed in streams with lower velocity one limitation of the model is that it does not track the physical changes in water depth associated with the free surface slope simulations for which the water surface slope becomes significant may not be realized in the field because overtopping of the vegetation or of the bank which would be associated with an increase in the effective channel width would result in different velocity distributions than those generated by the current 2 d model for emergent vegetation in a river the water depth is typically between 50 and 100 cm schoelynck et al 2012 green 2005 cameron et al 2013 naden et al 2006 in this framework an increase in water depth of around 50 100 cm would be significant and may cause upstream overbanking i e water leaves the main channel and expands into the adjacent flood plain and or overtopping of the vegetation green 2006 the risk of overbanking would also depend on the channel morphology if the banks are very steep then the channel may be able to accommodate an increase of water depth of about 1 m given that our model is two dimensional the increase in the water surface slope can be assessed with the difference in pressure between the inlet and the outlet in the simulation the flow rate is constant such that an increase in blockage factor necessitates an increase in the hydrostatic pressure between the inlet and the outlet which translates into a difference in water surface elevation as expected the maximum surface slopes occurred when the vegetation coverage was highest bf and were in the range 2 7 cm 100 m this is in accordance for instance with green 2006 who reported values of 2 4 cm 100 m 108 cm 100 m and 96 cm 100 m of surface slope in river reaches of southern england where the velocity was in the same magnitude as u 0 and the predominant vegetation was emergent see table 2 in the author s paper sites e1 e2 and e3 coincidentally the river reach used in green s work was 25 m long similar to the numerical channel which is 25 3 m long so for the conditions considered in this study the increase in water surface slope with increasing vegetation coverage would not likely overtop the vegetation or the banks the present model did not address how the initial colonization of patches occurred but simply assumed an initial random or aligned distribution of patches previous studies have similarly assumed a random distribution for the initial state of the model kondziolka and nepf 2014 crouzy et al 2016 verschoren 2017 the initial colonization of real plants results from interactions between biological and physical processes including seed dispersal germination establishment burial and physical transport in the field different degrees of randomness in the distribution of new vegetation have been observed for example barrat segretain and amoros 1996 observed three different patterns of patch colonization in the first pattern potamogeton pusillus randomly colonized bare areas that were not necessarily in contact with existing patches in the second pattern groenlandia densa luronium natans and potamogeton natans established in bare areas through propagation from adjacent vegetation a process known as a border effect finally an intermediate colonization pattern between the random dispersion and the border effect was observed for callitriche platycarpa elodea canadensis hippuris vulgaris ranunculus circinatus and sparganium emersum for non vegetated channels in which the initial seeds were dispersed by the flow the deposition and growth of those seeds occurred more frequently in areas of lower elevation of the river van dijk et al 2013 these field observations indicate that different degrees of randomness are present in real systems further the modeling results presented in this study indicated that the initial distribution was not a key factor in determining the final vegetation coverage and specifically that bf was essentially constant to within 10 across ten different initial random distributions and even including an aligned distribution but for the same bo and lv the morphodynamic evolution of the channel was not included in the simulations which limits the present model in terms of the interactions between the channel and the vegetation instead of including sediment in the simulations we linked deposition and subsequent vegetation growth to threshold values of velocity as described in section 2 this approach implies that the vegetated regions of the channel contain more fine sediments than the unvegetated regions consistent with observations that vegetation selectively traps fine sediment e g sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2005 licci et al 2019 the spatial distribution of new growth which the model assumed was driven by new deposition was consistent with other recent studies for example lera et al 2019 numerically studied the effects of submersed aquatic vegetation on the morphodynamic evolution of a river mouth bar the direction of bar progradation was reversed from downstream without vegetation to upstream with vegetation specifically the additional resistance provided by the vegetation caused greater flow deflection upstream of the bar which decreased the bed shear stress and velocity upstream of the bar which in turn promoted sediment deposition on the upstream side of the bar such that the bar progradation was towards the river mouth a similar mechanism was observed in this study for scenarios simulated with lv 0 7 e g fig 6 scenario 2 in which the patch located farthest upstream grew towards the channel inlet i e grew upstream here a single plant density within the patch was considered however as reviewed in larsen 2019 section 3 2 the magnitude in flow divergence upstream of a patch increases with increasing patch size and plant density within the patch such that the potential region of upstream patch growth depends on these patch characteristics further even for cases with enhanced deposition upstream of the patch erosion or diminished deposition can be observed within the leading edge of the patch and this is attributed to stem generated turbulence at the leading edge e g fig 6 zong and nepf 2010 a detailed review of the competing influences of flow divergence and turbulence generation on the morphological evolution near a patch of in stream vegetation is provided in larsen 2019 according to coulthard et al 2007 not considering the bed morphology may be acceptable if the channel form does not change significantly or if the study comprises short periods of time for instance in two straight river reaches in the uk the accumulation of fine sediments was enhanced at vegetated locations but not to the degree of causing significant changes in bed morphology cotton et al 2006 heppell et al 2009 schnauder and sukhodolov 2012 also observed a stable bed morphology in a vegetated lowland river in germany over a 10 month period they observed changes in the distribution of fine organic matter but not in bed elevation similarly sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2005 observed changes in the deposition patterns with the presence of vegetation but not a change in bed morphology sufficient to impact the flow patterns therefore in many cases in the field the alteration to the flow field is dominated by the change in vegetation not in the change in bed morphology and it is these conditions that our method and 2 d model represent to help illustrate the point that small changes in bed elevation do not significantly influence the flow and vegetation pattern we compared the dynamic significance of flow depth alteration to the presence of vegetation specifically the contribution of vegetation drag can be represented by the term μu α see eq 11 and the contribution from bed drag can be represented by ρcfu2 h where cf is the bed drag coefficient and h is the water depth as already mentioned for emergent vegetation in a river the water depth is typically between 50 and 100 cm schoelynck et al 2012 green 2005 cameron et al 2013 naden et al 2006 the bed friction coefficient cf in rivers is typically between 0 01 and 0 06 luhar et al 2008 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2010 green 2006 reported velocities between 6 6 and 17 2 cm s in english streams populated with emergent vegetation for ρ 1000 kg m3 μ 10 3 kg ms α 1 700 000 m2 cf 0 01 u 0 1 m s and h 1 0 m typical field values and similar to our study the contribution from vegetation drag 70 kg m2 s2 is much larger than the bed drag 0 1 kg m2 s2 this means that the addition of vegetation produces a much more significant change in local drag and velocity distribution than a change in depth in fact kondziolka and nepf 2014 showed that the flow resistance feedback typically associated with bathymetry can also be generated by differences in vegetation bare versus vegetated however it is worth noting that other studies have documented important morphodynamic feedbacks associated with vegetation for example feedbacks between vegetation and morphological change were shown to contribute to the formation of alternating bars barenbold et al 2016 bertagni et al 2018 and multiple channels perona et al 2014 the growth pattern that emerged from the model fig 8 was similar to that observed for growth of aquatic vegetation in lakes wilson et al 2005 luo et al 2016 and rivers crouzy et al 2016 verschoren 2017 for example between march and october of 2007 jeffres et al 2008 measured macrophyte distribution at thirteen sites in the shasta river california usa averaged across all transects the blockage factor ranged from 26 in march to 70 in september october the measured growth pattern of the vegetation in the shasta river fig 11 was similar to the growth that emerged in the numerical simulations i e the rate of growth slope of b versus time was greatest in the initial months march to may after may the rate of expansion slowed and eventually b became constant our modeling provides a physical explanation for this growth pattern as described in detail in the context of figs 7 and 8 and table 2 above eq 12 was fit to the data from the shasta river fig 11 yielding a growth rate of r 0 69 month 1 we can connect this result to our simulations we define the total growth period as the time for the blockage factor to go from b 0 to 0 99bf in eq 12 for the shasta river the total growth period is 6 months none of the numerical scenarios achieved bf 70 as in the shasta data however using a linear fit in fig 9 bf 53 24lv 17 59 r 1 06lv 0 19 we predict r 0 85 step 1 for bf 70 for the scenario in fig 9 the evolution from b 0 26 to bf 70 will then occur in 4 9 model steps this implies that for the conditions in the shasta river each model step would correspond to 1 2 month the simulations only represented the evolution of vegetation during growth it did not represent the decay of vegetation later in the season which would result in a decline in blockage factor this later phase of the vegetation cycle is also important to the sediment cycle for instance kleeberg et al 2010 observed that the sediment retained within vegetation patches was finer and looser than the surrounding bare bed so that after decay these sediments were the first to be eroded and carried away downstream in this stream the deposition signature created by the vegetation deposition feedback active in the growing season may be completely erased during senescence on the other hand cotton et al 2006 observed that patches of ranunculus did not completely decay in a headwater reach even during the winter months in this scenario the vegetation deposition growth feedback modeled by the simulation can be maintained from year to year finally the present model assumed that the flow was two dimensional which is a good assumption for emergent vegetation but when vegetation is submerged the regions of enhanced deposition may shift for emergent conditions the distance over which deposition is enhanced le scales with the patch width bp liu et al 2018 however for submerged vegetation with height h less than the water depth the flow structure cannot be considered two dimensional for wide submerged patches h bp a recirculating eddy forms in the streamwise vertical plane establishing the wake length within which the velocity is reduced and deposition is increased liu et al 2018 hu et al 2018 in this case the length of the deposition region is controlled by the patch height liu et al 2018 for river vegetation bp is typically greater than h liu et al 2018 such that a longer deposition region is generated for emergent vegetation this pattern was observed in a study of reed canarygrass specifically elliot et al 2018 observed that with greater flow depth greater submergence the region of deposition and the positive feedbacks for longitudinal expansion of patches decreased these studies suggest that the modeling results produced by the 2 d modeling which assumed emergent vegetation would likely overpredict the rate and degree of patch expansion for submerged vegetation 5 conclusion this study simulated the evolution of emergent vegetation patches in a channel using a cfd simulation of the flow field coupled with a growth model based on a critical velocity we considered how growth rate and final vegetation coverage were impacted by the initial vegetation coverage described by the blockage factor b 0 0 3 and 3 and by the critical velocity below which vegetation growth was assumed to be possible called the limiting velocity lv 0 5 and 0 7 in all cases when reaching the final blockage factor bf the vegetation was distributed in elongated patches the value of the final vegetation coverage bf was not dependendent on either the initial coverage b 0 or on the specific distribution of vegetation random or aligned but depended only on the critical velocity for vegetation growth lv specifically bf increased with increasing lv 0 5 0 9 from 43 to 64 fig 8 positive feedbacks such as the merging of adjacent patches impacted the initial growth rate but not the final vegetation coverage specifically scenarios with b 0 3 promoted early patch interaction allowing small islands to quickly merge into corridors of vegetation the patches in scenarios

633,usually the rapid geometric transitions that are of negligible length with respect to the channel are treated in one dimensional saint venant models as internal boundary conditions assuming that an instantaneous equilibrium is attained between the flow characteristics through the structure and the flow characteristics in the channel in the present paper a different point of view is assumed by considering rapid transients at channel constrictions and obstructions that are caused by the lack of instantaneous equilibrium between the flow conditions immediately upstream and downstream of the structure these transients are modelled as a riemann problem assuming that the flow through the geometric transition is described by a stationary weak solution of the saint venant equations without friction for this case it is demonstrated that the solution of the riemann problem exists and it is unique for a wide class of initial flow conditions including supercritical flows the solutions of the riemann problem supplied by the one dimensional mathematical model compare well with the results of a two dimensional shallow water equations numerical model when the head loss through the structure is negligible the inspection of the exact solutions structure shows that the flow conditions immediately to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity may be very different from the initial conditions and this contributes to explain the numerical issues that are reported in the literature for the rapid transients at internal boundary conditions in finite difference models the solution of the riemann problem has been coded and the corresponding exact fluxes have been used as numerical fluxes in a one dimensional finite volume scheme for the solution of the shallow water equations the results demonstrate that spurious oscillations and instability phenomena are completely eliminated ensuring the robustness of the approach in the case that the energy loss is not negligible the exact solutions capture the essential features of the two dimensional model numerical results ensuring that the mathematical procedure is generalizable to realistic conditions this generalization is presented in the final part of the paper keywords riemann problem bridge piles venturi flume slit check dams embankment porous shallow water equations 1 introduction practical computation of flood wave propagation in river channels and in canal networks requires the ability to cope with the interaction between the propagating wave and those structures where the channel is non prismatic and the assumption of gradually varied flow may be lost henderson 1966 this interaction may be characterised by rapid transients that are caused by manoeuvres cunge et al 1980 propagation of tidal bores chanson 2011 and dam break flows soares frazão and zech 2007 among the others attention is focused here on those structures called constrictions and obstructions which are characterised by rapid non monotonic width variations fig 1 in detail the constrictions are channel reaches where the section is rapidly contracted by reducing the distance between the sidewalls while a similar cross section reduction is generated in the obstructions by the presence of obstacles that leave at least two openings chow 1959 example of constrictions are the reduction of river cross section caused by the presence of embankments slit check dams with a single opening and measuring devices such as the venturi and the cutthroat flumes on the other hand bridge piles the piers sustaining the gates of run of river hydropower plants and slit check dams with multiple openings are example of obstructions in most cases rapid geometric transitions are short with respect to the length of the channel and the volume of water stored between the entrance and the exit is negligible at the channel scale for this reason the geometric transitions are usually treated in one dimensional saint venant models as internal boundary conditions where a static algebraic relation connects the instantaneous characteristics of the flow immediately upstream and downstream of the structure sobey 2001 litrico and fromion 2009 this static relation is usually derived from field or laboratory experiments or it is approximated by applying hydraulic principles such as bernoulli s theorem the direct use of static formulas connecting the flow characteristics at the two sides of the geometric transition may be problematic in numerical computations during transients sobey 2001 briefly discussed the spurious wiggles generated in one dimensional models by rapid changes of the flow in the vicinity of structures while the reference manual of the commercial software mike11 dhi 2017 reports numerical instabilities at bridges when high water level gradients are present finally there are cases where a sudden passage between different types of flow regimes for example from free to submerged flow happens during the calculations in order to avoid convergence problems the use of coefficients cunge et al 1980 dhi 2017 that smoothen this sudden passage is suggested but the modification of the hydraulic formulas is somehow arbitrary and subjective from this brief examination of the literature it is evident that there is a need to investigate how internal boundary conditions should be formulated in order to avoid issues such as numerical oscillations and lack of convergence in line of principle two dimensional shallow water models are able to cope with obstructions and contractions if the computational mesh is refined in the vicinities of the geometric transition but this can lead to an increase of computational burden ratia et al 2014 for this reason structures like bridges are frequently treated in two dimensional models as internal boundary conditions where an appropriate static relation connects the flow characteristics at the two sides of the structure zhao et al 1994 following this line of reasoning ratia et al 2014 introduced the bridges in a two dimensional finite volume model in the form of a borda carnot head loss term the corresponding additional friction term was numerically incorporated into the approximate solution of a riemann problem at the interface between two cells the procedure worked well if subcritical flow conditions were established upstream and downstream of the geometric transition while less satisfactory results were obtained in the case of supercritical flow downstream this observation explains why the numerical model failed to reproduce the flow depths that were measured immediately downstream of small scale laboratory bridges during dam break experiments in addition no guarantee was given in ratia et al 2014 about the existence of solutions and no comparison was made with exact solutions despite the fact that the shallow water and the saint venant equations are differential equations written under the assumption of gradually varied flow they admit discontinuous flow field solutions corresponding to moving shocks that connect the gradually varied parts of the flow field cunge et al 1980 leveque 2004 it is well known that a thorough study of the transients where these flow discontinuities are present can be accomplished in the context of the so called rieman problem i e the initial value problem where the initial conditions are discontinuous toro 2001 leveque 2004 inspired by this many researchers have treated rapid geometric transitions as a special class of standing discontinuities connecting the flow fields upstream and downstream and studying the corresponding transients in the context of a special riemann problem this approach has been successfully used in the literature for a variety of structures such as bed steps contractions and expansions broad crested weirs sluice gates alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 ostapenko and malysheva 2006 lefloch and thanh 2011 guerra et al 2011 ostapenko 2012 han and warnecke 2014 cozzolino et al 2014a 2015 2018 among the others the riemann problem at obstructions and constrictions was considered in cozzolino et al 2017 limiting to the case of null initial velocity dam break problem having assumed that the flow through the geometric transition can be represented by an admissible steady weak solution of the one dimensional flow equations cozzolino et al 2017 demonstrated that the solution of the dam break problem always exists and it is unique the exact solutions of the one dimensional mathematical model were compared with the laboratory results of dam break at constrictions by townson and al salihi 1989 showing the feasibility of the method in the present paper the restrictions about the initial velocity contained in cozzolino et al 2017 are removed by considering the solution of the riemann problem in rectangular channels with constrictions and obstructions for a wide class of initial flow conditions including supercritical flow this approach allows verifying under which assumptions the solution exists and it is unique when a transient starts from initial conditions that are far from equilibrium in the following sections the mathematical model is presented showing that the assumptions made for the flow through the geometric transition allows a variety of flow conditions with free partially submerged or submerged flow in addition the existence and the uniqueness of the corresponding solutions is demonstrated for a range of initial conditions that will be specified when the methodology is described supplying a solid ground to the application of the model interestingly the exact solutions presented in this paper are relevant for the porous shallow water equations because this model is formally identical to the one dimensional shallow water equations in variable width rectangular channels guinot and soares frazão 2006 cozzolino et al 2018 the exact results of the one dimensional mathematical model are finally compared with the numerical results of a two dimensional numerical model discussing the main differences despite the fact that the assumption of energy conservation is widely used in the literature bos 1989 sturm 2001 chaudhry 2008 the scheme presents clear limitations in the case that energy losses are not negligible for this reason the modifications required for the application in real world problems are discussed together with an analysis of the numerical issues commonly encountered in the simulation of strong transients at river structures the exact solution of the riemann problem has been coded and the corresponding exact fluxes have been used as numerical fluxes in a one dimensional finite volume scheme for the solution of the shallow water equations the results demonstrate that spurious oscillations and instability phenomena are completely eliminated ensuring the robustness of the approach finally the paper is closed by a conclusions section 2 exact solution of the riemann problem in the present section the general structure of the riemann problem at constrictions and obstructions is presented and the standing wave corresponding to the geometric discontinuity is defined finally the l m and r m curves are introduced and the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the general riemann problem is discussed 2 1 position of the problem under the assumption of rectangular cross section and negligible friction the one dimensional saint venant model can be written as 1 b h t b h u x 0 b h u t x g 2 b h 2 b h u 2 g 2 h 2 b x 0 the meaning of the symbols is as follows x is the longitudinal coordinate t is the time variable b b x is the local channel width h h x t is the flow depth u u x t is the cross section averaged velocity g 9 81 m s2 is the gravitational acceleration in the present paper the eq 1 is solved considering the following discontinuous flow initial data 2 u x 0 u l x 0 u r x 0 complemented by the discontinuous geometric data 3 b x b l x 0 b r x 0 in eq 2 u h hu t is the vector of the conserved variables for the channel of unitary width t is the matrix transpose symbol while u l hl hlul t and u r hr hrur t represent the initial flow conditions to the left and to the right of the initial discontinuity respectively the eq 3 specifies that the left reach of the channel x 0 has uniform width b l while the right reach x 0 has uniform width b r in the present model the obstructions fig 1a and the constrictions fig 1b are modelled by means of a single rapid smooth contraction from the width b 0 bl to the minimum width b b 0 followed by a single rapid smooth expansion from b b 0 to b 0 br for simplicity in the following it is assumed that bl br b and that the characteristics of the geometric transition can be concisely described by the aspect ratio b 0 b with 0 b 0 b 1 despite of this limitation the procedure of the present paper can be mutatis mutandis extended to general cases with bl br it is evident that the relationship between the flow variables at the inlet and at the outlet of the standing discontinuity depends on the inner description of the discontinuity following cozzolino et al 2017 the steady flow solutions of eq 1 are used to describe the flow through the standing discontinuity 2 2 structure of the riemann solution and moving waves the solution u x t of the riemann problem of eqs 1 3 is self similar cozzolino et al 2017 2018 and its structure consists of constant states which are conventionally ordered from left state u l to right state u r all these states are connected by classic moving elementary waves shocks or rarefactions and by an additional standing wave that is induced by the fixed geometric discontinuity in x 0 in the present paper the symbols u 1 u 0 t h 1 h 1 u 1 t and u 2 u 0 t h 2 h 2 u 2 t are used to indicate the constant states immediately to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity and connected by the standing wave relationship in order to elucidate the nature of the shocks and rarefactions for the system of eq 1 we observe that the eq 3 states that the channel width is uniform for x 0 and x 0 in these regions the eq 1 reduces to 4 u t f u x 0 where f hu hu 2 gh 2 2 t is the flux vector for the channel of unitary width the classic one dimensional shallow water equations of eq 4 are a strictly hyperbolic system of differential equations characterized by two characteristic fields leveque 2004 which are genuinely nonlinear and may contain moving waves such as shocks or rarefactions it follows that elementary waves developing to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity in the riemann problem of eqs 1 3 coincide with the elementary 1 and 2 waves of the classic one dimensional shallow water equations of eq 4 in the h u plane the symbols si u ref and s i b u r e f are used to denote the loci of the states u connected to the reference state u ref by a direct or a backward shock lefloch and thanh 2007 respectively that are contained into the ith characteristic field with i 1 2 of the system of eq 4 similarly the symbols ri u ref and r i b u r e f are used to denote the loci of the states u connected to the reference state u ref by a direct or a backward rarefaction lefloch and thanh 2007 respectively that are contained into the ith characteristic field with i 1 2 of the classic one dimensional shallow water equations the direct i wave curve ti u ref ri u ref si u ref is defined as the union of the direct i rarefaction and i shock curves with i 1 2 similarly the backward i wave curve t i b u r e f r i b u r e f s i b u r e f is defined as the union of the backward i rarefaction and i shock curves with i 1 2 it is immediate to show lefloch and than 2007 that the 1 wave curves are strictly decreasing and convex while the 2 wave curves are strictly increasing and concave the supremum i of t 1 u ref coincides with the intersection between the curve r 1 u ref and the axis h 0 and it is characterized by null flow depth hi 0 and velocity u i u r e f 2 g h r e f correspondingly the infimum j of t 2 b u r e f coincides with the intersection between the curve r 2 b u r e f and the axis h 0 and it is characterized by null flow depth hj 0 and velocity u j u r e f 2 g h r e f in addition to these waves it is useful considering the curve cd u ref of the states u that have the same discharge per unit width of the state u ref in the plane h u this curve is convex and strictly decreasing when the flow is directed from left to right while it is concave and strictly increasing when the flow is directed from right to left 2 3 the standing wave description admissible steady weak solutions of eq 1 are used for the definition of the standing wave cozzolino et al 2017 and this means that the discharge is invariant through the geometric discontinuity it follows that the equality h 1 u 1 h 2 u 2 is valid under the assumption bl br and that u 2 is a state on the curve cd u 1 while u 1 is a state on the curve cd u 2 in addition to this the steady weak solutions of eq 1 prescribe that the energy is conserved through the geometric discontinuity if the flow is smooth unless a hydraulic jump is present into the diverging part of the geometric transition a necessary condition for the establishing of smooth flow through the geometric discontinuities such as constrictions or obstructions is yarnell 1934 5 b 0 b f 3 2 3 2 1 f 2 2 3 2 where 0 b 0 b 1 while f u g h is the froude number of the flow u entering the geometric transition for given value of the aspect ratio b 0 b the eq 5 is satisfied by the values f 0 k s b b 0 b k s p b 0 b where the limit froude numbers 0 ksb b 0 b 1 and ksp b 0 b 1 are defined in the appendix a the values f k s b b 0 b and f k s p b 0 b satisfy the eq 5 with the equality sign in this case critical conditions are attained at the minimum width b b 0 of the geometric transition in addition to the limit froude numbers ksb b 0 b and ksp b 0 b let k s p b 0 b be the value of the subcritical froude number that is conjugate to the supercritical froude number ksp b 0 b by means of the hydraulic jump see the appendix for the corresponding mathematical expression in the following the superscript will be used to indicate the hydraulic jump projection operator i e the operator that supplies the subcritical flow state u r e f that is conjugated by the hydraulic jump to the supercritical flow reference state u ref in the h u plane the symbols c s b b 0 b c s p b 0 b and c s p b 0 b are used to denote the loci of the states u with u 0 characterized by f k s b b 0 b f k s p b 0 b and f k s p b 0 b respectively similarly the symbols c s b b 0 b c s p b 0 b and c s p b 0 b are used to denote the loci of the states u with u 0 characterized by f k s b b 0 b f k s p b 0 b and f k s p b 0 b respectively the mathematical expressions of these curves are contained in the appendix a three flow configurations through the geometric transition namely swa swb and swc are considered swa the flow which is submerged is smooth and subcritical through the standing discontinuity in this case u 1 u 2 and f 1 f 2 with f 1 ksb b 0 b where f 1 is the froude number corresponding to the state u 1 while f 2 corresponds to the state u 2 swb the flow which is chocked smoothly passes from subcritical to supercritical through the discontinuity and it is then reverted into subcritical flow by a hydraulic jump that is located in the expansion reach if u 1 0 and u 2 0 the subcritical state u 1 is characterized by f 1 k s b b 0 b and the subcritical state u 2 is characterized by f 2 k s b b 0 b k s p b 0 b if u 1 0 and u 2 0 the subcritical state u 1 is characterized by f 1 k s p b 0 b k s b b 0 b and the subcritical state u 2 is characterized by f 2 k s b b 0 b swc the flow which is chocked smoothly passes from subcritical to supercritical through the discontinuity if u 1 0 and u 2 0 the subcritical state u 1 and the supercritical state u 2 are characterized by f 1 k s b b 0 b and f 2 k s p b 0 b respectively if u 1 0 and u 2 0 the supercritical state u 1 and the subcritical state u 2 are characterized by f 1 k s p b 0 b and f 2 k s b b 0 b respectively in the following the family of standing waves swa swb and swc is collectively designated with the symbol sw these flow configurations cover the entire range of possible flow profiles through the standing discontinuity when the conditions 6 f l k s p b 0 b f r k s p b 0 b are satisfied in eq 6 the symbol fl is used to indicate the froude number f l u l g h l of the state u l while f r u r g h r is the froude number of the state u r it is evident that the dam break problem fl fr 0 studied by cozzolino et al 2017 is only a particular case of the general riemann problem described here 2 4 structure of the admissible wave configurations following the procedure contained in alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 and han and warnecke 2014 all the possible solution wave configurations for the riemann problem of eqs 1 3 can be enumerated if the study is limited to the initial states u l and u r that satisfy the eq 6 only four main classes of solution wave configurations sc3 sc4 sc3 sc4 are possible which are described as follows sc3 in this class of wave solution configurations wave configuration sketch in row 1 of table 1 there are four states u l u 1 u 2 and u r from left to right which are connected by three waves t 1 swa or swb and t 2 respectively the flow through the geometric transition is directed from left to right with subcritical states u 1 and u 2 the indications t 1 and t 2 are generic and the actual waves may be either shocks or rarefactions sc4 in the second class of wave solution configurations wave configuration sketch in row 2 of table 1 there are five states u l u 1 u 2 u mid and u r from left to right which are connected by four waves t 1 swc t 1 and t 2 respectively the flow through the geometric transition is directed from left to right with subcritical u 1 and supercritical u 2 sc3 in this class of solution configurations wave configurations sketch in row 3 of table 1 the flow through the geometric transition is directed from right to left this case is obtained by mirroring the case sc3 sc4 in this case which is obtained by mirroring the case sc4 the flow through the geometric transition is directed from right to left wave configurations sketch in row 4 of table 1 2 5 the l m and r m curves the classic riemann problem is easily solved by intersecting the curves t 1 u l and t 2 b u r that are associated to the states u l and u r respectively alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 toro 2001 leveque 2004 using a procedure inspired by the available literature marchesin and paes leme 1986 lefloch and than 2011 han and warnecke 2014 in the present sub section the curves t 1 u l and t 2 b u r are generalized by constructing two new curves of the h u plane namely the loci l m and r m which are associated to the states u l and u r respectively the inspection of the table 1 rows 1 4 suggests the following definition for the l m curve if the flow through the geometric discontinuity is not directed from right to left u 1 0 and u 2 0 the curve l m consists of the states u with u 0 that are connected to u l from the right by an admissible sequence of waves including sw and that can be connected to u r from the left by a moving wave contained in the second characteristic field if the flow through the geometric discontinuity is directed from right to left u 1 0 and u 2 0 the curve l m consists of the states u with u 0 that are connected to u l from the right by a moving wave contained in the first characteristic field the curve r m is defined by a symmetric construction if the flow through the geometric discontinuity is not directed from right to left u 1 0 and u 2 0 the curve r m consists of the states u with u 0 that are connected to u r from the left by a moving wave contained in the second characteristic field if the flow through the geometric discontinuity is directed from right to left u 1 0 and u 2 0 the curve r m consists of the states u with u 0 that are connected to u r from the left by an admissible sequence of waves including sw and that can be connected to u l from the right by a moving wave contained in the first characteristic field from the definitions it is evident that the loci l m and r m consist of the admissible states u 2 in the class of wave configurations sc3 of the admissible states u mid in the class sc4 and sc4 and of the admissible states u 1 for sc3 2 5 1 construction and interpretation of the l m curves two types of l m curves are considered namely the curves il and iil as follows curve il when fl 2 the l m curve simply coincides with the locus t 1 u l which in this case lies entirely under the axis u 0 of the h u plane an example is represented in fig 2 a for the initial left states of table 2 row 1 the supremum i of the curve il has velocity u i u l 2 g h l 0 and null flow depth hi curve iil when f l 2 k s p b 0 b it is possible to consider the special states u 1 l h 1 l h 1 l u 1 l t u 2 l h 2 l h 2 l u 2 l t u 2 l h 2 l h 2 l u 2 l t and u 0 l h 0 l 0 t which appear in the construction of the riemann problem solution the state u 1 l is defined as the intersection between the curves t 1 u l and c s b b 0 b while the states u 2 l and u 2 l are those states different from u 1 l at the intersection between the curve cd u 1 l and the curves c s p b 0 b and c s p b 0 b respectively finally the state u 0 l h 0 l 0 t is found at the intersection between the curve t 1 u l and the h axis recalling the properties of the hydraulic jump the state u 2 l coincides also with the intersection between the curves s 1 u 2 l and cd u 1 l the curve iil is defined as the union of the following loci the curve r 1 u 2 l the reach of the curve s 1 u 2 l between the states u 2 l and u 2 l the reach of curve cd u 1 l between the states u 2 l and u 1 l the curve t 1 u l below the state u 1 l the supremum i of the curve iil is characterized by null flow depth hi 0 and velocity u i u 2 l 2 g h 2 l 0 the states u between i and u 2 l characterize free flow conditions through the structure u 1 0 and u 2 0 the states between u 2 l and u 1 l characterize partially submerged flow conditions while the states between u 1 l and u 0 l correspond to submerged flow conditions two example curves iil are represented in fig 2b and c for the initial left states of table 2 rows 2 and 3 and b 0 b 0 6 respectively in the first of these examples fig 2b the state u l is such that fl ksb b 0 b and this implies that u l lies on the curve l m for this reason the reach of t 1 u l between the states u l and u 1 l coincides with the portion of r 1 u l between the same states while the reach of t 1 u l below the state u l coincides with s 1 u l in the second example fig 3 c the condition fl ksb b 0 b ksp b 0 b implies that u l does not lie on the curve l m in this case the reach of t 1 u l below the state u 1 l reduces to the corresponding reach of s 1 u l 2 5 2 construction and interpretation of the r m curves due to the symmetry of the geometric transition the curves l r ir and iir can be constructed by mirroring the curves il and iil with respect to the axis u 0 curve i r when fr 2 the r m curve coincides with the locus t 2 b u r the infimum j of the curve ir has velocity u j u r 2 g h r 0 and null flow depth hj curve ii r when f r k s p b 0 b 2 it is possible to define the special states u 1 r h 1 r h 1 r u 1 r t u 2 r h 2 r h 2 r u 2 r t u 1 r h 1 r h 1 r u 1 r t and u 0 r h 0 r 0 t in particular u 2 r is defined as the subcritical state at the intersection between the curves t 2 b u r and c s b b 0 b while u 1 r and u 1 r are the states at the intersection between the curve cd u 2 r and the curves c s p b 0 b and c s p b 0 b respectively for h h 2 r finally the state u 0 r h 0 r 0 t is found at the intersection between the curve t 2 b u r and the h axis in this case the curve iir is defined as the union of the following loci the curve r 2 b u 1 r the reach of the curve s 2 b u 1 r between the states u 1 r and u 1 r the reach of curve cd u 2 r between the states u 1 r and u 2 r the curve t 2 b u 1 r above the state u 1 r the infimum j of the curve iir is characterized by null flow depth hj 0 and velocity u j u 1 r 2 g h 1 r 0 2 6 construction the riemann problem solutions the exact solution of the riemann problem at obstructions and constrictions can be constructed by drawing the l m and r m curves corresponding to the states u l and u r respectively and finding their intersection u m the solution configuration and the constant states of the riemann solution are immediately deduced considering the wave configuration from u l to u m on the curve l m and from u m to u r on the curve r m the definitions adopted for the curves l m and r m ensure that there is exactly one standing wave or none in the sequence of waves from the state u l to the state u r as required by the structure of the exact solutions in the present sub section the solution construction and its interpretation are elucidated by means of four examples all these examples are characterized by aspect ratio b 0 b 0 6 with ksb 0 6 0 36 k s p 0 6 0 49 and ksp 0 6 2 32 it is clear that for these example the ranges fl 2 32 and fr 2 32 cover the totality of the subcritical flow conditions and a major portion of the supercritical flows that are relevant for the practical applications example 1 riemann problem in the first example fig 3a the graphical construction of the riemann problem with initial conditions of table 2 row 1 is shown the l m curve corresponding to the left initial state u l characterized by froude number fl 2 86 is of type il because fl 2 while the r m curve corresponding to the right initial state u r with fr 0 18 is of type iir because f r k s p b 0 b 2 2 32 2 from fig 3a it is clear that the intersection u m lies on the reach r 1 u l of the l m curve and on the reach r 2 b u 1 r of the r m curve following the waves from u l to the state u r it can be deduced that the flow through the standing wave is directed from right to left because the state u m lies below the axis u 0 the state u l is connected to the state u m by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field the state u 1 u 1 r is connected to the state u m by a rarefaction contained into the second characteristic field the state u r is connected to the state u 2 u 2 r by means of a rarefaction contained into the second characteristic field the solution configuration is of type sc4 with standing wave sw swc and u mid u m the wave configuration sketch corresponding to this example is detailed in the row 1 of table 3 the exact solution flow depth is represented at time t 5 s in fig 4 a example 2 riemann problem the initial conditions of table 2 row 2 are used in the second example riemann problem fig 3b the l m curve fl 0 16 is of type iil because f l 2 k s p b 0 b 2 2 32 while the r m curve coincides with that of example 1 the intersection u m lies on the reach r 1 u l of the l m curve and on the reach s 2 b u r of the r m curve and this implies that the flow through the standing wave is directed from left to right because the state u m lies above the axis u 0 the states u 1 and u 2 coincide with the state u m the state u l is connected to the state u 1 by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field the state u r is connected to the state u 2 by a shock contained into the second characteristic field the solution configuration is of type sc3 with standing wave sw swa the corresponding wave configuration sketch is detailed in the row 2 of table 3 while the exact solution flow depth is plotted at time t 5 s in fig 4b example 3 riemann problem this example corresponds to the initial conditions of table 2 row 3 where the l m curve is of type iil fl 1 07 and the r m curve coincides with those of examples 1 and 2 the intersection u m lies on the reach cd u l 1 of the l m curve and on the reach s 2 b u r of the r m curve fig 3c and this allows deducing what follows the flow through the standing wave is directed from left to right because the state u m lies above the axis u 0 the states immediately to the left and to the right of the standing discontinuity are such that u 1 u 1 l and u 2 u m the state u l is connected to the state u 1 by a shock contained into the first characteristic field the state u r is connected to the state u 2 by a shock contained into the second characteristic field the solution configuration is of type sc3 with standing wave sw swb the wave configuration sketch is represented in row 3 of table 3 and the exact solution flow depth is plotted at time t 5 s in fig 4c example 4 riemann problem in this case initial conditions in table 2 row 4 the l m curve coincides with that of example 2 while the r m curve is of type iir fr 0 16 the intersection u m lies on the reach s 1 u 1 l of the l m curve and on the reach s 2 b u r of the r m curve and this allows deducing what follows the flow through the standing wave is directed from left to right because the state u m lies above the axis u 0 the state u l is connected to the state u 1 u 1 l by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field the state u 2 u 2 l is connected to the state u m by a shock contained into the first characteristic field the state u r is connected to the state u m by a shock contained into the second characteristic field the solution configuration is of type sc4 with standing wave sw swc and u mid u m the corresponding wave configuration sketch is detailed in the row 4 of table 3 while the exact solution flow depth is represented at time t 5 s in fig 4d 2 7 global characteristics of the solutions from fig 2 it is clear that it is possible to parameterize the l m curve with respect to h in the form u flm h for h 0 where the function u flm h is continuous and strictly decreasing in a similar manner it is possible to parameterize the r m curve with respect to h in the form u frm h for h 0 where u frm h is continuous and strictly increasing the monotonicity properties of the curves l m and r m ensure that their intersection u m exists and it is unique for the case ui uj where the bed is wet everywhere in turn this implies that the solution of the riemann problem exists and it is unique when ui uj when ui uj a cavitation is formed despite of the fact that there is no intersection between the curves l m and r m the solution exists and it is unique also in this case because the structure of the waves that connect the states u l and u r to i and j respectively is individuated in an unambiguous manner in the case ui 0 corresponding to fl 2 see fig 2a the state u l is directly connected to the state i by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field in the case ui 0 corresponding to f l 2 k s p b 0 b see fig 2b and c the state u l is connected to u 1 u 1 l by a wave contained into the first characteristic field the state u 1 is connected to the state u 2 u 2 l by the standing wave swc and the state u 2 is connected to the dry bed state i by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field mutatis mutandis a similar discussion on the velocity uj is valid for the waves that connect the state u r to the dry bed state j in conclusion it is evident that the solution of the riemann problem where f l k s p b 0 b and f r k s p b 0 b always exists and it is unique what was to be demonstrated 2 8 iterative solution of the riemann problem the graphical procedure for the solution of the riemann problem at constrictions and obstructions can be tackled numerically when ui uj because the state u m can be calculated by finding the unique solution hm of the equation g h flm h frm h 0 and letting um frm hm the function g h is piecewise smooth and the classic bisection algorithm can be used for root finding press et al 1992 note that the position of the intersection u m on the curves l m and r m also determines the structure of the solution sc4 sc3 sc3 or sc4 and this immediately supplies the states u 1 and u 2 to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity the solution is trivially direct when ui uj because there is no need of an iterative approach the case 0 ui uj supplies u 1 u 1 l and u 2 u 2 l while the case ui uj 0 supplies u 1 u 1 r and u 2 u 2 r finally the case ui 0 uj supplies u 1 0 and u 2 0 where 0 is the null vector 3 numeric applications the results of the one dimensional mathematical model are compared with those supplied by a numerical model for the solution of the two dimensional shallow water equations this comparison allows discussing the limits of the one dimensional mathematical model which is a rough representation of the flow through the geometric transition in addition the iterative procedure for the approximate solution of the riemann problem at the geometric discontinuity has been embedded into a one dimensional finite volume model for the solution of the shallow water equations showing the feasibility of the approach in practical calculations 3 1 two dimensional numerical model the two dimensional numerical model used here is a standard first order cell centred finite volume model on triangular grid godlewski and raviart 1996 that approximates the solution of the classic two dimensional shallow water equations 7 h t h u x h v y 0 h u t x g 2 h 2 h u 2 h u v y 0 h v t h u v x y g 2 h 2 h v 2 0 where the symbol v correspond to the velocity along the coordinate axis y first order accuracy in time is obtained by using an explicit euler scheme for advancing the solution the numerical fluxes are calculated with a simple hllc riemann solver eqs 10 21 and 10 28 in toro 2001 where the minimum and maximum wave speeds are approximated by means of the relations contained in cozzolino et al 2014b first order accuracy in space is obtained by using the cell averaged values of the conserved variables as arguments of the numerical fluxes the solid boundary conditions are introduced in a weak form by imposing that the variables at the external side of the boundary are mirrored with respect to the variables at the internal side similarly the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are imposed weakly by specifying the appropriate values of the conserved variables immediately outside of the physical domain boundary zhao et al 1994 and then calculating the corresponding fluxes by means of the approximate riemann solver 3 2 two dimensional solution of the riemann problem at the obstruction layout of fig 5a the one dimensional riemann problems of table 2 rows 1 4 are simulated by considering a channel aligned with the x axis and characterized by rectangular cross section length l 100 m and ordinary width b 1 m a symmetrical obstruction with length lc 1 80 m and minimum width b 0 0 60 is present at the middle of the channel where x 0 m see fig 5 a where a zoomed view of the obstruction layout is represented at time t 0 s the initial flow conditions are characterized by h hl and u ul for x 0 m while h hr and u ur for x 0 m with null initial transverse component of the velocity for t 0 s the lack of equilibrium at the flow discontinuity generates a transient that propagates from the middle of the channel and that is simulated with the numerical model for the numerical computations the physical domain is partitioned into 369 644 triangular cells with average side ls 0 025 m while the maximum time step δt 0 001 s is used in all the numerical tests in fig 6 the results of the two dimensional numerical model at time t 5 s are represented by projecting the free surface elevation onto the longitudinal vertical plane before commenting the tests it is important to recall that the geometric transition occupies an area of measure zero in the one dimensional mathematical model this implies that for given values of hl and hr the volume of water initially stored by the one dimensional mathematical model is slightly greater than that present in the two dimensional numerical model at the beginning of calculations the absolute value of this error which depends on the actual geometry of the transition increases with the length of the transition and decreases with the aspect ratio b 0 b on the other hand the ratio between the absolute volume error and the total volume initially stored in the physical domain decreases with the channel length enforcing the assumption of short geometric transition in all the cases it is expected that the results supplied by the one and two dimensional models are slightly different the exact solution supplied by the one dimensional model for the riemann problem of table 2 row 1 is plotted in fig 6a at time t 5 s together with the numerical results of the two dimensional model for the same initial conditions the inspection of the figure shows that the results of the one dimensional mathematical model compare satisfactorily with the two dimensional numerical results in particular the strength and the position of the rarefaction to the right of the initial discontinuity is in good agreement with that supplied by the two dimensional model nonetheless some features of the two dimensional solution that are not well captured by the simplified one dimensional model deserve additional comments a distinctive characteristic of the two dimensional solution when sw swc is the oscillatory behaviour of the free surface immediately to the left of the initial discontinuity cozzolino et al 2017 proved that these oscillations are not originated by numerical instabilities but consist of a shock wave reflection pattern that is originated by the supercritical flow at the exit of the expanding reach to the left of x 0 m flow from right to left in fig 6a this is confirmed by the inspection of fig 7 where the three dimensional inclined view of the free surface elevation in the vicinity of x 0 m exhibits a typical crossing waves regular pattern these waves which are discussed in classic hydraulic textbooks see for example chow 1959 are characterized by non uniform free surface elevation through the cross section and this implies that one dimensional models cannot reproduce them defina and viero 2010 finally the one dimensional exact solution does not capture the two undershoots exhibited by the two dimensional model results at the toe of the left rarefaction waves fig 6a it can be conjectured that these undershoots are originated by the initial deficit of volume contained into the expanding reach of the geometric transition this point will be further discussed in the remainder of the paper the results supplied by the one and two dimensional models for the riemann problem of table 2 row 2 are plotted in fig 6b at time t 5 s the one and two dimensional models compare satisfactorily also in this case but some difference is present in particular the one dimensional right shock wave is slightly faster than the two dimensional solution in addition the left rarefaction wave exhibits an overshoot that again can be attributed to the initial deficit of volume the two dimensional model reproduces the subcritical flow profile through the finite length geometric transition and this is well visible with dots at the centre of fig 6b while this flow profile collapses to a point in the one dimensional model the flow depths supplied to the left and to the right of x 0 m by the two dimensional numerical simulation of fig 6b almost coincide with the middle constant state supplied by the one dimensional model exact solution confirming that the assumption of moderate energy loss is viable in this case the results for the test of table 2 row 3 are reproduced in fig 6c for t 5 s this case is much interesting because it corresponds to the condition standing wave swb where a hydraulic jump is present through the geometric transition the inspection of the figure shows that the speed of the shocks supplied by the one dimensional flow are slightly slower than the speeds of the corresponding two dimensional shocks conversely the strengths of the two extreme shocks and of the standing wave are well captured by the one dimensional model implying that in this case the energy loss predicted by the one dimensional model is very close to that supplied by the two dimensional model the inspection of fig 8 a where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 6c are plotted in the vicinity of the geometric transition shows that there is no evidence of large eddies confirming that the energy loss exhibited by the two dimensional numerical model can be almost entirely attributed to the hydraulic jump predicted by the one dimensional exact solution as a final example the results of the test of table 2 row 4 are plotted in fig 6d for t 5 s the subcritical flow upstream of the geometric transition is reverted in supercritical flow through the transition also in this case and a train of oblique shock waves is formed in the diverging part of the structure to the right of x 0 m flow from left to right the presence of the shock contained into the first characteristic field cuts this train of waves which is only partly developed the inspection of the figure shows that the shock speeds are well captured while the flow depth of the intermediate state between the two shocks is slightly overestimated by the one dimensional model also in this case a small overshoot is present at the leading point of the left rarefaction wave 3 3 additional examples of riemann problem at obstructions and constrictions layout of figs 5b e the tests of the preceding sub section have been repeated for four additional geometries all characterized by aspect ratio b 0 b 0 6 which are represented in figs 5b e the corresponding results are briefly commented in the present sub section the results obtained for the layout of fig 5b 369 486 triangular cells in the finite volume model are represented in fig 9 and compared with the one dimensional exact solution the new layout corresponds again to an obstruction but the transition throat is longer than that of fig 5a while the area occupied by the obstruction is increased the inspection of fig 9 shows again that the agreement between the one dimensional exact solution and the two dimensional numerical results is good because the energy loss through the geometric transition is negligible in the two dimensional simulations the increased length of the transition throat leads to a straightening of the flow through the geometric transition and this is particularly evident in fig 9b where the free surface elevation through x 0 m becomes almost horizontal in addition the increased area occupied by the geometric transition causes an increased volume deficit and this reverberates on slightly more evident under and over shoots attached to the rarefaction waves figs 9a b d and on an slightly increased mismatch of the shock position in fig 8b and c the inspection of fig 8b where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 9c are plotted in the vicinity of the geometric transition shows again that there is no evidence of eddies confirming that the flow depth jump through x 0 m can be entirely attributed to the hydraulic jump predicted by the one dimensional exact solution the results for the obstruction of fig 5c 370 390 triangular cells where the convergent and the divergent reaches are absent are compared in fig 10 with the one dimensional exact solutions the area occupied by the geometric transition is very small and this leads to the disappearing of the over and under shoots at the rarefaction edges as confirmed by figs 10a b d interestingly the sharper layout of the obstruction leads to non negligible energy losses through it and this decreases the agreement between the two dimensional numerical results and the one dimensional exact solution this is particularly evident for the riemann problem of table 2 row 2 whose corresponding results are represented in fig 10b for this case the one dimensional exact solution predicts a middle constant state between the left rarefaction and the right shock while the two dimensional numerical model supplies two different states between the extreme waves these two middle states are in turn separated by a flow depth jump in x 0 m which clearly corresponds to an energy jump through the sharp obstruction a similar energy jump which causes a reduced agreement between the one dimensional exact solution and the two dimensional numerical results can be individuated in the figs 10a c d in all these cases the energy losses cause an increase of subcritical flow depth upstream of the obstruction and a decrease of the flow depth of the constant states downstream the inspection of fig 8c where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 10c are plotted shows the presence of lateral eddies together with a wake downstream of the central obstacle confirming the presence of energy dissipation that is not taken into account by the hydraulic jump mechanism the layout of fig 5d characterizes a constriction where the convergent and the divergent reaches are present the corresponding two dimensional numerical results obtained using 368 878 cells are compared in fig 11 with the one dimensional exact solution interestingly the presence of the long throat straightens up the flow through the geometrical transition but the absence of the central obstruction causes a more evident side contraction with the formation of lateral eddies that dissipate some energy see fig 8d where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 11c are plotted for this reason the results are somehow intermediate between those of the cases of fig 5b and c in particular the initial volume deficit causes the presence of the under and the over shoots at the edges of the rarefaction waves while the energy loss causes the increase of the subcritical flow depth upstream of the geometric transition the last example corresponds to the layout of fig 5e which represents a constriction without the convergent and divergent reaches the numerical results obtained with the two dimensional numerical model 370 256 cells are compared in fig 12 with the one dimensional exact results analogously to the sharp obstruction results of fig 10 the area occupied by the geometric transition is small and this reduces the initial volume deficit which in turn causes the disappearance of the under and over shoots at the edges of the rarefaction waves interestingly the constriction enhances the side contraction of the flow through the geometric transition and this leads to increased energy losses through x 0 m this is clearly seen from fig 12b where the flow depth jump is increased with respect to that of fig 10b finally the inspection of fig 8e where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 12c are plotted shows the presence of long lateral eddies confirming the existence of an energy dissipation mechanism that is additional to the hydraulic jump 3 4 one dimensional numerical model the solution of the one dimensional shallow water equations of eq 4 can be tackled by means of the one dimensional finite volume scheme following the approach of cozzolino et al 2015 the one dimensional domain of length l is discretized into nv non overlapping control volumes and eq 4 is integrated into each control volume obtaining the following set of algebraic equations 8 u i n 1 u i n δ t δ x f i 1 2 f i 1 2 where the symbols are defined as follows the index i refers to the generic finite volume c i δt is the time step δ x l n v is the length of the generic finite volume c i u i n h i n h i n u i n t is the vector of the conserved variables averaged over c i at the time level n f i 1 2 is the contribution to the cell c i of the interface i 1 2 between ci 1 and ci f i 1 2 is the contribution to the cell ci of the interface i 1 2 between ci and ci 1 the channel geometry is continuous at ordinary interfaces and the interface contributions are calculated as f i 1 2 f i 1 2 f u i n u i 1 n where f u i n u i 1 n is the numerical flux corresponding to the classic shallow water equations riemann problem with initial conditions u l u i n and u r u i 1 n the corresponding fluxes are estimated by means of the hll approximate riemann solver where the speeds are calculated using the relations in cozzolino et al 2014b the geometric discontinuity which is located at the interface g 1 2 between the cells c g and c g 1 is taken into account at the time level n by solving iteratively the corresponding riemann problem with initial conditions u l u i n and u r u i 1 n as discussed in sub section 2 8 once that the solution of the riemann problem is known the states u 1 and u 2 immediately to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity are available and the positions f g 1 2 f u 1 and f g 1 2 f u 2 are made 3 5 one dimensional numerical results the solution of the one dimensional riemann problems of table 2 rows 1 4 is approximated with the one dimensional model by considering a geometric discontinuity located at the centre x 0 m of a channel whose length is l 100 m and whose width is unitary in fig 13 the results of the numerical calculations dots are compared at time t 5 s with the corresponding exact solution thin continuous line for the case where nv 100 finite volumes and δt 0 05 s the inspection of the figure shows that the structure of the riemann solution number type and position of the waves is well reproduced in all the numerical examples in particular the standing wave is always nicely captured independent of its actual form swa in fig 13b swb in fig 13c swc in fig 13a d however the numerical diffusion smoothens the moving shocks and rarefaction waves on the coarse grid for this reason the computations are repeated considering nv 1000 finite volumes and δt 0 005 s and the corresponding numerical results are represented in fig 13 with a dashed line the inspection of the figure shows that the grid refinement reduces the numerical diffusion and makes the numerical solution converge towards the exact one the results presented here demonstrate the robustness and the applicability of the numerical procedure to general cases 4 discussion following cozzolino et al 2017 admissible steady weak solutions of eq 1 are used in the present paper for the definition of the standing wave i e for the definition of the relation connecting the states u 1 and u 2 at the two sides of the geometric transition this choice is idealistic because the real fluid effects viscosity turbulence surface tension non hydrostatic pressure and velocity distribution development of short waves and the actual characteristics of the geometric transition boundary roughness length shape are neglected this is confirmed by the numerical experiments where modest changes in the geometric transition layout lead to non negligible energy loss in some case also when no physical viscosity and friction are added to the numerical model it is evident that the use of experimental formulas for the expression of the relationship between u 1 and u 2 inferred from laboratory or field activity could be beneficial in practical applications in this section the construction of the remann problem solution is devised with reference to the case that energy loss through the structure cannot be neglected in addition the structure of the exact solutions presented in the preceding sections is used to discuss the numerical problems that are usually encountered in the models where internal boundary conditions are present 4 1 generalization to the case of real flows many papers for the description of the flow through bridge piers yarnell 1934 river constrictions davidian et al 1962 wu and molinas 2005 and cutthroat measurement flumes torres and merkley 2008 are available in the literature and the same material is covered in classic hydraulics textbooks chow 1959 henderson 1966 these papers mainly concern the energy losses through the geometric transition and the onset of chocked flow conditions if the flow through the geometric transition is directed from left to right the following can be schematically assumed a1 if the flow upstream is subcritical but it is not influenced by the flow conditions downstream it is said to be undrowned standing wave swb or swc in this case there is a monotonic increasing relationship uup f un up hup between the characteristics h up and u up of the subcritical flow immediately to the left of the geometric transition upstream this relationship reduces to u u p k s b b 0 b g h u p when the energy is conserved through the geometric transition in the same manner there is a monotonic increasing relationship udo f un do hdo between the characteristics of the supercritical flow when the standing wave is swc immediately to the right of the geometric transition this relationship reduces to u d o k s p b 0 b g h d o when the energy is conserved a2 if the subcritical flow upstream is influenced by the tailwater it is said to be submerged standing wave swa in this case the function uup f dro up hup hdo connects the velocity upstream u up with the flow depths h up and h do respectively upstream and downstream of the geometric transition this relationship is increasing with h up and decreasing with h do the special case of constant energy reduces to u 1 u 2 the use of the corresponding formulas introduces some modification of the l m loci and this requires additional comments that concern the iil curve only because the il curve is not affected by the presence of the geometric transition given the initial left state u l it is possible to consider the states u connected to u l by means of the wave t 1 u l a case with u 0 this reach of the curve iil below the state u 0 l coincides with the curve t 1 u l for u 0 b case with u 0 b 1 let u a be the intersection between t 1 u l and the curve u f un up h for each state u h hu t of the curve t 1 u l between u 0 l and u a find the depth z that solves the equation u f dro up h z the submerged reach of the iil curve consists of the states with flow depth z and velocity hu z in particular the state u 1 l is the state on the iil curve that corresponds to u a b 2 denote with u 2 l h 2 l h 2 l u 2 l t the supercritical state at intersection between the curve cd u 1 l and the curve udo f un do hdo for h h 2 l the rarefaction part of the free flow reach along the curve iil coincides with the curve r 1 u 2 l b 3 denote with u 2 l h 2 l h 2 l u 2 l t the subcritical state at the intersection between the curve s 1 u2 l and the curve cd u 1 l the shock part of the free flow reach along the curve iil coincides with s 1 u 2 l for h 2 l h h 2 l while the partially submerged reach coincides with cd u 1 l for h 2 l h h 1 l also in this case it is evident that the free flow and the partially submerged flow reaches of the iil curve are strictly decreasing if the submerged reach of the curve iil is strictly decreasing the l m curve is continuous and strictly decreasing in the h u plane the analysis has been limited to the curve iil but the obvious symmetric considerations are valid for the curve iir if the direction of the flux through the geometric transition is inverted the preceding considerations lead to the conclusion that the solution of the riemann problem at the constrictions and obstructions may exist and be unique when energy losses are present if the curves iil and iir are strictly decreasing and increasing respectively the variability of real world situations suggests to verify on a case by case basis if these assumptions are verified interestingly the construction of the curve iil requires that the supercritical curve udo f un do hdo is known but this information is rarely available in the literature because subcritical conditions through the geometric transitions are more common especially for rivers nonetheless transcritical flow conditions could be temporarily established during strong transients such as those generated by maneuvers or by the impact of tidal bores on bridge piers in the test of table 2 row 2 figs 6b 9b 10b 11b 12b the initial states u l and u r are both subcritical with similar froude numbers fl 0 16 and fr 0 18 respectively congruently with the intuition subcritical flow conditions are established through the geometric discontinuity this is not the case for a similar test table 2 row4 figs 6d 9d 10d 11d 12d with fl fr 0 16 where the transient generates a transcritical flow through the geometric transition 4 2 a comment on the numerical issues at internal boundary conditions in finite difference schemes the inspection of the riemann problem exact solution at constrictions and obstructions shows that the initial discontinuity breaks in three or more waves see for example fig 4d that separate constant flow states the flow states u 1 and u 2 in the vicinity of the structure can be very different from the initial flow states u l and u r and this implies that strong gradients of the flow characteristics are present in the neighborhood of the structure at the beginning of the transient these strong gradients may cause the appearance of wiggles in classic finite difference schemes as suggested by the fourier representation of solution discontinuities in fact while the high frequency modes that constitute the solution are dumped by the strong numerical diffusion of first order accurate finite difference methods the numerical dispersion introduced by second or higher order accurate methods causes the different modes to move with different velocities gray and pinder 1976 the separation of the fourier components originates traveling wiggles in the vicinities of strong gradients which may suggest an incipient numerical instability sobey 2001 a second numerical issue that must be considered at internal boundary conditions such as constrictions and obstructions is the lack of numerical convergence caused by the use of static formulas connecting the flow characteristics immediately upstream and downstream of geometric transitions the use of these formulas during transients is based on the implicit assumption that the computed inner states u 1 and u 2 are close to the initial outer states u l and u r if this assumption is satisfied the application of iterative procedures which must be used also in the case of explicit methods for the advancing in time of finite difference solutions when structures are present cunge et al 1980 jaafar and merkley 2010 allows ensuring the instantaneous equilibrium between the flow through the structure and the one dimensional outer flow propagation model unfortunately the convergence of algebraic systems of non linear equations is not a priori guaranteed when the initial guess is not close to the solution press et al 1992 and this is precisely the case when the couple of inner states u 1 and u 2 in the exact solution is very different from the couple of outer states u l and u r this causes the arrest of the computer program or the lack of convergence and inaccuracy of results the cited problems are avoided by the one dimensional finite volume scheme presented in this work where the constrictions and the obstructions are treated as special interfaces where the inner boundary condition is imposed weakly namely by means of the fluxes the conceptual congruency between these special numerical fluxes and the ordinary numerical fluxes between the cells explains the robustness of the procedure 5 conclusions in the present paper the solution of the dam break problem at rectangular constrictions and obstructions available in the literature has been generalized by considering the one dimensional riemann problem for a wide class of initial conditions with non null initial velocity covering the totality of subcritical flows and the range of supercritical flows that is relevant for the practical applications in order to simplify the mathematical treatment it has been assumed that the flow through the geometric transition is described by a stationary weak solution of the saint venant equations without friction but the procedure to be used in the case of non negligible head losses has been briefly discussed as well this generalized solution can be used as a guide in the interpretation of the results from transient laboratory experiments or from field surveys on the other hand the exact solution presented in this paper allows the construction of a new class of benchmarks for the one dimensional numerical models that simulate the flow propagation in channels where constrictions or obstructions are present or the construction of new numerical schemes for the treatment of internal boundary conditions as customary for the hyperbolic systems of differential equations the riemann problem has been tackled in the present paper by means of a graphical construction that involves two types of curves namely the l m and r m curves these curves which generalize the 1 wave and 2 wave curves ordinarily used in the saint venant and one dimensional shallow water equations allow demonstrating that the solution of the riemann problem exists and it is unique for a large class of initial conditions whose range is given four main groups of solutions are possible table 1 depending on the number of waves three or four that develop from the initial discontinuity and the direction of the flow through the discontinuity from left to right or right to left in the case of four waves sc4 and sc4 in table 1 the flow through geometric transition is accelerated from subcritical to supercritical in the case of three waves sc3 and sc3 in table 1 two types of flow through the geometric transition are possible in the first case the flow is subcritical everywhere through the geometric transition in the second case the flow is accelerated from subcritical to supercritical conditions and is then reverted to subcritical conditions by a hydraulic jump example solutions of the riemann problem supplied by the one dimensional mathematical model have been compared with the results of a two dimensional shallow water equations numerical model where the same initial conditions are used despite the complicate structure of the flow through the geometric transition that is evidenced by the two dimensional numerical model there is a nice agreement between the results of the two approaches at some distance from the initial discontinuity when the energy losses are negligible among the other results it has been mathematically demonstrated a somehow counterintuitive result namely that supercritical flow conditions at the outlet of the geometric transition can be obtained during rapid transients also in the case that the initial conditions are subcritical everywhere see the example riemann problem of table 2 row 4 in the same manner the existence of a special flow condition predicted by the mathematical model table 2 row 3 namely the presence of a standing hydraulic jump through the outlet of the geometric transition has been predicted these different results have been verified by means of two dimensional numerical modelling the examination of the simulations has demonstrated the need of introducing the head losses in the procedure where this is appropriate and this can be easily done by introducing a standing wave definition inferred from laboratory experiments or field activity also in this case the existence and the uniqueness of the riemann problem solution can be demonstrated if the corresponding l m and r m curves are monotone in general the flow conditions immediately to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity may be very different from the initial conditions and this contributes to explain the numerical issues that are reported in the literature for the rapid transients at internal boundary conditions in common saint venant finite difference models interestingly the graphical construction for the exact solution of the riemann problem can be easily coded as a numerical procedure based on an iterative solver such as the bisection method this approach supplies the numerical fluxes that are embedded into a finite volume numerical scheme for the solution of the one dimensional shallow water equations the comparison between the riemann problem exact solution and the numerical results demonstrate that the solution is nicely captured by the numerical scheme in all the cases in addition numerical oscillations or instability phenomena are absent and this guarantees against anomalous termination of programs acknowledgements the writers want to warmly thank the associate editor prof manes and the two anonymous

633,usually the rapid geometric transitions that are of negligible length with respect to the channel are treated in one dimensional saint venant models as internal boundary conditions assuming that an instantaneous equilibrium is attained between the flow characteristics through the structure and the flow characteristics in the channel in the present paper a different point of view is assumed by considering rapid transients at channel constrictions and obstructions that are caused by the lack of instantaneous equilibrium between the flow conditions immediately upstream and downstream of the structure these transients are modelled as a riemann problem assuming that the flow through the geometric transition is described by a stationary weak solution of the saint venant equations without friction for this case it is demonstrated that the solution of the riemann problem exists and it is unique for a wide class of initial flow conditions including supercritical flows the solutions of the riemann problem supplied by the one dimensional mathematical model compare well with the results of a two dimensional shallow water equations numerical model when the head loss through the structure is negligible the inspection of the exact solutions structure shows that the flow conditions immediately to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity may be very different from the initial conditions and this contributes to explain the numerical issues that are reported in the literature for the rapid transients at internal boundary conditions in finite difference models the solution of the riemann problem has been coded and the corresponding exact fluxes have been used as numerical fluxes in a one dimensional finite volume scheme for the solution of the shallow water equations the results demonstrate that spurious oscillations and instability phenomena are completely eliminated ensuring the robustness of the approach in the case that the energy loss is not negligible the exact solutions capture the essential features of the two dimensional model numerical results ensuring that the mathematical procedure is generalizable to realistic conditions this generalization is presented in the final part of the paper keywords riemann problem bridge piles venturi flume slit check dams embankment porous shallow water equations 1 introduction practical computation of flood wave propagation in river channels and in canal networks requires the ability to cope with the interaction between the propagating wave and those structures where the channel is non prismatic and the assumption of gradually varied flow may be lost henderson 1966 this interaction may be characterised by rapid transients that are caused by manoeuvres cunge et al 1980 propagation of tidal bores chanson 2011 and dam break flows soares frazão and zech 2007 among the others attention is focused here on those structures called constrictions and obstructions which are characterised by rapid non monotonic width variations fig 1 in detail the constrictions are channel reaches where the section is rapidly contracted by reducing the distance between the sidewalls while a similar cross section reduction is generated in the obstructions by the presence of obstacles that leave at least two openings chow 1959 example of constrictions are the reduction of river cross section caused by the presence of embankments slit check dams with a single opening and measuring devices such as the venturi and the cutthroat flumes on the other hand bridge piles the piers sustaining the gates of run of river hydropower plants and slit check dams with multiple openings are example of obstructions in most cases rapid geometric transitions are short with respect to the length of the channel and the volume of water stored between the entrance and the exit is negligible at the channel scale for this reason the geometric transitions are usually treated in one dimensional saint venant models as internal boundary conditions where a static algebraic relation connects the instantaneous characteristics of the flow immediately upstream and downstream of the structure sobey 2001 litrico and fromion 2009 this static relation is usually derived from field or laboratory experiments or it is approximated by applying hydraulic principles such as bernoulli s theorem the direct use of static formulas connecting the flow characteristics at the two sides of the geometric transition may be problematic in numerical computations during transients sobey 2001 briefly discussed the spurious wiggles generated in one dimensional models by rapid changes of the flow in the vicinity of structures while the reference manual of the commercial software mike11 dhi 2017 reports numerical instabilities at bridges when high water level gradients are present finally there are cases where a sudden passage between different types of flow regimes for example from free to submerged flow happens during the calculations in order to avoid convergence problems the use of coefficients cunge et al 1980 dhi 2017 that smoothen this sudden passage is suggested but the modification of the hydraulic formulas is somehow arbitrary and subjective from this brief examination of the literature it is evident that there is a need to investigate how internal boundary conditions should be formulated in order to avoid issues such as numerical oscillations and lack of convergence in line of principle two dimensional shallow water models are able to cope with obstructions and contractions if the computational mesh is refined in the vicinities of the geometric transition but this can lead to an increase of computational burden ratia et al 2014 for this reason structures like bridges are frequently treated in two dimensional models as internal boundary conditions where an appropriate static relation connects the flow characteristics at the two sides of the structure zhao et al 1994 following this line of reasoning ratia et al 2014 introduced the bridges in a two dimensional finite volume model in the form of a borda carnot head loss term the corresponding additional friction term was numerically incorporated into the approximate solution of a riemann problem at the interface between two cells the procedure worked well if subcritical flow conditions were established upstream and downstream of the geometric transition while less satisfactory results were obtained in the case of supercritical flow downstream this observation explains why the numerical model failed to reproduce the flow depths that were measured immediately downstream of small scale laboratory bridges during dam break experiments in addition no guarantee was given in ratia et al 2014 about the existence of solutions and no comparison was made with exact solutions despite the fact that the shallow water and the saint venant equations are differential equations written under the assumption of gradually varied flow they admit discontinuous flow field solutions corresponding to moving shocks that connect the gradually varied parts of the flow field cunge et al 1980 leveque 2004 it is well known that a thorough study of the transients where these flow discontinuities are present can be accomplished in the context of the so called rieman problem i e the initial value problem where the initial conditions are discontinuous toro 2001 leveque 2004 inspired by this many researchers have treated rapid geometric transitions as a special class of standing discontinuities connecting the flow fields upstream and downstream and studying the corresponding transients in the context of a special riemann problem this approach has been successfully used in the literature for a variety of structures such as bed steps contractions and expansions broad crested weirs sluice gates alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 ostapenko and malysheva 2006 lefloch and thanh 2011 guerra et al 2011 ostapenko 2012 han and warnecke 2014 cozzolino et al 2014a 2015 2018 among the others the riemann problem at obstructions and constrictions was considered in cozzolino et al 2017 limiting to the case of null initial velocity dam break problem having assumed that the flow through the geometric transition can be represented by an admissible steady weak solution of the one dimensional flow equations cozzolino et al 2017 demonstrated that the solution of the dam break problem always exists and it is unique the exact solutions of the one dimensional mathematical model were compared with the laboratory results of dam break at constrictions by townson and al salihi 1989 showing the feasibility of the method in the present paper the restrictions about the initial velocity contained in cozzolino et al 2017 are removed by considering the solution of the riemann problem in rectangular channels with constrictions and obstructions for a wide class of initial flow conditions including supercritical flow this approach allows verifying under which assumptions the solution exists and it is unique when a transient starts from initial conditions that are far from equilibrium in the following sections the mathematical model is presented showing that the assumptions made for the flow through the geometric transition allows a variety of flow conditions with free partially submerged or submerged flow in addition the existence and the uniqueness of the corresponding solutions is demonstrated for a range of initial conditions that will be specified when the methodology is described supplying a solid ground to the application of the model interestingly the exact solutions presented in this paper are relevant for the porous shallow water equations because this model is formally identical to the one dimensional shallow water equations in variable width rectangular channels guinot and soares frazão 2006 cozzolino et al 2018 the exact results of the one dimensional mathematical model are finally compared with the numerical results of a two dimensional numerical model discussing the main differences despite the fact that the assumption of energy conservation is widely used in the literature bos 1989 sturm 2001 chaudhry 2008 the scheme presents clear limitations in the case that energy losses are not negligible for this reason the modifications required for the application in real world problems are discussed together with an analysis of the numerical issues commonly encountered in the simulation of strong transients at river structures the exact solution of the riemann problem has been coded and the corresponding exact fluxes have been used as numerical fluxes in a one dimensional finite volume scheme for the solution of the shallow water equations the results demonstrate that spurious oscillations and instability phenomena are completely eliminated ensuring the robustness of the approach finally the paper is closed by a conclusions section 2 exact solution of the riemann problem in the present section the general structure of the riemann problem at constrictions and obstructions is presented and the standing wave corresponding to the geometric discontinuity is defined finally the l m and r m curves are introduced and the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the general riemann problem is discussed 2 1 position of the problem under the assumption of rectangular cross section and negligible friction the one dimensional saint venant model can be written as 1 b h t b h u x 0 b h u t x g 2 b h 2 b h u 2 g 2 h 2 b x 0 the meaning of the symbols is as follows x is the longitudinal coordinate t is the time variable b b x is the local channel width h h x t is the flow depth u u x t is the cross section averaged velocity g 9 81 m s2 is the gravitational acceleration in the present paper the eq 1 is solved considering the following discontinuous flow initial data 2 u x 0 u l x 0 u r x 0 complemented by the discontinuous geometric data 3 b x b l x 0 b r x 0 in eq 2 u h hu t is the vector of the conserved variables for the channel of unitary width t is the matrix transpose symbol while u l hl hlul t and u r hr hrur t represent the initial flow conditions to the left and to the right of the initial discontinuity respectively the eq 3 specifies that the left reach of the channel x 0 has uniform width b l while the right reach x 0 has uniform width b r in the present model the obstructions fig 1a and the constrictions fig 1b are modelled by means of a single rapid smooth contraction from the width b 0 bl to the minimum width b b 0 followed by a single rapid smooth expansion from b b 0 to b 0 br for simplicity in the following it is assumed that bl br b and that the characteristics of the geometric transition can be concisely described by the aspect ratio b 0 b with 0 b 0 b 1 despite of this limitation the procedure of the present paper can be mutatis mutandis extended to general cases with bl br it is evident that the relationship between the flow variables at the inlet and at the outlet of the standing discontinuity depends on the inner description of the discontinuity following cozzolino et al 2017 the steady flow solutions of eq 1 are used to describe the flow through the standing discontinuity 2 2 structure of the riemann solution and moving waves the solution u x t of the riemann problem of eqs 1 3 is self similar cozzolino et al 2017 2018 and its structure consists of constant states which are conventionally ordered from left state u l to right state u r all these states are connected by classic moving elementary waves shocks or rarefactions and by an additional standing wave that is induced by the fixed geometric discontinuity in x 0 in the present paper the symbols u 1 u 0 t h 1 h 1 u 1 t and u 2 u 0 t h 2 h 2 u 2 t are used to indicate the constant states immediately to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity and connected by the standing wave relationship in order to elucidate the nature of the shocks and rarefactions for the system of eq 1 we observe that the eq 3 states that the channel width is uniform for x 0 and x 0 in these regions the eq 1 reduces to 4 u t f u x 0 where f hu hu 2 gh 2 2 t is the flux vector for the channel of unitary width the classic one dimensional shallow water equations of eq 4 are a strictly hyperbolic system of differential equations characterized by two characteristic fields leveque 2004 which are genuinely nonlinear and may contain moving waves such as shocks or rarefactions it follows that elementary waves developing to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity in the riemann problem of eqs 1 3 coincide with the elementary 1 and 2 waves of the classic one dimensional shallow water equations of eq 4 in the h u plane the symbols si u ref and s i b u r e f are used to denote the loci of the states u connected to the reference state u ref by a direct or a backward shock lefloch and thanh 2007 respectively that are contained into the ith characteristic field with i 1 2 of the system of eq 4 similarly the symbols ri u ref and r i b u r e f are used to denote the loci of the states u connected to the reference state u ref by a direct or a backward rarefaction lefloch and thanh 2007 respectively that are contained into the ith characteristic field with i 1 2 of the classic one dimensional shallow water equations the direct i wave curve ti u ref ri u ref si u ref is defined as the union of the direct i rarefaction and i shock curves with i 1 2 similarly the backward i wave curve t i b u r e f r i b u r e f s i b u r e f is defined as the union of the backward i rarefaction and i shock curves with i 1 2 it is immediate to show lefloch and than 2007 that the 1 wave curves are strictly decreasing and convex while the 2 wave curves are strictly increasing and concave the supremum i of t 1 u ref coincides with the intersection between the curve r 1 u ref and the axis h 0 and it is characterized by null flow depth hi 0 and velocity u i u r e f 2 g h r e f correspondingly the infimum j of t 2 b u r e f coincides with the intersection between the curve r 2 b u r e f and the axis h 0 and it is characterized by null flow depth hj 0 and velocity u j u r e f 2 g h r e f in addition to these waves it is useful considering the curve cd u ref of the states u that have the same discharge per unit width of the state u ref in the plane h u this curve is convex and strictly decreasing when the flow is directed from left to right while it is concave and strictly increasing when the flow is directed from right to left 2 3 the standing wave description admissible steady weak solutions of eq 1 are used for the definition of the standing wave cozzolino et al 2017 and this means that the discharge is invariant through the geometric discontinuity it follows that the equality h 1 u 1 h 2 u 2 is valid under the assumption bl br and that u 2 is a state on the curve cd u 1 while u 1 is a state on the curve cd u 2 in addition to this the steady weak solutions of eq 1 prescribe that the energy is conserved through the geometric discontinuity if the flow is smooth unless a hydraulic jump is present into the diverging part of the geometric transition a necessary condition for the establishing of smooth flow through the geometric discontinuities such as constrictions or obstructions is yarnell 1934 5 b 0 b f 3 2 3 2 1 f 2 2 3 2 where 0 b 0 b 1 while f u g h is the froude number of the flow u entering the geometric transition for given value of the aspect ratio b 0 b the eq 5 is satisfied by the values f 0 k s b b 0 b k s p b 0 b where the limit froude numbers 0 ksb b 0 b 1 and ksp b 0 b 1 are defined in the appendix a the values f k s b b 0 b and f k s p b 0 b satisfy the eq 5 with the equality sign in this case critical conditions are attained at the minimum width b b 0 of the geometric transition in addition to the limit froude numbers ksb b 0 b and ksp b 0 b let k s p b 0 b be the value of the subcritical froude number that is conjugate to the supercritical froude number ksp b 0 b by means of the hydraulic jump see the appendix for the corresponding mathematical expression in the following the superscript will be used to indicate the hydraulic jump projection operator i e the operator that supplies the subcritical flow state u r e f that is conjugated by the hydraulic jump to the supercritical flow reference state u ref in the h u plane the symbols c s b b 0 b c s p b 0 b and c s p b 0 b are used to denote the loci of the states u with u 0 characterized by f k s b b 0 b f k s p b 0 b and f k s p b 0 b respectively similarly the symbols c s b b 0 b c s p b 0 b and c s p b 0 b are used to denote the loci of the states u with u 0 characterized by f k s b b 0 b f k s p b 0 b and f k s p b 0 b respectively the mathematical expressions of these curves are contained in the appendix a three flow configurations through the geometric transition namely swa swb and swc are considered swa the flow which is submerged is smooth and subcritical through the standing discontinuity in this case u 1 u 2 and f 1 f 2 with f 1 ksb b 0 b where f 1 is the froude number corresponding to the state u 1 while f 2 corresponds to the state u 2 swb the flow which is chocked smoothly passes from subcritical to supercritical through the discontinuity and it is then reverted into subcritical flow by a hydraulic jump that is located in the expansion reach if u 1 0 and u 2 0 the subcritical state u 1 is characterized by f 1 k s b b 0 b and the subcritical state u 2 is characterized by f 2 k s b b 0 b k s p b 0 b if u 1 0 and u 2 0 the subcritical state u 1 is characterized by f 1 k s p b 0 b k s b b 0 b and the subcritical state u 2 is characterized by f 2 k s b b 0 b swc the flow which is chocked smoothly passes from subcritical to supercritical through the discontinuity if u 1 0 and u 2 0 the subcritical state u 1 and the supercritical state u 2 are characterized by f 1 k s b b 0 b and f 2 k s p b 0 b respectively if u 1 0 and u 2 0 the supercritical state u 1 and the subcritical state u 2 are characterized by f 1 k s p b 0 b and f 2 k s b b 0 b respectively in the following the family of standing waves swa swb and swc is collectively designated with the symbol sw these flow configurations cover the entire range of possible flow profiles through the standing discontinuity when the conditions 6 f l k s p b 0 b f r k s p b 0 b are satisfied in eq 6 the symbol fl is used to indicate the froude number f l u l g h l of the state u l while f r u r g h r is the froude number of the state u r it is evident that the dam break problem fl fr 0 studied by cozzolino et al 2017 is only a particular case of the general riemann problem described here 2 4 structure of the admissible wave configurations following the procedure contained in alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 and han and warnecke 2014 all the possible solution wave configurations for the riemann problem of eqs 1 3 can be enumerated if the study is limited to the initial states u l and u r that satisfy the eq 6 only four main classes of solution wave configurations sc3 sc4 sc3 sc4 are possible which are described as follows sc3 in this class of wave solution configurations wave configuration sketch in row 1 of table 1 there are four states u l u 1 u 2 and u r from left to right which are connected by three waves t 1 swa or swb and t 2 respectively the flow through the geometric transition is directed from left to right with subcritical states u 1 and u 2 the indications t 1 and t 2 are generic and the actual waves may be either shocks or rarefactions sc4 in the second class of wave solution configurations wave configuration sketch in row 2 of table 1 there are five states u l u 1 u 2 u mid and u r from left to right which are connected by four waves t 1 swc t 1 and t 2 respectively the flow through the geometric transition is directed from left to right with subcritical u 1 and supercritical u 2 sc3 in this class of solution configurations wave configurations sketch in row 3 of table 1 the flow through the geometric transition is directed from right to left this case is obtained by mirroring the case sc3 sc4 in this case which is obtained by mirroring the case sc4 the flow through the geometric transition is directed from right to left wave configurations sketch in row 4 of table 1 2 5 the l m and r m curves the classic riemann problem is easily solved by intersecting the curves t 1 u l and t 2 b u r that are associated to the states u l and u r respectively alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 toro 2001 leveque 2004 using a procedure inspired by the available literature marchesin and paes leme 1986 lefloch and than 2011 han and warnecke 2014 in the present sub section the curves t 1 u l and t 2 b u r are generalized by constructing two new curves of the h u plane namely the loci l m and r m which are associated to the states u l and u r respectively the inspection of the table 1 rows 1 4 suggests the following definition for the l m curve if the flow through the geometric discontinuity is not directed from right to left u 1 0 and u 2 0 the curve l m consists of the states u with u 0 that are connected to u l from the right by an admissible sequence of waves including sw and that can be connected to u r from the left by a moving wave contained in the second characteristic field if the flow through the geometric discontinuity is directed from right to left u 1 0 and u 2 0 the curve l m consists of the states u with u 0 that are connected to u l from the right by a moving wave contained in the first characteristic field the curve r m is defined by a symmetric construction if the flow through the geometric discontinuity is not directed from right to left u 1 0 and u 2 0 the curve r m consists of the states u with u 0 that are connected to u r from the left by a moving wave contained in the second characteristic field if the flow through the geometric discontinuity is directed from right to left u 1 0 and u 2 0 the curve r m consists of the states u with u 0 that are connected to u r from the left by an admissible sequence of waves including sw and that can be connected to u l from the right by a moving wave contained in the first characteristic field from the definitions it is evident that the loci l m and r m consist of the admissible states u 2 in the class of wave configurations sc3 of the admissible states u mid in the class sc4 and sc4 and of the admissible states u 1 for sc3 2 5 1 construction and interpretation of the l m curves two types of l m curves are considered namely the curves il and iil as follows curve il when fl 2 the l m curve simply coincides with the locus t 1 u l which in this case lies entirely under the axis u 0 of the h u plane an example is represented in fig 2 a for the initial left states of table 2 row 1 the supremum i of the curve il has velocity u i u l 2 g h l 0 and null flow depth hi curve iil when f l 2 k s p b 0 b it is possible to consider the special states u 1 l h 1 l h 1 l u 1 l t u 2 l h 2 l h 2 l u 2 l t u 2 l h 2 l h 2 l u 2 l t and u 0 l h 0 l 0 t which appear in the construction of the riemann problem solution the state u 1 l is defined as the intersection between the curves t 1 u l and c s b b 0 b while the states u 2 l and u 2 l are those states different from u 1 l at the intersection between the curve cd u 1 l and the curves c s p b 0 b and c s p b 0 b respectively finally the state u 0 l h 0 l 0 t is found at the intersection between the curve t 1 u l and the h axis recalling the properties of the hydraulic jump the state u 2 l coincides also with the intersection between the curves s 1 u 2 l and cd u 1 l the curve iil is defined as the union of the following loci the curve r 1 u 2 l the reach of the curve s 1 u 2 l between the states u 2 l and u 2 l the reach of curve cd u 1 l between the states u 2 l and u 1 l the curve t 1 u l below the state u 1 l the supremum i of the curve iil is characterized by null flow depth hi 0 and velocity u i u 2 l 2 g h 2 l 0 the states u between i and u 2 l characterize free flow conditions through the structure u 1 0 and u 2 0 the states between u 2 l and u 1 l characterize partially submerged flow conditions while the states between u 1 l and u 0 l correspond to submerged flow conditions two example curves iil are represented in fig 2b and c for the initial left states of table 2 rows 2 and 3 and b 0 b 0 6 respectively in the first of these examples fig 2b the state u l is such that fl ksb b 0 b and this implies that u l lies on the curve l m for this reason the reach of t 1 u l between the states u l and u 1 l coincides with the portion of r 1 u l between the same states while the reach of t 1 u l below the state u l coincides with s 1 u l in the second example fig 3 c the condition fl ksb b 0 b ksp b 0 b implies that u l does not lie on the curve l m in this case the reach of t 1 u l below the state u 1 l reduces to the corresponding reach of s 1 u l 2 5 2 construction and interpretation of the r m curves due to the symmetry of the geometric transition the curves l r ir and iir can be constructed by mirroring the curves il and iil with respect to the axis u 0 curve i r when fr 2 the r m curve coincides with the locus t 2 b u r the infimum j of the curve ir has velocity u j u r 2 g h r 0 and null flow depth hj curve ii r when f r k s p b 0 b 2 it is possible to define the special states u 1 r h 1 r h 1 r u 1 r t u 2 r h 2 r h 2 r u 2 r t u 1 r h 1 r h 1 r u 1 r t and u 0 r h 0 r 0 t in particular u 2 r is defined as the subcritical state at the intersection between the curves t 2 b u r and c s b b 0 b while u 1 r and u 1 r are the states at the intersection between the curve cd u 2 r and the curves c s p b 0 b and c s p b 0 b respectively for h h 2 r finally the state u 0 r h 0 r 0 t is found at the intersection between the curve t 2 b u r and the h axis in this case the curve iir is defined as the union of the following loci the curve r 2 b u 1 r the reach of the curve s 2 b u 1 r between the states u 1 r and u 1 r the reach of curve cd u 2 r between the states u 1 r and u 2 r the curve t 2 b u 1 r above the state u 1 r the infimum j of the curve iir is characterized by null flow depth hj 0 and velocity u j u 1 r 2 g h 1 r 0 2 6 construction the riemann problem solutions the exact solution of the riemann problem at obstructions and constrictions can be constructed by drawing the l m and r m curves corresponding to the states u l and u r respectively and finding their intersection u m the solution configuration and the constant states of the riemann solution are immediately deduced considering the wave configuration from u l to u m on the curve l m and from u m to u r on the curve r m the definitions adopted for the curves l m and r m ensure that there is exactly one standing wave or none in the sequence of waves from the state u l to the state u r as required by the structure of the exact solutions in the present sub section the solution construction and its interpretation are elucidated by means of four examples all these examples are characterized by aspect ratio b 0 b 0 6 with ksb 0 6 0 36 k s p 0 6 0 49 and ksp 0 6 2 32 it is clear that for these example the ranges fl 2 32 and fr 2 32 cover the totality of the subcritical flow conditions and a major portion of the supercritical flows that are relevant for the practical applications example 1 riemann problem in the first example fig 3a the graphical construction of the riemann problem with initial conditions of table 2 row 1 is shown the l m curve corresponding to the left initial state u l characterized by froude number fl 2 86 is of type il because fl 2 while the r m curve corresponding to the right initial state u r with fr 0 18 is of type iir because f r k s p b 0 b 2 2 32 2 from fig 3a it is clear that the intersection u m lies on the reach r 1 u l of the l m curve and on the reach r 2 b u 1 r of the r m curve following the waves from u l to the state u r it can be deduced that the flow through the standing wave is directed from right to left because the state u m lies below the axis u 0 the state u l is connected to the state u m by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field the state u 1 u 1 r is connected to the state u m by a rarefaction contained into the second characteristic field the state u r is connected to the state u 2 u 2 r by means of a rarefaction contained into the second characteristic field the solution configuration is of type sc4 with standing wave sw swc and u mid u m the wave configuration sketch corresponding to this example is detailed in the row 1 of table 3 the exact solution flow depth is represented at time t 5 s in fig 4 a example 2 riemann problem the initial conditions of table 2 row 2 are used in the second example riemann problem fig 3b the l m curve fl 0 16 is of type iil because f l 2 k s p b 0 b 2 2 32 while the r m curve coincides with that of example 1 the intersection u m lies on the reach r 1 u l of the l m curve and on the reach s 2 b u r of the r m curve and this implies that the flow through the standing wave is directed from left to right because the state u m lies above the axis u 0 the states u 1 and u 2 coincide with the state u m the state u l is connected to the state u 1 by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field the state u r is connected to the state u 2 by a shock contained into the second characteristic field the solution configuration is of type sc3 with standing wave sw swa the corresponding wave configuration sketch is detailed in the row 2 of table 3 while the exact solution flow depth is plotted at time t 5 s in fig 4b example 3 riemann problem this example corresponds to the initial conditions of table 2 row 3 where the l m curve is of type iil fl 1 07 and the r m curve coincides with those of examples 1 and 2 the intersection u m lies on the reach cd u l 1 of the l m curve and on the reach s 2 b u r of the r m curve fig 3c and this allows deducing what follows the flow through the standing wave is directed from left to right because the state u m lies above the axis u 0 the states immediately to the left and to the right of the standing discontinuity are such that u 1 u 1 l and u 2 u m the state u l is connected to the state u 1 by a shock contained into the first characteristic field the state u r is connected to the state u 2 by a shock contained into the second characteristic field the solution configuration is of type sc3 with standing wave sw swb the wave configuration sketch is represented in row 3 of table 3 and the exact solution flow depth is plotted at time t 5 s in fig 4c example 4 riemann problem in this case initial conditions in table 2 row 4 the l m curve coincides with that of example 2 while the r m curve is of type iir fr 0 16 the intersection u m lies on the reach s 1 u 1 l of the l m curve and on the reach s 2 b u r of the r m curve and this allows deducing what follows the flow through the standing wave is directed from left to right because the state u m lies above the axis u 0 the state u l is connected to the state u 1 u 1 l by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field the state u 2 u 2 l is connected to the state u m by a shock contained into the first characteristic field the state u r is connected to the state u m by a shock contained into the second characteristic field the solution configuration is of type sc4 with standing wave sw swc and u mid u m the corresponding wave configuration sketch is detailed in the row 4 of table 3 while the exact solution flow depth is represented at time t 5 s in fig 4d 2 7 global characteristics of the solutions from fig 2 it is clear that it is possible to parameterize the l m curve with respect to h in the form u flm h for h 0 where the function u flm h is continuous and strictly decreasing in a similar manner it is possible to parameterize the r m curve with respect to h in the form u frm h for h 0 where u frm h is continuous and strictly increasing the monotonicity properties of the curves l m and r m ensure that their intersection u m exists and it is unique for the case ui uj where the bed is wet everywhere in turn this implies that the solution of the riemann problem exists and it is unique when ui uj when ui uj a cavitation is formed despite of the fact that there is no intersection between the curves l m and r m the solution exists and it is unique also in this case because the structure of the waves that connect the states u l and u r to i and j respectively is individuated in an unambiguous manner in the case ui 0 corresponding to fl 2 see fig 2a the state u l is directly connected to the state i by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field in the case ui 0 corresponding to f l 2 k s p b 0 b see fig 2b and c the state u l is connected to u 1 u 1 l by a wave contained into the first characteristic field the state u 1 is connected to the state u 2 u 2 l by the standing wave swc and the state u 2 is connected to the dry bed state i by a rarefaction contained into the first characteristic field mutatis mutandis a similar discussion on the velocity uj is valid for the waves that connect the state u r to the dry bed state j in conclusion it is evident that the solution of the riemann problem where f l k s p b 0 b and f r k s p b 0 b always exists and it is unique what was to be demonstrated 2 8 iterative solution of the riemann problem the graphical procedure for the solution of the riemann problem at constrictions and obstructions can be tackled numerically when ui uj because the state u m can be calculated by finding the unique solution hm of the equation g h flm h frm h 0 and letting um frm hm the function g h is piecewise smooth and the classic bisection algorithm can be used for root finding press et al 1992 note that the position of the intersection u m on the curves l m and r m also determines the structure of the solution sc4 sc3 sc3 or sc4 and this immediately supplies the states u 1 and u 2 to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity the solution is trivially direct when ui uj because there is no need of an iterative approach the case 0 ui uj supplies u 1 u 1 l and u 2 u 2 l while the case ui uj 0 supplies u 1 u 1 r and u 2 u 2 r finally the case ui 0 uj supplies u 1 0 and u 2 0 where 0 is the null vector 3 numeric applications the results of the one dimensional mathematical model are compared with those supplied by a numerical model for the solution of the two dimensional shallow water equations this comparison allows discussing the limits of the one dimensional mathematical model which is a rough representation of the flow through the geometric transition in addition the iterative procedure for the approximate solution of the riemann problem at the geometric discontinuity has been embedded into a one dimensional finite volume model for the solution of the shallow water equations showing the feasibility of the approach in practical calculations 3 1 two dimensional numerical model the two dimensional numerical model used here is a standard first order cell centred finite volume model on triangular grid godlewski and raviart 1996 that approximates the solution of the classic two dimensional shallow water equations 7 h t h u x h v y 0 h u t x g 2 h 2 h u 2 h u v y 0 h v t h u v x y g 2 h 2 h v 2 0 where the symbol v correspond to the velocity along the coordinate axis y first order accuracy in time is obtained by using an explicit euler scheme for advancing the solution the numerical fluxes are calculated with a simple hllc riemann solver eqs 10 21 and 10 28 in toro 2001 where the minimum and maximum wave speeds are approximated by means of the relations contained in cozzolino et al 2014b first order accuracy in space is obtained by using the cell averaged values of the conserved variables as arguments of the numerical fluxes the solid boundary conditions are introduced in a weak form by imposing that the variables at the external side of the boundary are mirrored with respect to the variables at the internal side similarly the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are imposed weakly by specifying the appropriate values of the conserved variables immediately outside of the physical domain boundary zhao et al 1994 and then calculating the corresponding fluxes by means of the approximate riemann solver 3 2 two dimensional solution of the riemann problem at the obstruction layout of fig 5a the one dimensional riemann problems of table 2 rows 1 4 are simulated by considering a channel aligned with the x axis and characterized by rectangular cross section length l 100 m and ordinary width b 1 m a symmetrical obstruction with length lc 1 80 m and minimum width b 0 0 60 is present at the middle of the channel where x 0 m see fig 5 a where a zoomed view of the obstruction layout is represented at time t 0 s the initial flow conditions are characterized by h hl and u ul for x 0 m while h hr and u ur for x 0 m with null initial transverse component of the velocity for t 0 s the lack of equilibrium at the flow discontinuity generates a transient that propagates from the middle of the channel and that is simulated with the numerical model for the numerical computations the physical domain is partitioned into 369 644 triangular cells with average side ls 0 025 m while the maximum time step δt 0 001 s is used in all the numerical tests in fig 6 the results of the two dimensional numerical model at time t 5 s are represented by projecting the free surface elevation onto the longitudinal vertical plane before commenting the tests it is important to recall that the geometric transition occupies an area of measure zero in the one dimensional mathematical model this implies that for given values of hl and hr the volume of water initially stored by the one dimensional mathematical model is slightly greater than that present in the two dimensional numerical model at the beginning of calculations the absolute value of this error which depends on the actual geometry of the transition increases with the length of the transition and decreases with the aspect ratio b 0 b on the other hand the ratio between the absolute volume error and the total volume initially stored in the physical domain decreases with the channel length enforcing the assumption of short geometric transition in all the cases it is expected that the results supplied by the one and two dimensional models are slightly different the exact solution supplied by the one dimensional model for the riemann problem of table 2 row 1 is plotted in fig 6a at time t 5 s together with the numerical results of the two dimensional model for the same initial conditions the inspection of the figure shows that the results of the one dimensional mathematical model compare satisfactorily with the two dimensional numerical results in particular the strength and the position of the rarefaction to the right of the initial discontinuity is in good agreement with that supplied by the two dimensional model nonetheless some features of the two dimensional solution that are not well captured by the simplified one dimensional model deserve additional comments a distinctive characteristic of the two dimensional solution when sw swc is the oscillatory behaviour of the free surface immediately to the left of the initial discontinuity cozzolino et al 2017 proved that these oscillations are not originated by numerical instabilities but consist of a shock wave reflection pattern that is originated by the supercritical flow at the exit of the expanding reach to the left of x 0 m flow from right to left in fig 6a this is confirmed by the inspection of fig 7 where the three dimensional inclined view of the free surface elevation in the vicinity of x 0 m exhibits a typical crossing waves regular pattern these waves which are discussed in classic hydraulic textbooks see for example chow 1959 are characterized by non uniform free surface elevation through the cross section and this implies that one dimensional models cannot reproduce them defina and viero 2010 finally the one dimensional exact solution does not capture the two undershoots exhibited by the two dimensional model results at the toe of the left rarefaction waves fig 6a it can be conjectured that these undershoots are originated by the initial deficit of volume contained into the expanding reach of the geometric transition this point will be further discussed in the remainder of the paper the results supplied by the one and two dimensional models for the riemann problem of table 2 row 2 are plotted in fig 6b at time t 5 s the one and two dimensional models compare satisfactorily also in this case but some difference is present in particular the one dimensional right shock wave is slightly faster than the two dimensional solution in addition the left rarefaction wave exhibits an overshoot that again can be attributed to the initial deficit of volume the two dimensional model reproduces the subcritical flow profile through the finite length geometric transition and this is well visible with dots at the centre of fig 6b while this flow profile collapses to a point in the one dimensional model the flow depths supplied to the left and to the right of x 0 m by the two dimensional numerical simulation of fig 6b almost coincide with the middle constant state supplied by the one dimensional model exact solution confirming that the assumption of moderate energy loss is viable in this case the results for the test of table 2 row 3 are reproduced in fig 6c for t 5 s this case is much interesting because it corresponds to the condition standing wave swb where a hydraulic jump is present through the geometric transition the inspection of the figure shows that the speed of the shocks supplied by the one dimensional flow are slightly slower than the speeds of the corresponding two dimensional shocks conversely the strengths of the two extreme shocks and of the standing wave are well captured by the one dimensional model implying that in this case the energy loss predicted by the one dimensional model is very close to that supplied by the two dimensional model the inspection of fig 8 a where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 6c are plotted in the vicinity of the geometric transition shows that there is no evidence of large eddies confirming that the energy loss exhibited by the two dimensional numerical model can be almost entirely attributed to the hydraulic jump predicted by the one dimensional exact solution as a final example the results of the test of table 2 row 4 are plotted in fig 6d for t 5 s the subcritical flow upstream of the geometric transition is reverted in supercritical flow through the transition also in this case and a train of oblique shock waves is formed in the diverging part of the structure to the right of x 0 m flow from left to right the presence of the shock contained into the first characteristic field cuts this train of waves which is only partly developed the inspection of the figure shows that the shock speeds are well captured while the flow depth of the intermediate state between the two shocks is slightly overestimated by the one dimensional model also in this case a small overshoot is present at the leading point of the left rarefaction wave 3 3 additional examples of riemann problem at obstructions and constrictions layout of figs 5b e the tests of the preceding sub section have been repeated for four additional geometries all characterized by aspect ratio b 0 b 0 6 which are represented in figs 5b e the corresponding results are briefly commented in the present sub section the results obtained for the layout of fig 5b 369 486 triangular cells in the finite volume model are represented in fig 9 and compared with the one dimensional exact solution the new layout corresponds again to an obstruction but the transition throat is longer than that of fig 5a while the area occupied by the obstruction is increased the inspection of fig 9 shows again that the agreement between the one dimensional exact solution and the two dimensional numerical results is good because the energy loss through the geometric transition is negligible in the two dimensional simulations the increased length of the transition throat leads to a straightening of the flow through the geometric transition and this is particularly evident in fig 9b where the free surface elevation through x 0 m becomes almost horizontal in addition the increased area occupied by the geometric transition causes an increased volume deficit and this reverberates on slightly more evident under and over shoots attached to the rarefaction waves figs 9a b d and on an slightly increased mismatch of the shock position in fig 8b and c the inspection of fig 8b where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 9c are plotted in the vicinity of the geometric transition shows again that there is no evidence of eddies confirming that the flow depth jump through x 0 m can be entirely attributed to the hydraulic jump predicted by the one dimensional exact solution the results for the obstruction of fig 5c 370 390 triangular cells where the convergent and the divergent reaches are absent are compared in fig 10 with the one dimensional exact solutions the area occupied by the geometric transition is very small and this leads to the disappearing of the over and under shoots at the rarefaction edges as confirmed by figs 10a b d interestingly the sharper layout of the obstruction leads to non negligible energy losses through it and this decreases the agreement between the two dimensional numerical results and the one dimensional exact solution this is particularly evident for the riemann problem of table 2 row 2 whose corresponding results are represented in fig 10b for this case the one dimensional exact solution predicts a middle constant state between the left rarefaction and the right shock while the two dimensional numerical model supplies two different states between the extreme waves these two middle states are in turn separated by a flow depth jump in x 0 m which clearly corresponds to an energy jump through the sharp obstruction a similar energy jump which causes a reduced agreement between the one dimensional exact solution and the two dimensional numerical results can be individuated in the figs 10a c d in all these cases the energy losses cause an increase of subcritical flow depth upstream of the obstruction and a decrease of the flow depth of the constant states downstream the inspection of fig 8c where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 10c are plotted shows the presence of lateral eddies together with a wake downstream of the central obstacle confirming the presence of energy dissipation that is not taken into account by the hydraulic jump mechanism the layout of fig 5d characterizes a constriction where the convergent and the divergent reaches are present the corresponding two dimensional numerical results obtained using 368 878 cells are compared in fig 11 with the one dimensional exact solution interestingly the presence of the long throat straightens up the flow through the geometrical transition but the absence of the central obstruction causes a more evident side contraction with the formation of lateral eddies that dissipate some energy see fig 8d where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 11c are plotted for this reason the results are somehow intermediate between those of the cases of fig 5b and c in particular the initial volume deficit causes the presence of the under and the over shoots at the edges of the rarefaction waves while the energy loss causes the increase of the subcritical flow depth upstream of the geometric transition the last example corresponds to the layout of fig 5e which represents a constriction without the convergent and divergent reaches the numerical results obtained with the two dimensional numerical model 370 256 cells are compared in fig 12 with the one dimensional exact results analogously to the sharp obstruction results of fig 10 the area occupied by the geometric transition is small and this reduces the initial volume deficit which in turn causes the disappearance of the under and over shoots at the edges of the rarefaction waves interestingly the constriction enhances the side contraction of the flow through the geometric transition and this leads to increased energy losses through x 0 m this is clearly seen from fig 12b where the flow depth jump is increased with respect to that of fig 10b finally the inspection of fig 8e where the velocity vectors corresponding to the two dimensional numeric simulation of fig 12c are plotted shows the presence of long lateral eddies confirming the existence of an energy dissipation mechanism that is additional to the hydraulic jump 3 4 one dimensional numerical model the solution of the one dimensional shallow water equations of eq 4 can be tackled by means of the one dimensional finite volume scheme following the approach of cozzolino et al 2015 the one dimensional domain of length l is discretized into nv non overlapping control volumes and eq 4 is integrated into each control volume obtaining the following set of algebraic equations 8 u i n 1 u i n δ t δ x f i 1 2 f i 1 2 where the symbols are defined as follows the index i refers to the generic finite volume c i δt is the time step δ x l n v is the length of the generic finite volume c i u i n h i n h i n u i n t is the vector of the conserved variables averaged over c i at the time level n f i 1 2 is the contribution to the cell c i of the interface i 1 2 between ci 1 and ci f i 1 2 is the contribution to the cell ci of the interface i 1 2 between ci and ci 1 the channel geometry is continuous at ordinary interfaces and the interface contributions are calculated as f i 1 2 f i 1 2 f u i n u i 1 n where f u i n u i 1 n is the numerical flux corresponding to the classic shallow water equations riemann problem with initial conditions u l u i n and u r u i 1 n the corresponding fluxes are estimated by means of the hll approximate riemann solver where the speeds are calculated using the relations in cozzolino et al 2014b the geometric discontinuity which is located at the interface g 1 2 between the cells c g and c g 1 is taken into account at the time level n by solving iteratively the corresponding riemann problem with initial conditions u l u i n and u r u i 1 n as discussed in sub section 2 8 once that the solution of the riemann problem is known the states u 1 and u 2 immediately to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity are available and the positions f g 1 2 f u 1 and f g 1 2 f u 2 are made 3 5 one dimensional numerical results the solution of the one dimensional riemann problems of table 2 rows 1 4 is approximated with the one dimensional model by considering a geometric discontinuity located at the centre x 0 m of a channel whose length is l 100 m and whose width is unitary in fig 13 the results of the numerical calculations dots are compared at time t 5 s with the corresponding exact solution thin continuous line for the case where nv 100 finite volumes and δt 0 05 s the inspection of the figure shows that the structure of the riemann solution number type and position of the waves is well reproduced in all the numerical examples in particular the standing wave is always nicely captured independent of its actual form swa in fig 13b swb in fig 13c swc in fig 13a d however the numerical diffusion smoothens the moving shocks and rarefaction waves on the coarse grid for this reason the computations are repeated considering nv 1000 finite volumes and δt 0 005 s and the corresponding numerical results are represented in fig 13 with a dashed line the inspection of the figure shows that the grid refinement reduces the numerical diffusion and makes the numerical solution converge towards the exact one the results presented here demonstrate the robustness and the applicability of the numerical procedure to general cases 4 discussion following cozzolino et al 2017 admissible steady weak solutions of eq 1 are used in the present paper for the definition of the standing wave i e for the definition of the relation connecting the states u 1 and u 2 at the two sides of the geometric transition this choice is idealistic because the real fluid effects viscosity turbulence surface tension non hydrostatic pressure and velocity distribution development of short waves and the actual characteristics of the geometric transition boundary roughness length shape are neglected this is confirmed by the numerical experiments where modest changes in the geometric transition layout lead to non negligible energy loss in some case also when no physical viscosity and friction are added to the numerical model it is evident that the use of experimental formulas for the expression of the relationship between u 1 and u 2 inferred from laboratory or field activity could be beneficial in practical applications in this section the construction of the remann problem solution is devised with reference to the case that energy loss through the structure cannot be neglected in addition the structure of the exact solutions presented in the preceding sections is used to discuss the numerical problems that are usually encountered in the models where internal boundary conditions are present 4 1 generalization to the case of real flows many papers for the description of the flow through bridge piers yarnell 1934 river constrictions davidian et al 1962 wu and molinas 2005 and cutthroat measurement flumes torres and merkley 2008 are available in the literature and the same material is covered in classic hydraulics textbooks chow 1959 henderson 1966 these papers mainly concern the energy losses through the geometric transition and the onset of chocked flow conditions if the flow through the geometric transition is directed from left to right the following can be schematically assumed a1 if the flow upstream is subcritical but it is not influenced by the flow conditions downstream it is said to be undrowned standing wave swb or swc in this case there is a monotonic increasing relationship uup f un up hup between the characteristics h up and u up of the subcritical flow immediately to the left of the geometric transition upstream this relationship reduces to u u p k s b b 0 b g h u p when the energy is conserved through the geometric transition in the same manner there is a monotonic increasing relationship udo f un do hdo between the characteristics of the supercritical flow when the standing wave is swc immediately to the right of the geometric transition this relationship reduces to u d o k s p b 0 b g h d o when the energy is conserved a2 if the subcritical flow upstream is influenced by the tailwater it is said to be submerged standing wave swa in this case the function uup f dro up hup hdo connects the velocity upstream u up with the flow depths h up and h do respectively upstream and downstream of the geometric transition this relationship is increasing with h up and decreasing with h do the special case of constant energy reduces to u 1 u 2 the use of the corresponding formulas introduces some modification of the l m loci and this requires additional comments that concern the iil curve only because the il curve is not affected by the presence of the geometric transition given the initial left state u l it is possible to consider the states u connected to u l by means of the wave t 1 u l a case with u 0 this reach of the curve iil below the state u 0 l coincides with the curve t 1 u l for u 0 b case with u 0 b 1 let u a be the intersection between t 1 u l and the curve u f un up h for each state u h hu t of the curve t 1 u l between u 0 l and u a find the depth z that solves the equation u f dro up h z the submerged reach of the iil curve consists of the states with flow depth z and velocity hu z in particular the state u 1 l is the state on the iil curve that corresponds to u a b 2 denote with u 2 l h 2 l h 2 l u 2 l t the supercritical state at intersection between the curve cd u 1 l and the curve udo f un do hdo for h h 2 l the rarefaction part of the free flow reach along the curve iil coincides with the curve r 1 u 2 l b 3 denote with u 2 l h 2 l h 2 l u 2 l t the subcritical state at the intersection between the curve s 1 u2 l and the curve cd u 1 l the shock part of the free flow reach along the curve iil coincides with s 1 u 2 l for h 2 l h h 2 l while the partially submerged reach coincides with cd u 1 l for h 2 l h h 1 l also in this case it is evident that the free flow and the partially submerged flow reaches of the iil curve are strictly decreasing if the submerged reach of the curve iil is strictly decreasing the l m curve is continuous and strictly decreasing in the h u plane the analysis has been limited to the curve iil but the obvious symmetric considerations are valid for the curve iir if the direction of the flux through the geometric transition is inverted the preceding considerations lead to the conclusion that the solution of the riemann problem at the constrictions and obstructions may exist and be unique when energy losses are present if the curves iil and iir are strictly decreasing and increasing respectively the variability of real world situations suggests to verify on a case by case basis if these assumptions are verified interestingly the construction of the curve iil requires that the supercritical curve udo f un do hdo is known but this information is rarely available in the literature because subcritical conditions through the geometric transitions are more common especially for rivers nonetheless transcritical flow conditions could be temporarily established during strong transients such as those generated by maneuvers or by the impact of tidal bores on bridge piers in the test of table 2 row 2 figs 6b 9b 10b 11b 12b the initial states u l and u r are both subcritical with similar froude numbers fl 0 16 and fr 0 18 respectively congruently with the intuition subcritical flow conditions are established through the geometric discontinuity this is not the case for a similar test table 2 row4 figs 6d 9d 10d 11d 12d with fl fr 0 16 where the transient generates a transcritical flow through the geometric transition 4 2 a comment on the numerical issues at internal boundary conditions in finite difference schemes the inspection of the riemann problem exact solution at constrictions and obstructions shows that the initial discontinuity breaks in three or more waves see for example fig 4d that separate constant flow states the flow states u 1 and u 2 in the vicinity of the structure can be very different from the initial flow states u l and u r and this implies that strong gradients of the flow characteristics are present in the neighborhood of the structure at the beginning of the transient these strong gradients may cause the appearance of wiggles in classic finite difference schemes as suggested by the fourier representation of solution discontinuities in fact while the high frequency modes that constitute the solution are dumped by the strong numerical diffusion of first order accurate finite difference methods the numerical dispersion introduced by second or higher order accurate methods causes the different modes to move with different velocities gray and pinder 1976 the separation of the fourier components originates traveling wiggles in the vicinities of strong gradients which may suggest an incipient numerical instability sobey 2001 a second numerical issue that must be considered at internal boundary conditions such as constrictions and obstructions is the lack of numerical convergence caused by the use of static formulas connecting the flow characteristics immediately upstream and downstream of geometric transitions the use of these formulas during transients is based on the implicit assumption that the computed inner states u 1 and u 2 are close to the initial outer states u l and u r if this assumption is satisfied the application of iterative procedures which must be used also in the case of explicit methods for the advancing in time of finite difference solutions when structures are present cunge et al 1980 jaafar and merkley 2010 allows ensuring the instantaneous equilibrium between the flow through the structure and the one dimensional outer flow propagation model unfortunately the convergence of algebraic systems of non linear equations is not a priori guaranteed when the initial guess is not close to the solution press et al 1992 and this is precisely the case when the couple of inner states u 1 and u 2 in the exact solution is very different from the couple of outer states u l and u r this causes the arrest of the computer program or the lack of convergence and inaccuracy of results the cited problems are avoided by the one dimensional finite volume scheme presented in this work where the constrictions and the obstructions are treated as special interfaces where the inner boundary condition is imposed weakly namely by means of the fluxes the conceptual congruency between these special numerical fluxes and the ordinary numerical fluxes between the cells explains the robustness of the procedure 5 conclusions in the present paper the solution of the dam break problem at rectangular constrictions and obstructions available in the literature has been generalized by considering the one dimensional riemann problem for a wide class of initial conditions with non null initial velocity covering the totality of subcritical flows and the range of supercritical flows that is relevant for the practical applications in order to simplify the mathematical treatment it has been assumed that the flow through the geometric transition is described by a stationary weak solution of the saint venant equations without friction but the procedure to be used in the case of non negligible head losses has been briefly discussed as well this generalized solution can be used as a guide in the interpretation of the results from transient laboratory experiments or from field surveys on the other hand the exact solution presented in this paper allows the construction of a new class of benchmarks for the one dimensional numerical models that simulate the flow propagation in channels where constrictions or obstructions are present or the construction of new numerical schemes for the treatment of internal boundary conditions as customary for the hyperbolic systems of differential equations the riemann problem has been tackled in the present paper by means of a graphical construction that involves two types of curves namely the l m and r m curves these curves which generalize the 1 wave and 2 wave curves ordinarily used in the saint venant and one dimensional shallow water equations allow demonstrating that the solution of the riemann problem exists and it is unique for a large class of initial conditions whose range is given four main groups of solutions are possible table 1 depending on the number of waves three or four that develop from the initial discontinuity and the direction of the flow through the discontinuity from left to right or right to left in the case of four waves sc4 and sc4 in table 1 the flow through geometric transition is accelerated from subcritical to supercritical in the case of three waves sc3 and sc3 in table 1 two types of flow through the geometric transition are possible in the first case the flow is subcritical everywhere through the geometric transition in the second case the flow is accelerated from subcritical to supercritical conditions and is then reverted to subcritical conditions by a hydraulic jump example solutions of the riemann problem supplied by the one dimensional mathematical model have been compared with the results of a two dimensional shallow water equations numerical model where the same initial conditions are used despite the complicate structure of the flow through the geometric transition that is evidenced by the two dimensional numerical model there is a nice agreement between the results of the two approaches at some distance from the initial discontinuity when the energy losses are negligible among the other results it has been mathematically demonstrated a somehow counterintuitive result namely that supercritical flow conditions at the outlet of the geometric transition can be obtained during rapid transients also in the case that the initial conditions are subcritical everywhere see the example riemann problem of table 2 row 4 in the same manner the existence of a special flow condition predicted by the mathematical model table 2 row 3 namely the presence of a standing hydraulic jump through the outlet of the geometric transition has been predicted these different results have been verified by means of two dimensional numerical modelling the examination of the simulations has demonstrated the need of introducing the head losses in the procedure where this is appropriate and this can be easily done by introducing a standing wave definition inferred from laboratory experiments or field activity also in this case the existence and the uniqueness of the riemann problem solution can be demonstrated if the corresponding l m and r m curves are monotone in general the flow conditions immediately to the left and to the right of the geometric discontinuity may be very different from the initial conditions and this contributes to explain the numerical issues that are reported in the literature for the rapid transients at internal boundary conditions in common saint venant finite difference models interestingly the graphical construction for the exact solution of the riemann problem can be easily coded as a numerical procedure based on an iterative solver such as the bisection method this approach supplies the numerical fluxes that are embedded into a finite volume numerical scheme for the solution of the one dimensional shallow water equations the comparison between the riemann problem exact solution and the numerical results demonstrate that the solution is nicely captured by the numerical scheme in all the cases in addition numerical oscillations or instability phenomena are absent and this guarantees against anomalous termination of programs acknowledgements the writers want to warmly thank the associate editor prof manes and the two anonymous

financial losses due to flooding under a 1 5 c warming scenario reflecting a projected climate in the year 2115 according to rcp2 6 and for a counterfactual current climate scenario where the climate has evolved without anthropogenic influence reflecting a climate corresponding to pre industrial conditions climate scenarios were generated with the community atmospheric model cam version 5 for each scenario we derive a set of weights that when applied to the current climate s precipitation results in a climatology that approximates that of the scenario we apply the weights to annual losses from a well calibrated to the current climate flood loss model that spans 50 000 years and re compute the average annual loss to assess the impact of precipitation changes induced by anthropogenic climate change the method relies on a large stochastic set of physically based flood model simulations and allows quick assessment of potential loss changes due to change in precipitation based on two statistics namely total precipitation and total precipitation of very wet days defined here as the total precipitation of days above the 95th percentile of daily precipitation we compute the statistics with the raw cam precipitation and bias corrected precipitation our results show that for both raw and bias corrected statistics i average flood loss in europe generally tend to increase in winter and decrease in summer for the future scenario and consistent with that change we also show that ii average flood losses have increased decreased for winter summer from pre industrial

winsemius et al 2016 changes in precipitation patterns and their extremes under global warming are expected to be one of the major drivers in future flood risk the impact of temperature changes on precipitation has been the subject of many scientific contributions over the last decade leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which a warmer atmosphere can lead to changes in the rainfall distribution pfahl et al 2017 o gorman and schneider 2009 allan 2011 haerter et al 2010 specifically pfahl et al 2017 have shown how the response of extreme rainfall in the presence of temperature changes shows strong spatial variability due to energy availability in the atmosphere although it is widely accepted that precipitation and its extremes are likely to increase in a warmer world the same is not true for flood frequency and magnitude several studies have explored long term river flow data sets in an attempt to identify potential climate change trends showing how the inhomogeneity of available time series human influence in shaping the streamflow distributions and statistical uncertainty do not allow a confident statement on present day trends in flood peak frequency and magnitude over time mangini et al 2018 hodgkins et al 2017 bloeschl et al 2017 therefore there is significant uncertainty on the potential impacts of climatic changes on the economic damages associated with flood risk and there is no consensus yet around the magnitude and spatial distribution of change of average annual loss an indicator of flood risk projections of future annual precipitation indicate wetting tendencies for scandinavia and central eastern europe and drying tendencies for the southern parts of europe maraun 2013 this pattern has been observed in records of winter extreme precipitation donat et al 2013 a strong increase in winter heavy precipitation defined as precipitation above the 99th percentile for months december to february over scandinavia and eastern europe has been reproduced with global climate models giorgi et al 2014 and regional climate models rajczak et al 2013 in southern parts of europe even though mean precipitation is projected to decrease heavy precipitation is projected to increase sillmann et al 2013 these studies generally quantify changes at relatively high levels of global warming 3 c and more at 1 5 and 2 c king and karoly 2017 showed increased intensity of extreme wet days day with highest one day precipitation total within the season in both summer and winter in contrast to a weaker signal for mean changes over most of the continent vautard et al 2014 also found robust increases in mean winter precipitation in northern europe with extreme precipitation increase over eastern europe and scandinavia in summer and over southern europe in winter dosio and fischer 2018 found that locally the change in mean precipitation due to further warming is not significant but is accompanied by a robust change in extreme precipitation climate change is expected to alter european flood risk and specifically average annual losses in various ways rojas et al 2013 conducted an ensemble based pan european flood hazard assessment for present and future conditions and found that with no adaptation to climate change the average annual loss by 2080 with 3 c global warming sres a1b emission scenario would be about 17 times greater than in the present with adaptation the increase would be ten fold in earlier studies kundzewicz et al 2010 showed projected annual losses for the countries in europe to be between 2 and 10 times greater by 2080 compared to 1970 again for the sres a1b scenario and ciscar et al 2011 found the increase in annual loss from river floods in europe more than doubles for the same period and employing similar scenarios in a recent study which considers natural correlation between events jongman et al 2014 found an almost five fold increase in annual loss by 2050 for a 3 c global warming whereas alfieri et al 2015 found for the same period an increase of 4 to 8 times for a 4 c global warming scenario more recently alfieri et al 2018 reported changes in annual loss for three warming levels 1 5 2 and 3 c and three independent studies to be roughly in a range between 2 and 4 times that of the present the latter three studies do not include the effect of future socio economic changes on population economy and land use so flood risk was estimated assuming present day exposure and vulnerability because flood risk is a non linear function of hazard exposure and vulnerability e g de moel et al 2015 relative changes in average annual loss including future adaptation measures and socio economic impacts due to climate change can vastly differ here we focus on average annual losses due to changes in precipitation while holding constant other hazard variables and not considering adaptation flood risk assessments at pan european scale under different degrees of warming typically rely on multi model ensembles encompassing several climate and hydrological models e g rojas et al 2012 alfieri et al 2015 gosling et al 2016 donnelly et al 2017 compared runoff discharge and snowpack in europe for climate change at 1 5 2 and 3 c global warming above pre industrial levels they employed five hydrological models forced with multi model ensembles of climate projections to calculate changes in hydrological indicators they found robust increases in runoff over the scandinavian mountains and robust decreases in portugal at 1 5 c with extents further increasing over norway poland the iberian coast the balkan coast and parts of the french coast at 3 c a robust increase of discharge with warming level was found only in scandinavia thober et al 2018 also assessed the impacts of climate change employing a multi model ensemble of three hydrological models forced by five coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 general circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 they found decreases for high flows and annual maxima in the mediterranean and eastern europe mostly related to decreases in total annual precipitation they also found increases in high flows in northern regions due to increasing precipitation but with annual maxima decreasing due to less snowmelt alfieri et al 2018 compared three studies of flood hazard and risk projections based on ensemble projections of expected damage and population affected at country level they found a substantial increase in flood risk over most of central and western europe at all warming levels in this study we do not attempt to simulate flood risk under climate change scenarios instead we employ annual losses from a fully calibrated flood model of the current climate and translate these losses to the future or counterfactual world by reweighting the annual losses this approach has differences relative to the studies cited above and other studies in this area one critical difference is that whereas many previous studies have relied on around 100 years of hazard simulation with extreme value theory used to extrapolate to longer return periods we have used a stochastic set of 50 000 years of flood events created using physically based simulations driven by a stochastic rainfall generator the objective of this study is to present a simple approach to assess potential changes in european flood risk due to relative changes in precipitation driven by climate change the proposed approach combines the potential change in flood risk from river and pluvial flooding due to relative changes in precipitation we apply this approach to assess the impact of relative changes in precipitation on european flood damages for two climate change scenarios produced with the community atmospheric model version 5 cam precipitation fields are obtained from ensembles generated with cam for two climate change scenarios scenarios include future global warming at 1 5 c above pre industrial conditions and a hypothetical present day counterfactual scenario where the climate has evolved without anthropogenic influence the flood risk response to changes in precipitation in calculated using the rms european flood model a monte carlo model for the simulation of flood risk in europe for the insurance market this model has been calibrated and validated in its hazard and damage components with the goal to reproduce economic and insured flood damages and is employed here to evaluate changes in these damages relative to current climate the model uses a probabilistic set of flood events to model flood risk and the approach adopted in this study involves the creation of an alternative probabilistic set by reweighting the stochastic model precipitation to mimic the precipitation statistics of the climate scenarios produced by the gcm note that only the effects of anthropogenically driven changes in precipitation are considered here neglecting past and possible future changes in other factors influencing the hazard exposure vulnerability and resilience this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methods including the model runs reweighting method stochastic precipitation loss tables and bias correction methodology section 3 describes the relative changes in two precipitation statistics for the scenarios using raw input and bias corrected input along with the loss changes section 4 discusses the results section 5 concludes 2 methods in the present work we assess the impact of climate change on flood risk by incorporating a climate change signal derived from state of the art climate model simulations section 2 1 into a european probabilistic flood loss model section 2 2 the coupling of the models is done by means of a methodology devised to apply the spatially variable climate change signal to the stochastic flood losses produced by the rms european flood model for the present climate section 2 3 given the large uncertainties involved in climate model outputs and in modelling the hydrologic response in a changing climate highlighted in the wide literature review discussed above this paper focuses on the impact of precipitation changes and applies these to a time series of modelled european flood losses this simplified approach allows us to represent the potential effect of changes in wetness condition over the continent which are reflected in the average annual loss i e the mean of the flood loss distribution 2 1 climate model runs simulations were carried out with cam version 5 3 neale et al 2010 a dynamical model of the atmosphere ran at approximately quarter degree spatial resolution wehner et al 2018 under the protocols of the half a degree additional warming prognosis and projected impacts happi experiment mitchell et al 2017 and of the c20c detection and attribution project note the model is listed as cam5 1 2 0 25degree under the archive portal for both projects see http portal nersc gov c20c the happi project was designed to provide model output data describing climate and weather changes under a stabilized 1 5 c level of global warming as compared to preindustrial conditions 1861 1880 cam was ran under three time slice experiments to generate five 10 year simulations for the present climate 2006 2015 and six simulations for the potential future climate under stabilized 1 5 c of global warming nominally 2106 15 we use daily resolution output in this paper present climate simulations include observed forcing conditions for sea surface temperatures ssts and sea ice cover each simulation differs from the others in the initial weather state and they are limited to 10 years in length to avoid long term trends dominating the variability the 2006 2015 runs use realistic observation based time varying conditions for all climate drivers during that time these drivers are atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations tropospheric aerosol concentrations atmospheric ozone concentrations solar luminosity ssts and sea ice cover ssts in the 1 5 c scenario of the future are prescribed by summation of the observed 2006 15 ssts and an offset estimated between decadal averages of the 2006 15 period and the projected warmer global conditions for the 2091 2100 period according to the response to the rcp2 6 in cmip5 model simulations which results in a global warming of approximately 1 5 c with sea ice concentration modified accordingly mitchell et al 2017 greenhouse gas aerosol and ozone concentrations are set according to rcp2 6 more implementation details can be found in mitchell et al 2017 and wehner et al 2018 an additional set of four 10 year simulations corresponds to the counterfactual historical scenario of the c20c detection and attribution project this pre industrial climate scenario represents hypothetical counterfactual time varying conditions for climate drivers during the 2006 2015 period whereby industrial anthropogenic emissions had not occurred over the course of history it is constructed by setting the present scenario greenhouses gases aerosols and ozone to pre industrial year 1855 values and adjusting ssts and sea ice accordingly the sst adjustment is based on the difference of temperatures from cmip5 climate models run with and without anthropogenic influence stone and pall 2019 here we will make use of the natural scenario simulations as well as those for present climate and future climate at 1 5 c global warming we will refer to these simulations as nat present and plus15 respectively modelled precipitation is bias corrected with respect to observations e obs haylock et al 2008 for the period 1961 2011 using quantile mapping specifically we adopt a non parametric approach termed quantile delta mapping cannon et al 2015 first future or natural climate model outputs are bias corrected to observations by quantile mapping second model projected relative changes in quantiles are superimposed on the bias corrected model outputs the method preserves model projected relative changes in quantiles while at the same time correcting systematic biases in quantiles of a modeled series with respect to observed values one of the reasons for discrepancy in flood risk assessments as pointed out by thober et al 2018 2 2 the rms european flood model the rms european inland flood model is a probabilistic high resolution flood catastrophe model that is widely used in the insurance industry to estimate flood risk for a given portfolio of insured exposures the model currently covers 15 countries austria belgium czech republic france germany hungary ireland italy liechtenstein luxembourg monaco poland slovakia switzerland and the united kingdom in this study we exclude the republic of ireland italy and northern ireland which were under development while doing this analysis and we also exclude liechtenstein luxemburg and monaco because of their small size relative to the model domain the model includes three main components a hazard module a damage module and a financial module the hazard module simulates precipitation driven flood risk and risk from major river flooding with a physically based approach the damage module relies on detailed building inventories and a comprehensive catalogue of damage functions to describe the vulnerability of buildings to flood risk the financial model quantifies the economic loss of exposure to flooding here we focus on the hazard module and the methodology used to simulate probabilistic flood risk maps from a stochastic rainfall simulation the flood hazard model relies on a continuous 50 000 year europe wide stochastic precipitation dataset which has been generated with a stochastic rainfall generator based on the main modes of variability of gridded precipitation data through principal component analysis bouvier et al 2003 westra et al 2007 observed gridded precipitation e obs haylock et al 2008 was available for the period 1961 2011 daily resolution at quarter degree spatial resolution while the other atmospheric variables relevant for runoff generation were obtained from the gldas dataset https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas for the same period 3 hourly resolution at one degree spatial resolution stochastic monthly rainfall fields obtained as a linear combination of stochastic principal components pcs and main modes of variability of the monthly rainfall anomalies eofs were subsequently disaggregated in space and time to 3 hourly 6 km resolution grids spatial disaggregation was performed through the scaling properties of standardized rainfall fluctuations with statistical scaling parameters related to elevation and convective available potential energy cape perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 temporal disaggregation is performed through a bootstrapping methodology the stochastic rainfall generator considers the relationship between rainfall and the state of the atmosphere by incorporating the correlation between the rainfall principal components and the north atlantic oscillation nao which is simulated in the stochastic model as an ar 1 process calibrated on monthly nao data in the available observation period data from national weather service http www cpc ncep noaa gov the modelling domain is subdivided into 8546 catchments based on standard catchment delineation routines metz et al 2011 catchment size varies between 50 and 500 km2 rainfall runoff processes are modelled with a semi distributed rainfall runoff approach based on topmodel beven and freer 2001 with a runoff generation module that accounts for evapotranspiration canopy interception snow accumulation and melting the hydrological model includes 15 parameters which are calibrated against observations for approximately 2000 gauges employing time series of up to 30 years in length minimum 10 years using a genetic algorithm to appropriately cover the parameter space deb et al 2002 we employ two cost functions in the optimization one for the overall bias and another for the discharge peaks after performance assessment we retain about 1400 gauges parameters are redistributed to upstream catchments when gauges are not available discharge at the outlet of the catchments is obtained through the muskingum cunge routing technique again we perform calibration of the routing model for the same gauges the model is therefore designed to capture the temporal evolution e g antecedent conditions and clustering of events and the spatial correlation of inland flood risk within and between countries we employ a 50 m resolution digital terrain model dtm for computing flood depths on major rivers as well as surface flooding induced by precipitation manning coefficients are obtained from land use land cover data https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover we compute fluvial and pluvial inundation maps for several return periods using the river discharge and surface runoff respectively inundation maps are obtained by solving the shallow water equations more details about model implementation and validation can be found in zanardo et al 2019 the time sequence of flood damages is obtained in the form of a monte carlo set of stochastic flood events resulting from the estimation of economic damages to buildings for a given portfolio of exposed assets the damage simulation is performed at the building level by leveraging the high resolution flood maps and a detailed model of the building stock and their vulnerabilities to a given level of flood depth the results of the monte carlo simulation are output to a year loss table ylt where each simulated year has a uniform probability of occurrence equal to the inverse of the length of the simulation the model contains an average of about 30 damage producing flood events per year over the 50 000 years of simulation many of these events affect multiple countries for example the uk has 4 2 events per year each event is identified with time and date duration and location we compute the annual loss by aggregating the loss of events occurring in each year the average annual loss normally referred as aal is obtained by computing the mean of the annual losses over the length of the simulation note that in this paper we distinguish between winter and summer losses in which case the annual loss is based on winter and summer events separately 2 3 reweighting method we present a method to derive a set of weights that when applied to a given statistic of the stochastic precipitation dataset produces a climatology that approximates the statistic of an imposed climate change scenario we then apply the weights to the ylt and re compute the aal to assess the loss change due to precipitation under climate change here we introduce the method in terms of yearly calculations whereas in the results section we will adopt a seasonal approach in which case the statistics and losses are computed separately for each season of each year we compute two statistics total precipitation in a year sum and the contribution of very wet days to the total precipitation r95ptot defined in this study as the sum of all days with precipitation greater than the 95th percentile of the daily precipitation in the following pcy is the stochastic precipitation statistic for catchment c and year y and pc is the reference climatological mean of the statistic for catchment c if the mean precipitation statistic varies linearly with time the expected value n years from the reference period is given by 1 p c 1 n k c with kc the annual rate of change in the statistic for catchment c we derive a set of annual weights ωy such that when the mean precipitation statistic is calculated using the weighted ωypcy the latter approximates the expected value given by the above equation the pc quantities are computed for each year in the stochastic precipitation dataset whereas the rate of change kc is computed as the long term of lumped climate model simulations the approach to obtain the weights involves two steps first for each year in the stochastic precipitation we calculate a climate change index λ y this index gives the year relative to the reference period for which the chosen climate change scenario most closely resembles a given year in the stochastic precipitation the reference period here is 1961 2011 and corresponds to the observation period over which measured rainfall data were available for the creation of the european flood hd model s stochastic precipitation set the minimization is performed across all catchments 2 c a c p c y 1 λ y k c p c σ c 2 where ac is the catchment area and σ c is the standard deviation of the precipitation statistic of catchment c we normalize with the standard deviation to avoid high precipitation catchments dominating the terms in the summation because λ y does not depend on c the value that minimizes the expression can be found analytically and is given by 3 λ y c a c k c p c p c y p c σ c 2 c a c k c 2 p c 2 σ c 2 second we find the weights ωy that minimize the following expression 4 c a c 1 n y y 1 n y ω y p c y 1 n k c p c σ c 2 where ny is the number of years or individual seasons in the stochastic precipitation we use the climate change index λ y to inform the weight function ωy the expression above is optimized numerically to allow for weight functions of different types here we employ a two parameter function such that ω y 1 λ y α1 for positive λ y and ω y 1 λ y α2 for negative λ y with α1 and α2 two positive scalars the two parameter function allows for different weights in the two regions of the frequency domain above and below unity this means that weighting towards drier years can have a different scale coefficient than weighting towards wetter years 3 results to compare results between the different climate scenarios simulations within the respective ensembles are first concatenated this results in 50 year time series in the case of the future to present comparison 5 simulations of 10 years each for plus15 and present and 40 year time series in the case of the natural to present comparison 4 simulations of 10 years each for nat and present we compute all quantities for winter djf and summer jja seasons 3 1 mean seasonal precipitation when compared with e obs precipitation the cam generally tends to overestimate precipitation in winter months and underestimate precipitation in summer months fig 1 the winter bias can be seen mainly in mountainous areas barcikowska et al 2018 argues that these differences can be due to both model and observational biases because observations are less representative in orographic conditions and because topography is too smooth in the comparatively lower resolution model however the general large scale wet bias particularly over western europe could also be indicative of stronger zonal winds in the model suggesting more storminess and moisture brought particularly into the uk benelux and germany the summer bias may be explained by insufficient resolution in the model to capture heavy convective storms particularly in inland and mountainous regions at 1 5 c global warming winter precipitation in the model is generally greater throughout europe compared to the present summer precipitation shows slightly wetter conditions in eastern europe and drier in northern europe these results agree with a consensus towards wetter winters in most parts of europe e g dosio and fischer 2018 the natural to present comparison mostly shows wetter conditions in winter and drier in summer which is akin to the future to present comparison since in the present the climate is generally warmer than in the pre industrial scenario 3 2 relative changes in precipitation statistics relative changes are computed with respect to present climate simulations fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the relative changes of the two winter statistics for the two climate change scenarios the plus15 scenario generally shows positive changes throughout europe and changes with the largest magnitudes of the two scenarios the nat scenario shows mostly negative changes for eastern europe and some small areas with positive changes in western europe particularly for r95ptot each scenario shows a smooth spatial pattern for the total precipitation and a slight increase in patchiness and spikiness for the total precipitation from very wet days this could be attributed to sampling uncertainty because given the same amount of underlying data extreme metrics are less well sampled than the total additionally since patchiness is concentrated toward southern europe we hypothesize that there may be an increased influence of convective cells producing patchy extreme precipitation embedded within large scale southerly flow due to a warmer mediterranean under climate warming in general patterns are spatially coherent for the different statistics and do not change sign however magnitudes generally tend to decrease when looking at the more extreme statistics fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the relative changes of the two summer statistics for the two climate change scenarios gray areas indicate areas with too few rainy days to compute a meaningful change relative changes can easily be greater than 100 because summer precipitation is generally noisier than winter precipitation we have capped these to avoid extending the limits in the color bar plots summer spatial patterns are noisier with positive and negative relative changes concentrated within relatively small regions like winter spatial patterns are generally coherent when looking at the different statistics the 1 5 c scenario generally shows a tendency for drier conditions in northern europe and parts of italy whereas both statistics seem to agree on wetter conditions over southern and eastern europe these results as discussed in the introduction are not in full agreement with previously published results reasons for discrepancy could have to do with scenario design and model resolution in terms of scenario design most of the studies mentioned in the introduction concern about 1 co2 per year emissions scenarios where co2 increases dominate any aerosol changes the plus15 scenario exhibits an aggressive co2 ramp down and aerosol ramp down where the effects of any aerosol ramp down rival that of any further co2 increase the nat scenario also shows drier conditions over northern europe and wetter conditions over eastern europe france and parts of the uk we bias correct the cam simulations by preserving the relative change in precipitation quantiles of modelled precipitation i e trend in modelled projections see fig 4 the bias correction is performed for winter and for summer separately and for days with precipitation greater than 1 mm day fig 5 shows spatial plots of the mean seasonal precipitation difference between scenarios after bias correction spatial patterns are comparable to those before bias correction and differences between scenarios tend to be smaller some areas of high precipitation in plus15 e g france particularly for winter are missing after bias correction summer changes for plus15 indicate drier conditions in gb and benelux winter spatial patterns in the relative change of both statistics after bias correction fig 6 are very similar to the ones computed with the raw precipitation in the summer fig 7 spatial patterns before and after bias correction also compare well 3 3 relative changes in average annual loss in what follows we present the nat scenario multiplied by minus one so that both plus15 and nat scenarios appear with the same sign in the plot we have also changed the legend to indicate changes are in the opposite direction fig 8 shows the relative change in winter aal obtained with the raw and bias corrected bc winter precipitation statistics and both climate change scenarios for the eufl domain and split by country the plus15 scenario results in a positive loss change with both statistics r95ptot generally yields a lower magnitude which is a direct consequence of the smaller relative change of r95ptot compared to the total precipitation fig 6 the nat scenario shows reduced magnitudes in the relative change of the aal by country and for the entire domain when compared to the plus15 scenario this is because the relative changes of both statistics in the nat scenario are smaller than in the plus15 scenario discrepancies in aal change arising from both statistics are minor in the nat scenario generally showing a slightly higher magnitude with r95ptot summer changes in aal fig 7 generally show an opposing trend for the two climate change scenarios except for france in the plus15 scenario that shows a positive trend with the bias corrected total precipitation magnitudes of the summer aal change in the plus15 scenario can be compared with winter however summer aal changes are generally more sensitive to r95ptot than in winter showing greater changes in aal the nat scenario shows greater magnitudes of loss change when compared to winter these observations stem from the fact that in general winter changes are spatially smooth compared to summer changes figs 6 and 7 for summer we observe positive and negative changes within the domain and even within countries furthermore summer changes in statistics show greater magnitudes and more patchy features it is important to note that for winter differences between sum and r95ptot are less prominent than for summer fig 9 4 discussion the method we have presented assumes that the precipitation statistic varies linearly in time this approximation is likely to be more accurate over short periods of time but less accurate over longer periods of time where nonlinearity may become important this may limit the applicability of the method although this limitation could be circumvented by computing the changes in aal by splitting the timeline into two or more parts for instance the 2 c global warming plus20 simulations of the happi project display such non linear behaviour barcikowska et al 2018 li et al 2018 in our example one could first compute the changes from present to plus15 then apply the weights to present conditions to obtain a stochastic precipitation for plus15 climate and finally compute the changes from plus15 to plus20 our methodology only assesses the impact of changes in precipitation on flood losses however changes in other climatological drivers are likely to also have an impact kay et al 2011 schaller et al 2016 including via feedback mechanisms that are unaccounted for in our method e g increasing mean temperatures leading to increasing evapotranspiration however because precipitation acts as a first order control on flood losses we believe the approximations made in this paper still provide useful insights we have restricted attention to changes in the average annual loss since changes in the tail of the distribution of losses are likely to be less well estimated the approximations in this study can be compared with approximations made in other similar studies assessments of climate change on flood risk can be very uncertain for many reasons such as climate model choice deser et al 2012 downscaling and bias correction procedures hydrological model choice and parameter estimation donnely et al 2017 alfieri et al 2018 concluded that uncertainty from climate projections is the main driver of uncertainty when assessing future flood risk under global warming because the model error due to the flood component of the model is smaller than the differences due to alternative climate change scenarios another source of uncertainty arises when only a small number of years of flooding are simulated many studies of future flood risk based on climate models output have been limited to simulations of no more than 100 years because flood loss time series have a large natural variability the estimation of an aal based on such a short record of annualised losses introduces considerable sampling error a strength of the approach described here is that we use 50 000 years of simulated flood losses perhaps ideally one would combine our approach with a climate model driven approach to take advantage of the benefits of both approaches however this would involve creating much larger climate model ensemble and rerunning the calculations that generate the stochastic set the aal estimates presented above do not consider the effects of adaptation and other indirect socio economic impacts and are based only on the potential change in the flood hazard while holding other factors constant population projections suggest that eu population has a mild decreasing trend un report 2017 jongman et al 2012 suggest a constant or decreasing exposed population but an increase in exposed assets consideration of these aspects would certainly be important for a complete view of future flood risk since it has been argued that the observed increase in flood damage in many regions of the world is dominated by exposure increase rather than changes in hazard e g bouwer 2011 in addition to changes in exposure other more subtle socio economics factors can also play a role in determining flood risk in a recent study on paired flood events kreibich et al 2017 showed that the lower damage caused by a second event was mainly due to significant reductions in vulnerability via raised risk awareness preparedness and improvements of organizational emergency management to gain some insight into the impact that adaptation might have on the results we conducted a sensitivity analysis into the effect of raising defences based on current adaptation literature e g alfieri et al 2016 we find that the aal for winter and summer together is reduced by about 2 12 and 20 for an increase in the defence return period standard of protection of 5 25 and 50 respectively these changes are comparable to the changes in aal that we estimate due to climate change alone more complex adaptation scenarios in which standards of protection change at different rates in different locations could also easily be assessed under the proposed evaluation setup 5 conclusions climate change threatens to increase the frequency and magnitude of high precipitation events with a likely impact on flood risk this has the potential to lead to year on year increase in the cost of flood insurance in this contribution we assess the potential impact of climate change on average annual loss aal due to floods we consider two climate change scenarios one corresponding to a 1 5 c global warming above pre industrial level and one corresponding to a pre industrial world where climate has evolved without anthropogenic effects we introduce a framework to reweight current precipitation patterns such that the resulting climatology matches with either the future or the pre industrial precipitation climatology climatology is understood here as the long term mean of any precipitation statistic in our case the total precipitation and the total precipitation of wet days for raw and bias corrected climate model simulations the weights were determined by minimization of the squared root differences in precipitation metrics at catchment level and apply to the entire model domain and for each simulated year we employed the weights to scale the annual loss of events simulated with an in house european flood hd model based on a 50 000 year stochastic simulation before weighting this model was calibrated to current climate the weighting allows us to adjust the model to represent our two climate change scenarios without having to rerun the stochastic simulations this allows us to assess the impacts of climate change on flood losses the resulting aal estimates vary with scenario and precipitation statistic used with magnitudes typically within 5 per decade for winter and 10 per decade for summer aal for the future scenario generally tends to increase in winter and decrease in summer although the summer results were sensitive to the choice of precipitation statistic used and so are uncertain for the pre industrial scenario flood losses in winter are lower than for current day conditions and for summer they are larger the magnitudes of change are comparable to the magnitude of change between current day losses and those for the future scenario these results are consistent for both raw and bias corrected precipitation statistics finally our results show that adaptation measures included as updates to the current standard of protection of the flood defences could potentially play a significant role in reducing climate change impacts on european flood risk acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the

634,climate change is expected to alter european floods and associated economic losses in various ways here we investigate the impact of precipitation change on european average winter and summer financial losses due to flooding under a 1 5 c warming scenario reflecting a projected climate in the year 2115 according to rcp2 6 and for a counterfactual current climate scenario where the climate has evolved without anthropogenic influence reflecting a climate corresponding to pre industrial conditions climate scenarios were generated with the community atmospheric model cam version 5 for each scenario we derive a set of weights that when applied to the current climate s precipitation results in a climatology that approximates that of the scenario we apply the weights to annual losses from a well calibrated to the current climate flood loss model that spans 50 000 years and re compute the average annual loss to assess the impact of precipitation changes induced by anthropogenic climate change the method relies on a large stochastic set of physically based flood model simulations and allows quick assessment of potential loss changes due to change in precipitation based on two statistics namely total precipitation and total precipitation of very wet days defined here as the total precipitation of days above the 95th percentile of daily precipitation we compute the statistics with the raw cam precipitation and bias corrected precipitation our results show that for both raw and bias corrected statistics i average flood loss in europe generally tend to increase in winter and decrease in summer for the future scenario and consistent with that change we also show that ii average flood losses have increased decreased for winter summer from pre industrial conditions to the current day the magnitude of the change varies among scenarios and statistics chosen keywords climate change paris agreement flood risk economic loss anthropogenic climate change stochastic precipitation average flood loss rcp2 6 1 introduction inland flooding in europe and worldwide affects the life of millions and causes large economic losses guha sapir et al 2017 the number of severe flood events in europe has increased over the last 35 years and more than 1500 flood events have been registered in europe since 1980 half of which occurred after the year 2000 eea 2017 in the future this trend is expected to continue because of changes in land use socio economic factors and the potential impacts of climatic changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions winsemius et al 2016 changes in precipitation patterns and their extremes under global warming are expected to be one of the major drivers in future flood risk the impact of temperature changes on precipitation has been the subject of many scientific contributions over the last decade leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which a warmer atmosphere can lead to changes in the rainfall distribution pfahl et al 2017 o gorman and schneider 2009 allan 2011 haerter et al 2010 specifically pfahl et al 2017 have shown how the response of extreme rainfall in the presence of temperature changes shows strong spatial variability due to energy availability in the atmosphere although it is widely accepted that precipitation and its extremes are likely to increase in a warmer world the same is not true for flood frequency and magnitude several studies have explored long term river flow data sets in an attempt to identify potential climate change trends showing how the inhomogeneity of available time series human influence in shaping the streamflow distributions and statistical uncertainty do not allow a confident statement on present day trends in flood peak frequency and magnitude over time mangini et al 2018 hodgkins et al 2017 bloeschl et al 2017 therefore there is significant uncertainty on the potential impacts of climatic changes on the economic damages associated with flood risk and there is no consensus yet around the magnitude and spatial distribution of change of average annual loss an indicator of flood risk projections of future annual precipitation indicate wetting tendencies for scandinavia and central eastern europe and drying tendencies for the southern parts of europe maraun 2013 this pattern has been observed in records of winter extreme precipitation donat et al 2013 a strong increase in winter heavy precipitation defined as precipitation above the 99th percentile for months december to february over scandinavia and eastern europe has been reproduced with global climate models giorgi et al 2014 and regional climate models rajczak et al 2013 in southern parts of europe even though mean precipitation is projected to decrease heavy precipitation is projected to increase sillmann et al 2013 these studies generally quantify changes at relatively high levels of global warming 3 c and more at 1 5 and 2 c king and karoly 2017 showed increased intensity of extreme wet days day with highest one day precipitation total within the season in both summer and winter in contrast to a weaker signal for mean changes over most of the continent vautard et al 2014 also found robust increases in mean winter precipitation in northern europe with extreme precipitation increase over eastern europe and scandinavia in summer and over southern europe in winter dosio and fischer 2018 found that locally the change in mean precipitation due to further warming is not significant but is accompanied by a robust change in extreme precipitation climate change is expected to alter european flood risk and specifically average annual losses in various ways rojas et al 2013 conducted an ensemble based pan european flood hazard assessment for present and future conditions and found that with no adaptation to climate change the average annual loss by 2080 with 3 c global warming sres a1b emission scenario would be about 17 times greater than in the present with adaptation the increase would be ten fold in earlier studies kundzewicz et al 2010 showed projected annual losses for the countries in europe to be between 2 and 10 times greater by 2080 compared to 1970 again for the sres a1b scenario and ciscar et al 2011 found the increase in annual loss from river floods in europe more than doubles for the same period and employing similar scenarios in a recent study which considers natural correlation between events jongman et al 2014 found an almost five fold increase in annual loss by 2050 for a 3 c global warming whereas alfieri et al 2015 found for the same period an increase of 4 to 8 times for a 4 c global warming scenario more recently alfieri et al 2018 reported changes in annual loss for three warming levels 1 5 2 and 3 c and three independent studies to be roughly in a range between 2 and 4 times that of the present the latter three studies do not include the effect of future socio economic changes on population economy and land use so flood risk was estimated assuming present day exposure and vulnerability because flood risk is a non linear function of hazard exposure and vulnerability e g de moel et al 2015 relative changes in average annual loss including future adaptation measures and socio economic impacts due to climate change can vastly differ here we focus on average annual losses due to changes in precipitation while holding constant other hazard variables and not considering adaptation flood risk assessments at pan european scale under different degrees of warming typically rely on multi model ensembles encompassing several climate and hydrological models e g rojas et al 2012 alfieri et al 2015 gosling et al 2016 donnelly et al 2017 compared runoff discharge and snowpack in europe for climate change at 1 5 2 and 3 c global warming above pre industrial levels they employed five hydrological models forced with multi model ensembles of climate projections to calculate changes in hydrological indicators they found robust increases in runoff over the scandinavian mountains and robust decreases in portugal at 1 5 c with extents further increasing over norway poland the iberian coast the balkan coast and parts of the french coast at 3 c a robust increase of discharge with warming level was found only in scandinavia thober et al 2018 also assessed the impacts of climate change employing a multi model ensemble of three hydrological models forced by five coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 general circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 they found decreases for high flows and annual maxima in the mediterranean and eastern europe mostly related to decreases in total annual precipitation they also found increases in high flows in northern regions due to increasing precipitation but with annual maxima decreasing due to less snowmelt alfieri et al 2018 compared three studies of flood hazard and risk projections based on ensemble projections of expected damage and population affected at country level they found a substantial increase in flood risk over most of central and western europe at all warming levels in this study we do not attempt to simulate flood risk under climate change scenarios instead we employ annual losses from a fully calibrated flood model of the current climate and translate these losses to the future or counterfactual world by reweighting the annual losses this approach has differences relative to the studies cited above and other studies in this area one critical difference is that whereas many previous studies have relied on around 100 years of hazard simulation with extreme value theory used to extrapolate to longer return periods we have used a stochastic set of 50 000 years of flood events created using physically based simulations driven by a stochastic rainfall generator the objective of this study is to present a simple approach to assess potential changes in european flood risk due to relative changes in precipitation driven by climate change the proposed approach combines the potential change in flood risk from river and pluvial flooding due to relative changes in precipitation we apply this approach to assess the impact of relative changes in precipitation on european flood damages for two climate change scenarios produced with the community atmospheric model version 5 cam precipitation fields are obtained from ensembles generated with cam for two climate change scenarios scenarios include future global warming at 1 5 c above pre industrial conditions and a hypothetical present day counterfactual scenario where the climate has evolved without anthropogenic influence the flood risk response to changes in precipitation in calculated using the rms european flood model a monte carlo model for the simulation of flood risk in europe for the insurance market this model has been calibrated and validated in its hazard and damage components with the goal to reproduce economic and insured flood damages and is employed here to evaluate changes in these damages relative to current climate the model uses a probabilistic set of flood events to model flood risk and the approach adopted in this study involves the creation of an alternative probabilistic set by reweighting the stochastic model precipitation to mimic the precipitation statistics of the climate scenarios produced by the gcm note that only the effects of anthropogenically driven changes in precipitation are considered here neglecting past and possible future changes in other factors influencing the hazard exposure vulnerability and resilience this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methods including the model runs reweighting method stochastic precipitation loss tables and bias correction methodology section 3 describes the relative changes in two precipitation statistics for the scenarios using raw input and bias corrected input along with the loss changes section 4 discusses the results section 5 concludes 2 methods in the present work we assess the impact of climate change on flood risk by incorporating a climate change signal derived from state of the art climate model simulations section 2 1 into a european probabilistic flood loss model section 2 2 the coupling of the models is done by means of a methodology devised to apply the spatially variable climate change signal to the stochastic flood losses produced by the rms european flood model for the present climate section 2 3 given the large uncertainties involved in climate model outputs and in modelling the hydrologic response in a changing climate highlighted in the wide literature review discussed above this paper focuses on the impact of precipitation changes and applies these to a time series of modelled european flood losses this simplified approach allows us to represent the potential effect of changes in wetness condition over the continent which are reflected in the average annual loss i e the mean of the flood loss distribution 2 1 climate model runs simulations were carried out with cam version 5 3 neale et al 2010 a dynamical model of the atmosphere ran at approximately quarter degree spatial resolution wehner et al 2018 under the protocols of the half a degree additional warming prognosis and projected impacts happi experiment mitchell et al 2017 and of the c20c detection and attribution project note the model is listed as cam5 1 2 0 25degree under the archive portal for both projects see http portal nersc gov c20c the happi project was designed to provide model output data describing climate and weather changes under a stabilized 1 5 c level of global warming as compared to preindustrial conditions 1861 1880 cam was ran under three time slice experiments to generate five 10 year simulations for the present climate 2006 2015 and six simulations for the potential future climate under stabilized 1 5 c of global warming nominally 2106 15 we use daily resolution output in this paper present climate simulations include observed forcing conditions for sea surface temperatures ssts and sea ice cover each simulation differs from the others in the initial weather state and they are limited to 10 years in length to avoid long term trends dominating the variability the 2006 2015 runs use realistic observation based time varying conditions for all climate drivers during that time these drivers are atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations tropospheric aerosol concentrations atmospheric ozone concentrations solar luminosity ssts and sea ice cover ssts in the 1 5 c scenario of the future are prescribed by summation of the observed 2006 15 ssts and an offset estimated between decadal averages of the 2006 15 period and the projected warmer global conditions for the 2091 2100 period according to the response to the rcp2 6 in cmip5 model simulations which results in a global warming of approximately 1 5 c with sea ice concentration modified accordingly mitchell et al 2017 greenhouse gas aerosol and ozone concentrations are set according to rcp2 6 more implementation details can be found in mitchell et al 2017 and wehner et al 2018 an additional set of four 10 year simulations corresponds to the counterfactual historical scenario of the c20c detection and attribution project this pre industrial climate scenario represents hypothetical counterfactual time varying conditions for climate drivers during the 2006 2015 period whereby industrial anthropogenic emissions had not occurred over the course of history it is constructed by setting the present scenario greenhouses gases aerosols and ozone to pre industrial year 1855 values and adjusting ssts and sea ice accordingly the sst adjustment is based on the difference of temperatures from cmip5 climate models run with and without anthropogenic influence stone and pall 2019 here we will make use of the natural scenario simulations as well as those for present climate and future climate at 1 5 c global warming we will refer to these simulations as nat present and plus15 respectively modelled precipitation is bias corrected with respect to observations e obs haylock et al 2008 for the period 1961 2011 using quantile mapping specifically we adopt a non parametric approach termed quantile delta mapping cannon et al 2015 first future or natural climate model outputs are bias corrected to observations by quantile mapping second model projected relative changes in quantiles are superimposed on the bias corrected model outputs the method preserves model projected relative changes in quantiles while at the same time correcting systematic biases in quantiles of a modeled series with respect to observed values one of the reasons for discrepancy in flood risk assessments as pointed out by thober et al 2018 2 2 the rms european flood model the rms european inland flood model is a probabilistic high resolution flood catastrophe model that is widely used in the insurance industry to estimate flood risk for a given portfolio of insured exposures the model currently covers 15 countries austria belgium czech republic france germany hungary ireland italy liechtenstein luxembourg monaco poland slovakia switzerland and the united kingdom in this study we exclude the republic of ireland italy and northern ireland which were under development while doing this analysis and we also exclude liechtenstein luxemburg and monaco because of their small size relative to the model domain the model includes three main components a hazard module a damage module and a financial module the hazard module simulates precipitation driven flood risk and risk from major river flooding with a physically based approach the damage module relies on detailed building inventories and a comprehensive catalogue of damage functions to describe the vulnerability of buildings to flood risk the financial model quantifies the economic loss of exposure to flooding here we focus on the hazard module and the methodology used to simulate probabilistic flood risk maps from a stochastic rainfall simulation the flood hazard model relies on a continuous 50 000 year europe wide stochastic precipitation dataset which has been generated with a stochastic rainfall generator based on the main modes of variability of gridded precipitation data through principal component analysis bouvier et al 2003 westra et al 2007 observed gridded precipitation e obs haylock et al 2008 was available for the period 1961 2011 daily resolution at quarter degree spatial resolution while the other atmospheric variables relevant for runoff generation were obtained from the gldas dataset https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas for the same period 3 hourly resolution at one degree spatial resolution stochastic monthly rainfall fields obtained as a linear combination of stochastic principal components pcs and main modes of variability of the monthly rainfall anomalies eofs were subsequently disaggregated in space and time to 3 hourly 6 km resolution grids spatial disaggregation was performed through the scaling properties of standardized rainfall fluctuations with statistical scaling parameters related to elevation and convective available potential energy cape perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 temporal disaggregation is performed through a bootstrapping methodology the stochastic rainfall generator considers the relationship between rainfall and the state of the atmosphere by incorporating the correlation between the rainfall principal components and the north atlantic oscillation nao which is simulated in the stochastic model as an ar 1 process calibrated on monthly nao data in the available observation period data from national weather service http www cpc ncep noaa gov the modelling domain is subdivided into 8546 catchments based on standard catchment delineation routines metz et al 2011 catchment size varies between 50 and 500 km2 rainfall runoff processes are modelled with a semi distributed rainfall runoff approach based on topmodel beven and freer 2001 with a runoff generation module that accounts for evapotranspiration canopy interception snow accumulation and melting the hydrological model includes 15 parameters which are calibrated against observations for approximately 2000 gauges employing time series of up to 30 years in length minimum 10 years using a genetic algorithm to appropriately cover the parameter space deb et al 2002 we employ two cost functions in the optimization one for the overall bias and another for the discharge peaks after performance assessment we retain about 1400 gauges parameters are redistributed to upstream catchments when gauges are not available discharge at the outlet of the catchments is obtained through the muskingum cunge routing technique again we perform calibration of the routing model for the same gauges the model is therefore designed to capture the temporal evolution e g antecedent conditions and clustering of events and the spatial correlation of inland flood risk within and between countries we employ a 50 m resolution digital terrain model dtm for computing flood depths on major rivers as well as surface flooding induced by precipitation manning coefficients are obtained from land use land cover data https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover we compute fluvial and pluvial inundation maps for several return periods using the river discharge and surface runoff respectively inundation maps are obtained by solving the shallow water equations more details about model implementation and validation can be found in zanardo et al 2019 the time sequence of flood damages is obtained in the form of a monte carlo set of stochastic flood events resulting from the estimation of economic damages to buildings for a given portfolio of exposed assets the damage simulation is performed at the building level by leveraging the high resolution flood maps and a detailed model of the building stock and their vulnerabilities to a given level of flood depth the results of the monte carlo simulation are output to a year loss table ylt where each simulated year has a uniform probability of occurrence equal to the inverse of the length of the simulation the model contains an average of about 30 damage producing flood events per year over the 50 000 years of simulation many of these events affect multiple countries for example the uk has 4 2 events per year each event is identified with time and date duration and location we compute the annual loss by aggregating the loss of events occurring in each year the average annual loss normally referred as aal is obtained by computing the mean of the annual losses over the length of the simulation note that in this paper we distinguish between winter and summer losses in which case the annual loss is based on winter and summer events separately 2 3 reweighting method we present a method to derive a set of weights that when applied to a given statistic of the stochastic precipitation dataset produces a climatology that approximates the statistic of an imposed climate change scenario we then apply the weights to the ylt and re compute the aal to assess the loss change due to precipitation under climate change here we introduce the method in terms of yearly calculations whereas in the results section we will adopt a seasonal approach in which case the statistics and losses are computed separately for each season of each year we compute two statistics total precipitation in a year sum and the contribution of very wet days to the total precipitation r95ptot defined in this study as the sum of all days with precipitation greater than the 95th percentile of the daily precipitation in the following pcy is the stochastic precipitation statistic for catchment c and year y and pc is the reference climatological mean of the statistic for catchment c if the mean precipitation statistic varies linearly with time the expected value n years from the reference period is given by 1 p c 1 n k c with kc the annual rate of change in the statistic for catchment c we derive a set of annual weights ωy such that when the mean precipitation statistic is calculated using the weighted ωypcy the latter approximates the expected value given by the above equation the pc quantities are computed for each year in the stochastic precipitation dataset whereas the rate of change kc is computed as the long term of lumped climate model simulations the approach to obtain the weights involves two steps first for each year in the stochastic precipitation we calculate a climate change index λ y this index gives the year relative to the reference period for which the chosen climate change scenario most closely resembles a given year in the stochastic precipitation the reference period here is 1961 2011 and corresponds to the observation period over which measured rainfall data were available for the creation of the european flood hd model s stochastic precipitation set the minimization is performed across all catchments 2 c a c p c y 1 λ y k c p c σ c 2 where ac is the catchment area and σ c is the standard deviation of the precipitation statistic of catchment c we normalize with the standard deviation to avoid high precipitation catchments dominating the terms in the summation because λ y does not depend on c the value that minimizes the expression can be found analytically and is given by 3 λ y c a c k c p c p c y p c σ c 2 c a c k c 2 p c 2 σ c 2 second we find the weights ωy that minimize the following expression 4 c a c 1 n y y 1 n y ω y p c y 1 n k c p c σ c 2 where ny is the number of years or individual seasons in the stochastic precipitation we use the climate change index λ y to inform the weight function ωy the expression above is optimized numerically to allow for weight functions of different types here we employ a two parameter function such that ω y 1 λ y α1 for positive λ y and ω y 1 λ y α2 for negative λ y with α1 and α2 two positive scalars the two parameter function allows for different weights in the two regions of the frequency domain above and below unity this means that weighting towards drier years can have a different scale coefficient than weighting towards wetter years 3 results to compare results between the different climate scenarios simulations within the respective ensembles are first concatenated this results in 50 year time series in the case of the future to present comparison 5 simulations of 10 years each for plus15 and present and 40 year time series in the case of the natural to present comparison 4 simulations of 10 years each for nat and present we compute all quantities for winter djf and summer jja seasons 3 1 mean seasonal precipitation when compared with e obs precipitation the cam generally tends to overestimate precipitation in winter months and underestimate precipitation in summer months fig 1 the winter bias can be seen mainly in mountainous areas barcikowska et al 2018 argues that these differences can be due to both model and observational biases because observations are less representative in orographic conditions and because topography is too smooth in the comparatively lower resolution model however the general large scale wet bias particularly over western europe could also be indicative of stronger zonal winds in the model suggesting more storminess and moisture brought particularly into the uk benelux and germany the summer bias may be explained by insufficient resolution in the model to capture heavy convective storms particularly in inland and mountainous regions at 1 5 c global warming winter precipitation in the model is generally greater throughout europe compared to the present summer precipitation shows slightly wetter conditions in eastern europe and drier in northern europe these results agree with a consensus towards wetter winters in most parts of europe e g dosio and fischer 2018 the natural to present comparison mostly shows wetter conditions in winter and drier in summer which is akin to the future to present comparison since in the present the climate is generally warmer than in the pre industrial scenario 3 2 relative changes in precipitation statistics relative changes are computed with respect to present climate simulations fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the relative changes of the two winter statistics for the two climate change scenarios the plus15 scenario generally shows positive changes throughout europe and changes with the largest magnitudes of the two scenarios the nat scenario shows mostly negative changes for eastern europe and some small areas with positive changes in western europe particularly for r95ptot each scenario shows a smooth spatial pattern for the total precipitation and a slight increase in patchiness and spikiness for the total precipitation from very wet days this could be attributed to sampling uncertainty because given the same amount of underlying data extreme metrics are less well sampled than the total additionally since patchiness is concentrated toward southern europe we hypothesize that there may be an increased influence of convective cells producing patchy extreme precipitation embedded within large scale southerly flow due to a warmer mediterranean under climate warming in general patterns are spatially coherent for the different statistics and do not change sign however magnitudes generally tend to decrease when looking at the more extreme statistics fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the relative changes of the two summer statistics for the two climate change scenarios gray areas indicate areas with too few rainy days to compute a meaningful change relative changes can easily be greater than 100 because summer precipitation is generally noisier than winter precipitation we have capped these to avoid extending the limits in the color bar plots summer spatial patterns are noisier with positive and negative relative changes concentrated within relatively small regions like winter spatial patterns are generally coherent when looking at the different statistics the 1 5 c scenario generally shows a tendency for drier conditions in northern europe and parts of italy whereas both statistics seem to agree on wetter conditions over southern and eastern europe these results as discussed in the introduction are not in full agreement with previously published results reasons for discrepancy could have to do with scenario design and model resolution in terms of scenario design most of the studies mentioned in the introduction concern about 1 co2 per year emissions scenarios where co2 increases dominate any aerosol changes the plus15 scenario exhibits an aggressive co2 ramp down and aerosol ramp down where the effects of any aerosol ramp down rival that of any further co2 increase the nat scenario also shows drier conditions over northern europe and wetter conditions over eastern europe france and parts of the uk we bias correct the cam simulations by preserving the relative change in precipitation quantiles of modelled precipitation i e trend in modelled projections see fig 4 the bias correction is performed for winter and for summer separately and for days with precipitation greater than 1 mm day fig 5 shows spatial plots of the mean seasonal precipitation difference between scenarios after bias correction spatial patterns are comparable to those before bias correction and differences between scenarios tend to be smaller some areas of high precipitation in plus15 e g france particularly for winter are missing after bias correction summer changes for plus15 indicate drier conditions in gb and benelux winter spatial patterns in the relative change of both statistics after bias correction fig 6 are very similar to the ones computed with the raw precipitation in the summer fig 7 spatial patterns before and after bias correction also compare well 3 3 relative changes in average annual loss in what follows we present the nat scenario multiplied by minus one so that both plus15 and nat scenarios appear with the same sign in the plot we have also changed the legend to indicate changes are in the opposite direction fig 8 shows the relative change in winter aal obtained with the raw and bias corrected bc winter precipitation statistics and both climate change scenarios for the eufl domain and split by country the plus15 scenario results in a positive loss change with both statistics r95ptot generally yields a lower magnitude which is a direct consequence of the smaller relative change of r95ptot compared to the total precipitation fig 6 the nat scenario shows reduced magnitudes in the relative change of the aal by country and for the entire domain when compared to the plus15 scenario this is because the relative changes of both statistics in the nat scenario are smaller than in the plus15 scenario discrepancies in aal change arising from both statistics are minor in the nat scenario generally showing a slightly higher magnitude with r95ptot summer changes in aal fig 7 generally show an opposing trend for the two climate change scenarios except for france in the plus15 scenario that shows a positive trend with the bias corrected total precipitation magnitudes of the summer aal change in the plus15 scenario can be compared with winter however summer aal changes are generally more sensitive to r95ptot than in winter showing greater changes in aal the nat scenario shows greater magnitudes of loss change when compared to winter these observations stem from the fact that in general winter changes are spatially smooth compared to summer changes figs 6 and 7 for summer we observe positive and negative changes within the domain and even within countries furthermore summer changes in statistics show greater magnitudes and more patchy features it is important to note that for winter differences between sum and r95ptot are less prominent than for summer fig 9 4 discussion the method we have presented assumes that the precipitation statistic varies linearly in time this approximation is likely to be more accurate over short periods of time but less accurate over longer periods of time where nonlinearity may become important this may limit the applicability of the method although this limitation could be circumvented by computing the changes in aal by splitting the timeline into two or more parts for instance the 2 c global warming plus20 simulations of the happi project display such non linear behaviour barcikowska et al 2018 li et al 2018 in our example one could first compute the changes from present to plus15 then apply the weights to present conditions to obtain a stochastic precipitation for plus15 climate and finally compute the changes from plus15 to plus20 our methodology only assesses the impact of changes in precipitation on flood losses however changes in other climatological drivers are likely to also have an impact kay et al 2011 schaller et al 2016 including via feedback mechanisms that are unaccounted for in our method e g increasing mean temperatures leading to increasing evapotranspiration however because precipitation acts as a first order control on flood losses we believe the approximations made in this paper still provide useful insights we have restricted attention to changes in the average annual loss since changes in the tail of the distribution of losses are likely to be less well estimated the approximations in this study can be compared with approximations made in other similar studies assessments of climate change on flood risk can be very uncertain for many reasons such as climate model choice deser et al 2012 downscaling and bias correction procedures hydrological model choice and parameter estimation donnely et al 2017 alfieri et al 2018 concluded that uncertainty from climate projections is the main driver of uncertainty when assessing future flood risk under global warming because the model error due to the flood component of the model is smaller than the differences due to alternative climate change scenarios another source of uncertainty arises when only a small number of years of flooding are simulated many studies of future flood risk based on climate models output have been limited to simulations of no more than 100 years because flood loss time series have a large natural variability the estimation of an aal based on such a short record of annualised losses introduces considerable sampling error a strength of the approach described here is that we use 50 000 years of simulated flood losses perhaps ideally one would combine our approach with a climate model driven approach to take advantage of the benefits of both approaches however this would involve creating much larger climate model ensemble and rerunning the calculations that generate the stochastic set the aal estimates presented above do not consider the effects of adaptation and other indirect socio economic impacts and are based only on the potential change in the flood hazard while holding other factors constant population projections suggest that eu population has a mild decreasing trend un report 2017 jongman et al 2012 suggest a constant or decreasing exposed population but an increase in exposed assets consideration of these aspects would certainly be important for a complete view of future flood risk since it has been argued that the observed increase in flood damage in many regions of the world is dominated by exposure increase rather than changes in hazard e g bouwer 2011 in addition to changes in exposure other more subtle socio economics factors can also play a role in determining flood risk in a recent study on paired flood events kreibich et al 2017 showed that the lower damage caused by a second event was mainly due to significant reductions in vulnerability via raised risk awareness preparedness and improvements of organizational emergency management to gain some insight into the impact that adaptation might have on the results we conducted a sensitivity analysis into the effect of raising defences based on current adaptation literature e g alfieri et al 2016 we find that the aal for winter and summer together is reduced by about 2 12 and 20 for an increase in the defence return period standard of protection of 5 25 and 50 respectively these changes are comparable to the changes in aal that we estimate due to climate change alone more complex adaptation scenarios in which standards of protection change at different rates in different locations could also easily be assessed under the proposed evaluation setup 5 conclusions climate change threatens to increase the frequency and magnitude of high precipitation events with a likely impact on flood risk this has the potential to lead to year on year increase in the cost of flood insurance in this contribution we assess the potential impact of climate change on average annual loss aal due to floods we consider two climate change scenarios one corresponding to a 1 5 c global warming above pre industrial level and one corresponding to a pre industrial world where climate has evolved without anthropogenic effects we introduce a framework to reweight current precipitation patterns such that the resulting climatology matches with either the future or the pre industrial precipitation climatology climatology is understood here as the long term mean of any precipitation statistic in our case the total precipitation and the total precipitation of wet days for raw and bias corrected climate model simulations the weights were determined by minimization of the squared root differences in precipitation metrics at catchment level and apply to the entire model domain and for each simulated year we employed the weights to scale the annual loss of events simulated with an in house european flood hd model based on a 50 000 year stochastic simulation before weighting this model was calibrated to current climate the weighting allows us to adjust the model to represent our two climate change scenarios without having to rerun the stochastic simulations this allows us to assess the impacts of climate change on flood losses the resulting aal estimates vary with scenario and precipitation statistic used with magnitudes typically within 5 per decade for winter and 10 per decade for summer aal for the future scenario generally tends to increase in winter and decrease in summer although the summer results were sensitive to the choice of precipitation statistic used and so are uncertain for the pre industrial scenario flood losses in winter are lower than for current day conditions and for summer they are larger the magnitudes of change are comparable to the magnitude of change between current day losses and those for the future scenario these results are consistent for both raw and bias corrected precipitation statistics finally our results show that adaptation measures included as updates to the current standard of protection of the flood defences could potentially play a significant role in reducing climate change impacts on european flood risk acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the
