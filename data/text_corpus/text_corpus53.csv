265,international transboundary aquifers provide important water supplies to over 150 countries long term sustainability of these aquifers requires transboundary cooperation and yet only a select few 1 transboundary aquifers are regulated by a treaty to better understand the incentives that allow treaties to emerge we develop a two player game theoretic model that couples groundwater behavior and economic incentives to represent the social dilemma of transboundary aquifer cooperation the game incorporates economic incentives and hydrogeological features and highlights the importance of trust to evaluate the benefits and risks of a treaty we demonstrate the ability of the game to reproduce key features of cooperation in the genevese aquifer which is governed by the longest running and most collaborative transboundary aquifer treaty on record we analyze the comparative statics of the game to explore the role of groundwater connectivity alternative water supply water demand and trust on the emergence of transboundary treaties the solution space highlights how economic incentives for cooperation are greatest when the value of water is commensurate with the cost of groundwater abstraction cooperation requires high trust in situations characterized by water abundance or scarcity the model results further indicate how two different types of agreements are likely to emerge treaties that limit how much is being pumped have greater potential when countries have access to an alternative water source whereas treaties that restrict where the aquifer is being exploited have greater potential in water scarce regions with emerging concerns over groundwater depletion in addition to helping explain the emergence of existing treaties this framework offers potential to identify aquifers that may be amenable to cooperation keywords transboundary aquifers coupled human natural systems socio hydrology game theory 1 introduction groundwater is an essential shared resource it acts as a reservoir that buffers against climate variability and provides water that is often more accessible than the nearest surface water body wijnen et al 2012 global water use relies heavily on groundwater which comprises over 40 of irrigation siebert et al 2010 and 50 of urban water consumption zektser and everett 2004 the convenience of groundwater however belies its susceptibility to overdraft and depletion shah 2014 wada et al 2010 abstraction exceeds recharge in many aquifers jeopardizing future water supply and often reducing downstream water availability bierkens and wada 2019 de graaf et al 2019 groundwater often serves as a common pool resource where pumping by individual users generates private profits while increasing the pumping costs to all users negri 1989 absent cooperation or regulation the ensuing externalities create incentives to over pump groundwater in a competitive process that has been described as a tragedy of the commons gardner et al 1997 additionally the benefits of groundwater withdrawals accrue immediately yet the consequences of groundwater depletion build slowly and are difficult to understand assess and monitor gleeson and richter 2018 sustainable equitable and enforceable groundwater management is therefore essential but often challenging and groundwater regulation has lagged behind surface water regulation despite a widespread global dependence on groundwater resources e g sax 2002 water governance facility 2013 the problem of groundwater management is a growing concern in transboundary basins eckstein and sindico 2014 conti 2014 rivera and candela 2018 due to ongoing groundwater depletion in many of these aquifers wada and heinrich 2013 herbert and döll 2019 over 150 nations share a transboundary aquifer igrac and unesco ihp 2015 and many of them lack the technical capacity to adequately assess groundwater resources leading to a situation in which transboundary groundwater is severely understudied and under managed eckstein 2007 2017 lee et al 2018 this situation contrasts with transboundary rivers which have been studied and regulated more intensively wolf 2007 although many more transboundary aquifers have been discovered 592 igrac and unesco ihp 2015 than transboundary rivers 310 mccracken and wolf 2019 international agreements covering surface waters outnumber agreements covering transboundary aquifers by a factor of 100 to 1 burchi 2018 tfdd 2016 only six international transboundary aquifers are currently regulated by a dedicated transboundary treaty fig 1 and only two of them place specific restrictions on groundwater use burchi 2018 the genevese aquifer treaty originally signed in 1978 regulates artificial groundwater recharge and abstraction by switzerland and france de los cobos 2018 the disi saq ram hereafter referred to as the disi aquifer agreement signed in 2015 restricts abstraction within a buffer area on either side of the border between jordan and saudi arabia müller et al 2017 the remaining agreements adopt recommendations from the non binding draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers by the united nations unga 2008 and model provisions on transboundary groundwaters by the u n economic commission for europe unece 2014 these documents include principles to support equitable and reasonable utilization an obligation not to cause significant harm a general obligation to cooperate and regular exchange of data and information unga 2013 although valuable tools to cultivate cooperative relationships and improve transboundary management these general principles are difficult to assess and enforce in addition to the six aforementioned treaties specifically focusing on groundwater we note that some 14 transboundary surface water agreements include a clause pertaining to groundwater giordano et al 2014 but most 81 of these conjunctive management treaties contain only limited mentions of groundwater and do not explicitly describe how it should be managed lautze et al 2018 the dearth of transboundary aquifer agreements has been attributed to a variety of factors including a lack of available policy frameworks eckstein 2017 inadequate technical and institutional capacity conti 2014 eckstein 2007 lee et al 2018 domestic power structures that oppose regulation feitelson 2006 and legal frameworks or bureaucracy on either side of the border that impede negotiations over transboundary resources at the local level sanchez and eckstein 2020 furthermore attention to transboundary groundwater may be limited due to the gradual rate at which problems arise and the hidden nature of the resource movilla pateiro 2016 wijnen et al 2012 these latter two features of groundwater create regulatory obstacles precisely because groundwater is difficult to monitor and regulations are difficult to enforce in addition incentives and impediments to cooperation for any particular transboundary aquifer depend on a variety of social and geophysical characteristics that are specific to the aquifer region here we model incentives for bilateral cooperation through the reduction of pumping cost externalities negri 1989 which represent a common feature of shared groundwater systems and reflect additional costs of abstraction imposed on transboundary partners in particular we develop a game theoretic model that evaluates how incentives to limit or reduce abstractions emerge through the interaction of key economic and hydrogeological features of transboundary aquifer scenarios the simplicity of the model allows us to abstract from place specific characteristics of transboundary cooperation to consider broadly how geophysical conditions economic incentives and mutual trust of transboundary partners interact across transboundary aquifers as such we use the results of the model to provide insights and understanding regarding the cooperative management of existing transboundary aquifers this allows a first order assessment of the circumstances that might lead to different types of agreements we focus on the role of trust due to the difficulty of monitoring groundwater abstraction and attributing changes in groundwater level to pumping by a particular country optimal groundwater abstraction likely requires one or both countries to credibly commit to reduce their pumping trust is critical for this to happen particularly in an international context where the objectives of multiple countries may be in opposition wolf et al 2005 cooperation produces additional risk hoffman 2002 and complete oversight of groundwater abstraction is impractical given the hidden nature of the resource albrecht et al 2017 trust building initiatives are essential components of transboundary negotiations over water particularly in situations where international partners do not have a history of cooperation wolf 2010 susskind and islam 2012 islam and susskind 2013 existing transboundary aquifer agreements all include mechanisms intended to build trust between countries including joint monitoring information sharing and increased collaboration edelenbos and van meerkerk 2015 burchi 2018 trust between swiss and french negotiators played an important role in developing the genevese treaty de los cobos 2012 and other transboundary surface water agreements have succeeded or failed on the basis of trust abbink et al 2010 biswas 2011 concerns over non compliance with transboundary agreements have arisen in multiple circumstances including the mountain aquifer shared by israel and palestine gvirtzman 2012 mckee 2019 the ganges river shared by india and bangladesh rahman et al 2019 and the indus river shared by india and pakistan akhtar 2010 qamar et al 2019 transboundary trust is shaped not only by inherent beliefs held by one country with respect to another but also by institutional capacity historical interactions ongoing bilateral initiatives strategic priorities and cultural narratives susskind and islam 2012 often trust is defined in close relation to the notion of reciprocity in which an actor may be more willing to sacrifice for the benefit of another if they believe the other actor would do the same ostrom 2003 although reciprocity may affect the level of trust we specifically conceptualize trust as the belief of one country that a transboundary partner will seek cooperation and comply with any signed agreement e g see kydd 2005 we incorporate this notion of trust into a model of transboundary aquifer cooperation that captures key economic incentives and hydrogeological features of the coupled human water system building on previous work in the disi aquifer müller et al 2017 we apply game theory to investigate how economic incentives hydrogeological constraints and trust can incentivize formal cooperation over shared groundwater although these incentives may influence cooperative outcomes a variety of factors determine whether or not a treaty is signed in any particular aquifer including domestic politics diplomatic relations and institutional capacity albrecht et al 2017 as such the objective of the model is to facilitate an understanding of cooperation rather than for prediction game theory has a rich tradition in international diplomacy fearon 1998 snidal 1985 and water resources management see madani 2010 dinar and hogarth 2015 müller and levy 2019 for extensive reviews to model decision making and conflict resolution within that context our model contributes to two key bodies of literature the first literature relates to the representation of aquifer response in game theoretic models of transboundary groundwater although a number of game theoretic models have considered cooperation and conflict over transboundary rivers e g dema 2014 eleftheriadou and mylopoulos 2008 khachaturyan and schoengold 2019 motlagh et al 2017 very few have considered transboundary aquifers aside from müller et al müller et al 2017 further discussed below we are only aware of nakao et al nakao et al 2002 which simulated transboundary groundwater cooperation along the us mexico border incorporating multiple types of cooperative institutions similar to most early games of non transboundary groundwater competition e g negri 1989 gardner et al 1997 provencher and burt 1993 that study used a single cell or bathtub aquifer model in which pumping yielded homogeneous drawdown throughout the aquifer spatially explicit groundwater behavior was incorporated by brozovíc et al brozović et al 2010 using the theis solution for drawdown by pumping wells theis 1935 the spatial behavior of groundwater depletion was further integrated into a groundwater game by müller et al müller et al 2017 by formally applying the principle of superposition and using a 2d finite difference model to account for complex groundwater behavior we use this framework to model spatial groundwater behavior using the analytical element method penny et al 2020 which allows complex groundwater behavior to be modeled by combining theoretical solutions to any number of individual aquifer elements e g wells aquifer boundaries and recharge see strack 2017 the second literature that this study contributes to relates to the representation of trust in game theoretical models of shared water resources several studies focusing on transboundary surface water have modeled how trust can be built through repetitive interactions with incremental benefits madani 2010 yu et al 2019 motlagh et al 2017 these repeated games describe the ability of players to learn trustworthy behavior based on reciprocal interactions that ultimately improve their respective reputations unlike reputation building games in which trust emerges through repetitive interactions we focus on the implications of trust in terms of the expected outcomes of transboundary cooperation in a one shot game such a game is representative of transboundary situations where the primary interaction is the development of a formal treaty and where the actions of the other player e g groundwater abstraction are not directly observable or enforceable note that this approach does not require trust to be fixed in time but rather that trust is exogenously determined at the moment a treaty is considered by each player in this manuscript we develop a bayesian game of incomplete information to represent key strategic incentives that underpin transboundary groundwater cooperation section 2 the bayesian nature of the game allows us to formally incorporate trust as the belief of each player that the other player will comply with a cooperative agreement the game is fully coupled with a groundwater model that determines well drawdown and pumping costs we analyze the comparative statics of the game by exploring outcomes i e whether there is a treaty and how much groundwater is being used under a range of economic and hydrogeologic conditions section 3 we then evaluate the ability of the game to qualitatively reproduce the sequence of events that gave rise to the genevese aquifer treaty section 4 1 finally we reconcile our understanding of the game with existing transboundary aquifer treaties and use this as a basis to explore a typology of transboundary groundwater cooperation section 4 2 2 theory derivation of the transboundary aquifer game 2 1 utility function and aquifer response consider a situation where two groundwater users i e players 1 and 2 share an aquifer and gain some benefit from abstracting water in order to maximize profits water use will balance the cost of abstraction with profits generated from water consumption e g through agricultural irrigation this scenario can be represented for either player i i e i 1 2 by the equation see müller et al 2017 for application to the disi aquifer 1 max q i 0 q i u i q i q j where u i q i q j α i q i β d i q i q j q i in this equation q i l 3 is the groundwater abstraction volume from the shared aquifer over the considered time horizon α i l 3 is the value of a unit of groundwater e g the profit generated from using the water for irrigation β l 3 l 1 is the net present cost of energy required to lift a unit of water by a unit length and d i l is the depth of the water table the constraint q i l 3 represents the abstraction threshold beyond which no marginal revenue is produced in the context of groundwater use for irrigation this represents the water volume necessary to fully irrigate all the available cropland during the considered period under these conditions additional pumping from the aquifer would not increase agricultural production which becomes limited by production factors e g land or labor other than water in an urban water supply context utility can be replaced by 2 u i q i q j α i q i q i β d i q i q j q i here q i represents the domestic water need that the urban utility needs to satisfy and α i now represents the unit cost of water obtained from an alternative source other than the aquifer with q i q i the water volume the should be obtained from that alternative source fig 2 a note that eqs 1 and 2 have identical derivatives with respect to q i and therefore identical utility maximizing values of q i in both equations α i can be interpreted as the unit value of the aquifer water for player i either in terms of the associated agricultural output or in terms of the opportunity cost of not using the water furthermore q i portrays the fact that the marginal return of aquifer water drops to zero once a sufficient quantity of water is obtained importantly the depth to groundwater for either player is affected by the pumping volumes q i and q j of both players in confined aquifers the groundwater flow equations are linear with respect to hydraulic head strack 2017 and the principle of superposition entails that the net effect of pumping by all players can be calculated as the sum of the individual effects of each player brozović et al 2010 the average groundwater depth for player i can therefore be written as 3 d i q i q j d 0 i d i i q i d i j q j where d 0 i is the undisturbed average groundwater depth i e d i when q i q j 0 and d i i and d i j are aquifer response parameters that relate the groundwater depth of player i to the groundwater abstractions of players i and j q i and q j respectively the aquifer response parameters d i i and d i j can be estimated through a variety of methods including finite difference numerical models e g müller et al 2017 or the analytical element method e g penny et al 2020 in both cases the model calculates drawdown for player i in response to unit pumping by each player in order to estimate d i i and d i j the process is repeated for player j to obtain d j j and d j i in the particular case of a confined homogeneous and isotropic aquifer where each player operates a single well d i i and d i j could be derived analytically from the theis solution e g as implemented in brozović et al 2010 madani and dinar 2012 both abstraction q i and the aquifer response parameters d i i and d i j are assumed to be static over the considered time horizon e g the life span of the infrastructure this reflects the fact that water supplies are often constrained by infrastructure and prior decisions in the context of the game this indicates that the decision to abstract q i puts each player on a path from which they will not deviate this assumption is supported by data in the genevese aquifer where abstraction for switzerland and france has been relatively constant since both parties signed the treaty see section s2 3 and is also supported by prior analysis in the disi aquifer müller et al 2017 note that these two examples are the only known cases of active international groundwater agreements that constrain pumping which the model seeks to emulate the assumption of static aquifer response parameters implies that d i i and d i j are obtained by simulating the average drawdown effects of a unit pumping rate imposed for the full duration of the considered time horizon as such the parameters of the model can be changed to represent the system across multiple instances in time including for example changing abstraction behavior in response to changing demand or climate the model itself however does not assume that players respond dynamically to aquifer conditions rather consistent with the game theoretical concept of a best response equilibrium gibbons 1992 the model assumes that each player fully anticipates the other player s response which they use to determine their optimal course of action prior to the game 2 2 non cooperative equilibrium without any form of cooperation we solve the game by determining the nash equilibrium in which each player chooses their abstraction to maximize their own utility conditional on the other player maximizing theirs in this case the players abstract q i n determined through simultaneous optimization of their individual utility as 4 u i q i q j q i 0 u j q j q i q j 0 where u i q i q j and u j q j q i take the functional forms of eq 1 or 2 which have identical derivatives importantly the groundwater depth of each player depends on the pumping rates of both players eq 3 because the unit cost of abstraction β d i increases with depth groundwater abstraction by one player leads to a pumping cost externality which is imposed on the other player negri 1989 in other words the nash equilibrium produces a situation where both players over pump and over pay for water supply players can however increase their individual utilities by targeting the socially optimal solution but doing so requires cooperation 2 3 cooperation and trust cooperation in the context of the transboundary aquifer game means that players collectively optimize their joint utility u i u j so that they both benefit the socially optimal solution requires either or both players to reduce pumping compared to the nash equilibrium thereby reducing groundwater drawdown and the average cost of abstraction i e β d i social optimal pumping can be formalized through a treaty that stipulates abstraction rates of each player in order to maximize the sum of utility of all players depending on the economic and hydrogeological characteristics the social optimal may require that one player decreases their groundwater abstraction more than the other player or even that one player increase abstraction we assume that utility is transferable and allow players to compensate these differences through side payments see dinar 2006 for a review of side payments in transboundary agreements we formally define utility for player i under the treaty as 5 u i q i q j α i q i β d i q i q j q i ϵ i 1 i z where the new parameter ϵ i is the cost of signing a treaty e g implementation or monitoring costs and z represents a payment to player 1 from player 2 to ensure that both players benefit from the treaty even when one player must sacrifice more than the other abstraction rates under the optimal treaty q i h are determined by the joint maximization of utility of both players as 6 u i q i q j u j q j q i q i 0 u i q i q j u j q j q i q j 0 where u i and u j are both given by either eqs 1 or 2 which have identical derivatives signing a treaty may appear to be an obvious solution to the pumping cost externality but the difficulty of monitoring abstraction both practical and political means that neither player can be completely certain that the other player complies with the treaty entering into a treaty with a transboundary partner therefore requires trust between countries to incorporate trust in the model we assume that each player is one of two randomly determined types honest t i h or fraudulent t i f honest players always comply with a signed treaty and abstract q i h eq 6 while frauds always act in their own self interest and abstract q i f q i h eq 8 below note that our binary categorization of players does not seek to determine the underlying reasons for complying with the treaty or not which would depend on a variety of country specific factors e g strategic goals capacity to uphold the treaty and international standing kydd 2005 each player knows their own type but not the type of the other player given this uncertainty each player has a belief about the other player s type we incorporate trust into the model as the belief of each player that the other player is honest and will comply with a signed treaty formally the player i s trust in player j is expressed as the prior probability λ i 0 1 that player j is honest this notion of trust is in line with existing literature in particular trust has been conceptualized as the the willingness to take risks and the expectation that others will honor particular obligations hoffman 2002 a belief that the other side is trustworthy that is willing to reciprocate cooperation kydd 2005 and that trust is context specific meaning it involves the belief that another actor will carry out a specific action hardin 2001 the expected utility for player i after signing a treaty is then a weighted function of abstraction by both players given as 7 e u i λ i u i q i q j h 1 λ i u i q i q j f where the first and second terms on the right hand side represent the expected utility associated with the other player j being honest or fraudulent respectively see fig 2b this expression can be used to derive the abstraction q i f of player i if they are fraudulent 8 q i λ i u i q i f q j h 1 λ i u i q i f q j f 0 in this optimization player i maximizes their individual utility despite signing a treaty with player j just as above the two terms in the derivative represent the expected utilities arising from the belief of player i that player j will first term or will not second term comply with the treaty the game does not explicitly account for treaty enforcement or impose any sanctions in the case of non compliance however our definition of trust and its implementation in eq 7 allow for flexibility in how the trust parameter can be interpreted for instance high trust λ i 1 could be achieved through reputation and strong diplomatic relations or alternatively high trust could be achieved through strong monitoring and enforcement low trust λ i 0 therefore would only occur in situations where frauds can conceal their behavior such that non compliance is difficult to monitor and enforce the model focuses only on treaties that minimize pumping cost externalities by optimizing volumetric abstractions by each country this simplifying assumption means that the model cannot directly simulate the emergence of other types of treaties however by pointing to why a volume based treaty is likely unfeasible in the considered situations it provides helpful information to interpret the alternative type of treaty that emerged instead see section 4 2 2 4 solution to the game the decision by each player whether or not to sign a treaty requires comparing expected utility under the nash equilibrium u i q i n q j n with that under the treaty u i q i q j where utility depends on the types and abstraction rates of both players each player prefers that the other player pumps less and the treaty is appealing because it reduces average pumping of the two players any player is therefore inclined to cooperate with an honest player who abides by the treaty but not with a fraudulent one furthermore because the treaty does not reduce fraudulent pumping players must account for the fact that fraudulent players are more likely to sign a treaty than honest players this feature of the game means that players update their trust in the other player after observing their decision to enter into a treaty this transboundary aquifer situation represents a two stage or dynamic bayesian game in which players first indicate their desire to sign a treaty followed by their decisions on abstraction rate q i in dynamic bayesian games players update their beliefs at each stage according to prior actions of other players gibbons 1992 player strategies must follow a perfect bayesian equilibrium meaning that actions at each stage of the game must be sequentially rational given the beliefs of each player which are updated using bayes rule given any previous actions gibbons 1992 when the terms of the treaty attract only fraudulent opponents an honest player can anticipate this and refuse to sign therefore a treaty only occurs when both players prefer cooperation regardless of their type meaning that both e u i nash e u i fraud and e u i nash e u i honest are satisfied because fraudulent players face fewer restrictions on their pumping they always benefit equally to or more than honest players when signing a treaty i e e u i honest e u i fraud we therefore focus on the conservative case where player i is honest in other words in our model a treaty is signed if and only if 9 e u i nash e u i honest u i q i n q i n λ i u i q i h q j h 1 λ i u i q i h q j f evaluating this inequality requires determining pumping in the nash no treaty honest treaty and fraud treaty without compliance scenarios as described above the utility functions for both players contain the parameter z the side payment from player 2 to player 1 because z can take on any value players will sign a treaty when they can agree on a value for z such that the inequality in eq 9 holds true we therefore solve eq 9 for each player in terms of z and then calculate a minimum acceptable payment for player 1 z 1 and a maximum allowable payment for player 2 z 2 if the difference between the two u z 1 z 2 is greater than zero the treaty is signed we therefore use u as a measure of the utility of the treaty compared with the nash equilibrium this variable represents the expected net increase in utility for two honest players entering into a treaty accounting for the fact that each player has uncertainty about the behavior of the other player who may try to cheat we use this variable as the primary outcome of the game thereby framing the issue of cooperation from the perspective of honest players we present a more formal solution to the game in section s1 including evaluating player beliefs and combinations of player strategies closed form solutions to the game were obtained using mathematica and included in an r package containing functions to evaluate the transboundary aquifer game penny 2020 the r package was then used to generate results presented in subsequent sections 3 results comparative statics of the two player game the results of the game demonstrate how incentives to cooperate depend on a variety of system characteristics that ultimately dictate whether both players are willing to sign a treaty as described above section 2 the decision of each player to cooperate depends on the expected utilities associated with signing or not signing the treaty given their beliefs on the type honest or fraud and actions of the other player we proceed to analyze the comparative statics of the game by considering how model outcomes vary for different combinations of driving parameters fig 3 to simplify this task we analyze the symmetric game where all parameters are equivalent for each of the two players we especially focus on the interactive effects of groundwater connectivity d i j d i i 0 1 the unit value of water α i and trust λ i on the utility of a treaty u groundwater connectivity represents the rate at which players reduce the water level of the other player relative to the rate at which they reduce their own water level we note that groundwater connectivity will generally increase with greater hydraulic conductivity a distinct but more common term which represents the ability of porous media to transmit water klute 1965 the remaining parameters α i λ i and u are defined above section 2 3 1 groundwater connectivity groundwater connectivity affects the interdependence of groundwater resources of both players all else being held constant it can be considered the stakes of signing a treaty in the extreme case where the two players are almost entirely disconnected d i j d i i 0 neither player affects the abstraction costs of the other player there is no pumping cost externality and equilibrium pumping rates are exactly identical with and without treaty fig 4a under these conditions players are ambivalent about signing a treaty fig 4c white and would only develop a preference if there exists some cost ϵ i 0 associated with the treaty in other words the stakes of the treaty are low at the upper extreme of connectivity d i i d i j 1 pumping by one player creates equivalent drawdown for both players i e a single cell or bathtub model brozović et al 2006 between these extremes increasing connectivity leads to an increasing pumping cost externality and the benefits and risks of a treaty both increase monotonically the difference in abstraction between the nash equilibrium fig 4a green and the treaty fig 4a blue represents the pumping cost externality that arises from individual utility maximization the risk of signing a treaty also increases with connectivity due to the greater reduction in abstraction for honest players which allows frauds to pump increasingly more when a treaty is signed fig 4a red 3 2 value of water the utility of a treaty u exhibits a non monotonic relation with the marginal benefit α i of using aquifer water as described in section 2 1 this marginal benefit can be either associated with the value of the goods produced with the water or with the opportunity costs of not having to rely on an alternative water source to meet a given water need at the lower extreme α i 0 neither player will use the aquifer because no marginal benefit can be generated from the abstracted water in the context of urban water supply both players exclusively use an alternative source because it is less expensive than groundwater pumping α i 0 means that the alternative water source is free of costs at the upper extreme α i both players produce a substantial marginal benefit from the abstracted water and do not wish to compromise their ability to exploit the aquifer in the context of urban water supply both players exclusively rely on the shared aquifer because the alternative source is too expensive in other words for a sufficiently high value of α i both players pump exactly their water demand q i regardless of the treaty unless some inherent cost arises ϵ i 0 in both situations α 0 and α players are ambivalent about signing a treaty which will be either useless α 0 no one uses the aquifer or toothless α no one will agree to restrict their consumption just as abstraction at the extremes obeys clear rules abstraction throughout the domain of α i follows predictable behavior which can be separated into clearly defined zones as shown in fig 4b as just argued when the marginal benefit of using the aquifer is lower than the cost of abstracting groundwater from the undisturbed water table depth i e α i β d 0 i neither player has incentive to exploit the shared aquifer i no abstraction zone in fig 4b as the marginal benefit of pumping α i increases past the threshold β d 0 i players start using the aquifer and pumping rates increase linearly with α i reliance on the aquifer increases as the marginal benefit of pumping increases the incentives to over pump given by the difference between honest and nash abstraction rates in fig 4b increase as do the risks of signing a treaty difference between the honest and fraud abstraction rates in fig 4b in this zone abstraction is cost limited meaning that players consider trade offs between the cost of groundwater and the marginal benefits of abstraction α i ii cost limited zone in fig 4b if α i is sufficiently high the fraudulent player will use the aquifer to the full extent of their capacity and pump q i in an urban water supply context they would rely entirely on the aquifer to meet their water need q i iii demand limited fraud at this point increasing values of α i will increase reliance on the aquifer in the absence of treaty nash in green on fig 4b but will not increase incentives to cheat fraud in red on fig 4b the aggregate effect is that the benefits of a treaty continue to increase while the risks decrease visible as a dip in the utility contour lines in fig 4d for even higher values of α i the nash equilibrium pumping rate reaches the threshold q i iv demand limited nash where the difference between pumping rates with and without a treaty diminishes and a treaty loses its ability to reduce abstraction for sufficiently high values of α i all players consume q i regardless of the treaty equivalent to the extreme case of α i described above v abstraction only the progressive decoupling of abstraction with the marginal benefit of pumping in zones iii v occurs due to the pumping threshold q i beyond which the marginal benefit of increasing consumption vanishes for urban users this threshold represents the total water need that needs to be satisfied for agricultural users this threshold is represented by the transition from water to another constraining factor e g land or labor that limits agricultural production in situations where this transition does not occur for reasonable values of q i e g in desert aquifers where labor and land are not constrained q i does not have an effect on pumping decisions and solution space becomes restricted to zones i and ii see fig 4 zone i indicates that the value of water is small enough that no groundwater is worth pumping in zone ii abstraction increases linearly with the value of water 3 3 trust trust plays an important role in model scenarios where players could benefit from a treaty but risk being cheated by a fraud the importance of trust depends on the relative risks and benefits of a treaty for each of the two players which we define relative to the nash no treaty scenario more precisely the benefit of a treaty is the difference in utility between the nash and treaty scenarios for two honest players given by u i q i h q j h u i q i n q j n the risk of a treaty is the difference between not signing a treaty and being cheated by a fraud given by u i q i n q j n u i q i h q j f note that these are the absolute benefits and risks of a treaty unweighted by trust benefits and risks are plotted against each other in fig 5 for each of the five zones as a percentage of utility in the nash equilibrium we note that with high trust frauds become emboldened and abstract greater quantities because they are more certain that they are cheating an honest player with lower trust the absolute risk would reduce but the expected risk i e weighted by 1 λ would increase the risks and benefits of a treaty are zero in the i no abstraction and v abstraction only zones because abstractions rates are equivalent in the treaty and no treaty scenarios as the marginal benefit of pumping α i increases in the ii cost limited zone the benefits and risks increase at proportional rates meaning that the trust required for a treaty remains constant fig 5a moving into the iii demand limited fraud zone the benefits of a treaty increase while the risks of a treaty reduce fig 5b the decreasing risk arises because fraud abstraction q i f is limited by demand q i and approaches abstraction in the nash as α i increases see fig 4 b in the iv demand limited nash zone the benefits and risks both decrease but the benefits decrease more rapidly than the risks fig 5c for this reason the trust required to sign a treaty increases dramatically at the upper end of this zone fig 4d these results demonstrate that a treaty can be signed across any of the zones but that zones ii and iii are most favorable because they require the lowest level of trust in zone iv a treaty can be achieved but requires a higher level of trust particularly near zone v 4 discussion 4 1 is the model realistic the genevese aquifer treaty signed by switzerland and france in 1978 offers a useful case study with which to assess cooperative outcomes in the transboundary aquifer game this treaty is the longest running transboundary aquifer agreement in the world eckstein and sindico 2014 and the only one to explicitly include incentives to limit abstraction rates burchi 2018 although the stylized formulation of the game cannot fully capture the complex social or hydrogeological characteristics of the genevese scenario we use the game to qualitatively reproduce the bilateral relations that took place between france and switzerland in negotiations leading up to the agreement the genevese aquifer runs along the southern border of the canton of geneva switzerland with portions of the aquifer extending into france fig 6ab the timeline of events in the genevese fig 6c allows us to explore multiple aspects of the transboundary situation geneva began utilizing the aquifer for water resources in the 1940s followed by the french communities in the 1960s water levels began declining in the 1960 and reached a critically low level after france began abstraction with water levels nearly falling below the level of many wells de los cobos 2018 both countries jointly decided to investigate the hydrogeophysical properties of the aquifer in 1972 de los cobos 2018 while individually beginning to explore alternative water sources swiss investigations found that treating water from lake geneva would be considerably more expensive than managed aquifer recharge to increase aquifer water levels and allow for additional abstraction de los cobos 2015 in 1975 the french side announced it would not use genevese water and would instead utilize an alternative source however they reversed course three years later and signed the treaty in 1978 managed aquifer recharge was initiated in 1980 and the treaty has been successfully operational since de los cobos 2018 we codified this timeline of events into the transboundary aquifer game by varying input parameters within monte carlo simulations to capture both uncertainty and nonstationarity in the input variables see section s2 in order to capture specific features of the genevese aquifer we modified the game described in section 2 to account for unconfined behavior and aquifer recharge see section s2 1 the model indicates that a treaty was more likely than not in 1974 then unlikely while france pursued inexpensive alternatives and again likely in 1978 when the treaty was actually signed the model results presented in figure s2 offer confidence that the transboundary aquifer game adequately captures key features of the treaty negotiation 4 2 a typology of transboundary groundwater cooperation the transboundary aquifer game provides a basis for identifying classes of transboundary groundwater agreements that seek to reduce pumping cost externalities by restricting pumping rates by one or both countries indeed by reconciling existing treaties with the model a typology of transboundary groundwater cooperation emerges that provides clearer distinctions between the agreements that have been signed the typology includes treaties that 1 explicitly regulate abstraction volumes the genevese 2 explicitly restrict abstraction within a buffer region near the border the disi and 3 rely on general principles to promote cooperation and collaboration fig 7 illustrates the general mapping of these agreements onto the transboundary aquifer game under different values of q i the horizontal axis is identical across all three panels and represents the marginal benefits of pumping water from the shared aquifer again these marginal benefits can be either interpreted as the marginal revenue associated with the goods produced with the abstracted water agriculture or the marginal opportunity cost associated with obtaining that water from an alternative source urban water supply the genevese treaty was signed in the context of increasing demand for water and depleting groundwater resources to the extent that some wells had dried i e shifting from panel a to b in fig 7 the motivation for cooperation therefore arose from the desire to preserve groundwater supplies in the aquifer and ensure access for both switzerland and france de los cobos 2018 given the small size of the aquifer and the close proximity of wells on either side of the border the only available option to ensure groundwater sustainability was to reduce abstraction the model demonstrates that the situation was favorable for cooperation given the joint depletion of groundwater availability of alternative supply and high trust between countries nevertheless negotiations were difficult at times and nearly fell through section 4 1 even as demand increased the incentive to cooperate was insufficient to sign a treaty until both sides realized that continued abstraction would result in runaway costs aquifer depletion and that neither player had an inexpensive alternative source of water in other words both players were satisfied with the status quo until it became untenable the disi agreement was signed in the context of increasing groundwater use by saudi arabia and jordan and the construction of the disi pipeline that conveys water from the aquifer to the largest city in jordan amman similar to the genevese both sides were concerned about declining water table levels and were confronted with the development of new water supply infrastructure in the case of the disi however groundwater depletion was driven primarily by domestic abstraction on either side of the border and not by mutual depletion müller et al 2017 this allowed the disi agreement to emerge which places no limits on the quantity of groundwater abstraction but restricts abstraction near the shared border the effect of the disi approach is that pumping by either player has little effect on water levels of the other player because of the large distance between wells on either side of the border müller et al 2017 the essential achievement of this approach is to avoid pumping cost externalities without the need for a treaty to reduce abstraction which would be politically unappealing additionally the model indicates that trust as defined in the model has little effect on the expected outcomes when connectivity is low because of the minimal effect each player has on the other player s well drawdown the treaty reframes groundwater depletion as a domestic issue because either side does not deplete their groundwater more quickly than they might have if the aquifer was not internationally shared furthermore limiting connectivity reduces the stakes of the treaty and could facilitate higher trust between countries by lowering risks and rewards see poteete et al 2010 hoffman 2002 more generally a high marginal revenue of water α combined with a low demand threshold q indicates situations where both parties are heavily reliant on the aquifer either to produce a high value output or because any alternative source of water would be prohibitively expensive under these conditions use of the shared aquifer becomes inelastic to its own cost providing little room for either party to restrict their abstraction as in fig 7c limiting connectivity in such situations as was done in the disi saq ram aquifer may be the most viable option the remaining agreements lack any regulation of groundwater abstraction but rather build a foundation for cooperation by establishing best practices aquifer assessment and monitoring initiatives do no harm principles to limit overdraft and pollution and a diplomatic framework for resolving disputes burchi 2018 with the exception of the guarani where annual abstractions represent a small fraction 3 of annual recharge and the primary concerns include vulnerability to contamination in unconfined zones of the aquifer and long term declining water storage in portions of the confined aquifer with slow recharge sindico et al 2018 all other agreements concern aquifers situated in arid regions where alternative water sources are expensive depending on the aquifer and the scale of interest e g local versus national these aquifers also exhibit a range of connectivity we therefore place these treaties on the right side of fig 7 while acknowledging that they could be situated in a range of scenarios or zones it is important to note that the model developed in this study focuses on a specific type of agreement that limits water abstraction volumes in order to maximize the joint utility of the users consequently the model does not directly evaluate the feasibility of any other types of agreement instead the model can be used to identify likely reasons why a volume based agreement did not emerge and can help us interpret the type of agreement that did emerge for instance the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas agreement provides for a mechanism for information sharing and joint hydrogeologic modeling efforts modeling results suggest that although drawdown near pumping centers can be substantial transboundary drawdown is likely minimal even in regions where pumping centers are located near national borders voss and soliman 2014 this places the nsas aquifer in the low connectivity region at the very bottom of fig 7 however the model also outlines the risk of oasis loss and associated environmental impacts due to dropping water tables voss and soliman 2014 among other benefits information sharing associated with the agreement improves modelling accuracy to allow countries to monitor and mitigate these domestic issues government of egypt government of libya government of chad government of sudan 2013 in the case of the iullemeden taoudeni tanezrouft aquifer system itas water levels have been affected by expanding agriculture into low rainfall area and land use changes in the recharge zone over the past decades these effects will be exacerbated by a predicted decrease in precipitation and increase in evaporation associated with climate change in the sahel region these changing conditions might alter the location of the itas in parameter space in fig 7 with substantial associated uncertainty the memorandum of understanding provides for a consultation mechanism for information gathering information exchange and decision making for sustainable water resource management of the aquifer eckstein and dodo 2012 in the case of the northwestern sahara aquifer system commonly referred to by its french acronym sass locally high transboundary connectivity and extreme water scarcity sahara and sahel observatory 2003 place the aquifer in the upper right corner of fig 7 where a volume base agreement is unlikely instead the riparian countries have created a consultative mechanism that includes a permanent technical committee tasked with information sharing and managing a joint aquifer model this process allowed regions with high vulnerability or high exploitation potential to be mapped to possibly optimize the spatial location of exploitation regions sahara and sahel observatory 2003 these findings collectively demonstrate that multiple classes of regulatory frameworks are available to limit groundwater abstraction and prevent pumping cost externalities in transboundary aquifers but that each one requires particular circumstances to be met in particular the zones relate connectivity and value of water with plausible treaty outcomes for instance limiting abstraction is a viable option in the cost limited zone ii with the reasonable availability of an alternative water source but may be politically challenging in the demand limited nash iv and abstraction only v zones which require exceptionally high trust in zones iv and v limiting connectivity is a reasonable approach to reduce transboundary externalities provided connectivity is low to begin with otherwise agreements that rely on general principles to promote cooperation are more tractable lastly groundwater use tends to expand and increase over time this means that connectivity is likely to increase as groundwater depleted areas expand and the stakes of cooperation will escalate it could also mean that some aquifers transition to zones ii and iii from zones iv and v creating both challenges and opportunities for cooperation the intensification of groundwater use and interdependence means that transboundary cooperation will become increasingly important 5 conclusions transboundary aquifers provide critical water supplies around the world but have received relatively little attention from the broader research community given the importance of the resource to help close this gap we develop a game theoretic model to explore the relationship between economic incentives and hydrogeological characteristics of transboundary aquifer cooperation with an emphasis on the role of trust by focusing on the pumping cost externality between two players that seek to minimize the cost of their water supply our analysis pertains to aquifer scenarios where two countries share a single border and cooperation entails reducing or limiting the pumping cost externality other scenarios with additional players e g aquifers shared by three or more countries different cooperative objectives i e other than the pumping cost externality or more complicated groundwater configurations e g a confined aquifer recharged by surface water in another country may yield different outcomes future work should also consider additional externalities related to groundwater abstraction including subsidence ecosystem degradation and water quality despite its limitations the model demonstrates how interactions among groundwater connectivity water demand and the economic value of water shape transboundary pumping cost externalities the typology encapsulates these principles by relating model outcomes with existing transboundary cooperative frameworks that seek to limit pumping cost externalities by 1 regulating abstraction volumes i e the genevese 2 restricting abstraction near the border i e the disi or 3 developing cooperative frameworks for learning about the aquifer and building trust given the theoretical foundation of the model we posit that these drivers transcend the unique features of these aquifers and likely affect economic incentives for transboundary aquifer cooperation more generally furthermore in combination with the model the typology of treaties presents an opportunity to broadly identify aquifers that might be amenable to cooperation or those that risk escalating into crises over transboundary water resources data availability the r package for the transboundary aquifer game is archived on zenodo

265,international transboundary aquifers provide important water supplies to over 150 countries long term sustainability of these aquifers requires transboundary cooperation and yet only a select few 1 transboundary aquifers are regulated by a treaty to better understand the incentives that allow treaties to emerge we develop a two player game theoretic model that couples groundwater behavior and economic incentives to represent the social dilemma of transboundary aquifer cooperation the game incorporates economic incentives and hydrogeological features and highlights the importance of trust to evaluate the benefits and risks of a treaty we demonstrate the ability of the game to reproduce key features of cooperation in the genevese aquifer which is governed by the longest running and most collaborative transboundary aquifer treaty on record we analyze the comparative statics of the game to explore the role of groundwater connectivity alternative water supply water demand and trust on the emergence of transboundary treaties the solution space highlights how economic incentives for cooperation are greatest when the value of water is commensurate with the cost of groundwater abstraction cooperation requires high trust in situations characterized by water abundance or scarcity the model results further indicate how two different types of agreements are likely to emerge treaties that limit how much is being pumped have greater potential when countries have access to an alternative water source whereas treaties that restrict where the aquifer is being exploited have greater potential in water scarce regions with emerging concerns over groundwater depletion in addition to helping explain the emergence of existing treaties this framework offers potential to identify aquifers that may be amenable to cooperation keywords transboundary aquifers coupled human natural systems socio hydrology game theory 1 introduction groundwater is an essential shared resource it acts as a reservoir that buffers against climate variability and provides water that is often more accessible than the nearest surface water body wijnen et al 2012 global water use relies

susceptibility to overdraft and depletion shah 2014 wada et al 2010 abstraction exceeds recharge in many aquifers jeopardizing future water supply and often reducing downstream water availability bierkens and wada 2019 de graaf et al 2019 groundwater often serves as a common pool resource where pumping by individual users generates private profits while increasing the pumping costs to all users negri 1989 absent cooperation or regulation the ensuing externalities create incentives to over pump groundwater in a competitive process that has been described as a tragedy of the commons gardner et al 1997 additionally the benefits of groundwater withdrawals accrue immediately yet the consequences of groundwater depletion build slowly and are difficult to understand assess and monitor

understudied and under managed eckstein 2007 2017 lee et al 2018 this situation contrasts with transboundary rivers which have been studied and regulated more intensively wolf 2007 although many more

covering transboundary aquifers by a factor of 100 to 1 burchi 2018 tfdd 2016 only six international transboundary aquifers are currently regulated by a dedicated transboundary treaty fig 1 and only two of them place specific restrictions on groundwater use burchi 2018 the genevese aquifer treaty originally signed in 1978 regulates artificial groundwater recharge and abstraction by switzerland and france de los cobos 2018 the disi saq ram hereafter referred to as the disi aquifer agreement signed in 2015 restricts abstraction within a buffer area on either side of the border between jordan and saudi arabia müller et al 2017 the remaining agreements adopt recommendations from the non binding draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers by the united nations unga 2008 and model provisions on transboundary groundwaters by the u n economic commission for europe unece 2014 these documents include principles to support equitable and reasonable utilization an obligation not to cause significant harm a general obligation to cooperate and regular exchange of data and information unga 2013 although valuable tools to cultivate cooperative relationships and improve transboundary management these general principles are difficult to assess and enforce in addition to the six aforementioned treaties specifically focusing on groundwater we note that some 14 transboundary surface water agreements include a clause pertaining to groundwater giordano et al 2014 but most 81 of these conjunctive management treaties contain only limited mentions of groundwater and do not explicitly describe how it should be managed lautze et al 2018 the dearth of transboundary aquifer agreements has been attributed to a variety of factors including a lack of available policy frameworks eckstein 2017 inadequate technical and institutional capacity conti 2014 eckstein 2007 lee et al 2018 domestic power structures that oppose regulation feitelson 2006 and legal frameworks or bureaucracy on either side of the border that impede negotiations over transboundary resources at the local level sanchez and eckstein 2020 furthermore attention to transboundary groundwater may be limited due to the gradual rate at which problems arise and the hidden nature of the resource movilla pateiro 2016 wijnen et al 2012 these latter two features of groundwater create regulatory obstacles precisely because groundwater is difficult to monitor and regulations are difficult to enforce in addition incentives and impediments to cooperation for any particular transboundary aquifer depend on a variety of social and geophysical characteristics that are specific to the aquifer region here we model incentives for bilateral cooperation through the reduction of pumping cost externalities negri 1989 which represent a common feature of shared groundwater systems and reflect additional costs of abstraction imposed on transboundary partners in particular we develop a game theoretic model that evaluates how incentives to limit or reduce abstractions emerge through the interaction of key economic and hydrogeological features of transboundary aquifer scenarios the simplicity of the model allows us to abstract from place specific characteristics of transboundary cooperation to consider broadly how geophysical conditions economic incentives and mutual trust of transboundary partners interact across transboundary aquifers as such we use the results of the model to provide insights and understanding regarding the cooperative management of existing transboundary aquifers this allows a first order assessment of the circumstances that might lead to different types of agreements we focus on the role of trust due to the difficulty of monitoring groundwater abstraction and attributing changes in groundwater level to pumping by a particular country optimal groundwater abstraction likely requires one or both countries to credibly commit to reduce their pumping trust is critical for this to happen particularly in an international context where the objectives of multiple countries may be in opposition wolf et al 2005 cooperation produces additional risk hoffman 2002 and complete oversight of groundwater abstraction is impractical given the hidden nature of the resource albrecht et al 2017 trust building initiatives are essential components of transboundary negotiations over water particularly in situations where international partners do not have a history of cooperation wolf 2010 susskind and islam 2012 islam and susskind 2013 existing transboundary aquifer agreements all include mechanisms intended to build trust between countries including joint monitoring information sharing and increased collaboration edelenbos and van meerkerk 2015 burchi 2018 trust between swiss and french negotiators played an important role in developing the genevese treaty de los cobos 2012 and other transboundary surface water agreements have succeeded or failed on the basis of trust abbink et al 2010 biswas 2011 concerns over non compliance with transboundary agreements have arisen in multiple circumstances including the mountain aquifer shared by israel and palestine gvirtzman 2012 mckee 2019 the ganges river shared by india and bangladesh rahman et al 2019 and the indus river shared by india and pakistan akhtar 2010 qamar et al 2019 transboundary trust is shaped not only by inherent beliefs held by one country with respect to another but also by institutional capacity historical interactions ongoing bilateral initiatives strategic priorities and cultural narratives susskind and islam 2012 often trust is defined in close relation to the notion of reciprocity in which an actor may be more willing to sacrifice for the benefit of another if they believe the other actor would do the same ostrom 2003 although reciprocity may affect the level of trust we specifically conceptualize trust as the belief of one country that a transboundary partner will seek cooperation and comply with any signed agreement e g see kydd 2005 we incorporate this notion of trust into a model of transboundary aquifer cooperation that captures key economic incentives and hydrogeological features of the coupled human water system building on previous work in the disi aquifer müller et al 2017 we apply game theory to investigate how economic incentives hydrogeological constraints and trust can incentivize formal cooperation over shared groundwater although these incentives may influence cooperative outcomes a variety of factors determine whether or not a treaty is signed in any particular aquifer including domestic politics diplomatic relations and institutional capacity albrecht et al 2017 as such the objective of the model is to facilitate an understanding of cooperation rather than for prediction game theory has a rich tradition in international diplomacy fearon 1998 snidal 1985 and water resources management see madani 2010 dinar and hogarth 2015 müller and levy 2019 for extensive reviews to model decision making and conflict resolution within that context our model contributes to two key bodies of literature the first literature relates to the representation of aquifer response in game theoretic models of transboundary groundwater although a number of game theoretic models have considered cooperation and conflict over transboundary rivers e g dema 2014 eleftheriadou and mylopoulos 2008 khachaturyan and schoengold 2019 motlagh et al 2017 very few have considered transboundary aquifers aside from müller et al müller et al 2017 further discussed below we are only aware of nakao et al nakao et al 2002 which simulated transboundary groundwater cooperation along the us mexico border incorporating multiple types of cooperative institutions similar to most early games of non transboundary groundwater competition e g negri 1989 gardner et al 1997 provencher and burt 1993 that study used a single cell or bathtub aquifer model in which pumping yielded homogeneous drawdown throughout the aquifer spatially explicit groundwater behavior was incorporated by brozovíc et al brozović et al 2010 using the theis solution for drawdown by pumping wells theis 1935 the spatial behavior of groundwater depletion was further integrated into a groundwater game by müller et al müller et al 2017 by formally applying the principle of superposition and using a 2d finite difference model to account for complex groundwater behavior we use this framework to model spatial groundwater behavior using the analytical element method penny et al 2020 which allows complex groundwater behavior to be modeled by combining theoretical solutions to any number of individual aquifer elements e g wells aquifer boundaries and recharge see strack 2017 the second literature that this study contributes to relates to the representation of trust in game theoretical models of shared water resources several studies focusing on transboundary surface water have modeled how trust can be built through repetitive interactions with incremental benefits madani 2010 yu et al 2019 motlagh et al 2017 these repeated games describe the ability of players to learn trustworthy behavior based on reciprocal interactions that ultimately improve their respective reputations unlike reputation building games in which trust emerges through repetitive interactions we focus on the implications of trust in terms of the expected outcomes of transboundary cooperation in a one shot game such a game is representative of transboundary situations where the primary interaction is the development of a formal treaty and where the actions of the other player e g groundwater abstraction are not directly observable or enforceable note that this approach does not require trust to be fixed in time but rather that trust is exogenously determined at the moment a treaty is considered by each player in this manuscript we develop a bayesian game of incomplete information to represent key strategic incentives that underpin transboundary groundwater cooperation section 2 the bayesian nature of the game allows us to formally incorporate trust as the belief of each player that the other player will comply with a cooperative agreement the game is fully coupled with a groundwater model that determines well drawdown and pumping costs we analyze the comparative statics of the game by exploring outcomes i e whether there is a treaty and how much groundwater is being used under a range of economic and hydrogeologic conditions section 3 we then evaluate the ability of the game to qualitatively reproduce the sequence of events that gave rise to the genevese aquifer treaty section 4 1 finally we reconcile our understanding of the game with existing transboundary aquifer treaties and use this as a basis to explore a typology of transboundary groundwater cooperation section 4 2 2 theory derivation of the transboundary aquifer game 2 1 utility function and aquifer response consider a situation where two groundwater users i e players 1 and 2 share an aquifer and gain some benefit from abstracting water in order to maximize profits water use will balance the cost of abstraction with profits generated from water consumption e g through agricultural irrigation this scenario can be represented for either player i i e i 1 2 by the equation see müller et al 2017 for application to the disi aquifer 1 max q i 0 q i u i q i q j where u i q i q j α i q i β d i q i q j q i in this equation q i l 3 is the groundwater abstraction volume from the shared aquifer over the considered time horizon α i l 3 is the value of a unit of groundwater e g the profit generated from using the water for irrigation β l 3 l 1 is the net present cost of energy required to lift a unit of water by a unit length and d i l is the depth of the water table the constraint q i l 3 represents the abstraction threshold beyond which no marginal revenue is produced in the context of groundwater use for irrigation this represents the water volume necessary to fully irrigate all the available cropland during the considered period under these conditions additional pumping from the aquifer would not increase agricultural production which becomes limited by production factors e g land or labor other than water in an urban water supply context utility can be replaced by 2 u i q i q j α i q i q i β d i q i q j q i here q i represents the domestic water need that the urban utility needs to satisfy and α i now represents the unit cost of water obtained from an alternative source other than the aquifer with q i q i the water volume the should be obtained from that alternative source fig 2 a note that eqs 1 and 2 have identical derivatives with respect to q i and therefore identical utility maximizing values of q i in both equations α i can be interpreted as the unit value of the aquifer water for player i either in terms of the associated agricultural output or in terms of the opportunity cost of not using the water furthermore q i portrays the fact that the marginal return of aquifer water drops to zero once a sufficient quantity of water is obtained importantly the depth to groundwater for either player is affected by the pumping volumes q i and q j of both players in confined aquifers the groundwater flow equations are linear with respect to hydraulic head strack 2017 and the principle of superposition entails that the net effect of pumping by all players can be calculated as the sum of the individual effects of each player brozović et al 2010 the average groundwater depth for player i can therefore be written as 3 d i q i q j d 0 i d i i q i d i j q j where d 0 i is the undisturbed average groundwater depth i e d i when q i q j 0 and d i i and d i j are aquifer response parameters that relate the groundwater depth of player i to the groundwater abstractions of players i and j q i and q j respectively the aquifer response parameters d i i and d i j can be estimated through a variety of methods including finite difference numerical models e g müller et al 2017 or the analytical element method e g penny et al 2020 in both cases the model calculates drawdown for player i in response to unit pumping by each player in order to estimate d i i and d i j the process is repeated for player j to obtain d j j and d j i in the particular case of a confined homogeneous and isotropic aquifer where each player operates a single well d i i and d i j could be derived analytically from the theis solution e g as implemented in brozović et al 2010 madani and dinar 2012 both abstraction q i and the aquifer response parameters d i i and d i j are assumed to be static over the considered time horizon e g the life span of the infrastructure this reflects the fact that water supplies are often constrained by infrastructure and prior decisions in the context of the game this indicates that the decision to abstract q i puts each player on a path from which they will not deviate this assumption is supported by data in the genevese aquifer where abstraction for switzerland and france has been relatively constant since both parties signed the treaty see section s2 3 and is also supported by prior analysis in the disi aquifer müller et al 2017 note that these two examples are the only known cases of active international groundwater agreements that constrain pumping which the model seeks to emulate the assumption of static aquifer response parameters implies that d i i and d i j are obtained by simulating the average drawdown effects of a unit pumping rate imposed for the full duration of the considered time horizon as such the parameters of the model can be changed to represent the system across multiple instances in time including for example changing abstraction behavior in response to changing demand or climate the model itself however does not assume that players respond dynamically to aquifer conditions rather consistent with the game theoretical concept of a best response equilibrium gibbons 1992 the model assumes that each player fully anticipates the other player s response which they use to determine their optimal course of action prior to the game 2 2 non cooperative equilibrium without any form of cooperation we solve the game by determining the nash equilibrium in which each player chooses their abstraction to maximize their own utility conditional on the other player maximizing theirs in this case the players abstract q i n determined through simultaneous optimization of their individual utility as 4 u i q i q j q i 0 u j q j q i q j 0 where u i q i q j and u j q j q i take the functional forms of eq 1 or 2 which have identical derivatives importantly the groundwater depth of each player depends on the pumping rates of both players eq 3 because the unit cost of abstraction β d i increases with depth groundwater abstraction by one player leads to a pumping cost externality which is imposed on the other player negri 1989 in other words the nash equilibrium produces a situation where both players over pump and over pay for water supply players can however increase their individual utilities by targeting the socially optimal solution but doing so requires cooperation 2 3 cooperation and trust cooperation in the context of the transboundary aquifer game means that players collectively optimize their joint utility u i u j so that they both benefit the socially optimal solution requires either or both players to reduce pumping compared to the nash equilibrium thereby reducing groundwater drawdown and the average cost of abstraction i e β d i social optimal pumping can be formalized through a treaty that stipulates abstraction rates of each player in order to maximize the sum of utility of all players depending on the economic and hydrogeological characteristics the social optimal may require that one player decreases their groundwater abstraction more than the other player or even that one player increase abstraction we assume that utility is transferable and allow players to compensate these differences through side payments see dinar 2006 for a review of side payments in transboundary agreements we formally define utility for player i under the treaty as 5 u i q i q j α i q i β d i q i q j q i ϵ i 1 i z where the new parameter ϵ i is the cost of signing a treaty e g implementation or monitoring costs and z represents a payment to player 1 from player 2 to ensure that both players benefit from the treaty even when one player must sacrifice more than the other abstraction rates under the optimal treaty q i h are determined by the joint maximization of utility of both players as 6 u i q i q j u j q j q i q i 0 u i q i q j u j q j q i q j 0 where u i and u j are both given by either eqs 1 or 2 which have identical derivatives signing a treaty may appear to be an obvious solution to the pumping cost externality but the difficulty of monitoring abstraction both practical and political means that neither player can be completely certain that the other player complies with the treaty entering into a treaty with a transboundary partner therefore requires trust between countries to incorporate trust in the model we assume that each player is one of two randomly determined types honest t i h or fraudulent t i f honest players always comply with a signed treaty and abstract q i h eq 6 while frauds always act in their own self interest and abstract q i f q i h eq 8 below note that our binary categorization of players does not seek to determine the underlying reasons for complying with the treaty or not which would depend on a variety of country specific factors e g strategic goals capacity to uphold the treaty and international standing kydd 2005 each player knows their own type but not the type of the other player given this uncertainty each player has a belief about the other player s type we incorporate trust into the model as the belief of each player that the other player is honest and will comply with a signed treaty formally the player i s trust in player j is expressed as the prior probability λ i 0 1 that player j is honest this notion of trust is in line with existing literature in particular trust has been conceptualized as the the willingness to take risks and the expectation that others will honor particular obligations hoffman 2002 a belief that the other side is trustworthy that is willing to reciprocate cooperation kydd 2005 and that trust is context specific meaning it involves the belief that another actor will carry out a specific action hardin 2001 the expected utility for player i after signing a treaty is then a weighted function of abstraction by both players given as 7 e u i λ i u i q i q j h 1 λ i u i q i q j f where the first and second terms on the right hand side represent the expected utility associated with the other player j being honest or fraudulent respectively see fig 2b this expression can be used to derive the abstraction q i f of player i if they are fraudulent 8 q i λ i u i q i f q j h 1 λ i u i q i f q j f 0 in this optimization player i maximizes their individual utility despite signing a treaty with player j just as above the two terms in the derivative represent the expected utilities arising from the belief of player i that player j will first term or will not second term comply with the treaty the game does not explicitly account for treaty enforcement or impose any sanctions in the case of non compliance however our definition of trust and its implementation in eq 7 allow for flexibility in how the trust parameter can be interpreted for instance high trust λ i 1 could be achieved through reputation and strong diplomatic relations or alternatively high trust could be achieved through strong monitoring and enforcement low trust λ i 0 therefore would only occur in situations where frauds can conceal their behavior such that non compliance is difficult to monitor and enforce the model focuses only on treaties that minimize pumping cost externalities by optimizing volumetric abstractions by each country this simplifying assumption means that the model cannot directly simulate the emergence of other types of treaties however by pointing to why a volume based treaty is likely unfeasible in the considered situations it provides helpful information to interpret the alternative type of treaty that emerged instead see section 4 2 2 4 solution to the game the decision by each player whether or not to sign a treaty requires comparing expected utility under the nash equilibrium u i q i n q j n with that under the treaty u i q i q j where utility depends on the types and abstraction rates of both players each player prefers that the other player pumps less and the treaty is appealing because it reduces average pumping of the two players any player is therefore inclined to cooperate with an honest player who abides by the treaty but not with a fraudulent one furthermore because the treaty does not reduce fraudulent pumping players must account for the fact that fraudulent players are more likely to sign a treaty than honest players this feature of the game means that players update their trust in the other player after observing their decision to enter into a treaty this transboundary aquifer situation represents a two stage or dynamic bayesian game in which players first indicate their desire to sign a treaty followed by their decisions on abstraction rate q i in dynamic bayesian games players update their beliefs at each stage according to prior actions of other players gibbons 1992 player strategies must follow a perfect bayesian equilibrium meaning that actions at each stage of the game must be sequentially rational given the beliefs of each player which are updated using bayes rule given any previous actions gibbons 1992 when the terms of the treaty attract only fraudulent opponents an honest player can anticipate this and refuse to sign therefore a treaty only occurs when both players prefer cooperation regardless of their type meaning that both e u i nash e u i fraud and e u i nash e u i honest are satisfied because fraudulent players face fewer restrictions on their pumping they always benefit equally to or more than honest players when signing a treaty i e e u i honest e u i fraud we therefore focus on the conservative case where player i is honest in other words in our model a treaty is signed if and only if 9 e u i nash e u i honest u i q i n q i n λ i u i q i h q j h 1 λ i u i q i h q j f evaluating this inequality requires determining pumping in the nash no treaty honest treaty and fraud treaty without compliance scenarios as described above the utility functions for both players contain the parameter z the side payment from player 2 to player 1 because z can take on any value players will sign a treaty when they can agree on a value for z such that the inequality in eq 9 holds true we therefore solve eq 9 for each player in terms of z and then calculate a minimum acceptable payment for player 1 z 1 and a maximum allowable payment for player 2 z 2 if the difference between the two u z 1 z 2 is greater than zero the treaty is signed we therefore use u as a measure of the utility of the treaty compared with the nash equilibrium this variable represents the expected net increase in utility for two honest players entering into a treaty accounting for the fact that each player has uncertainty about the behavior of the other player who may try to cheat we use this variable as the primary outcome of the game thereby framing the issue of cooperation from the perspective of honest players we present a more formal solution to the game in section s1 including evaluating player beliefs and combinations of player strategies closed form solutions to the game were obtained using mathematica and included in an r package containing functions to evaluate the transboundary aquifer game penny 2020 the r package was then used to generate results presented in subsequent sections 3 results comparative statics of the two player game the results of the game demonstrate how incentives to cooperate depend on a variety of system characteristics that ultimately dictate whether both players are willing to sign a treaty as described above section 2 the decision of each player to cooperate depends on the expected utilities associated with signing or not signing the treaty given their beliefs on the type honest or fraud and actions of the other player we proceed to analyze the comparative statics of the game by considering how model outcomes vary for different combinations of driving parameters fig 3 to simplify this task we analyze the symmetric game where all parameters are equivalent for each of the two players we especially focus on the interactive effects of groundwater connectivity d i j d i i 0 1 the unit value of water α i and trust λ i on the utility of a treaty u groundwater connectivity represents the rate at which players reduce the water level of the other player relative to the rate at which they reduce their own water level we note that groundwater connectivity will generally increase with greater hydraulic conductivity a distinct but more common term which represents the ability of porous media to transmit water klute 1965 the remaining parameters α i λ i and u are defined above section 2 3 1 groundwater connectivity groundwater connectivity affects the interdependence of groundwater resources of both players all else being held constant it can be considered the stakes of signing a treaty in the extreme case where the two players are almost entirely disconnected d i j d i i 0 neither player affects the abstraction costs of the other player there is no pumping cost externality and equilibrium pumping rates are exactly identical with and without treaty fig 4a under these conditions players are ambivalent about signing a treaty fig 4c white and would only develop a preference if there exists some cost ϵ i 0 associated with the treaty in other words the stakes of the treaty are low at the upper extreme of connectivity d i i d i j 1 pumping by one player creates equivalent drawdown for both players i e a single cell or bathtub model brozović et al 2006 between these extremes increasing connectivity leads to an increasing pumping cost externality and the benefits and risks of a treaty both increase monotonically the difference in abstraction between the nash equilibrium fig 4a green and the treaty fig 4a blue represents the pumping cost externality that arises from individual utility maximization the risk of signing a treaty also increases with connectivity due to the greater reduction in abstraction for honest players which allows frauds to pump increasingly more when a treaty is signed fig 4a red 3 2 value of water the utility of a treaty u exhibits a non monotonic relation with the marginal benefit α i of using aquifer water as described in section 2 1 this marginal benefit can be either associated with the value of the goods produced with the water or with the opportunity costs of not having to rely on an alternative water source to meet a given water need at the lower extreme α i 0 neither player will use the aquifer because no marginal benefit can be generated from the abstracted water in the context of urban water supply both players exclusively use an alternative source because it is less expensive than groundwater pumping α i 0 means that the alternative water source is free of costs at the upper extreme α i both players produce a substantial marginal benefit from the abstracted water and do not wish to compromise their ability to exploit the aquifer in the context of urban water supply both players exclusively rely on the shared aquifer because the alternative source is too expensive in other words for a sufficiently high value of α i both players pump exactly their water demand q i regardless of the treaty unless some inherent cost arises ϵ i 0 in both situations α 0 and α players are ambivalent about signing a treaty which will be either useless α 0 no one uses the aquifer or toothless α no one will agree to restrict their consumption just as abstraction at the extremes obeys clear rules abstraction throughout the domain of α i follows predictable behavior which can be separated into clearly defined zones as shown in fig 4b as just argued when the marginal benefit of using the aquifer is lower than the cost of abstracting groundwater from the undisturbed water table depth i e α i β d 0 i neither player has incentive to exploit the shared aquifer i no abstraction zone in fig 4b as the marginal benefit of pumping α i increases past the threshold β d 0 i players start using the aquifer and pumping rates increase linearly with α i reliance on the aquifer increases as the marginal benefit of pumping increases the incentives to over pump given by the difference between honest and nash abstraction rates in fig 4b increase as do the risks of signing a treaty difference between the honest and fraud abstraction rates in fig 4b in this zone abstraction is cost limited meaning that players consider trade offs between the cost of groundwater and the marginal benefits of abstraction α i ii cost limited zone in fig 4b if α i is sufficiently high the fraudulent player will use the aquifer to the full extent of their capacity and pump q i in an urban water supply context they would rely entirely on the aquifer to meet their water need q i iii demand limited fraud at this point increasing values of α i will increase reliance on the aquifer in the absence of treaty nash in green on fig 4b but will not increase incentives to cheat fraud in red on fig 4b the aggregate effect is that the benefits of a treaty continue to increase while the risks decrease visible as a dip in the utility contour lines in fig 4d for even higher values of α i the nash equilibrium pumping rate reaches the threshold q i iv demand limited nash where the difference between pumping rates with and without a treaty diminishes and a treaty loses its ability to reduce abstraction for sufficiently high values of α i all players consume q i regardless of the treaty equivalent to the extreme case of α i described above v abstraction only the progressive decoupling of abstraction with the marginal benefit of pumping in zones iii v occurs due to the pumping threshold q i beyond which the marginal benefit of increasing consumption vanishes for urban users this threshold represents the total water need that needs to be satisfied for agricultural users this threshold is represented by the transition from water to another constraining factor e g land or labor that limits agricultural production in situations where this transition does not occur for reasonable values of q i e g in desert aquifers where labor and land are not constrained q i does not have an effect on pumping decisions and solution space becomes restricted to zones i and ii see fig 4 zone i indicates that the value of water is small enough that no groundwater is worth pumping in zone ii abstraction increases linearly with the value of water 3 3 trust trust plays an important role in model scenarios where players could benefit from a treaty but risk being cheated by a fraud the importance of trust depends on the relative risks and benefits of a treaty for each of the two players which we define relative to the nash no treaty scenario more precisely the benefit of a treaty is the difference in utility between the nash and treaty scenarios for two honest players given by u i q i h q j h u i q i n q j n the risk of a treaty is the difference between not signing a treaty and being cheated by a fraud given by u i q i n q j n u i q i h q j f note that these are the absolute benefits and risks of a treaty unweighted by trust benefits and risks are plotted against each other in fig 5 for each of the five zones as a percentage of utility in the nash equilibrium we note that with high trust frauds become emboldened and abstract greater quantities because they are more certain that they are cheating an honest player with lower trust the absolute risk would reduce but the expected risk i e weighted by 1 λ would increase the risks and benefits of a treaty are zero in the i no abstraction and v abstraction only zones because abstractions rates are equivalent in the treaty and no treaty scenarios as the marginal benefit of pumping α i increases in the ii cost limited zone the benefits and risks increase at proportional rates meaning that the trust required for a treaty remains constant fig 5a moving into the iii demand limited fraud zone the benefits of a treaty increase while the risks of a treaty reduce fig 5b the decreasing risk arises because fraud abstraction q i f is limited by demand q i and approaches abstraction in the nash as α i increases see fig 4 b in the iv demand limited nash zone the benefits and risks both decrease but the benefits decrease more rapidly than the risks fig 5c for this reason the trust required to sign a treaty increases dramatically at the upper end of this zone fig 4d these results demonstrate that a treaty can be signed across any of the zones but that zones ii and iii are most favorable because they require the lowest level of trust in zone iv a treaty can be achieved but requires a higher level of trust particularly near zone v 4 discussion 4 1 is the model realistic the genevese aquifer treaty signed by switzerland and france in 1978 offers a useful case study with which to assess cooperative outcomes in the transboundary aquifer game this treaty is the longest running transboundary aquifer agreement in the world eckstein and sindico 2014 and the only one to explicitly include incentives to limit abstraction rates burchi 2018 although the stylized formulation of the game cannot fully capture the complex social or hydrogeological characteristics of the genevese scenario we use the game to qualitatively reproduce the bilateral relations that took place between france and switzerland in negotiations leading up to the agreement the genevese aquifer runs along the southern border of the canton of geneva switzerland with portions of the aquifer extending into france fig 6ab the timeline of events in the genevese fig 6c allows us to explore multiple aspects of the transboundary situation geneva began utilizing the aquifer for water resources in the 1940s followed by the french communities in the 1960s water levels began declining in the 1960 and reached a critically low level after france began abstraction with water levels nearly falling below the level of many wells de los cobos 2018 both countries jointly decided to investigate the hydrogeophysical properties of the aquifer in 1972 de los cobos 2018 while individually beginning to explore alternative water sources swiss investigations found that treating water from lake geneva would be considerably more expensive than managed aquifer recharge to increase aquifer water levels and allow for additional abstraction de los cobos 2015 in 1975 the french side announced it would not use genevese water and would instead utilize an alternative source however they reversed course three years later and signed the treaty in 1978 managed aquifer recharge was initiated in 1980 and the treaty has been successfully operational since de los cobos 2018 we codified this timeline of events into the transboundary aquifer game by varying input parameters within monte carlo simulations to capture both uncertainty and nonstationarity in the input variables see section s2 in order to capture specific features of the genevese aquifer we modified the game described in section 2 to account for unconfined behavior and aquifer recharge see section s2 1 the model indicates that a treaty was more likely than not in 1974 then unlikely while france pursued inexpensive alternatives and again likely in 1978 when the treaty was actually signed the model results presented in figure s2 offer confidence that the transboundary aquifer game adequately captures key features of the treaty negotiation 4 2 a typology of transboundary groundwater cooperation the transboundary aquifer game provides a basis for identifying classes of transboundary groundwater agreements that seek to reduce pumping cost externalities by restricting pumping rates by one or both countries indeed by reconciling existing treaties with the model a typology of transboundary groundwater cooperation emerges that provides clearer distinctions between the agreements that have been signed the typology includes treaties that 1 explicitly regulate abstraction volumes the genevese 2 explicitly restrict abstraction within a buffer region near the border the disi and 3 rely on general principles to promote cooperation and collaboration fig 7 illustrates the general mapping of these agreements onto the transboundary aquifer game under different values of q i the horizontal axis is identical across all three panels and represents the marginal benefits of pumping water from the shared aquifer again these marginal benefits can be either interpreted as the marginal revenue associated with the goods produced with the abstracted water agriculture or the marginal opportunity cost associated with obtaining that water from an alternative source urban water supply the genevese treaty was signed in the context of increasing demand for water and depleting groundwater resources to the extent that some wells had dried i e shifting from panel a to b in fig 7 the motivation for cooperation therefore arose from the desire to preserve groundwater supplies in the aquifer and ensure access for both switzerland and france de los cobos 2018 given the small size of the aquifer and the close proximity of wells on either side of the border the only available option to ensure groundwater sustainability was to reduce abstraction the model demonstrates that the situation was favorable for cooperation given the joint depletion of groundwater availability of alternative supply and high trust between countries nevertheless negotiations were difficult at times and nearly fell through section 4 1 even as demand increased the incentive to cooperate was insufficient to sign a treaty until both sides realized that continued abstraction would result in runaway costs aquifer depletion and that neither player had an inexpensive alternative source of water in other words both players were satisfied with the status quo until it became untenable the disi agreement was signed in the context of increasing groundwater use by saudi arabia and jordan and the construction of the disi pipeline that conveys water from the aquifer to the largest city in jordan amman similar to the genevese both sides were concerned about declining water table levels and were confronted with the development of new water supply infrastructure in the case of the disi however groundwater depletion was driven primarily by domestic abstraction on either side of the border and not by mutual depletion müller et al 2017 this allowed the disi agreement to emerge which places no limits on the quantity of groundwater abstraction but restricts abstraction near the shared border the effect of the disi approach is that pumping by either player has little effect on water levels of the other player because of the large distance between wells on either side of the border müller et al 2017 the essential achievement of this approach is to avoid pumping cost externalities without the need for a treaty to reduce abstraction which would be politically unappealing additionally the model indicates that trust as defined in the model has little effect on the expected outcomes when connectivity is low because of the minimal effect each player has on the other player s well drawdown the treaty reframes groundwater depletion as a domestic issue because either side does not deplete their groundwater more quickly than they might have if the aquifer was not internationally shared furthermore limiting connectivity reduces the stakes of the treaty and could facilitate higher trust between countries by lowering risks and rewards see poteete et al 2010 hoffman 2002 more generally a high marginal revenue of water α combined with a low demand threshold q indicates situations where both parties are heavily reliant on the aquifer either to produce a high value output or because any alternative source of water would be prohibitively expensive under these conditions use of the shared aquifer becomes inelastic to its own cost providing little room for either party to restrict their abstraction as in fig 7c limiting connectivity in such situations as was done in the disi saq ram aquifer may be the most viable option the remaining agreements lack any regulation of groundwater abstraction but rather build a foundation for cooperation by establishing best practices aquifer assessment and monitoring initiatives do no harm principles to limit overdraft and pollution and a diplomatic framework for resolving disputes burchi 2018 with the exception of the guarani where annual abstractions represent a small fraction 3 of annual recharge and the primary concerns include vulnerability to contamination in unconfined zones of the aquifer and long term declining water storage in portions of the confined aquifer with slow recharge sindico et al 2018 all other agreements concern aquifers situated in arid regions where alternative water sources are expensive depending on the aquifer and the scale of interest e g local versus national these aquifers also exhibit a range of connectivity we therefore place these treaties on the right side of fig 7 while acknowledging that they could be situated in a range of scenarios or zones it is important to note that the model developed in this study focuses on a specific type of agreement that limits water abstraction volumes in order to maximize the joint utility of the users consequently the model does not directly evaluate the feasibility of any other types of agreement instead the model can be used to identify likely reasons why a volume based agreement did not emerge and can help us interpret the type of agreement that did emerge for instance the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas agreement provides for a mechanism for information sharing and joint hydrogeologic modeling efforts modeling results suggest that although drawdown near pumping centers can be substantial transboundary drawdown is likely minimal even in regions where pumping centers are located near national borders voss and soliman 2014 this places the nsas aquifer in the low connectivity region at the very bottom of fig 7 however the model also outlines the risk of oasis loss and associated environmental impacts due to dropping water tables voss and soliman 2014 among other benefits information sharing associated with the agreement improves modelling accuracy to allow countries to monitor and mitigate these domestic issues government of egypt government of libya government of chad government of sudan 2013 in the case of the iullemeden taoudeni tanezrouft aquifer system itas water levels have been affected by expanding agriculture into low rainfall area and land use changes in the recharge zone over the past decades these effects will be exacerbated by a predicted decrease in precipitation and increase in evaporation associated with climate change in the sahel region these changing conditions might alter the location of the itas in parameter space in fig 7 with substantial associated uncertainty the memorandum of understanding provides for a consultation mechanism for information gathering information exchange and decision making for sustainable water resource management of the aquifer eckstein and dodo 2012 in the case of the northwestern sahara aquifer system commonly referred to by its french acronym sass locally high transboundary connectivity and extreme water scarcity sahara and sahel observatory 2003 place the aquifer in the upper right corner of fig 7 where a volume base agreement is unlikely instead the riparian countries have created a consultative mechanism that includes a permanent technical committee tasked with information sharing and managing a joint aquifer model this process allowed regions with high vulnerability or high exploitation potential to be mapped to possibly optimize the spatial location of exploitation regions sahara and sahel observatory 2003 these findings collectively demonstrate that multiple classes of regulatory frameworks are available to limit groundwater abstraction and prevent pumping cost externalities in transboundary aquifers but that each one requires particular circumstances to be met in particular the zones relate connectivity and value of water with plausible treaty outcomes for instance limiting abstraction is a viable option in the cost limited zone ii with the reasonable availability of an alternative water source but may be politically challenging in the demand limited nash iv and abstraction only v zones which require exceptionally high trust in zones iv and v limiting connectivity is a reasonable approach to reduce transboundary externalities provided connectivity is low to begin with otherwise agreements that rely on general principles to promote cooperation are more tractable lastly groundwater use tends to expand and increase over time this means that connectivity is likely to increase as groundwater depleted areas expand and the stakes of cooperation will escalate it could also mean that some aquifers transition to zones ii and iii from zones iv and v creating both challenges and opportunities for cooperation the intensification of groundwater use and interdependence means that transboundary cooperation will become increasingly important 5 conclusions transboundary aquifers provide critical water supplies around the world but have received relatively little attention from the broader research community given the importance of the resource to help close this gap we develop a game theoretic model to explore the relationship between economic incentives and hydrogeological characteristics of transboundary aquifer cooperation with an emphasis on the role of trust by focusing on the pumping cost externality between two players that seek to minimize the cost of their water supply our analysis pertains to aquifer scenarios where two countries share a single border and cooperation entails reducing or limiting the pumping cost externality other scenarios with additional players e g aquifers shared by three or more countries different cooperative objectives i e other than the pumping cost externality or more complicated groundwater configurations e g a confined aquifer recharged by surface water in another country may yield different outcomes future work should also consider additional externalities related to groundwater abstraction including subsidence ecosystem degradation and water quality despite its limitations the model demonstrates how interactions among groundwater connectivity water demand and the economic value of water shape transboundary pumping cost externalities the typology encapsulates these principles by relating model outcomes with existing transboundary cooperative frameworks that seek to limit pumping cost externalities by 1 regulating abstraction volumes i e the genevese 2 restricting abstraction near the border i e the disi or 3 developing cooperative frameworks for learning about the aquifer and building trust given the theoretical foundation of the model we posit that these drivers transcend the unique features of these aquifers and likely affect economic incentives for transboundary aquifer cooperation more generally furthermore in combination with the model the typology of treaties presents an opportunity to broadly identify aquifers that might be amenable to cooperation or those that risk escalating into crises over transboundary water resources data availability the r package for the transboundary aquifer game is archived on zenodo

266,this study presents novel exact analytical solutions to a set of simultaneous three dimensional advection dispersion equations coupled with a sequential first order degradation reaction network involving distinct retardation factor values among individual species the analytical solutions to the coupled partial differential equation system subject to both the first and third type inlet source boundary conditions are derived by consecutive application of the three integral transformations in combination with sequential substitutions the correctness of the developed analytical solutions is confirmed through numerical comparisons of three verification examples between our derived exact analytical solutions and a three dimensional single species analytical model in a semi infinite domain a two dimensional multispecies exact analytical model in a finite domain and a three dimensional multispecies semi analytical model in a semi infinite domain of the previous studies respectively the advantage of the derived analytical solutions is that its computational efficiency is 104 times the computational efficiency of two dimensional multispecies analytical solutions for a finite domain when two solutions are simultaneously used to solve a two dimensional multispecies transport problem the developed analytical solutions are then used to evaluate the performance of the public domain biochlor model that simulates aquifer remediation by natural attenuation of dissolved multispecies at a chlorinated solvent contaminated site provided by the center for subsurface modeling support csmos of usepa results show that the biochlor model that was developed based on three dimensional analytical model assuming a single retardation factor value for all dissolved species would not be suitable for simulating most multispecies plume migration at contaminated sites where each contaminant has its own retardation factor value the effects of the inlet source boundary conditions on the multispecies plume migration are also investigated the high computational efficiency of the developed analytical model in this current study renders it a very efficient tool for executing a probabilistic health risk assessment involving a large number of simulations required for problems of multispecies transport of dissolved chlorinated solvent in groundwater at a contaminated site with uncertainties in many different variables keywords analytical solutions multispecies biochlor three dimensional sequential first order degradation reaction network computational efficiency 1 introduction problems with groundwater pollution have grown increasingly serious in many countries during the past several decades to establish a sound groundwater utilization plan and avoid contaminated groundwater posing high threats to human health a reliable physically based mathematical model is required to delineate the extent of the migration of the contaminant in the plume mathematical models in which the advection dispersion equations ades are analytically or numerically solved are widely used for understanding plume migration of contaminants in the subsurface environment although analytical models require the simplification of many assumptions they remain necessary because it is much easier to perform the sensitivity analysis to determine which are the important parameters that affect contaminant transport as compared to numerical models moreover analytical models can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a numerical code or determining the optimal grid size for executing a numerical simulation many analytical solutions for single species transport have been published in the literature van genuchten and alves 1982 batu and van genuchten 1990 leij et al 1991 park and zhan 2001 chen et al 2002 zhan et al 2009 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 however some contaminants such as chlorinated solvents radionuclides nitrogen and pesticides generally decay degrade to produce other compounds called daughter compounds following a sequential first order degradation reaction sequences the sequential first order degradation reaction refers to series of first order reactions where species reacts to form an intermediate species which then reacts to form the product which sequentially reacts to form the other product in the sequential first order degradation reaction the change of the concentration for each compound due to degradation reaction is described by using the first order reaction kinetic equations and all contaminants in the series are linked for example in this study during the process of sequential degradation reactions the concentration of original contaminants pce will decrease but the final product eth will increase continuously however because the each daughter product in the series is linked to each other the concentrations of the intermediate degradation products tce dce and vc will increase or decrease depending on the different reaction rate constants of the species or its parent species these daughter compounds may be more toxic hazardous or migrate farther than the original contaminants these single species models do not permit the transport behaviors of daughter compounds of these degradable contaminants to be correctly evaluated analytical models for multispecies transport in which a set of simultaneous ades coupled with a series of first order decay degradation reactions are solved would be more useful for accurate and efficient evaluation of the transport behavior of such degradable contaminants in the subsurface environment over the past few decades relatively few analytical models for coupled multispecies transport have been presented as compared to the large body of single species analytical solutions most of the analytical solutions for coupled multispecies ades currently found in the literature have only been derived for one dimensional groundwater transport problems cho 1971 van genuchten 1985 sun and clement 1999 srinivasan and clement 2008a 2008b pérez guerrero et al 2009 2010 chen et al 2012a 2012b 2019a mieles and zhan 2012 suk 2013 2016 chen et al 2018 wang and neville 2019 chaudhary and singh 2020 a limited number of analytical or semi analytical solutions for coupled three dimensional multispecies transport equations have been developed aziz et al 2000 bauer et al 2001 clement et al 2001 quezada et al 2004 sudicky et al 2013 chen et al 2019b among them the public domain biochlor model aziz et al 2000 that simulates aquifer remediation by natural attenuation of dissolved multispecies at a chlorinated solvent contaminated site provided by the center for subsurface modeling support csmos of usepa has been one of the most commonly used analytical models for three dimensional coupled multispecies transport a study of 45 chlorinated solvent sites by mcguire et al 2004 found that mathematical models were used at 60 of these sites and the public domain model biochlor aziz et al 2000 was the most popular the analytical solution embedded in the biochlor model aziz et al 2000 was derived based on the domenico s approximate analytical solution west et al 2007 and srinivasan et al 2007 showed that the use of the domenico s approximate solution could lead to a substantial error in the predicted concentration particularly when a large longitudinal dispersion coefficient is used moreover the decomposition method used for separating the set of coupled ades results in the biochlor model only valid for that each contaminant involved in the sequential degradation reaction network must have the same retardation factor value the retardation factor is used to account for the sorption processes of contaminants between the aqueous and sorbed phases which depend on the compositions of soil grains of porous medium and properties of individual chlorinated solvent species previous studies have been demonstrated that sorption processes can significantly affect the mobility of contaminants so it would not be realistic and unsuitable for assigning the same retardation factor values for all contaminants in the analytical solution embedded in biochlor when the multispecies plume migration of dissolved chlorinated solvent contaminants would be simulated aside from the biochlor analytical model some analytical solutions to coupled two or three dimensional multispecies ades can be used to simulate transport problems with distinct retardation factor values among individual species solutions are derived in the laplace domain from which the concentrations in real time domain are achieved with the aid of the numerical laplace inverse transform algorithm bauer et al 2001 quezada et al 2004 sudicky et al 2013 chen et al 2019b chen et al 2016 developed exact analytical solutions for multispecies transport in a finite domain groundwater system with distinct retardation factor values among individual species however the solutions were comprised of a summation of double infinite series expansions for the finite fourier cosine and generalized integral transform inversions respectively the solutions should sum up these two infinite series expansions term by term which needs the convergence tests to determine the optimal number of the required terms to the desired accuracy according to the convergence tests in chen et al 2016 the solutions required about 8 000 terms and 1 600 terms to achieve convergence for these two transform inversions thus the summation of the double infinite series expansions in chen et al 2016 often caused the computations of analytical solutions time consuming and computationally inefficient moreover mathematical evaluation of the infinite series solutions is difficult to achieve for problems of advective dominated multispecies transport according to previous studies in pérez guerrero et al 2009 chen et al 2012a the optimal number of the required terms are shown to increase with large peclet number pe for integral transform inverse chen et al 2012a indicated the required numbers for convergence are 25 5 000 and 250 000 for pe 1 10 and 40 for the first species the terms required 250 000 for pe 40 showed the series expansion summation required a large number of terms when pelect number is great and the condition caused the computational time was so inefficient in advective dominated multispecies transport besides the conventional numerical models such as rt3d clement 1997 mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 or hydrogeochem yeh et al 2004 can deal with three dimensional multispecies plume migration coupled with a sequential first order reaction network very well however most of the three dimensional reactive transport numerical models require considerable experience and expertise to model a problem of coupled multispecies plume migration of chemical mixtures of chlorinated contaminant and its degradation products the simulated results obtained using these numerical models commonly suffer from various numerical errors such as numerical oscillation and dispersion errors due to inappropriate mesh size or time step size or grid orientation effect large amount of field data lots of time and lots of money are required for the full rigorous and sophisticated numerical model unfortunately many sites do not satisfy these requirement these sites should benefit from a more practical and simpler analytical modeling approach based on the above review this study aims to develop novel analytical solutions to the three dimensional multispecies ades coupled with a sequential first order degradation reaction network subject to both the first and third type inlet source boundary conditions bcs the novel analytical solutions have three key features first the solutions are analytically derived in a semi infinite domain with mathematical expressions in terms of the combination of exponential and error functions make calculation tractable so that it is possible to develop the auxiliary computer program code for executing very efficient computations second the proposed analytical solutions is advantageous in calculating the concentrations for advection dominant transport problem because the proposed solution is closed and so it doesn t require many terms of summation series but only small number of terms to achieve to the desired accuracy finally the proposed solutions consider that each contaminant is allowed to have its own different retardation factor value thereby making it a more practical application in real situations a fortran computer code has been programmed for our proposed analytical solutions and can be freely downloaded from the supplementary information for readers who are interested in simulating three dimensional multispecies plume migration of chemical mixtures of chlorinated solvent contaminants 2 mathematical model this study develops novel analytical solutions to a set of three dimensional multispecies ades coupled with sequential first order degradation reactions in a groundwater system with a geometry l w h as schematically depicted in fig 1 l w and h are the domain length width and height respectively in field problems it can be reasonably assmed unidirectional flow within a finite region if there are no pumping or injection unidirectional groundwater flow direction is arranged to be coincide with the x axis direction for the development of analytical solutions the movement of each contaminant is controlled by the advection longitudinal x axis horizontal transverse y axis and vertical transverse z axis dispersion linear isothermal equilibrium sorption its own first order degradation reaction and mass accumulation contributed from the degradation of its parent compounds the ades for describing the coupled three dimensional reactive transport of each contaminant can be mathematically written as follows 1a d x 2 c 1 x y z t x 2 d y 2 c 1 x y z t y 2 d z 2 c 1 x y z t z 2 v c 1 x y z t x μ 1 r 1 c 1 x y z t r 1 c 1 x y z t t 0 x 0 y w 0 z h 1b d x 2 c i x y z t x 2 d y 2 c i x y z t y 2 d z 2 c i x y z t z 2 v c i x y z t x μ i r i c i x y z t g i 1 i μ i 1 r i 1 c i 1 x y z t r i c i x y z t t 0 x 0 y w 0 z h i 2 3 4 5 where ci x y z t is the concentration of the ith species in the aqueous phase ml 3 x y and z are the spatial coordinates l t is the time t dx dy and dz represent the dispersion coefficients in the x y and z directions l2t 1 v is the constant pore water velocity in the x direction lt 1 μ i is the first order degradation reaction rate constant of the ith species t 1 g i 1 i is the yield coefficient which describes the mass produced from parent species i 1 to species i ri is the retardation factor of the ith species note that in eqs 1a and 1b the degradation reactions are considered to occur simultaneously in both the aqueous and sorbed phases for the case where the degradation reactions occur only in the aqueous phase the μ i and μ i 1constants on the left hand sides of eqs 1a and 1b can be modified as follows μ i r i and μ i 1 r i 1 the groundwater system is assumed to be free of any contaminant mass for each contaminant at the initial time 2 c i x y z t 0 0 0 x 0 y w 0 z h i 1 2 3 4 5 some researchers were also interested in how system showed the response of the pre existing plume in the groundwater system to remedial actions it was common to specify the initial condition with the existing data in field directly zheng and bennett 2002 however the detailed information of the pre existing plumes such as the concentration distribution of the contaminants were infrequently known in detail to allow this approach to be achieved most chlorinated solvents released at the surface enter the subsurface in the form of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls that are denser than water dnapls may migrate downward into the groundwater system driven by gravity and capillary forces when dnapls encounter water in subsurface they begin to dissolve and partition into the dissolved phase it is assumed that the source mass of the residual dnapls trapped in the aquifer which would be dissolved into groundwater in saturated zone act as continuing sources of contaminant plumes down gradient thus as compared to the solute concentration exists in the system the source concentration is much more important and have significantly impact on the concentration distribution in the domain of system for long periods of time modeling the continuing sources for contaminant plumes can be done using two alternative approaches the boundary source and internal source promma 2010 for the internal source approach the contaminant sources are regarded as source sink terms inside the transport system that should be embedded in the ades as described in eqs 1a and 1b alternatively the boundary source approach treats the contaminant sources as bcs that are placed at the up gradient boundary of the transport system shown in fig 1 x 0 currently the boundary source approaches prevail over the internal source approaches for the development of most analytical models for contaminant transport therefore the constant concentration inlet bc for each species are typically used to indicate the dissolution from residual dnapls which is specified as follows 3a c i x 0 y z t c i 0 h y y 1 h y y 2 h z z 1 h z z 2 i 1 2 3 4 5 for the first type bc 3b d x c i x 0 y z t x v c i x 0 y z t v c i 0 h y y 1 h y y 2 h z z 1 h z z 2 i 1 2 3 4 5 for the third type bc where h is the heaviside function y 1 y 2 z 1 and z 2 are the four parameters used to specify the rectangular source area on up gradient boundary plane and c i 0 is the source concentration of the ith species applied on the rectangular source area to facilitate the derivation of analytical solutions the exit boundary conditions for each individual species are specified at infinity as follows 4 c i x y z t 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 since there are no components of velocity in both y and z directional in the current study it will be assumed no contaminant flux moving across the right and left boundary plane in the y direction and the upper and lower boundary plane in the z direction thus the other four boundary conditions for each individual species are usually denoted as 5 c i x y 0 z t y 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 6 c i x y w z t y 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 7 c i x y z 0 t z 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 8 c i x y z h t z 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 the initial boundary value problem defined in eqs 1 8 are analytically solved by successive implementation of the laplace transform with respect to t and the finite fourier cosine transform techniques twice with respect to y and z respectively the details of the derivation and the final analytical solutions in the original domain in the sequence of degradation reaction network are provided in appendix a the proposed solutions in this current study are exact furthermore the proposed solutions can calculate more efficiently because they don t require numerical laplace transform inversion employed in chen et al 2019b and also need only small numbers of about 300 and 350 terms for summing double infinite series for performing the finite fourier cosine transform inversions twice 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the derived analytical solutions the developed three dimensional multispecies analytical solutions are comprehensively verified against a single species analytical solution adopted from the 3dade module of stanmod leij and bradford 1994 and two multispecies analytical semi analytical models from published studies chen et al 2016 chen et al 2019b the three verification examples are needed for the following three reasons the first example is to verify capability of our developed analytical model of accurately simulating solute transport problem with various peclet numbers pe previous studies showed the analytical solutions in a finite system are in the form of infinite series and the series solutions would converge slowly for problems of advective dominated multispecies transport which is relatively large values of pe van genuchten and alves 1982 chen et al 2012a in current study we are interesting about how the wide range of pe that can be applied in the developed model the second example is that our developed model is verified for the purpose of illustrating that our developed three dimensional analytical model can simulate two dimensional solute transport problem accurately the third example was to illustrate capability of our developed model to deal with real situation of three dimensional transport problem in the first verification example we perform numerical comparisons between our developed analytical solutions and the 3dade leij and bradford 1994 analytical solution the simulated scenario is adapted from one of the illustrative examples used in 3dade leij and bradford 1994 this study considers a homogeneous saturated aquifer which extends infinitely along the positive x direction along both the positive and negative y directions along both the positive and negative z directions subject to a rectangular patch source as schematically shown in fig 2 the geometry of the aquifer system and the transport parameters for this verification example are summarized in table 1 fig 3 shows a numerical comparison between spatial concentration profiles along a straight line oriented in the x direction and going through the center of the rectangular patch source at t 1 year obtained using different longitudinal dispersion coefficients dx from our derived analytical solutions and 3dade for the first type and third type bcs respectively the verification is established by numerical comparisons in which there is excellent agreements between our derived solutions and the 3dade leij and bradford 1994 analytical solution for a wide range of longitudinal dispersion coefficients dx as shown in fig 3 the second verification example is designed to compare the two dimensional multispecies plume migration for a semi infinite domain obtained using our derived solutions and two dimensional multispecies analytical solutions for a finite domain of chen et al 2016 notice that the analytical solutions of chen et al 2016 are derived only for the third type inlet bcs according to chen et al 2011 in order to obtain the analytical solutions for the first type inlet bcs an appropriate auxiliary eigenvalue problem and the associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are selected and then the same solution procedures of chen et al 2016 can be applied to obtain the analytical solutions for the first type inlet bcs the simulation scenario is adapted from the illustrative biochlor example from the biochlor user s manual aziz et al 2000 this illustrative example was designed to reproduce the movement of the plumes from 1965 to 1998 at a contaminated site at cape canaveral air station florida the example involves the plume migrations of five species chlorinated solvent decay chain at a groundwater contaminated site following a straight first order reaction network tetrachloroethylene pce trichloroethylene tce dichloroethylene dce vinyl chloride vc ethylene eth the simulation conditions and transport parameters for this verification example are summarized in table 2 except the yield coefficients of 1 the conceptual model of this problem for which the geometry of the groundwater system is l w h 330 7 m 213 4 m 17 m is shown in fig 4 constant concentrations source areas of the five species dissolved chlorinated solvents is illustrated as a rectangular patch with the dimensions of 90 7 m y 122 7 m and 0 m z 17 m at the inlet source boundary x 0 it should be noted that vertical variations in plume concentrations of five species in the z direction can be safely ignored since the constant source concentrations of five species are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the z direction and the depth of sources coincide with the thickness of the aquifer as shown in fig 4 figs 5 and 6 depict the two dimensional spatial concentration contours of the five species on the x y plane at t 10 years obtained from the three dimensional analytical solutions in a semi infinite system developed in this current study and the two dimensional analytical model in a finite system for the first and third type bcs of chen et al 2016 respectively as expected there are close matches between the five species spatial concentration contours produced by the two solutions for the first type and third type bcs respectively notably the spatial concentration contours of five species for the first type bcs are higher those for the third type bcs especially for the area adjacent to the inlet boundary the third verification example is used to test the correctness of the three dimensional multispecies plume migration simulations of our developed solutions the verification is implemented by numerical comparisons of our derived solutions and the semi analytical solutions developed by chen et al 2019b it is noted that chen et al 2019b developed solutions only for the third type inlet bcs however the analytical solutions for the first type inlet bcs can be easily obtained following the same solution procedures of chen et al 2019b the scenario is similar to the second verification example except that the depth of the source is arranged to cover only about one third the thickness of the aquifer 43 m z 60 m as shown in fig 7 figs 8 and 9 show numerical comparisons between the spatial concentration profiles of the five species along a straight line that orients the positive x direction and goes through the center of the rectangular patch source area at t 1 5 10 and 20 years obtained from the three dimensional exact analytical solutions for a semi infinite system developed in this study and the three dimensional semi analytical solutions for a semi infinite domain system for the first type and third type bcs respectively as can be seen in figs 8 and 9 the numerical comparisons show close correspondences between the spatial concentration profiles of the five species along the straight line that orients the positive x direction and goes through the center of the rectangular patch source as indicated by the blue dashed line shown in fig 7 at t 1 5 10 and 20 years obtained from the two solutions for both the first and third type bcs higher spatial concentrations for the first type bcs are found than those for the third type bcs especially for the pce tce and dce species the effects of the inlet source bcs are further investigated in section 3 3 the above three verification examples clearly demonstrate the correctness of our exact analytical solutions in addition to three verification examples of our developed analytical solutions the computational efficiencies of the computer program codes corresponding to chen et al s 2016 2019b and our solutions are evaluated by using the second verification example the cpu running time for calculating concentrations of 5 species on an intel r pentium r cpu n3540 2 16 ghz computer with a microsoft windows 10 operating system are tabulated in table 3 obviously our analytical solutions have the highest computational efficiency for all species at least 9 000 and 3 000 folds faster than chen et al s 2016 and 2019b solutions respectively the reason why the proposed analytical solution has superior computational efficiency over that of chen et al s 2019b is that the proposed analytical solution doesn t employ the numerical laplace transform inversion furthermore the proposed analytical solutions require only less than 400 terms of summation series on double infinite series expansions for the finite fourier cosine transform inversions twice for achieving 3 decimal digits accuracy while in chen et al 2016 the infinite series expansion for the generalized integral transform inversion requires about more than 8 000 terms for 3 decimal digits accuracy therefore the biggest advantage of the computational efficiency of our proposed exact solutions renders them suitable for executing a large number of simulations within a reasonable time frame for example lemke and bahrou 2009 applied the analytical solution to investigate the sensitivity of increased cancer risk to 22 different variables associated with pce transport in the groundwater at a contaminated site through 22 000 simulations 3 2 evaluating the performance of biochlor using the developed model the biochlor model is limited to the condition that all specie considered in the degradation reaction network must have the same retardation factor value whereas our developed analytical solutions are free from this limitation in real world problems each contaminant in the plume should have its own specific retardation factor value accordingly we are interested in investigating the possible numerical deviation of the biochlor model for predicting the plume migration of dissolved chlorinated solvents at a contaminated site assuming specific retardation factor values for individual chlorinated solvent species the scenario is similar to the second verification example in which the geometry of the groundwater system is l w h 330 7 m 213 4 m 17 m as shown in fig 10 the parameters summarized in table 2 are considered to ascertain the performance of the biochlor model for our derived analytical solutions we assign the retardation factor values of pce tce dce vc and eth are 7 13 2 87 2 80 1 43 and 5 35 respectively the median of retardation factor values for the five species is assigned in the biochlor model fig 11 shows numerical comparisons of the spatial concentration profiles of five species along a blue dashed line indicated in fig 10 which orients the positive x direction and goes through the center of the rectangular patch source area y 106 7 m z 8 5 m at 1 year and 10 years obtained from the three dimensional exact analytical solutions developed in this current study and the biochlor model when simulating the tce rtce 2 87 and dce rdce 2 8 whose retardation factor values are close to the median of retardation factor values for the five species 2 87 the simulation results obtained with our developed analytical solutions and the biochlor model correspond closely with each other as shown in fig 11 b and c however for pce rpce 7 13 whose retardation factor value is much larger than the median of retardation factor values for the five species the results predicted by biochlor show a higher concentration than those predicted by our exact analytical solutions thus the biochlor model overestimates the mobility of pce plume as shown in fig 11 a on the other hand for vc rvc 1 43 with a retardation factor value significantly smaller than 2 87 the results predicted by the biochlor model show a lower concentration than our developed solutions thus the biochlor model underestimates the mobility of the vc plume as shown in fig 11 d it should be noted that for a longer elapsed time 10 years the difference propagated between the concentration predicted by the biochlor model and our solutions become more pronounced especially for vc and eth the results clearly illustrate that the biochlor model is not suitable for simulating plume migration of chlorinated solvent in groundwater at a contaminated site where the retardation factor values of the individual contaminants differ from the median of retardation factor values for the five species at the same time the above comparisons also demonstrate how important it is to consider the difference in retardation factor values among individual species for the development of the analytical solutions for simulating multispecies plume migration of degradable contaminants in the field application 3 3 effect of inlet source bcs on the multispecies plume migration the effects of the inlet source bcs on the solute transport of a single species have been extensively investigated in previous studies van genuchten and alves 1982 batu and van genuchten 1990 chen et al 2011 they reached the conclusion that the first type bc gives rise to physically improper mass conservation and so overestimates the solute concentration for a groundwater system with a large longitudinal dispersion coefficient especially for the observed concentrations at locations near the inlet source boundary however unlike the cases of single species transport the effects of the inlet bcs on the multispecies plume movements are investigated by a numerical comparison between the solutions for the first type and third type bcs derived in current study the second example for which the parameters are summarized in table 2 in section 3 1 is considered for execution of the numerical comparison fig 12 shows the numerical comparisons between the two dimensional spatial concentration contours of five species on the x y plane at a depth of z 8 5 m as it intersects the centerline of the rectangular patch source area indicated by blue dashed line in fig 4 for the first and third type inlet bcs at t 1 year fig 12 shows the obvious differences between the predicted concentration contours of the five species for the first type and the third type bcs for instance the simulated tce concentrations for the third type inlet bcs are all below 11 g m3 over the entire domain whereas the tce concentrations greater than 13 g m3 are observed for areas adjacent to the inlet source boundary for the first type inlet bcs indicated in red similarly the dce concentration for the third type inlet bcs is obviously lower below 70 g m3 over the entire domain whereas concentrations for the first type bcs are greater than 80 g m3 in the neighborhood of the inlet source boundary indicated in red in addition it can be seen that migration of the plumes of vc and eth is faster for the first type bcs than for the third type bcs it can be found from the observations that the highest eth concentration for the first type bcs occurs at a distance of 16 m away from the inlet source boundary while the highest eth concentration is observed at a distance of 8 m away from the inlet source boundary for the third type bc it can be concluded that the analytical solutions derived using the first type bcs predict markedly higher concentrations for the first three species of the sequential reaction network and high mobility for the last two species of the sequential reaction network than the solutions derived for the third type bcs selection of appropriate and reasonable inlet source bcs also plays a crucial role in accurately simulating multispecies plume migration 3 4 application of the developed model the derived analytical solutions are applied to investigate how the dispersion coefficients affect the three dimensional plume migrations of five species at a site contaminated with chlorinated solvent the application example is similar to the third verification example the simulation conditions and transport parameters are similar to those shown in fig 7 and tabulated in table 2 all the parameters are kept the same except that the three dispersion coefficients dx dy and dz are all increased by a factor of two the computational efficiencies of the computer program codes for our solutions in three dimensional simulation are also evaluated the average cpu running time for calculating the five species concentrations of one observation only takes 2 s computer clock time on a same operating system described in section 3 1 fig 13 illustrates of the three dimensional spatial visualization of the plume migration of the five species on two x y planes at z of 43 and 60 m at 10 years under two different combinations of the dispersion coefficients as expected all the concentration plumes of the 5 species develop over larger contaminated areas for the combination of the larger dispersion coefficients 4 conclusions this study presents exact analytical solutions to a set of simultaneous advection dispersion equations coupled by a sequential first order reaction network involving distinct retardation factor values among individual species the verification of our derived analytical solutions is confirmed by a series of numerical comparisons of our developed analytical solutions with the three analytical solutions published in previous studies application of the developed analytical solutions to evaluate the performance of biochlor model shows that the biochlor model may underestimate or overestimate the concentrations when the retardation factors of individual species are significantly different from the median retardation factor value of five species investigation of how the inlet source boundary condition affects the multispecies plume migration indicates that the analytical solutions derived for the first type bcs predict markedly higher concentrations of the first three species of the sequential first order reaction network and higher mobility of the last two species of the sequential first order reaction network than the solutions derived for the third type bcs the newly proposed exact analytical solutions have the advantage of validity for distinct retardation factor values among individual species and high efficiency of the solution computation thus making it an efficient tool for executing the large number of simulations required for problems of multispecies transport of dissolved chlorinated solvent in groundwater at a contaminated site with uncertainties

omit the second order partial differential terms with respect to y 2 c i l y 2 in eqs a 2 and a 3 the finite fourier cosine transform of ci l x y z s with respect to y is defined by the following

after using the first finite fourier cosine transform defined in eq a11 the finite fourier cosine transform of ci fy x m z s with respect to z is defined by the following transformation relations a 13

imposing the boundary conditions of eqs a 17 a 21 on the general solution a 22 to yield b 1 and b 2 and inserting the obtained b 1 and b 2 into eq a 15 one obtains c 1 f z x m n s written as follows a

ultimately the regular time space analytical solutions of the concentrations for individual species can be readily obtained by successive application of the finite fourier cosine transform inversion twice as defined in eqs a 12 and a 14 and the laplace transform inversion the laplace transform inversion is achieved by making use of the formulas summarized in table a 1 after taking the finite fourier cosine transform inversion twice and the laplace transform inversion the final analytical solutions in the regular time space domain for species i is obtained as follows c i x y z t y 2 y 1 w

266,this study presents novel exact analytical solutions to a set of simultaneous three dimensional advection dispersion equations coupled with a sequential first order degradation reaction network involving distinct retardation factor values among individual species the analytical solutions to the coupled partial differential equation system subject to both the first and third type inlet source boundary conditions are derived by consecutive application of the three integral transformations in combination with sequential substitutions the correctness of the developed analytical solutions is confirmed through numerical comparisons of three verification examples between our derived exact analytical solutions and a three dimensional single species analytical model in a semi infinite domain a two dimensional multispecies exact analytical model in a finite domain and a three dimensional multispecies semi analytical model in a semi infinite domain of the previous studies respectively the advantage of the derived analytical solutions is that its computational efficiency is 104 times the computational efficiency of two dimensional multispecies analytical solutions for a finite domain when two solutions are simultaneously used to solve a two dimensional multispecies transport problem the developed analytical solutions are then used to evaluate the performance of the public domain biochlor model that simulates aquifer remediation by natural attenuation of dissolved multispecies at a chlorinated solvent contaminated site provided by the center for subsurface modeling support csmos of usepa results show that the biochlor model that was developed based on three dimensional analytical model assuming a single retardation factor value for all dissolved species would not be suitable for simulating most multispecies plume migration at contaminated sites where each contaminant has its own retardation factor value the effects of the inlet source boundary conditions on the multispecies plume migration are also investigated the high computational efficiency of the developed analytical model in this current study renders it a very efficient tool for executing a probabilistic health risk assessment involving a large number of simulations required for problems of multispecies transport of dissolved chlorinated solvent in groundwater at a contaminated site with uncertainties in many different variables keywords analytical solutions multispecies biochlor three dimensional sequential first order degradation reaction network computational efficiency 1 introduction problems with groundwater pollution have grown increasingly serious in many countries during the past several decades to establish a sound groundwater utilization plan and avoid contaminated groundwater posing high threats to human health a reliable physically based mathematical model is required to delineate the extent of the migration of the contaminant in the plume mathematical models in which the advection dispersion equations ades are analytically or numerically solved are widely used for understanding plume migration of contaminants in the subsurface environment although analytical models require the simplification of many assumptions they remain necessary because it is much easier to perform the sensitivity analysis to determine which are the important parameters that affect contaminant transport as compared to numerical models moreover analytical models can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a numerical code or determining the optimal grid size for executing a numerical simulation many analytical solutions for single species transport have been published in the literature van genuchten and alves 1982 batu and van genuchten 1990 leij et al 1991 park and zhan 2001 chen et al 2002 zhan et al 2009 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 however some contaminants such as chlorinated solvents radionuclides nitrogen and pesticides generally decay degrade to produce other compounds called daughter compounds following a sequential first order degradation reaction sequences the sequential first order degradation reaction refers to series of first order reactions where species reacts to form an intermediate species which then reacts to form the product which sequentially reacts to form the other product in the sequential first order degradation reaction the change of the concentration for each compound due to degradation reaction is described by using the first order reaction kinetic equations and all contaminants in the series are linked for example in this study during the process of sequential degradation reactions the concentration of original contaminants pce will decrease but the final product eth will increase continuously however because the each daughter product in the series is linked to each other the concentrations of the intermediate degradation products tce dce and vc will increase or decrease depending on the different reaction rate constants of the species or its parent species these daughter compounds may be more toxic hazardous or migrate farther than the original contaminants these single species models do not permit the transport behaviors of daughter compounds of these degradable contaminants to be correctly evaluated analytical models for multispecies transport in which a set of simultaneous ades coupled with a series of first order decay degradation reactions are solved would be more useful for accurate and efficient evaluation of the transport behavior of such degradable contaminants in the subsurface environment over the past few decades relatively few analytical models for coupled multispecies transport have been presented as compared to the large body of single species analytical solutions most of the analytical solutions for coupled multispecies ades currently found in the literature have only been derived for one dimensional groundwater transport problems cho 1971 van genuchten 1985 sun and clement 1999 srinivasan and clement 2008a 2008b pérez guerrero et al 2009 2010 chen et al 2012a 2012b 2019a mieles and zhan 2012 suk 2013 2016 chen et al 2018 wang and neville 2019 chaudhary and singh 2020 a limited number of analytical or semi analytical solutions for coupled three dimensional multispecies transport equations have been developed aziz et al 2000 bauer et al 2001 clement et al 2001 quezada et al 2004 sudicky et al 2013 chen et al 2019b among them the public domain biochlor model aziz et al 2000 that simulates aquifer remediation by natural attenuation of dissolved multispecies at a chlorinated solvent contaminated site provided by the center for subsurface modeling support csmos of usepa has been one of the most commonly used analytical models for three dimensional coupled multispecies transport a study of 45 chlorinated solvent sites by mcguire et al 2004 found that mathematical models were used at 60 of these sites and the public domain model biochlor aziz et al 2000 was the most popular the analytical solution embedded in the biochlor model aziz et al 2000 was derived based on the domenico s approximate analytical solution west et al 2007 and srinivasan et al 2007 showed that the use of the domenico s approximate solution could lead to a substantial error in the predicted concentration particularly when a large longitudinal dispersion coefficient is used moreover the decomposition method used for separating the set of coupled ades results in the biochlor model only valid for that each contaminant involved in the sequential degradation reaction network must have the same retardation factor value the retardation factor is used to account for the sorption processes of contaminants between the aqueous and sorbed phases which depend on the compositions of soil grains of porous medium and properties of individual chlorinated solvent species previous studies have been demonstrated that sorption processes can significantly affect the mobility of contaminants so it would not be realistic and unsuitable for assigning the same retardation factor values for all contaminants in the analytical solution embedded in biochlor when the multispecies plume migration of dissolved chlorinated solvent contaminants would be simulated aside from the biochlor analytical model some analytical solutions to coupled two or three dimensional multispecies ades can be used to simulate transport problems with distinct retardation factor values among individual species solutions are derived in the laplace domain from which the concentrations in real time domain are achieved with the aid of the numerical laplace inverse transform algorithm bauer et al 2001 quezada et al 2004 sudicky et al 2013 chen et al 2019b chen et al 2016 developed exact analytical solutions for multispecies transport in a finite domain groundwater system with distinct retardation factor values among individual species however the solutions were comprised of a summation of double infinite series expansions for the finite fourier cosine and generalized integral transform inversions respectively the solutions should sum up these two infinite series expansions term by term which needs the convergence tests to determine the optimal number of the required terms to the desired accuracy according to the convergence tests in chen et al 2016 the solutions required about 8 000 terms and 1 600 terms to achieve convergence for these two transform inversions thus the summation of the double infinite series expansions in chen et al 2016 often caused the computations of analytical solutions time consuming and computationally inefficient moreover mathematical evaluation of the infinite series solutions is difficult to achieve for problems of advective dominated multispecies transport according to previous studies in pérez guerrero et al 2009 chen et al 2012a the optimal number of the required terms are shown to increase with large peclet number pe for integral transform inverse chen et al 2012a indicated the required numbers for convergence are 25 5 000 and 250 000 for pe 1 10 and 40 for the first species the terms required 250 000 for pe 40 showed the series expansion summation required a large number of terms when pelect number is great and the condition caused the computational time was so inefficient in advective dominated multispecies transport besides the conventional numerical models such as rt3d clement 1997 mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 or hydrogeochem yeh et al 2004 can deal with three dimensional multispecies plume migration coupled with a sequential first order reaction network very well however most of the three dimensional reactive transport numerical models require considerable experience and expertise to model a problem of coupled multispecies plume migration of chemical mixtures of chlorinated contaminant and its degradation products the simulated results obtained using these numerical models commonly suffer from various numerical errors such as numerical oscillation and dispersion errors due to inappropriate mesh size or time step size or grid orientation effect large amount of field data lots of time and lots of money are required for the full rigorous and sophisticated numerical model unfortunately many sites do not satisfy these requirement these sites should benefit from a more practical and simpler analytical modeling approach based on the above review this study aims to develop novel analytical solutions to the three dimensional multispecies ades coupled with a sequential first order degradation reaction network subject to both the first and third type inlet source boundary conditions bcs the novel analytical solutions have three key features first the solutions are analytically derived in a semi infinite domain with mathematical expressions in terms of the combination of exponential and error functions make calculation tractable so that it is possible to develop the auxiliary computer program code for executing very efficient computations second the proposed analytical solutions is advantageous in calculating the concentrations for advection dominant transport problem because the proposed solution is closed and so it doesn t require many terms of summation series but only small number of terms to achieve to the desired accuracy finally the proposed solutions consider that each contaminant is allowed to have its own different retardation factor value thereby making it a more practical application in real situations a fortran computer code has been programmed for our proposed analytical solutions and can be freely downloaded from the supplementary information for readers who are interested in simulating three dimensional multispecies plume migration of chemical mixtures of chlorinated solvent contaminants 2 mathematical model this study develops novel analytical solutions to a set of three dimensional multispecies ades coupled with sequential first order degradation reactions in a groundwater system with a geometry l w h as schematically depicted in fig 1 l w and h are the domain length width and height respectively in field problems it can be reasonably assmed unidirectional flow within a finite region if there are no pumping or injection unidirectional groundwater flow direction is arranged to be coincide with the x axis direction for the development of analytical solutions the movement of each contaminant is controlled by the advection longitudinal x axis horizontal transverse y axis and vertical transverse z axis dispersion linear isothermal equilibrium sorption its own first order degradation reaction and mass accumulation contributed from the degradation of its parent compounds the ades for describing the coupled three dimensional reactive transport of each contaminant can be mathematically written as follows 1a d x 2 c 1 x y z t x 2 d y 2 c 1 x y z t y 2 d z 2 c 1 x y z t z 2 v c 1 x y z t x μ 1 r 1 c 1 x y z t r 1 c 1 x y z t t 0 x 0 y w 0 z h 1b d x 2 c i x y z t x 2 d y 2 c i x y z t y 2 d z 2 c i x y z t z 2 v c i x y z t x μ i r i c i x y z t g i 1 i μ i 1 r i 1 c i 1 x y z t r i c i x y z t t 0 x 0 y w 0 z h i 2 3 4 5 where ci x y z t is the concentration of the ith species in the aqueous phase ml 3 x y and z are the spatial coordinates l t is the time t dx dy and dz represent the dispersion coefficients in the x y and z directions l2t 1 v is the constant pore water velocity in the x direction lt 1 μ i is the first order degradation reaction rate constant of the ith species t 1 g i 1 i is the yield coefficient which describes the mass produced from parent species i 1 to species i ri is the retardation factor of the ith species note that in eqs 1a and 1b the degradation reactions are considered to occur simultaneously in both the aqueous and sorbed phases for the case where the degradation reactions occur only in the aqueous phase the μ i and μ i 1constants on the left hand sides of eqs 1a and 1b can be modified as follows μ i r i and μ i 1 r i 1 the groundwater system is assumed to be free of any contaminant mass for each contaminant at the initial time 2 c i x y z t 0 0 0 x 0 y w 0 z h i 1 2 3 4 5 some researchers were also interested in how system showed the response of the pre existing plume in the groundwater system to remedial actions it was common to specify the initial condition with the existing data in field directly zheng and bennett 2002 however the detailed information of the pre existing plumes such as the concentration distribution of the contaminants were infrequently known in detail to allow this approach to be achieved most chlorinated solvents released at the surface enter the subsurface in the form of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls that are denser than water dnapls may migrate downward into the groundwater system driven by gravity and capillary forces when dnapls encounter water in subsurface they begin to dissolve and partition into the dissolved phase it is assumed that the source mass of the residual dnapls trapped in the aquifer which would be dissolved into groundwater in saturated zone act as continuing sources of contaminant plumes down gradient thus as compared to the solute concentration exists in the system the source concentration is much more important and have significantly impact on the concentration distribution in the domain of system for long periods of time modeling the continuing sources for contaminant plumes can be done using two alternative approaches the boundary source and internal source promma 2010 for the internal source approach the contaminant sources are regarded as source sink terms inside the transport system that should be embedded in the ades as described in eqs 1a and 1b alternatively the boundary source approach treats the contaminant sources as bcs that are placed at the up gradient boundary of the transport system shown in fig 1 x 0 currently the boundary source approaches prevail over the internal source approaches for the development of most analytical models for contaminant transport therefore the constant concentration inlet bc for each species are typically used to indicate the dissolution from residual dnapls which is specified as follows 3a c i x 0 y z t c i 0 h y y 1 h y y 2 h z z 1 h z z 2 i 1 2 3 4 5 for the first type bc 3b d x c i x 0 y z t x v c i x 0 y z t v c i 0 h y y 1 h y y 2 h z z 1 h z z 2 i 1 2 3 4 5 for the third type bc where h is the heaviside function y 1 y 2 z 1 and z 2 are the four parameters used to specify the rectangular source area on up gradient boundary plane and c i 0 is the source concentration of the ith species applied on the rectangular source area to facilitate the derivation of analytical solutions the exit boundary conditions for each individual species are specified at infinity as follows 4 c i x y z t 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 since there are no components of velocity in both y and z directional in the current study it will be assumed no contaminant flux moving across the right and left boundary plane in the y direction and the upper and lower boundary plane in the z direction thus the other four boundary conditions for each individual species are usually denoted as 5 c i x y 0 z t y 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 6 c i x y w z t y 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 7 c i x y z 0 t z 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 8 c i x y z h t z 0 i 1 2 3 4 5 the initial boundary value problem defined in eqs 1 8 are analytically solved by successive implementation of the laplace transform with respect to t and the finite fourier cosine transform techniques twice with respect to y and z respectively the details of the derivation and the final analytical solutions in the original domain in the sequence of degradation reaction network are provided in appendix a the proposed solutions in this current study are exact furthermore the proposed solutions can calculate more efficiently because they don t require numerical laplace transform inversion employed in chen et al 2019b and also need only small numbers of about 300 and 350 terms for summing double infinite series for performing the finite fourier cosine transform inversions twice 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the derived analytical solutions the developed three dimensional multispecies analytical solutions are comprehensively verified against a single species analytical solution adopted from the 3dade module of stanmod leij and bradford 1994 and two multispecies analytical semi analytical models from published studies chen et al 2016 chen et al 2019b the three verification examples are needed for the following three reasons the first example is to verify capability of our developed analytical model of accurately simulating solute transport problem with various peclet numbers pe previous studies showed the analytical solutions in a finite system are in the form of infinite series and the series solutions would converge slowly for problems of advective dominated multispecies transport which is relatively large values of pe van genuchten and alves 1982 chen et al 2012a in current study we are interesting about how the wide range of pe that can be applied in the developed model the second example is that our developed model is verified for the purpose of illustrating that our developed three dimensional analytical model can simulate two dimensional solute transport problem accurately the third example was to illustrate capability of our developed model to deal with real situation of three dimensional transport problem in the first verification example we perform numerical comparisons between our developed analytical solutions and the 3dade leij and bradford 1994 analytical solution the simulated scenario is adapted from one of the illustrative examples used in 3dade leij and bradford 1994 this study considers a homogeneous saturated aquifer which extends infinitely along the positive x direction along both the positive and negative y directions along both the positive and negative z directions subject to a rectangular patch source as schematically shown in fig 2 the geometry of the aquifer system and the transport parameters for this verification example are summarized in table 1 fig 3 shows a numerical comparison between spatial concentration profiles along a straight line oriented in the x direction and going through the center of the rectangular patch source at t 1 year obtained using different longitudinal dispersion coefficients dx from our derived analytical solutions and 3dade for the first type and third type bcs respectively the verification is established by numerical comparisons in which there is excellent agreements between our derived solutions and the 3dade leij and bradford 1994 analytical solution for a wide range of longitudinal dispersion coefficients dx as shown in fig 3 the second verification example is designed to compare the two dimensional multispecies plume migration for a semi infinite domain obtained using our derived solutions and two dimensional multispecies analytical solutions for a finite domain of chen et al 2016 notice that the analytical solutions of chen et al 2016 are derived only for the third type inlet bcs according to chen et al 2011 in order to obtain the analytical solutions for the first type inlet bcs an appropriate auxiliary eigenvalue problem and the associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are selected and then the same solution procedures of chen et al 2016 can be applied to obtain the analytical solutions for the first type inlet bcs the simulation scenario is adapted from the illustrative biochlor example from the biochlor user s manual aziz et al 2000 this illustrative example was designed to reproduce the movement of the plumes from 1965 to 1998 at a contaminated site at cape canaveral air station florida the example involves the plume migrations of five species chlorinated solvent decay chain at a groundwater contaminated site following a straight first order reaction network tetrachloroethylene pce trichloroethylene tce dichloroethylene dce vinyl chloride vc ethylene eth the simulation conditions and transport parameters for this verification example are summarized in table 2 except the yield coefficients of 1 the conceptual model of this problem for which the geometry of the groundwater system is l w h 330 7 m 213 4 m 17 m is shown in fig 4 constant concentrations source areas of the five species dissolved chlorinated solvents is illustrated as a rectangular patch with the dimensions of 90 7 m y 122 7 m and 0 m z 17 m at the inlet source boundary x 0 it should be noted that vertical variations in plume concentrations of five species in the z direction can be safely ignored since the constant source concentrations of five species are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the z direction and the depth of sources coincide with the thickness of the aquifer as shown in fig 4 figs 5 and 6 depict the two dimensional spatial concentration contours of the five species on the x y plane at t 10 years obtained from the three dimensional analytical solutions in a semi infinite system developed in this current study and the two dimensional analytical model in a finite system for the first and third type bcs of chen et al 2016 respectively as expected there are close matches between the five species spatial concentration contours produced by the two solutions for the first type and third type bcs respectively notably the spatial concentration contours of five species for the first type bcs are higher those for the third type bcs especially for the area adjacent to the inlet boundary the third verification example is used to test the correctness of the three dimensional multispecies plume migration simulations of our developed solutions the verification is implemented by numerical comparisons of our derived solutions and the semi analytical solutions developed by chen et al 2019b it is noted that chen et al 2019b developed solutions only for the third type inlet bcs however the analytical solutions for the first type inlet bcs can be easily obtained following the same solution procedures of chen et al 2019b the scenario is similar to the second verification example except that the depth of the source is arranged to cover only about one third the thickness of the aquifer 43 m z 60 m as shown in fig 7 figs 8 and 9 show numerical comparisons between the spatial concentration profiles of the five species along a straight line that orients the positive x direction and goes through the center of the rectangular patch source area at t 1 5 10 and 20 years obtained from the three dimensional exact analytical solutions for a semi infinite system developed in this study and the three dimensional semi analytical solutions for a semi infinite domain system for the first type and third type bcs respectively as can be seen in figs 8 and 9 the numerical comparisons show close correspondences between the spatial concentration profiles of the five species along the straight line that orients the positive x direction and goes through the center of the rectangular patch source as indicated by the blue dashed line shown in fig 7 at t 1 5 10 and 20 years obtained from the two solutions for both the first and third type bcs higher spatial concentrations for the first type bcs are found than those for the third type bcs especially for the pce tce and dce species the effects of the inlet source bcs are further investigated in section 3 3 the above three verification examples clearly demonstrate the correctness of our exact analytical solutions in addition to three verification examples of our developed analytical solutions the computational efficiencies of the computer program codes corresponding to chen et al s 2016 2019b and our solutions are evaluated by using the second verification example the cpu running time for calculating concentrations of 5 species on an intel r pentium r cpu n3540 2 16 ghz computer with a microsoft windows 10 operating system are tabulated in table 3 obviously our analytical solutions have the highest computational efficiency for all species at least 9 000 and 3 000 folds faster than chen et al s 2016 and 2019b solutions respectively the reason why the proposed analytical solution has superior computational efficiency over that of chen et al s 2019b is that the proposed analytical solution doesn t employ the numerical laplace transform inversion furthermore the proposed analytical solutions require only less than 400 terms of summation series on double infinite series expansions for the finite fourier cosine transform inversions twice for achieving 3 decimal digits accuracy while in chen et al 2016 the infinite series expansion for the generalized integral transform inversion requires about more than 8 000 terms for 3 decimal digits accuracy therefore the biggest advantage of the computational efficiency of our proposed exact solutions renders them suitable for executing a large number of simulations within a reasonable time frame for example lemke and bahrou 2009 applied the analytical solution to investigate the sensitivity of increased cancer risk to 22 different variables associated with pce transport in the groundwater at a contaminated site through 22 000 simulations 3 2 evaluating the performance of biochlor using the developed model the biochlor model is limited to the condition that all specie considered in the degradation reaction network must have the same retardation factor value whereas our developed analytical solutions are free from this limitation in real world problems each contaminant in the plume should have its own specific retardation factor value accordingly we are interested in investigating the possible numerical deviation of the biochlor model for predicting the plume migration of dissolved chlorinated solvents at a contaminated site assuming specific retardation factor values for individual chlorinated solvent species the scenario is similar to the second verification example in which the geometry of the groundwater system is l w h 330 7 m 213 4 m 17 m as shown in fig 10 the parameters summarized in table 2 are considered to ascertain the performance of the biochlor model for our derived analytical solutions we assign the retardation factor values of pce tce dce vc and eth are 7 13 2 87 2 80 1 43 and 5 35 respectively the median of retardation factor values for the five species is assigned in the biochlor model fig 11 shows numerical comparisons of the spatial concentration profiles of five species along a blue dashed line indicated in fig 10 which orients the positive x direction and goes through the center of the rectangular patch source area y 106 7 m z 8 5 m at 1 year and 10 years obtained from the three dimensional exact analytical solutions developed in this current study and the biochlor model when simulating the tce rtce 2 87 and dce rdce 2 8 whose retardation factor values are close to the median of retardation factor values for the five species 2 87 the simulation results obtained with our developed analytical solutions and the biochlor model correspond closely with each other as shown in fig 11 b and c however for pce rpce 7 13 whose retardation factor value is much larger than the median of retardation factor values for the five species the results predicted by biochlor show a higher concentration than those predicted by our exact analytical solutions thus the biochlor model overestimates the mobility of pce plume as shown in fig 11 a on the other hand for vc rvc 1 43 with a retardation factor value significantly smaller than 2 87 the results predicted by the biochlor model show a lower concentration than our developed solutions thus the biochlor model underestimates the mobility of the vc plume as shown in fig 11 d it should be noted that for a longer elapsed time 10 years the difference propagated between the concentration predicted by the biochlor model and our solutions become more pronounced especially for vc and eth the results clearly illustrate that the biochlor model is not suitable for simulating plume migration of chlorinated solvent in groundwater at a contaminated site where the retardation factor values of the individual contaminants differ from the median of retardation factor values for the five species at the same time the above comparisons also demonstrate how important it is to consider the difference in retardation factor values among individual species for the development of the analytical solutions for simulating multispecies plume migration of degradable contaminants in the field application 3 3 effect of inlet source bcs on the multispecies plume migration the effects of the inlet source bcs on the solute transport of a single species have been extensively investigated in previous studies van genuchten and alves 1982 batu and van genuchten 1990 chen et al 2011 they reached the conclusion that the first type bc gives rise to physically improper mass conservation and so overestimates the solute concentration for a groundwater system with a large longitudinal dispersion coefficient especially for the observed concentrations at locations near the inlet source boundary however unlike the cases of single species transport the effects of the inlet bcs on the multispecies plume movements are investigated by a numerical comparison between the solutions for the first type and third type bcs derived in current study the second example for which the parameters are summarized in table 2 in section 3 1 is considered for execution of the numerical comparison fig 12 shows the numerical comparisons between the two dimensional spatial concentration contours of five species on the x y plane at a depth of z 8 5 m as it intersects the centerline of the rectangular patch source area indicated by blue dashed line in fig 4 for the first and third type inlet bcs at t 1 year fig 12 shows the obvious differences between the predicted concentration contours of the five species for the first type and the third type bcs for instance the simulated tce concentrations for the third type inlet bcs are all below 11 g m3 over the entire domain whereas the tce concentrations greater than 13 g m3 are observed for areas adjacent to the inlet source boundary for the first type inlet bcs indicated in red similarly the dce concentration for the third type inlet bcs is obviously lower below 70 g m3 over the entire domain whereas concentrations for the first type bcs are greater than 80 g m3 in the neighborhood of the inlet source boundary indicated in red in addition it can be seen that migration of the plumes of vc and eth is faster for the first type bcs than for the third type bcs it can be found from the observations that the highest eth concentration for the first type bcs occurs at a distance of 16 m away from the inlet source boundary while the highest eth concentration is observed at a distance of 8 m away from the inlet source boundary for the third type bc it can be concluded that the analytical solutions derived using the first type bcs predict markedly higher concentrations for the first three species of the sequential reaction network and high mobility for the last two species of the sequential reaction network than the solutions derived for the third type bcs selection of appropriate and reasonable inlet source bcs also plays a crucial role in accurately simulating multispecies plume migration 3 4 application of the developed model the derived analytical solutions are applied to investigate how the dispersion coefficients affect the three dimensional plume migrations of five species at a site contaminated with chlorinated solvent the application example is similar to the third verification example the simulation conditions and transport parameters are similar to those shown in fig 7 and tabulated in table 2 all the parameters are kept the same except that the three dispersion coefficients dx dy and dz are all increased by a factor of two the computational efficiencies of the computer program codes for our solutions in three dimensional simulation are also evaluated the average cpu running time for calculating the five species concentrations of one observation only takes 2 s computer clock time on a same operating system described in section 3 1 fig 13 illustrates of the three dimensional spatial visualization of the plume migration of the five species on two x y planes at z of 43 and 60 m at 10 years under two different combinations of the dispersion coefficients as expected all the concentration plumes of the 5 species develop over larger contaminated areas for the combination of the larger dispersion coefficients 4 conclusions this study presents exact analytical solutions to a set of simultaneous advection dispersion equations coupled by a sequential first order reaction network involving distinct retardation factor values among individual species the verification of our derived analytical solutions is confirmed by a series of numerical comparisons of our developed analytical solutions with the three analytical solutions published in previous studies application of the developed analytical solutions to evaluate the performance of biochlor model shows that the biochlor model may underestimate or overestimate the concentrations when the retardation factors of individual species are significantly different from the median retardation factor value of five species investigation of how the inlet source boundary condition affects the multispecies plume migration indicates that the analytical solutions derived for the first type bcs predict markedly higher concentrations of the first three species of the sequential first order reaction network and higher mobility of the last two species of the sequential first order reaction network than the solutions derived for the third type bcs the newly proposed exact analytical solutions have the advantage of validity for distinct retardation factor values among individual species and high efficiency of the solution computation thus making it an efficient tool for executing the large number of simulations required for problems of multispecies transport of dissolved chlorinated solvent in groundwater at a contaminated site with uncertainties

267,enhanced weathering ew scenarios are analyzed using the model presented in cipolla et al 2020 we explore the role of different hydroclimatic forcing on carbon sequestration efficiencies we also investigate whether increasing soil carbon content improves weathering conditions we link olivine weathering rates to ph variations and quantify the suitability of hydroclimatic regimes to ew based on rainfall intensity and frequency the results show that the amount of co 2 reacting with olivine and ending up in solution in the form of hco 3 and co 3 2 increases with mean annual precipitation map up to 2000 mm but then tapers off for higher maps on the contrary the sequestered co 2 continues to grow with map in a more significant way we also quantify the increase of nutrients availability especially when map exceeds 2000 mm lastly the results suggest that organic matter amendments are more effective in humid environments map higher than 2000 mm confirming the central role of hydrologic processes on ew keywords enhanced weathering carbon sequestration hydrology 1 introduction ew is a negative emission technology hegerl et al 2015 with great potential to sequester co 2 hartmann et al 2013 taylor et al 2017 this strategy is based on increasing the rate of chemical weathering a chemical biochemical reaction that naturally occurs in soils and bedrocks higher rates are achieved by adding crushed silicate minerals with higher reactive surface area than naturally occurring minerals the weathering rates of these minerals however are also affected by local hydrologic processes i e soil moisture dynamics plants soil organic matter dynamics and soil ph hartmann et al 2013 weil and brady 2017 a fact that complicates the estimates of the actual efficiency of ew mathematical models are needed in conjunction with experiments to elucidate the interactions between soil chemistry plants and olivine dissolution and predict weathering rates under variable environmental conditions towards this goal in a companion paper cipolla et al 2021 we developed a model coupling soil biogeochemical processes ph co 2 cation exchange and ecohydrological dynamics soil moisture plants to the dissolution of olivine in the soil root zone the model allows us to explore the role of precipitation hereafter named climate effect and its intermittency plants and other ecohydrologic processes as well as biogeochemistry on ew dynamics in this paper we employ detailed model simulations to answer the following questions which climates are more suitable to ew what are the rates of co 2 sequestration resulting from olivine dissolution for given climate and land use conditions including the presence of soil organic matter what is the order of magnitude of the nutrients increase in soil water due to olivine dissolution the main motivation that inspired this work is to quantify the role of hydrological processes on ew dynamics indeed characterizing various climate conditions with respect to ew could help decision makers to define the parts of the globe more suitable for amending soil with reactive minerals in perspective to put ew into practice to the best of our knowledge the actual rates of co 2 sequestration due to olivine dissolution in the field are not well defined as many studies hartmann et al 2013 renforth et al 2015 ten berge et al 2012 base their estimates on the theoretical limit of 1 25 g co 2 g oliv to this regard our model allows to better characterize the actual rates of co 2 sequestration considering the dynamics of bicarbonate hco 3 and carbonate co 3 2 ions in soil water resulting from olivine dissolution we also investigate whether we can improve ew by amending soil with organic matter since this can lead to a change in soil chemistry i e cation exchange and ph and in turn weathering rates another goal is related to quantify the increase of nutrients availability and ph as also noted by weil and brady 2017 and renforth et al 2015 due to olivine dissolution since in some cases these aspects can enhance plants productivity atkinson et al 2010 the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 gives a brief description of the model of its parameters and some used data to carry out the applications in this section a description of different simulation scenarios is also provided in section 3 we address the research questions by analyzing and discussing the results finally section 4 provides some conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview the model cipolla et al 2020 takes into account the fundamental interactions among ecohydrological e g plants water nutrients and biogeochemical e g ph cec processes driving mineral dissolution the external forces of the model can be either precipitation measurements or stochastic rainfall time series for long term simulations on the bases of the involved mass fluxes among the components of the model represented in fig 1 it is possible to write the related differential equations describing the mass balance and the chemical reactions of the involved elements the model simultaneously simulates the balance of soil organic carbon which is one of the co 2 sources in the system the dynamics of co 2 in the gas phase and of the part of it that reacts with water the dynamics of dissolved elements that do not contain carbon these include plant nutrients and the products of olivine dissolution i e silicates and mg 2 and the cation exchange capacity representative of the equilibrium exchanges between soil organic and inorganic colloids and the dissolved ions the model is summarized by a system of eight mass balance differential equations representative of the temporal dynamics of eight state variables namely the total carbon in the system c t co 2 a

particular attention to the temporal dynamics of soil water ph both with and without olivine since this has an impact on several other processes including the dissolved ions concentration dynamics and the suitability of the environment for plants it can be further considered as a proxy for assessing the amount of sequestered carbon from a certain mass of olivine as reported by the analyses conducted in this work 2 2 ew scenarios to assess the role of climate on ew and explore solutions aimed to enhance weathering rates and carbon sequestration we simulated the dissolution of olivine under different mean annual precipitation map scenarios we explored five scenarios labeled s1 to s5 characterized by the same average rainfall depth α but different storm frequencies λ resulting in map ranging from about 900 to 3000 mm details in table 1 we focused on this range because for map lower than 900 mm the environment is too dry for ew applications weil and brady 2017 while only a limited area of the globe has map higher than 3000 mm since we are interested in the role of climate on ew we maintained soil and vegetation properties constant for the sake of simplicity we did not carry out our analyses with reference to a forested soil in order to neglect the presence of aluminum in the system that as explained in cipolla et al 2020 would represent one of the major h sources for this strong acid soil for the background weathering we used the dissolution rate constant of anorthite in all scenarios we considered the addition of 10 kg of olivine after the soil biogeochemistry time series of c and of dissolved and adsorbed ca 2 mg 2 k and na had reached a statistically stationary regime consistent with the given climate the effects of olivine dissolution on soil chemistry and carbon sequestration were then analyzed after a simulated period of five years in order to look at the short middle term effects of olivine dissolution we here omit the long term effects of olivine dissolution since they are not consistent with the short middle term goals of carbon sequestration in order to counteract the greenhouse effect in any case the analyses may be extended to any time horizon we also explored to what extent organic matter amendments e g compost would increase weathering rates and carbon sequestration we simulated organic matter amendment by increasing the soil carbon input a d d in all scenarios by 0 2 gc m 2 d 1 table 1 or equivalently 73 gc m 2 y 1 on the basis of the amount of extractable organic carbon of grass cuttings baca et al 1996 about 25 g oc kg compost 1 this amount would correspond to 3 kg compost m 2 y 1 which is the typical average amount of compost used to amend an agricultural soil for each scenario the effect of organic amendment is assessed by maintaining the same time series of soil moisture as for the base scenarios without amendment to better isolate the changes in soil chemistry and carbon sequestration due to the additional organic matter as an example we here present a typical model simulation carried out with the parameters related to the s1 scenario presented in table 1 fig 2 shows the time series of the most representative variables of the model i e a soil moisture b organic matter concentration c co 2 concentration in the gas phase d alkalinity e total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration f mg 2 ca 2 and the sum of na and k concentrations g ph h weathering rate and i the reduction of olivine particles diameter related to a time interval of about three years after olivine addition as soil moisture increases there is a stronger decomposition of organic matter a lower ph and a greater weathering rate 2 3 parameterization the values for the parameters related to climate soil and vegetation are listed in table 2 we consider a sandy soil for all scenarios in order to better highlight the role of climate on ew without confounding factors deriving from different soil properties the specific cec of organic matter and clay colloids are extracted from weil and brady 2017 while the selectivity constants related to the cec from suarez and ŝimunek 1997 the values of add the maximum transpiration rate and the input of calcium magnesium potassium and sodium for the five considered climate scenarios are reported in table 1 we used typical levels of input of calcium magnesium potassium and sodium provided by pulido villena et al 2006 groshans et al 2019 mikhailova et al 2019 and suweis et al 2010 which scale according to map based on the observation that deposition increases with map pulido villena et al 2006 groshans et al 2019 mikhailova et al 2019 the mass fraction of anorthite is representative of all the minerals within the soil different than olivine consuming h due to their weathering processes this parameter is fixed equal to 1 but it could be modified in order to increase or decrease the term related to these weathering processes the diameter of the anorthite particles was assumed to be equal to that of the olivine particles the background weathering is fundamental to characterize the initial soil ph consistently with the given climate indeed this strongly affects olivine dissolution dynamics in this paper anyway the background weathering characteristics i e the mass fraction and diameter of anorthite particles are considered constant among the five analyzed climate scenarios mainly due to the fact that the main goal of the study is to explore the climate effects on ew therefore in order to isolate these effects all the soil and vegetation parameters do not have to vary with respect to map it is however worth noticing that for case study applications the background weathering parameters should be defined based on the soil properties under analysis olivine amendment is set to 10 kg olivine m 2 approximately equal to the amount used in the pot experiment by renforth et al 2015 the authors used 100 g of olivine for a cylindrical soil sample of diameter 0 1 m and height 1 m corresponding to about 12 kg olivine m 2 plant biomass productivity is positively correlated to map especially when this is higher than 600 mm porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2013 to take this aspect into account we rescaled the input of organic matter from plant litter add porporato et al 2003 according to the annual plant productivity of the given climate the increase of the map and plant biomass productivity also leads to a higher transpiration rate generally transpiration rate is linearly related to the canopy cover pelak et al 2017 which likely increases as the plant biomass productivity grows we thus rescaled the maximum transpiration rate according to map also based on typical values of potential evapotranspiration at the global scale weiß and menzel 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate effects climate mainly affects the dissolution of olivine and co 2 sequestration through its control on the soil moisture dynamics the latter in fact affects organic carbon decomposition soil ph and in turn olivine dissolution and leaching of dissolution products while in the next section a comparison between the dynamics under a dry s1 and a wet s5 scenarios is carried out in the sections 3 2 and 3 3 we then analyze the results provided by all five scenarios 3 1 1 temporal dynamics of soil moisture and organic carbon the time series of soil moisture and organic carbon for the s1 and s5 scenarios see table 1 are presented in fig 3 a and b respectively along with the probability distribution functions pdfs of soil moisture as expected while the soil water content under the s5 is on average higher than that of s1 an average of 0 26 in s5 and 0 11 in s1 the figure also shows that in the former there is higher variability as evident from the standard deviation 0 13 in s5 and 0 06 in s1 and more in general from the pdfs shape the propagation of soil moisture variability to the organic carbon depends on the inertia of the organic matter pool represented by the decomposition constant k d e c and the carbon concentration in the biomass pool c b as described in porporato et al 2003 and d odorico et al 2003 overall although the carbon input is higher in wetter climates table 1 the organic carbon mean concentration is higher in scenario s1 9 4 kgc m 3 than s5 8 8 kgc m 3 as the effect of faster decomposition prevails indeed wet environments are generally more suitable for the biomass to decompose the organic matter since microbial activity and consequently the decomposition rates are higher d odorico et al 2003 1973 scenario s1 also has higher standard deviation which is explained by the inverse proportionality between decomposition and soil moisture when the latter is above field capacity 3 1 2 ph soil moisture relation since in both simulations the same soil properties are considered the differences in ph dynamics are only due to a different soil water content and a different organic matter concentration which depends on the carbon input and decomposition rate in agreement with observations which report that at a global scale soils are more acidic in humid climates slessarev et al 2016 merry 2009 in our scenarios soil ph is generally higher in s1 6 6 on average than in s5 5 9 on average fig 4 a these ph levels are also in line with typical ph values found in wet and dry environments respectively see fig 3a in slessarev et al 2016 or merry 2009 this tendency originates from multiple factors one is related to the amount of h in rainfall in fact because of slight acidity of normal rain soils in regions with higher map receive more h furthermore as plants uptake nutrients from soil water such as ca 2 mg 2 k and na that are positively charged they release h ions to balance the extra uptake of positively charged ions and maintain a neutral charge this is favored in wetter climates with higher plant water and nutrient uptake rates lastly due to the low leaching dry soils tend to accumulate alkaline ions such as carbonate and bicarbonate ions mainly generated from the organic matter decomposition that can react with h and help maintain higher soil ph looking at the probability density functions pdfs it is also evident that scenario s5 presents a slightly higher variability as confirmed by the standard deviation values 0 32 in s5 and 0 30 in s1 by looking at its pdf we notice the presence of a double peak and that especially when the ph is high it tends to remain at this level for a certain amount of time before decreasing a high ph is associated to low soil moisture values see fig 4b and consequently given the low decomposition rate to high concentrations of organic carbon this leads to a high organic cec and thus to a strong buffering capacity and resistance to ph variations therefore in these conditions the cec tends to keep the ph high until soil moisture and decomposition rate of organic matter increase in a significant way resulting in a reduction of cec and therefore in a lowering of ph the repeating occurrence of such phenomena leads to the presence of a peak in the pdf even at higher ph specifically at ph of about 6 3 apart from the most probable ph in s5 scenario which is about 5 8 this aspect is not visible in the s1 scenario since it is characterized by a lower ph and smaller soil moisture variability and hence there are not abrupt changes in the soil buffering capacity and ph which tends to be concentrated around the most probable value equal to about 6 7 3 1 3 olivine dissolution dynamics the effect of climate on olivine dissolution dynamics can be clearly seen on the different temporal evolution of the weathering rate fig 5 a the latter being one order of magnitude higher in scenario s5 wetter than s1 in particular the mean weathering rate is 4 3 10 12 mol m 2 s 1 in s5 and 4 6 10 13 mol m 2 s 1 in s1 this is not a surprising result since previous studies already observed that higher soil water content leads to higher reactive surface areas of olivine particles and in turn to higher dissolution rates weil and brady 2017 sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 hartmann et al 2013 the relation between weathering rate and soil moisture reflects the number of interactions involved in the olivine dissolution dynamics as it clearly appears from fig 6 a even if the direct influence of soil moisture on weathering rate is assumed linear linear soil moisture mineral surface area relation the effective relationship that also takes into account the indirect influence of soil moisture results in a non linear and non unique relationship indirect effects include for instance the role of soil moisture variability on ph which in turn is another important variable affecting the weathering rate hartmann et al 2013 weil and brady 2017 figure 6a also highlights that weathering rate and soil moisture exhibit interesting hysteresis cycles with lower weathering rates during the wetting process and the higher ones during the drying phase although olivine has one of the highest dissolution rates compared to other minerals hartmann et al 2013 the dissolution times are relatively long regardless of soil moisture and ph conditions indeed according to lasaga 1984 the mean lifetime of a 1 mm diameter olivine particle is equal to about 600 000 years this is confirmed in fig 5b where even at high map five years after the addition of olivine the diameter reduction is very low e g about 0 06 for the s5 scenario in any case the effect of different climates in the reduction of the diameter of olivine particles is evident since under the s5 scenario it is greater than that of the s1 scenario due to the generally higher weathering rate 3 2 the role of organic matter on ew as we have seen above the olivine weathering rate increases as soil water becomes more acidic to this regard it is interesting to explore whether increasing the organic matter content by means of soil amendment can increase the availability of h for olivine dissolution and in turn increase weathering rate fig 7 compares in a box plot form the organic carbon concentration fig 7a soil ph fig 7b and olivine weathering rate fig 7c achieved with and without carbon amendment the effects of organic matter amendment are evaluated for a period of 5 years after the addition of olivine for all climatic scenarios the changes in the organic carbon concentration mainly depend on how much the decomposition term grows relative to the addition itself the decomposition rate is linearly related to the organic carbon concentration which is generally expected to grow if the carbon input is higher our results show that due to a higher decomposition rate the organic carbon tends to decrease with map especially when it exceeds 1300 mm a similar pattern is visible under the scenario with carbon amendment even though as expected with higher values of carbon concentration while this relation may appear to contradict global scale observations of soil organic carbon we emphasize that the maximum variation of organic matter between the driest and the wettest scenario is very small only about 2 kg c m 3 in the analysis we also considered constant soil properties and composition a fact that may considerably affect organic matter decomposition dynamics the ph tends to decrease with map under both the carbon input scenarios this extends the result reported in figure 4a to all the considered climate scenarios it is also relevant to see that as map increases the soil ph at the scenario with carbon amendment progressively gets close to the one related to the base carbon input in table 1 until in very humid conditions which are provided by a map greater than 2000 mm the higher carbon input leads to a slight reduction of soil ph with reference to the ph variability there seems to be no pattern with map and under the amendment scenario the interquartile range is almost the same as in the case where the increase of organic matter is not considered we can thus conclude that organic matter amendment is effective under very humid climates where it leads to a ph reduction in general the response of ph to the increase of organic matter depends on a balance between two contrasting effects the increase of soil buffering capacity and the greater decomposition of carbonate and bicarbonate ions along with the greater input of h due to infiltration and plants action on the one hand in dry conditions a greater ph is recorded under higher organic matter addition because the increase in the organic cec and thus of the soil buffering capacity prevails over the plant and rainfall input of h on the other hand in wet conditions the input of h due to infiltration and plants action tends to become more relevant than the increase in soil buffering capacity leading to a reduction in soil ph furthermore the faster decomposition of organic matter in wet climates leads to a greater increase of the carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion concentration in the soil water which rapidly dissociate releasing h and lowering soil ph the variation of soil ph due to the different climate and organic matter addition scenarios affects olivine weathering rate whether soils are organically amended or not there is a significant increase of the weathering rate with map fig 7c and its interquartile range which is representative of the weathering rate variability however adding organic matter is effective only when map exceeds 2000 mm since in correspondence of the carbon amendment scenario the weathering rate is slightly greater than in the case achieved with the carbon input values presented in table 1 i e in fig 7c at the amendment scenario the median weathering rate is slightly higher than the one achieved at the add scenario this is a natural consequence of the ph reduction which under the greater carbon input only occurs when map exceeds 2000 mm 3 3 analysis of ew benefits several studies have shown that using olivine for ew applications leads to carbon sequestration and increase of nutrients availability renforth et al 2015 hartmann et al 2013 estimates of carbon sequestration hartmann et al 2013 renforth et al 2015 ten berge et al 2012 however are generally based on the theoretical limit of 1 25 g co 2 g oliv although it is acknowledged that the actual sequestration can be considerably lower and time varying to this regard our model allows us to finalize such estimates for example by taking into account the effect of extra amount of bicarbonate hco 3 and carbonate co 3 2 ions in soil water originating from olivine dissolution and in relation to whether they are transported away to groundwater and to stream through soil water percolation this distinction is particularly important since hco 3 and co 3 2 ions in soil water due to the weathering of olivine could potentially react with h to form carbonic acid causing an increase in ph and a consequent slow down of the olivine dissolution rate on the contrary actual carbon sequestration is more closely related to the extra hco 3 and co 3 2 ions that are leached away from the soil the actual sequestered carbon due to ew can be estimated as the leached mass of the extra hco 3 and co 3 2 produced by olivine dissolution at each time step apart from carbon sequestration olivine application leads to other effects related to the changes in soil chemistry for instance by reacting with h it leads to an increase of soil ph in many cases this is beneficial to plant productivity weil and brady 2017 atkinson et al 2010 which may be further enhanced by the release of nutrients upon olivine dissolution renforth et al 2015 it is worth noting that a nutrient increase in soil water is not necessarily beneficial for vegetation in section 3 3 2 we show the increase of nutrients in soil water as a common effect of olivine dissolution for example an excess of mg 2 in soil water may be the cause of reduced soil fertility which depends on the ca mg ratio at the exchange sites kopittke and menzies 2007 3 3 1 carbon sequestration olivine reacts with co 2 drawing it into solution to form hco 3 and co 3 2 ions however due to the reasons described in section 3 3 the actual sequestered co 2 is better connected to the leached mass of these ions in fig 8 a we plot the equivalent mass of co 2 called co 2 s w assessed on the base of the carbon contained in the mass of hco 3 and co 3 2 produced from olivine dissolution while fig 8b displays a box plot of the sequestered co 2 evaluated as a function of the leached mass of hco 3 and co 3 2 the co 2 s w increases with map only up to 2000 mm fig 8a mainly due to the rapid increase in weathering rate under this map threshold however at map greater than 2000 mm there is a decrease of the co 2 s w in spite of the weathering rate increase this fact could be connected to the methodology used in its evaluation which does not take into account the outputs of hco 3 and co 3 2 ions for instance some hco 3 and co 3 2 react with h and form the carbonic acid comparing the plots related to the different carbon input scenarios it is worth noticing that adding organic matter seems to be effective especially for map above 2000 mm since there is a general increase of co 2 s w the sequestered co 2 instead increases with map for two reasons i higher weathering rates imply greater concentrations of hco 3 and co 3 2 in soil water and ii higher map increasing the percolation rates the combination of these two factors lead to an increased sequestered co 2 with map at a rate which is faster than the increase in weathering rate itself the small mass of sequestered co 2 under all climate scenarios is due to the short time interval used in the box plots generation i e five years which does not allow us to see significant effects from the leaching component indeed according to hartmann et al 2013 at longer time scales of decades or centuries the cations resulting from olivine dissolution i e hco 3 and co 3 2 tend to remain in solution thus leading to carbon sequestration in aqueous form to see significant amounts of sequestered co 2 due to the leaching of bicarbonate and carbonate ions much longer time scales would be necessary especially in the condition where map and leaching rate are low 3 3 2 increase of nutrients availability in general olivine dissolution leads to an increase of nutrients availability in soil water renforth et al 2015 figure 9 a d show the annual increase of dissolved calcium magnesium potassium and sodium respectively for all climate scenarios as map increases in line with the increase in weathering rate fig 7c the additional availability of nutrients becomes more pronounced above 2000 mm even if olivine releases only magnesium from dissolution the results show an increase of the mass of all the considered nutrients in soil water this is related to the fact that larger magnesium concentrations in the soil solution lead to greater adsorbed amounts of this mineral on soil colloids since the adsorption process is regulated by equilibrium reactions as a result magnesium replaces adsorbed calcium sodium and potassium ions which are thus released in the solution in the s2 and s3 scenarios however there is a slight reduction of magnesium in soil water which is due to the higher soil organic matter content and cec such that magnesium released by olivine dissolution ends up almost entirely adsorbed the same behavior is observed for calcium since it has the same valence of magnesium due to their low adsorption processes potassium and sodium instead tend to remain in solution the increase of these nutrient concentration in soil water in response to the carbon amendment is given by two contrasting effects on soil ph an increase in cation exchange capacity and a greater decomposition of carbonate and bicarbonate ions along with a higher h input due to infiltration and plants action by determining which of the two effects prevails climate plays a very relevant role with a more pronounced increase in nutrients only above a map of 2000 mm note that in the long term olivine dissolution cases a general loss of exchangeable calcium potassium and sodium since these ions are replaced by magnesium which is continuously released from olivine dissolution as olivine dissolves this loss becomes progressively more relevant due to the reduction of olivine particles diameter and the corresponding increase of the weathering rate i e a greater input of magnesium 4 conclusions we presented a detailed analysis of ew simulations of olivine in field conditions under time varying rainfall conditions the combination of soil vegetation and climate conditions have been chosen with the aim of understanding the ecohydrological control on ew and ultimately of giving some insight into which climate hence regions could be more suitable for ew in current and future scenarios the interplay between climate organic matter and ph is recognized as the key factors affecting for ew dynamics while humid climate promote faster olivine dissolution we found that it is for map higher than 2000 mm that carbon sequestration increases substantially due to the combination of higher weathering and leaching rates however the co 2 sequestration rate here computed as the leaching of the extra amounts of hco 3 and co 3 2 produced by olivine dissolution remains very small emphasizing the fact that large land area is needed for ew to be effective olivine application also leads to an increase of soil ph and nutrients availability in soil water especially calcium and magnesium at least in the short term which in turn can enhance plant productivity humid climates are again more suitable since as map increases and particularly when it exceeds 2000 mm the extra masses of these nutrients provided by olivine dissolution grow as well furthermore increasing the soil organic carbon content e g through organic matter amendment was not effective for both carbon sequestration and increase of nutrients availability in drier conditions map lower than 2000 mm at least for the assumed amount of amendment this is due to the fact that a greater organic matter concentration leads to a general growth of soil ph and a consequent decrease of weathering rate by contrast for more humid climates map higher than 2000 mm a greater carbon content results in a lower ph and a higher weathering rate and carbon

effect of rainfall seasonality on ew rates in addition it would be interesting to study also the liming effect of ew due to the displacement of exchangeable al 3 and the consequent effect on soil

267,enhanced weathering ew scenarios are analyzed using the model presented in cipolla et al 2020 we explore the role of different hydroclimatic forcing on carbon sequestration efficiencies we also investigate whether increasing soil carbon content improves weathering conditions we link olivine weathering rates to ph variations and quantify the suitability of hydroclimatic regimes to ew based on rainfall intensity and frequency the results show that the amount of co 2 reacting with olivine and ending up in solution in the form of hco 3 and co 3 2 increases with mean annual precipitation map up to 2000 mm but then tapers off for higher maps on the contrary the sequestered co 2 continues to grow with map in a more significant way we also quantify the increase of nutrients availability especially when map exceeds 2000 mm lastly the results suggest that organic matter amendments are more effective in humid environments map higher than 2000 mm confirming the central role of hydrologic processes on ew keywords enhanced weathering carbon sequestration hydrology 1 introduction ew is a negative emission technology hegerl et al 2015 with great potential to sequester co 2 hartmann et al 2013 taylor et al 2017 this strategy is based on increasing the rate of chemical weathering a chemical biochemical reaction that naturally occurs in soils and bedrocks higher rates are achieved by adding crushed silicate minerals with higher reactive surface area than naturally occurring minerals the weathering rates of these minerals however are also affected by local hydrologic processes i e soil moisture dynamics plants soil organic matter dynamics and soil ph hartmann et al 2013 weil and brady 2017 a fact that complicates the estimates of the actual efficiency of ew mathematical models are needed in conjunction with experiments to elucidate the interactions between soil chemistry plants and olivine dissolution and predict weathering rates under variable environmental conditions towards this goal in a companion paper cipolla et al 2021 we developed a model coupling soil biogeochemical processes ph co 2 cation exchange and ecohydrological dynamics soil moisture plants to the dissolution of olivine in the soil root zone the model allows us to explore the role of precipitation hereafter named climate effect and its intermittency plants and other ecohydrologic processes as well as biogeochemistry on ew dynamics in this paper we employ detailed model simulations to answer the following questions which climates are more suitable to ew what are the rates of co 2 sequestration resulting from olivine dissolution for given climate and land use conditions including the presence of soil organic matter what is the order of magnitude of the nutrients increase in soil water due to olivine dissolution the main motivation that inspired this work is to quantify the role of hydrological processes on ew dynamics indeed characterizing various climate conditions with respect to ew could help decision makers to define the parts of the globe more suitable for amending soil with reactive minerals in perspective to put ew into practice to the best of our knowledge the actual rates of co 2 sequestration due to olivine dissolution in the field are not well defined as many studies hartmann et al 2013 renforth et al 2015 ten berge et al 2012 base their estimates on the theoretical limit of 1 25 g co 2 g oliv to this regard our model allows to better characterize the actual rates of co 2 sequestration considering the dynamics of bicarbonate hco 3 and carbonate co 3 2 ions in soil water resulting from olivine dissolution we also investigate whether we can improve ew by amending soil with organic matter since this can lead to a change in soil chemistry i e cation exchange and ph and in turn weathering rates another goal is related to quantify the increase of nutrients availability and ph as also noted by weil and brady 2017 and renforth et al 2015 due to olivine dissolution since in some cases these aspects can enhance plants productivity atkinson et al 2010 the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 gives a brief description of the model of its parameters and some used data to carry out the applications in this section a description of different simulation scenarios is also provided in section 3 we address the research questions by analyzing and discussing the results finally section 4 provides some conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview the model cipolla et al 2020 takes into account the fundamental interactions among ecohydrological e g plants water nutrients and biogeochemical e g ph cec processes driving mineral dissolution the external forces of the model can be either precipitation measurements or stochastic rainfall time series for long term simulations on the bases of the involved mass fluxes among the components of the model represented in fig 1 it is possible to write the related differential equations describing the mass balance and the chemical reactions of the involved elements the model simultaneously simulates the balance of soil organic carbon which is one of the co 2 sources in the system the dynamics of co 2 in the gas phase and of the part of it that reacts with water the dynamics of dissolved elements that do not contain carbon these include plant nutrients and the products of olivine dissolution i e silicates and mg 2 and the cation exchange capacity representative of the equilibrium exchanges between soil organic and inorganic colloids and the dissolved ions the model is summarized by a system of eight mass balance differential equations representative of the temporal dynamics of eight state variables namely the total carbon in the system c t co 2 a

particular attention to the temporal dynamics of soil water ph both with and without olivine since this has an impact on several other processes including the dissolved ions concentration dynamics and the suitability of the environment for plants it can be further considered as a proxy for assessing the amount of sequestered carbon from a certain mass of olivine as reported by the analyses conducted in this work 2 2 ew scenarios to assess the role of climate on ew and explore solutions aimed to enhance weathering rates and carbon sequestration we simulated the dissolution of olivine under different mean annual precipitation map scenarios we explored five scenarios labeled s1 to s5 characterized by the same average rainfall depth α but different storm frequencies λ resulting in map ranging from about 900 to 3000 mm details in table 1 we focused on this range because for map lower than 900 mm the environment is too dry for ew applications weil and brady 2017 while only a limited area of the globe has map higher than 3000 mm since we are interested in the role of climate on ew we maintained soil and vegetation properties constant for the sake of simplicity we did not carry out our analyses with reference to a forested soil in order to neglect the presence of aluminum in the system that as explained in cipolla et al 2020 would represent one of the major h sources for this strong acid soil for the background weathering we used the dissolution rate constant of anorthite in all scenarios we considered the addition of 10 kg of olivine after the soil biogeochemistry time series of c and of dissolved and adsorbed ca 2 mg 2 k and na had reached a statistically stationary regime consistent with the given climate the effects of olivine dissolution on soil chemistry and carbon sequestration were then analyzed after a simulated period of five years in order to look at the short middle term effects of olivine dissolution we here omit the long term effects of olivine dissolution since they are not consistent with the short middle term goals of carbon sequestration in order to counteract the greenhouse effect in any case the analyses may be extended to any time horizon we also explored to what extent organic matter amendments e g compost would increase weathering rates and carbon sequestration we simulated organic matter amendment by increasing the soil carbon input a d d in all scenarios by 0 2 gc m 2 d 1 table 1 or equivalently 73 gc m 2 y 1 on the basis of the amount of extractable organic carbon of grass cuttings baca et al 1996 about 25 g oc kg compost 1 this amount would correspond to 3 kg compost m 2 y 1 which is the typical average amount of compost used to amend an agricultural soil for each scenario the effect of organic amendment is assessed by maintaining the same time series of soil moisture as for the base scenarios without amendment to better isolate the changes in soil chemistry and carbon sequestration due to the additional organic matter as an example we here present a typical model simulation carried out with the parameters related to the s1 scenario presented in table 1 fig 2 shows the time series of the most representative variables of the model i e a soil moisture b organic matter concentration c co 2 concentration in the gas phase d alkalinity e total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration f mg 2 ca 2 and the sum of na and k concentrations g ph h weathering rate and i the reduction of olivine particles diameter related to a time interval of about three years after olivine addition as soil moisture increases there is a stronger decomposition of organic matter a lower ph and a greater weathering rate 2 3 parameterization the values for the parameters related to climate soil and vegetation are listed in table 2 we consider a sandy soil for all scenarios in order to better highlight the role of climate on ew without confounding factors deriving from different soil properties the specific cec of organic matter and clay colloids are extracted from weil and brady 2017 while the selectivity constants related to the cec from suarez and ŝimunek 1997 the values of add the maximum transpiration rate and the input of calcium magnesium potassium and sodium for the five considered climate scenarios are reported in table 1 we used typical levels of input of calcium magnesium potassium and sodium provided by pulido villena et al 2006 groshans et al 2019 mikhailova et al 2019 and suweis et al 2010 which scale according to map based on the observation that deposition increases with map pulido villena et al 2006 groshans et al 2019 mikhailova et al 2019 the mass fraction of anorthite is representative of all the minerals within the soil different than olivine consuming h due to their weathering processes this parameter is fixed equal to 1 but it could be modified in order to increase or decrease the term related to these weathering processes the diameter of the anorthite particles was assumed to be equal to that of the olivine particles the background weathering is fundamental to characterize the initial soil ph consistently with the given climate indeed this strongly affects olivine dissolution dynamics in this paper anyway the background weathering characteristics i e the mass fraction and diameter of anorthite particles are considered constant among the five analyzed climate scenarios mainly due to the fact that the main goal of the study is to explore the climate effects on ew therefore in order to isolate these effects all the soil and vegetation parameters do not have to vary with respect to map it is however worth noticing that for case study applications the background weathering parameters should be defined based on the soil properties under analysis olivine amendment is set to 10 kg olivine m 2 approximately equal to the amount used in the pot experiment by renforth et al 2015 the authors used 100 g of olivine for a cylindrical soil sample of diameter 0 1 m and height 1 m corresponding to about 12 kg olivine m 2 plant biomass productivity is positively correlated to map especially when this is higher than 600 mm porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2013 to take this aspect into account we rescaled the input of organic matter from plant litter add porporato et al 2003 according to the annual plant productivity of the given climate the increase of the map and plant biomass productivity also leads to a higher transpiration rate generally transpiration rate is linearly related to the canopy cover pelak et al 2017 which likely increases as the plant biomass productivity grows we thus rescaled the maximum transpiration rate according to map also based on typical values of potential evapotranspiration at the global scale weiß and menzel 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate effects climate mainly affects the dissolution of olivine and co 2 sequestration through its control on the soil moisture dynamics the latter in fact affects organic carbon decomposition soil ph and in turn olivine dissolution and leaching of dissolution products while in the next section a comparison between the dynamics under a dry s1 and a wet s5 scenarios is carried out in the sections 3 2 and 3 3 we then analyze the results provided by all five scenarios 3 1 1 temporal dynamics of soil moisture and organic carbon the time series of soil moisture and organic carbon for the s1 and s5 scenarios see table 1 are presented in fig 3 a and b respectively along with the probability distribution functions pdfs of soil moisture as expected while the soil water content under the s5 is on average higher than that of s1 an average of 0 26 in s5 and 0 11 in s1 the figure also shows that in the former there is higher variability as evident from the standard deviation 0 13 in s5 and 0 06 in s1 and more in general from the pdfs shape the propagation of soil moisture variability to the organic carbon depends on the inertia of the organic matter pool represented by the decomposition constant k d e c and the carbon concentration in the biomass pool c b as described in porporato et al 2003 and d odorico et al 2003 overall although the carbon input is higher in wetter climates table 1 the organic carbon mean concentration is higher in scenario s1 9 4 kgc m 3 than s5 8 8 kgc m 3 as the effect of faster decomposition prevails indeed wet environments are generally more suitable for the biomass to decompose the organic matter since microbial activity and consequently the decomposition rates are higher d odorico et al 2003 1973 scenario s1 also has higher standard deviation which is explained by the inverse proportionality between decomposition and soil moisture when the latter is above field capacity 3 1 2 ph soil moisture relation since in both simulations the same soil properties are considered the differences in ph dynamics are only due to a different soil water content and a different organic matter concentration which depends on the carbon input and decomposition rate in agreement with observations which report that at a global scale soils are more acidic in humid climates slessarev et al 2016 merry 2009 in our scenarios soil ph is generally higher in s1 6 6 on average than in s5 5 9 on average fig 4 a these ph levels are also in line with typical ph values found in wet and dry environments respectively see fig 3a in slessarev et al 2016 or merry 2009 this tendency originates from multiple factors one is related to the amount of h in rainfall in fact because of slight acidity of normal rain soils in regions with higher map receive more h furthermore as plants uptake nutrients from soil water such as ca 2 mg 2 k and na that are positively charged they release h ions to balance the extra uptake of positively charged ions and maintain a neutral charge this is favored in wetter climates with higher plant water and nutrient uptake rates lastly due to the low leaching dry soils tend to accumulate alkaline ions such as carbonate and bicarbonate ions mainly generated from the organic matter decomposition that can react with h and help maintain higher soil ph looking at the probability density functions pdfs it is also evident that scenario s5 presents a slightly higher variability as confirmed by the standard deviation values 0 32 in s5 and 0 30 in s1 by looking at its pdf we notice the presence of a double peak and that especially when the ph is high it tends to remain at this level for a certain amount of time before decreasing a high ph is associated to low soil moisture values see fig 4b and consequently given the low decomposition rate to high concentrations of organic carbon this leads to a high organic cec and thus to a strong buffering capacity and resistance to ph variations therefore in these conditions the cec tends to keep the ph high until soil moisture and decomposition rate of organic matter increase in a significant way resulting in a reduction of cec and therefore in a lowering of ph the repeating occurrence of such phenomena leads to the presence of a peak in the pdf even at higher ph specifically at ph of about 6 3 apart from the most probable ph in s5 scenario which is about 5 8 this aspect is not visible in the s1 scenario since it is characterized by a lower ph and smaller soil moisture variability and hence there are not abrupt changes in the soil buffering capacity and ph which tends to be concentrated around the most probable value equal to about 6 7 3 1 3 olivine dissolution dynamics the effect of climate on olivine dissolution dynamics can be clearly seen on the different temporal evolution of the weathering rate fig 5 a the latter being one order of magnitude higher in scenario s5 wetter than s1 in particular the mean weathering rate is 4 3 10 12 mol m 2 s 1 in s5 and 4 6 10 13 mol m 2 s 1 in s1 this is not a surprising result since previous studies already observed that higher soil water content leads to higher reactive surface areas of olivine particles and in turn to higher dissolution rates weil and brady 2017 sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 hartmann et al 2013 the relation between weathering rate and soil moisture reflects the number of interactions involved in the olivine dissolution dynamics as it clearly appears from fig 6 a even if the direct influence of soil moisture on weathering rate is assumed linear linear soil moisture mineral surface area relation the effective relationship that also takes into account the indirect influence of soil moisture results in a non linear and non unique relationship indirect effects include for instance the role of soil moisture variability on ph which in turn is another important variable affecting the weathering rate hartmann et al 2013 weil and brady 2017 figure 6a also highlights that weathering rate and soil moisture exhibit interesting hysteresis cycles with lower weathering rates during the wetting process and the higher ones during the drying phase although olivine has one of the highest dissolution rates compared to other minerals hartmann et al 2013 the dissolution times are relatively long regardless of soil moisture and ph conditions indeed according to lasaga 1984 the mean lifetime of a 1 mm diameter olivine particle is equal to about 600 000 years this is confirmed in fig 5b where even at high map five years after the addition of olivine the diameter reduction is very low e g about 0 06 for the s5 scenario in any case the effect of different climates in the reduction of the diameter of olivine particles is evident since under the s5 scenario it is greater than that of the s1 scenario due to the generally higher weathering rate 3 2 the role of organic matter on ew as we have seen above the olivine weathering rate increases as soil water becomes more acidic to this regard it is interesting to explore whether increasing the organic matter content by means of soil amendment can increase the availability of h for olivine dissolution and in turn increase weathering rate fig 7 compares in a box plot form the organic carbon concentration fig 7a soil ph fig 7b and olivine weathering rate fig 7c achieved with and without carbon amendment the effects of organic matter amendment are evaluated for a period of 5 years after the addition of olivine for all climatic scenarios the changes in the organic carbon concentration mainly depend on how much the decomposition term grows relative to the addition itself the decomposition rate is linearly related to the organic carbon concentration which is generally expected to grow if the carbon input is higher our results show that due to a higher decomposition rate the organic carbon tends to decrease with map especially when it exceeds 1300 mm a similar pattern is visible under the scenario with carbon amendment even though as expected with higher values of carbon concentration while this relation may appear to contradict global scale observations of soil organic carbon we emphasize that the maximum variation of organic matter between the driest and the wettest scenario is very small only about 2 kg c m 3 in the analysis we also considered constant soil properties and composition a fact that may considerably affect organic matter decomposition dynamics the ph tends to decrease with map under both the carbon input scenarios this extends the result reported in figure 4a to all the considered climate scenarios it is also relevant to see that as map increases the soil ph at the scenario with carbon amendment progressively gets close to the one related to the base carbon input in table 1 until in very humid conditions which are provided by a map greater than 2000 mm the higher carbon input leads to a slight reduction of soil ph with reference to the ph variability there seems to be no pattern with map and under the amendment scenario the interquartile range is almost the same as in the case where the increase of organic matter is not considered we can thus conclude that organic matter amendment is effective under very humid climates where it leads to a ph reduction in general the response of ph to the increase of organic matter depends on a balance between two contrasting effects the increase of soil buffering capacity and the greater decomposition of carbonate and bicarbonate ions along with the greater input of h due to infiltration and plants action on the one hand in dry conditions a greater ph is recorded under higher organic matter addition because the increase in the organic cec and thus of the soil buffering capacity prevails over the plant and rainfall input of h on the other hand in wet conditions the input of h due to infiltration and plants action tends to become more relevant than the increase in soil buffering capacity leading to a reduction in soil ph furthermore the faster decomposition of organic matter in wet climates leads to a greater increase of the carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion concentration in the soil water which rapidly dissociate releasing h and lowering soil ph the variation of soil ph due to the different climate and organic matter addition scenarios affects olivine weathering rate whether soils are organically amended or not there is a significant increase of the weathering rate with map fig 7c and its interquartile range which is representative of the weathering rate variability however adding organic matter is effective only when map exceeds 2000 mm since in correspondence of the carbon amendment scenario the weathering rate is slightly greater than in the case achieved with the carbon input values presented in table 1 i e in fig 7c at the amendment scenario the median weathering rate is slightly higher than the one achieved at the add scenario this is a natural consequence of the ph reduction which under the greater carbon input only occurs when map exceeds 2000 mm 3 3 analysis of ew benefits several studies have shown that using olivine for ew applications leads to carbon sequestration and increase of nutrients availability renforth et al 2015 hartmann et al 2013 estimates of carbon sequestration hartmann et al 2013 renforth et al 2015 ten berge et al 2012 however are generally based on the theoretical limit of 1 25 g co 2 g oliv although it is acknowledged that the actual sequestration can be considerably lower and time varying to this regard our model allows us to finalize such estimates for example by taking into account the effect of extra amount of bicarbonate hco 3 and carbonate co 3 2 ions in soil water originating from olivine dissolution and in relation to whether they are transported away to groundwater and to stream through soil water percolation this distinction is particularly important since hco 3 and co 3 2 ions in soil water due to the weathering of olivine could potentially react with h to form carbonic acid causing an increase in ph and a consequent slow down of the olivine dissolution rate on the contrary actual carbon sequestration is more closely related to the extra hco 3 and co 3 2 ions that are leached away from the soil the actual sequestered carbon due to ew can be estimated as the leached mass of the extra hco 3 and co 3 2 produced by olivine dissolution at each time step apart from carbon sequestration olivine application leads to other effects related to the changes in soil chemistry for instance by reacting with h it leads to an increase of soil ph in many cases this is beneficial to plant productivity weil and brady 2017 atkinson et al 2010 which may be further enhanced by the release of nutrients upon olivine dissolution renforth et al 2015 it is worth noting that a nutrient increase in soil water is not necessarily beneficial for vegetation in section 3 3 2 we show the increase of nutrients in soil water as a common effect of olivine dissolution for example an excess of mg 2 in soil water may be the cause of reduced soil fertility which depends on the ca mg ratio at the exchange sites kopittke and menzies 2007 3 3 1 carbon sequestration olivine reacts with co 2 drawing it into solution to form hco 3 and co 3 2 ions however due to the reasons described in section 3 3 the actual sequestered co 2 is better connected to the leached mass of these ions in fig 8 a we plot the equivalent mass of co 2 called co 2 s w assessed on the base of the carbon contained in the mass of hco 3 and co 3 2 produced from olivine dissolution while fig 8b displays a box plot of the sequestered co 2 evaluated as a function of the leached mass of hco 3 and co 3 2 the co 2 s w increases with map only up to 2000 mm fig 8a mainly due to the rapid increase in weathering rate under this map threshold however at map greater than 2000 mm there is a decrease of the co 2 s w in spite of the weathering rate increase this fact could be connected to the methodology used in its evaluation which does not take into account the outputs of hco 3 and co 3 2 ions for instance some hco 3 and co 3 2 react with h and form the carbonic acid comparing the plots related to the different carbon input scenarios it is worth noticing that adding organic matter seems to be effective especially for map above 2000 mm since there is a general increase of co 2 s w the sequestered co 2 instead increases with map for two reasons i higher weathering rates imply greater concentrations of hco 3 and co 3 2 in soil water and ii higher map increasing the percolation rates the combination of these two factors lead to an increased sequestered co 2 with map at a rate which is faster than the increase in weathering rate itself the small mass of sequestered co 2 under all climate scenarios is due to the short time interval used in the box plots generation i e five years which does not allow us to see significant effects from the leaching component indeed according to hartmann et al 2013 at longer time scales of decades or centuries the cations resulting from olivine dissolution i e hco 3 and co 3 2 tend to remain in solution thus leading to carbon sequestration in aqueous form to see significant amounts of sequestered co 2 due to the leaching of bicarbonate and carbonate ions much longer time scales would be necessary especially in the condition where map and leaching rate are low 3 3 2 increase of nutrients availability in general olivine dissolution leads to an increase of nutrients availability in soil water renforth et al 2015 figure 9 a d show the annual increase of dissolved calcium magnesium potassium and sodium respectively for all climate scenarios as map increases in line with the increase in weathering rate fig 7c the additional availability of nutrients becomes more pronounced above 2000 mm even if olivine releases only magnesium from dissolution the results show an increase of the mass of all the considered nutrients in soil water this is related to the fact that larger magnesium concentrations in the soil solution lead to greater adsorbed amounts of this mineral on soil colloids since the adsorption process is regulated by equilibrium reactions as a result magnesium replaces adsorbed calcium sodium and potassium ions which are thus released in the solution in the s2 and s3 scenarios however there is a slight reduction of magnesium in soil water which is due to the higher soil organic matter content and cec such that magnesium released by olivine dissolution ends up almost entirely adsorbed the same behavior is observed for calcium since it has the same valence of magnesium due to their low adsorption processes potassium and sodium instead tend to remain in solution the increase of these nutrient concentration in soil water in response to the carbon amendment is given by two contrasting effects on soil ph an increase in cation exchange capacity and a greater decomposition of carbonate and bicarbonate ions along with a higher h input due to infiltration and plants action by determining which of the two effects prevails climate plays a very relevant role with a more pronounced increase in nutrients only above a map of 2000 mm note that in the long term olivine dissolution cases a general loss of exchangeable calcium potassium and sodium since these ions are replaced by magnesium which is continuously released from olivine dissolution as olivine dissolves this loss becomes progressively more relevant due to the reduction of olivine particles diameter and the corresponding increase of the weathering rate i e a greater input of magnesium 4 conclusions we presented a detailed analysis of ew simulations of olivine in field conditions under time varying rainfall conditions the combination of soil vegetation and climate conditions have been chosen with the aim of understanding the ecohydrological control on ew and ultimately of giving some insight into which climate hence regions could be more suitable for ew in current and future scenarios the interplay between climate organic matter and ph is recognized as the key factors affecting for ew dynamics while humid climate promote faster olivine dissolution we found that it is for map higher than 2000 mm that carbon sequestration increases substantially due to the combination of higher weathering and leaching rates however the co 2 sequestration rate here computed as the leaching of the extra amounts of hco 3 and co 3 2 produced by olivine dissolution remains very small emphasizing the fact that large land area is needed for ew to be effective olivine application also leads to an increase of soil ph and nutrients availability in soil water especially calcium and magnesium at least in the short term which in turn can enhance plant productivity humid climates are again more suitable since as map increases and particularly when it exceeds 2000 mm the extra masses of these nutrients provided by olivine dissolution grow as well furthermore increasing the soil organic carbon content e g through organic matter amendment was not effective for both carbon sequestration and increase of nutrients availability in drier conditions map lower than 2000 mm at least for the assumed amount of amendment this is due to the fact that a greater organic matter concentration leads to a general growth of soil ph and a consequent decrease of weathering rate by contrast for more humid climates map higher than 2000 mm a greater carbon content results in a lower ph and a higher weathering rate and carbon sequestration further applications of this model could explore the influence of soil properties to identify which soil type under specific climates is more suitable toward ew applications and the effect of rainfall seasonality on ew rates in addition it would be interesting to study also the liming effect of ew due to the displacement of exchangeable al 3 and the consequent effect on soil fertility overall our results suggest that details of ecohydrological variability and its impact on ew are important for a sound techno economic analysis of ew feasibility declaration of competing

rock at two different pressure p and temperature t values of 50 bar 20 oc and 100 bar 45 oc yekta et al 2018 it resulted in receding contact angles of 21 56o and 34 9o respectively for the first and

gap in this work we perform contact angle measurements for hydrogen brine sandstone rock using a captive bubble cell device since there is no external viscous forces to displace fluid and gas phases our study allows for nearly static intrinsic contact angle measurements for hydrogen when it comes in contact with the saturated porous reservoir rock we first benchmark our measurements for nitrogen gas with the published literature and then introduce hydrogen gas in the system table 8 and table 9 in the appendix provide a summary of different contact angle measurement methods in the systems of gas brine solid surface the study is performed under different pressure temperature and salinity of the brine so to represent a fair assessment of the in situ conditions our findings shed new lights

their relevance for uhs will be discussed finally concluding remarks are presented 2 methods and materials in this study the captive bubble method was utilized to measure intrinsic contact angles using a gas bubble at a solid liquid interface this method is advantageous over the alternative sessile drop method because spreading and diffusion of the brine into porous hydrophilic substrates in the latter method poses experimental challenges making the data less reliable prydatko et al 2018 2 1 materials hydrogen with a purity of 99 99 mol produced by lindegas was used the rock slabs were taken from a sawed homogeneous bentheimer and berea sandstone blocks the properties of bentheimer and berea have been studied in literature peksa et al 2015 farajzadeh et al 2017 kapetas et al 2015 the samples were mainly composed of quartz 95 which was evenly distributed throughout the rock matrix see appendix figs 10 and 11 the average porosity of the bentheimer and berea sandstones were about 20 and permeability around 2 to 3 and 0 1 darcy respectively each slab had dimensions of 30 6 12 mm in addition to brine containing nacl a synthetic seawater laskaris 2015 with the composition in table 1 was also used in the experiments 2 2 microscopic image analysis of rock samples to quantify the surface roughness of rock slabs 2d and 3d microscopic images were taken using a leica 3d stereo explorer fig 1 the surface profiles were characterized based on the internationally recognized standard of en iso 287 where the so called pa factor defines the surface roughness kaveh et al 2014 pa is the arithmetic mean of the absolute ordinate height values z x within a sampling length lp the average roughnesses of the bentheimer and berea slabs have been measured 0 030 and 0 025 mm respectively 2 3 experimental setup the captive bubble setup modified after kaveh et al 2014 was used to measure contact angles in the system of hydrogen brine rock at high pressures and temperatures the schematic of the experimental setup is given in fig 2 the setup comprises of a single steel cell which holds the rock sample and brine the injection of the brine and other fluids takes place from the bottom and from different inlets extraction of the brine and gas from the cell was done from the top the pressure in the cell was held constant by a back pressure regulator connected to a large nitrogen cylinder injection of both brine and hydrogen was done with the use of two vindum pumps to bring the brine and hydrogen to equilibrium a pressure gauge was installed in between the hydrogen pump and the cell hydrogen flows through a line with respective inner and outer diameters of 0 25 mm and 1 58 mm to a nozzle from which the hydrogen was released into the brine the bubble that was created on the rock surface was photographed with a canon 90 camera with a maximum resolution of 12 3 mp attached to an endoscope the pressure and temperature of the setup were monitored continuously and recorded in a computer connected to the system 2 4 experimental procedure to start the experiment the cell including the rock sample was initially filled with the brine over night to reach equilibrium then at the desired pressure and temperature a hydrogen bubble was injected through a needle at the bottom of the cell due to buoyancy the bubble arises and sticks underneath of the rock sample the pictures of the released bubbles were taken by using the connected digital camera through the endoscope at one side of the cell and diffusion of the light source at the other side to get sharp pictures of the bubbles the resolution of imaging was set to 6 9 mp 3216 2136 due to diffusion and dissolution of hydrogen into brine the size of the bubbles changed over time consequently several images were taken after injection of one bubble at each pressure and temperature therefore for each experimental condition the minimum and the maximum contact angles were reported in addition to the averaged values 2 5 image analysis to calculate the contact angles the captured images from the hydrogen bubbles were analyzed using an in house matlab code the needle diameter inside the cell was used to define the scale of the images afterwards the image was converted to grey scale format and was cropped to only keep the bubble and the rock surface to find the boundary of the bubble the image was subsequently binarized tracing boundary of the bubble and detecting the apex as well as contact points were followed by fitting the best curve based on the axisymmetric drop shape analysis profile adsa p technique li et al 1992 all the main steps of the image analysis are shown in fig 4 the adsa p technique fits the best theoretical laplacian curve on the physical observed bubble interface li et al 1992 the young laplace capillarity equation for two fluid phases is given as 1 δ p σ 1 r 1 1 r 2 where σ is interfacial tension r1 and r2 are the two principle radii of the curvature because of the axisymmetry of the bubble in eqn 1 the radii are considered equal at the apex r1 r2 r0 i e 2 δ p a p e x 2 σ r 0 also by considering the gravity as the only external force across the interface the pressure difference in eqn 2 is assumed to be a linear function of the hydrostatic pressure δ ρ g z with interception of δ p 0 at a reference plane i e 3 δ p δ p 0 δ ρ g z as shown in fig 3 the origin of the coordinate system was placed at the apex point the x axis is tangent to the origin and normal to the axis of symmetry therefore eqn 3 can be rewritten as 4 σ 1 r 1 s i n θ x 2 σ r 0 δ ρ g z where r1 rotates in the plane of x z and r2 x s i n θ rotates in the plane of z y eqn 4 is restated as 5 d x d s c o s θ 6 d z d s s i n θ 7 d θ d s 2 r 0 δ ρ g z σ s i n θ x eqn 5 6 and 7 are first order differential equations in terms of the arc length s finally these three differential equations i e eqn 5 6 and 7 are integrated using runge kutta numerical approach to find theoretical laplacian curve in order to find the corresponding contact angle the objective function is defined to minimize the deviation of the physically observed curve from a theoretical curve by adjusting parameters radius of the curvature at the apex r0 and interfacial tension σ the detail of this procedure has been extensively explained in the literature li et al 1992 brine and gas density were calculated based on the literature thermodynamic formulation for each specific pressure and temperature condition batzle and wang 1992 and reported in the appendix tables 10 15 2 6 calibration of the setup before starting the main test for the hydrogen gas the setup was calibrated against the literature data for a nitrogen brine quartz system the literature reports contact angle of nitrogen on a smooth alpha quartz crystal surface at pressure of 13 mpa and temperature of 333k al yaseri et al 2015 under the same experimental conditions the method used in our study i e captive bubble method resulted in the contact

temperature salinity rock type will be separately discussed note that in order to prove reproducibility of the results measurements were repeated up to three times see appendix table 16 17 18 3 1 effect of bubble size on the contact angle as shown in fig 6 it was noticed that due to dissolution diffusion of the hydrogen gas into brine the size of the created bubbles continuously decreased during the experiments until they disappeared interestingly as the size of the bubble decreases the calculated contact angle increases a similar behavior has been reported by kaveh et al 2014 haeri et al 2020 and jung et al 2012 for co2 brine rock system therefore to capture the effect of the bubble size on the reported contact angles for each test case several images were taken from every injected bubble at different times out of which only four images were analyzed to calculate the minimum maximum and the mean contact angle the mean contact angle is the arithmetic average of the four measured contact angles an example is given in fig 6a which results in the contact angles shown in fig 6b 3 2 test case 1 effect of pressure and temperature fig 7 shows the effect of different pressures and

50 000 ppm nacl were used at a constant temperature of 30 oc and four different pressures in the range of 20 to 100 bar the results are shown in fig 8 the change of salinity did not result in a meaningful change in the measured contact angles indicating that the wetting state of the rock was insensitive to salinity in the presence of hydrogen detailed results for salinity of 50 000 ppm nacl and seawater are also provided in tables 5 and 6 3 4 test case 3 effect of rock type fig 9 shows the effect of rock type on the contact angles of the hydrogen pure water rock system with bentheimer

repeatability of the tests the results of the repeated experiments are reported in tables 16 17 18 and 19 in the appendix 4 conclusions and outlook wettability of the rock in contact with brine and hydrogen plays a crucial role in the displacement processes in uhs this paper reports experimental measurements of the contact angle of the hydrogen brine sandstone system relevant for underground hydrogen storage this is the first step in understanding and quantifying the impact of different parameters in accurate prediction of the fate of stored and produced hydrogen the captive bubble method was used for measuring contact angle to ensure accurate measurements the setup was successfully calibrated against the existing literature data with nitrogen gas then through several test cases the intrinsic contact angles were measured under various experimental conditions it was found that under our experimental conditions and within the accuracy of the method and setup the contact angles in the examined systems were not affected by temperature pressure and salinity under all conditions the presence of hydrogen did not appear to affect the wettability of the bentheimer sandstone all the results indicated water wet conditions with contact angles in the range of 21 1o to 43o this general conclusion and contact angles of less than 50o agree well with the conclusions of literature yekta manceau gaboreau pichavant audigane 2018 a major discrepancy between our data and the data reported by iglauer et al 2021 is the absence of a general trend between the parameters pressure temperature and salinity and the measured contact angles this can be attributed to the differences in the measurement methods experimental conditions and sample preparation it was also observed that the bubble size affects the calculated contact angle values due to dominance of gravity for the larger gas bubbles and possibly different surface composition of the rock the presented experimental data and

268,subsurface porous formations provide large capacities for underground hydrogen storage uhs successful utilization of these porous reservoirs for uhs depends on accurate quantification of the hydrogen transport characteristics at continuum macro scale specially in contact with other reservoir fluids relative permeability and capillary pressure curves are among the macro scale transport characteristics which play crucial roles in quantification of the storage capacity and efficiency for a given rock sample these functions can be determined if pore scale micro scale surface properties specially contact angles are known for hydrogen brine rock system these properties are yet to a large extent unknown in this study we characterize the contact angles of hydrogen in contact with brine and bentheimer and berea sandstones at various pressure temperature and brine salinity using captive bubble method the experiments are conducted close to the in situ conditions which resulted in water wet intrinsic contact angles about 25 to 45 degrees moreover no meaningful correlation was found with changing tested parameters we monitor the bubbles over time and report the average contact angles

international association of hydrological sciences iahs has brought further attention to this challenge in the last two decades hrachowitz et al 2013 inaccurate knowledge of water availability can affect local water resource planning and management and severely harm social well being and economic development because river discharge is the major water resource for agricultural industrial and urban water use guo et al 2021 adequately extrapolating such information is crucial thus ungauged regions often depend on regionalization approaches to transfer information from hydrological model calibrated gauged catchments guo et al 2021 razavi and coulibaly 2013 the most common techniques used to transfer information are approaches based on the calibration of hydrological models on individual gauged catchments and i donating parameters to ungauged catchments by physical proximity and or similarity arsenault and brissette 2016 beck et al 2016 pool et al 2019 qi et al 2020 or ii building regressions to derive parameters at ungauged catchments based on catchment attributes arsenault and brissette 2016 beck et al 2016 h e 2020 however regression approaches are usually limited by the equifinality issue of parameter sets whereas parameter donation can be limited by the gage station network density regional heterogeneity with respect to topography climate and geology and low robustness of parameters to environmental and climate changes when working at larger scales i e regional or continental scales models can be calibrated for an entire region or subset of regions kratzert et al 2018 pagliero et al 2019 macroscale models are usually calibrated to regions clustered by physical similarities and spatial proximity so that the model is aware of characteristics such as vegetation topography and pedology another alternative as shown by beck et al 2016 is to produce parameter maps by regionalizing parameter sets of donor catchments this approach is also based on catchment attributes in the hope that the model adequately learns different hydrological behaviors data driven methods have recently gained much popularity by succeeding over process based models in mapping streamflows from meteorological forcing data bai et al 2021 fan et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 f kratzert et al 2019b the main advantage of these methods is that they are free from predetermined conceptual structures and can learn how to represent hydrological processes themselves nearing et al 2020 discuss how deep learning algorithms can better learn from hydrological variability in large samples and outperform models trained on individual catchments for example a recent study by f kratzert et al 2019b showed that ancillary data from catchment attributes were able to improve streamflow estimates of a single long short term memory neural network lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997a hydrological model trained on data from 531 catchments in the united states of america in fact the model proposed by the authors outperformed many popular conceptual hydrological models calibrated catchment by catchment or regionally as ancillary data f kratzert et al 2019b used 27 catchment attributes as static input features they recognized that treating catchment attributes as static is a strong assumption especially over long time periods moreover several studies have reported on the impacts of hydrological process dynamics inherent to land cover changes abdulkareem et al 2019 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 zhou et al 2015 traditionally the impacts of anthropogenic land cover changes have been simulated with methodologies based on the curve number abdulkareem et al 2019 gashaw et al 2018 oliveira et al 2016 v de p r da silva et al 2018 wang et al 2018 or calibrations over different periods liu et al 2009 however the use of the curve number can be limited by the many uncertainties related to land cover e g degraded pastures and grasslands density of forests cultivated crop varieties and soil and water conservation strategies assumptions made for catchment characteristics can be detrimental to hydrological modeling when enough information is not available however nearing et al 2020 discuss how deep learning has the potential to skip steps that introduce uncertainty in the modeling chain thus there is an opportunity for the development of a data driven hydrological model that can benefit and learn from inputting high quality land cover data as a dynamic feature in addition recent advances in model explainability for artificial intelligence sundararajan et al 2017 can help hydrologists gain new insights from their models f kratzert et al 2019a given the importance of land cover changes on hydrological responses the objective of this study is to develop a hydrological model that considers land cover characteristics as dynamic and assess whether including such information can improve the predictions made by the model 2 materials and methods the study area in this paper is the brazilian cerrado biome its watersheds are characterized by a tropical climate and strong seasonality the cerrado biome is a good candidate for this study because significant land cover changes have been reported in recent decades althoff et al 2020 mapbiomas 2020 it is considered the most important biome with respect to agriculture and has many areas classified as high potential for expanding irrigation activities althoff and rodrigues 2019 fealq 2014 however many regions of the cerrado biome have also reported conflicts over water use pousa et al 2019 thus hydrological models developed for the region should able to leverage land cover changes from the past and to predict future changes the following subsections describe the data driven hydrological model the input configurations tested the streamflow and features data sets the criteria used to assess performance the benchmarking strategies and the techniques used for model interpretation 2 1 hydrological model the hydrological model used for this study is a type of recurrent neural network rnn specifically the long short term memory lstm neural network hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997a in particular the lstm configuration does not suffer from vanishing gradients and is suited for learning long term dependencies hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997b recurrent layers consist of memory cells that are able to store information over sequential time steps similar to state vectors f kratzert et al 2019b the lstm is therefore able to model watershed processes such as soil moisture and or snow accumulation comparably to process based models f kratzert et al 2019a the following subsections describe the operations behind the lstm network section 2 1 1 and the model and training setups chosen for the study section 2 1 2 2 1 1 long short term neural network lstm layers consist of a number of consecutive memory cells that are responsible for transferring updating two states over consecutive time steps a cell state and a hidden state the cell state characterizes the memory of the system and the hidden state characterizes what the layer will eventually output at the last time step of the sequence in a memory cell the hidden state of the previous time step output of the previous memory cell and the input vector at the current time step pass through three gate units that control which information is added or removed from the cell and hidden states these gate units are the input gate the forget gate and the output gate the forget gate ft eq 1 deletes information from the cell state while the input gate it eq 2 and cell update gt eq 3 add new information to it eq 4 the input gate controls which components of the cell state are updated and the cell updates what information is added last the output gate ot eq 5 controls which information is updated to the hidden state ht eq 6 given an input sequence x x1 xt with t time steps where xt is a vector of input features at time step t 1 t t the forward pass through the lstm layer can be described by the following equations 1 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f 2 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i 3 g t tanh w g x t u g h t 1 b g 4 c t f t c t 1 i t g t 5 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where ft it and ot are the forget gate input gate and output gate respectively and gt is the cell update at time step t 1 t t ht 1 and ct 1 are the hidden state and cell state at the previous time step t 1 respectively w and u are weight matrices and b is a weight vector representing the learnable parameters for each gate the subscripts indicate their respective gates σ is the sigmoid function outputs between 0 and 1 tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function outputs between 1 and 1 and is the elementwise multiplication 2 1 2 hyperparameters and training setups the structure chosen for the study consisted of an input layer a single hidden layer lstm and an output layer the input layer received an input array of two dimensions one dimension representing the number of input features and the other dimension representing the number of time steps lookback series the number of input features depended on the input configuration see section 2 2 whereas the lookback series was fixed at 270 time steps a dropout rate of 0 4 was applied to the lstm layer during the training phase which consisted of 256 memory cell units the dropout rate was adopted as a regularization technique i e to reduce the chances of overfitting the model srivastava et al 2014 the number of time steps memory cells and the dropout rate were chosen based on the study by f kratzert et al 2019b the lstm was run in a sequence to value mode to output a single prediction the daily discharge the models were trained considering the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as an objective function for training the model the batch size was set to 1024 and the epochs were set to 100 both based on computer limitations and experimentation the data set see section 2 3 the hydrocerrado data set was split into training and testing periods the training period consisted of the first 75 of available observations of the time series for each catchment while the testing period consisted of the remaining 25 of available observations a validation set with 20 of the observations in the training period was randomly subset from the training set the validation set was used to track performance improvements over each epoch and avoid choosing weights from an overfitted model the models were built and trained using the r programming language and environment r core team 2020 and the following r packages were used dplyr wickham et al 2020 tensorflow falbel allaire rstudio et al 2020 keras falbel et al 2020 and kerasgenerator herlambang 2019 the keras callback model checkpoint was used to save the model s weights after each epoch in the training phase the weights that performed best for the validation set and without signs of overfitting were chosen as the final set of weights for the models 2 2 input configurations instead of the traditional station by station calibration of multiple models this study focuses on the ability of a single regional model to capture hydrologic behaviors in different catchments therefore three input configurations are used to train different lstm hydrological models lstm with no attributes a single lstm hydrological model is trained on combined calibration data of all catchments using meteorological features lstm with static attributes a single lstm hydrological model is trained on combined calibration data of all catchments using time series of meteorological features and 21 static catchment attributes lstm with static and dynamic attributes a single lstm hydrological model is trained on combined calibration data of all catchments using time series of meteorological features and 12 static and 9 dynamic catchment attributes the meteorological features are time series of the daily precipitation p and daily penman monteith reference evapotranspiration e averaged over each catchment i e the pixels from daily grids within a given catchment boundary are averaged as a single value for each day while only precipitation and evapotranspiration are considered for the first input configuration 21 catchment attributes are considered for the second and third input configurations these attributes relate to catchment topography log transformed area mean elevation and mean slope climate indices mean annual precipitation mean annual evapotranspiration timing of precipitation index and aridity index soil characteristics clay content silt content sand content organic carbon content and bulk density and land cover characteristics forest formation forest plantation savanna formation grassland pasture crops urban infrastructure river and lake and wetland fractions all sources of input features are described in section 2 3 although all the catchment attributes are considered static for the second input configuration substantial changes in land cover characteristics have been documented in many regions of the cerrado biome over the last few decades mapbiomas 2020 althoff et al 2021 submitted therefore the third input configuration assesses whether accounting for environmental changes represented by yearly information on land cover fractions can improve streamflow predictions while the second input configuration considers these variables static i e the same values for the entire time series for each land cover fraction the third input configuration updates the values of land cover fractions for different years 2 3 the hydrocerrado data set the hydrocerrado data set consists of a regional sample data set for catchments in the cerrado biome compiled by althoff et al 2021 and made available at https github com daniel althoff hydrocerrado the data set includes information on catchment boundaries daily time series of observed streamflow daily time series of meteorological forcing precipitation and penman monteith evapotranspiration and catchment attributes a brief description overview is given in the following subsections for the target variable of the lstm hydrological model the daily streamflow and the input features 2 3 1 daily streamflow the streamflow database consists of daily streamflow observations for 411 catchments within or intersecting the cerrado biome the observations in the database cover the period from 2000 06 01 to 2014 12 31 where catchments have at least 5 years of equivalent observed data median 14 6 years mean 14 0 years catchment areas range from 51 to 746 000 km2 and the mean daily streamflow ranges from 0 005 to 2 844 mm day 1 more information on the data quality assessment can be found in althoff et al 2021 according to the pfafstetter hierarchical classification of basins furnans and olivera 2001 pfafstetter 1989 the cerrado catchments are distributed over 6 of brazil s 8 major basins fig 1 a the locations of the gage stations and respective catchment boundaries are shown in fig 1b 2 3 2 input features p and e daily time series were derived from the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2019 2019 and the gridded reference evapotranspiration for brazil based on machine learning eto brazil althoff et al 2020a althoff 2020b respectively and averaged over catchment areas the log transform area mean altitude and mean slope are derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model at 3 arc seconds earth resources observation and science center 2017 the mean annual precipitation p and the mean annual evapotranspiration e are derived from the p and e time series the timing of the precipitation index is estimated using sine curves to represent the annual e and p cycles eq 14 in woods 2009 the aridity index is the ratio between mean annual evapotranspiration and rainfall e p soil characteristics are derived from the soilgrids data sets hengl et al 2017 for the top 2 0 m soil layer land use characteristics are derived from the mapbiomas data sets mapbiomas 2020 an overview of several catchment attributes is given in fig 2 before training all features are standardized to their respective mean and standard deviation of the training period we recognize that as derived gridded products there is a general uncertainty in the catchment attributes for example taking the mean elevation or annual rainfall from different digital elevation models or different precipitation gridded products would lead to different values however using multiple sources of the same feature e g different gridded rainfall products has been shown to improve performance in rainfall runoff modeling with deep learning kratzert et al 2020 2 4 assessment of model performance the performance of the lstm hydrological models was assessed for each catchment using the following criteria kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and relative nse rnse krause et al 2005 these criteria are calculated as follows 7 k g e 1 e d k g e 1 w i t h e d r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 8 n s e 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 n s e 1 9 r n s e 1 i 1 n x i x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x x 2 r n s e 1 where xi and x i are the observed and predicted streamflow at time step i respectively x is the mean observed streamflow n is the number of observations ed is the euclidian distance r is the linear correlation coefficient between x i and xi α is the variability ratio or the ratio between the standard deviation of predicted values and the standard deviation of observed values σ x σ x and β is the ratio between the mean predicted and mean observed values μ x μ x the nse is one of the most traditional goodness of fit criteria used in water resources and is reported in most applicable studies due to some well reported nse limitations gupta et al 2009 krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 schaefli and gupta 2007 the kge is chosen as the main performance indicator and objective function for training the models the kge decomposes errors in terms of mean flow flow variability and flow dynamics gupta et al 2009 since the rnse gives more emphasis to low flow conditions it is chosen considering the importance of water availability in the cerrado biome during the dry season the paired wilcoxon test is used to compare scores found for different models input configurations where p 0 05 means that there is a statistical difference between scores the adoption of intervals and thresholds with respect to performance criteria can be viewed as a subjective means to assess the performance of hydrological models especially in large scale hydrology this is because the criteria are not intercomparable among basins under different contexts i e different seasonality and rainfall runoff dynamics gupta et al 2009 thus the performance of the hydrological models is compared to the performance of benchmarks section 2 5 if a model performs better than the lower limit benchmark the model can be considered useful 2 5 benchmarking the intention in using benchmarks is to assess if the models result in reasonable simulations therefore we compare the performance achieved by the lstm hydrological models against a high and a low quality benchmark the benchmark model high quality benchmark is a conceptual bucket style hydrological model calibrated to individual catchments the benchmark series low quality benchmark is a mean monthly streamflow series observed for each catchment in the training period the high quality benchmark represents an upper limit of expected performance for lumped hydrological models in this case we adopt the performance obtained for the testing period in a previous study althoff et al 2021 by running the gr5j model benchmark model for the same catchments and on the same meteorological forcing the gr5j model le moine 2008 pushpalatha et al 2011 is a conceptual bucket style rainfall runoff model requiring only meteorological forcings as input this is considered a high quality benchmark since models were calibrated for each catchment individually in an attempt to better adjust to catchment uniqueness the mean monthly streamflow series is considered a low quality benchmark because it simply repeats the mean monthly streamflow for all days in a corresponding month thus it has no complexity and considers no processes despite being documented to provide high performance scores in some cases althoff et al 2021 2 6 lstm model interpretation to interpret the lstm hydrological models the integrated gradients technique sundararajan et al 2017 is adopted gradients are analogous to model coefficients and measure the attribution of each input feature to the output since neural networks are completely differentiable it is possible to calculate the exact gradient with respect to the input features f kratzert et al 2019b therefore the gradients can be integrated along the path of the input dimension lookback series for lstms and a baseline vector sequence of zeros measuring the attribution of each feature in the final prediction in this study the gradient integral was approximated using the trapezoidal rule more details on the procedures for this technique are found in kratzert et al 2019a and sundararajan et al 2017 the following subsections describe how this technique is used to rank catchment attribute importance and compute the number of time steps of influence for the model 2 6 1 importance of features to estimate the importance of the features used to train the models i e catchment attributes a global sensitivity analysis was performed gradients were obtained for all features and for each observation in the testing period the global sensitivity measure of individual features was derived for each catchment by taking their average absolute gradient f kratzert et al 2019b because the magnitude of the streamflow varies for different catchments for each catchment we normalized the feature sensitivity with respect to the sum of sensitivities obtained for the catchment attributes 2 6 2 time steps of influence the time steps of influence tsoi is a measure of how many past days actually influence the streamflow prediction f kratzert et al 2019a to compute the tsoi the procedure presented by f kratzert et al 2019a was used first integrated gradients were summed across features for each time step then the difference from time step to time step was computed to find the time step t 1 t t when the difference exceeded a threshold of 0 002 this threshold was empirically set by f kratzert et al 2019a to ignore noise in the integrated gradient signal for each observation in the testing period the tsoi was calculated by the following 10 t s o i t t where t is the total length of the sequence i e 270 and t is the time step when the difference between consecutive time steps exceeds the threshold 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance obtained by different input configurations this section presents the comparison between three different input configurations used for the lstm hydrological models discussed in section 2 2 fig 3 shows the cumulative density functions for the performance scores obtained for each catchment in the testing period when considering only the meteorological forcing the model obtained median kge nse and rnse values of 0 40 0 16 and 0 17 respectively approximately 25 of the stations gave a kge score greater than 0 59 this input configuration for the lstm hydrological model was able to improve the median kge and median rnse by 0 04 and 0 51 respectively in relation to the benchmark series on the other hand by not considering catchment attributes the median kge and rnse achieved by the model were 0 31 and 0 55 lower than those obtained by the high quality benchmark i e the performance obtained using gr5j models calibrated for each catchment by considering catchment attributes the lstm model showed significant improvement in the overall performance for the catchments which was expected when considering all the catchment attributes as static the lstm model scored median kge nse and rnse values of 0 69 0 56 and 0 53 respectively these data indicate a kge that is 0 33 times higher than that of the benchmark series and 0 29 times higher than that of the lstm model considering no attributes in contrast the lstm model trained on both static and dynamic catchment attributes i e land characteristics as dynamic in time resulted in median kge nse and rnse values of 0 69 0 59 and 0 62 respectively overall both models that considered catchment attributes scored closer to the high quality benchmark kge 0 71 and rnse 0 72 although the median rnse score was higher by 0 09 for the lstm model considering changes in land cover characteristics as opposed to considering such characteristics as static this means that by considering the environmental changes over time the model was able to give a better prediction under low flow conditions f kratzert et al 2019b also highlight that randomness in the training procedures may be further mitigated by running model ensembles and improving final predictions the advantage of calibrating a model for each catchment is that the model is able to better capture the catchment uniqueness beven 2020 such uniqueness may be difficult for a regional model to capture since it may be poorly reflected in the available considered attributes in contrast the conceptual structure of a hydrological model can also limit the performance for particular catchments in addition it is difficult for conceptual models to extend their calibrated parameters to consider changes in land cover these models are less robust to changes in both the environment and climate the regional model on the other hand learns from a very diverse number of scenarios overall the lstm model with both static and dynamic attributes has lower kge and rnse scores in 55 paired wilcoxon test p 0 001 and 54 p 0 001 of the catchments respectively when compared to the benchmark model fig 4 a although with similar performance the wilcoxon test shows that the performance of the lstm model is still lacking when compared to a model calibrated on individual catchments considering land cover as dynamic also resulted in kge and rnse scores higher than 52 p 0 52 and 60 p 0 001 of the catchments respectively when compared to assuming these characteristics as static this means that considering land cover changes significantly improved the predictions under low flow conditions there are a few catchments that perform better by considering only the meteorological forcing which is due to the general simulations of the lstm that considers catchment attributes failing to represent the unique hydrological responses of particular catchments in fact the structure of the lstm model has also failed to map hydrological processes for some catchments since the lower limit benchmark the time series based on mean monthly streamflow observed in the training period is able to outperform the lstm model in 10 of the catchments nevertheless the model is useful for 90 of the catchments outperforming the lower limit benchmark perhaps by considering different model structures and hyperparameters a better overall performance could be reached for the lstm model another alternative would be to mitigate randomness in predictions by running model ensembles f kratzert et al 2019b however in both cases running multiple calibrations on such a large data set would take a considerable amount of time for an ordinary computer although it is well known that machine learning models can perform well under the stationarity assumption f kratzert et al 2019b wu et al 2019 they will hardly be applicable for non stationary data non stationarity may come from changes in climate and environment which will affect how rainfall is partitioned into evaporation runoff and surface and subsurface storages thus considering the current attributes of a given catchment can help to address its streamflow prediction in different years of the study period however the length of the lookback series may not be enough to address for example long term changes in groundwater storage that are fundamental in regulating streamflow this could perhaps be better explored in a future study for individual catchments that experienced severe disturbances considering catchment attributes as input makes the models developed here a great alternative for the regionalization of streamflow series to ungauged areas when conceptual hydrological models are considered the regionalization usually relies on donating the parameters calibrated at gauged catchments to ungauged catchments based on their similarity guo et al 2021 similarity can be measured either by spatial proximity or physical similarity the success attributed to donating parameters by spatial proximity comes from nearby catchments presenting similar climate and environment in contrast the pitfall of regionalization approaches based on the physical similarities of catchments is not knowing how much weight should be given to the different attributes considered the advantage of using data driven models for regionalization is that these models learn to generalize the effect of different attributes on streamflow at a given region in addition all the variables considered here as input to these models are readily available to make predictions for any ungauged catchment in the region 3 2 feature ranking after confirming that catchment attributes increased the ability of the lstm hydrological model to simulate streamflow we assessed the overall importance of such features for predictions made in the testing period by collecting their individual integrated gradients fig 5 presents the average sensitivity of each catchment attribute for the 411 catchments in the testing period this analysis was carried out only for the model which considered besides meteorological forcings 12 static and 9 dynamic attributes as input the feature importance was ranked considering the lstm model with both static and dynamic attributes as inputs among the catchment attributes the land cover characteristics which are the dynamic attributes were the ones that showed the highest sensitivities e g pasture 1 grassland 2 savanna formation 3 crop 5 and forest formation 7 fractions pastures occupy most of the land cover in the cerrado catchments average from 411 catchments in 2014 35 2 followed by savanna formation 24 7 forest formation 15 8 crops 13 3 and grassland 8 0 despite the large areas of forest in the cerrado catchments its lesser attribution on streamflow may be because they are generally less prone to runoff generation than the other aforementioned land covers falcão et al 2020 this is because forests are better at intercepting and infiltrating rainfall and at the same time make use of water available in deeper soil layers for evapotranspiration the remaining land cover characteristics occupy relatively small portions of areas in the cerrado biome and show lower sensitivity in the model the topographic characteristic that showed the highest sensitivity was the catchment mean slope 4 followed by area and 10 mean elevation 11 the effect of slope on runoff and infiltration has long been studied nassif and wilson 1975 where an increased slope generally results in increased runoff and lower infiltration i e higher or lower flows during the wet or dry season to confirm whether the model correctly learns these effects the median gradients by catchment attribute and year are plotted against the catchment attributes fig 6 the gradients and attribute values are standardized for each plot to better assess their relationship regardless of their magnitude indeed fig 6 shows a positive slope for the catchment mean slope while the area and mean elevation show slopes close to 0 i e no clear relationship between the variable and their attribution to streamflow for climate characteristics the mean precipitation 6 and timing index 8 show higher sensitivities than the mean evapotranspiration 12 and aridity index 18 fig 5 the mean precipitation sensitivity is higher likely because it is the main driver of runoff generation and shows a positive correlation with the gradient fig 6 the precipitation timing index on the other hand indicates whether rainfall occurs in the warmer positive index or colder negative index season positive timing index values are related to lower attribution to streamflow since water is made available for evaporation in a more arid environment this relationship is also confirmed by the negative slope in fig 6 in contrast mean evapotranspiration and the aridity index show a positive slope fig 6 which is not expected generally higher evapotranspiration and more arid environments are related to lower streamflow and a negative correlation to gradients is expected the gradient decreases as the mean evapotranspiration increases until a given point but increases for higher mean evapotranspiration values as the final streamflow prediction depends on the sum of all feature gradients it is possible that the relationships of gradients to higher mean evapotranspiration and higher aridity became weak thus presenting gradients closer to 0 nonstandardized gradient values for higher values of these variables soil characteristics show the least importance to the lstm model considering both static and dynamic features fig 5 and therefore the least attribution to streamflow generally sand and organic carbon show a positive correlation with infiltration rates whereas clay silt and bulk density show a negative correlation with infiltration rates patle et al 2019 fig 6 shows a negative or positive slope for sand or silt which confirms our previous knowledge sand or silt with higher or lower infiltration rates results in less or more direct runoff generation normally a positive slope would be expected for clay however the soils in the cerrado biome are older and well structured providing soil with larger macropore volumes e m silva et al 2003 therefore higher infiltration rates occur in the cerrado biome despite loamy soils reflecting a negative slope between clay and the gradient bulk density and soil organic matter on the other hand have slopes close to 0 although we recognize that the uncertainties and biases related to using a global gridded soil product can reflect poor learning of the model the soil characteristics provide some useful information to the model that agrees with previous hydrological knowledge in the region for land cover characteristics fig 6 shows a negative correlation with forest plantations grasslands and savanna formations while forest formations show a slope close to zero in general this means that greater natural formation fractions result in a decreased attribution to runoff likely because of increased infiltration in contrast pasture and crop fractions show positive slopes i e less infiltration and increased attribution to runoff rivers and lakes and urban infrastructure also show positive slopes because they usually directly translate rainfall into direct runoff with the exception of reservoirs or other structures engineered to retain runoff harvest rainfall to provide a closer look at the land cover attribution to streamflow throughout the year the median gradient is taken for each day of the year and catchment and the interquartile ranges for all catchments are highlighted in fig 7 for instance vegetated land cover with the exception of wetlands show similar behavior although at different magnitudes it has a higher positive attribution gradient to streamflow in the wet season and a lower attribution in the dry season the median attribution gradient of urban infrastructure and river and lake fractions to streamflow generation is close to zero with interquartile ranges showing both positive and negative values the positive attribution in the wet season can be related to rainfall translating directly to streamflow which would result in a negative attribution in the dry season i e lower base flow in contrast the negative attribution in the wet season can be related to the interception of excess runoff in reservoirs or rain harvesting structures and could result in a positive attribution in the dry season higher base flow wetland fractions likely show lower importance because of their small representativeness in terms of area and variance close to 0 fig 5 however their hydrological behavior is accurately captured this result shows a positive attribution to streamflow in the wet season because precipitation falls in saturated areas in contrast lower infiltration results in a negative attribution in the dry season overall there is also much information with respect to the land cover characteristics that influence hydrological responses that are not available for instance how dense are the forests how old are the forest plantations are pastures and grasslands degraded which crops are planted in which period of the year what tillage systems are used however even if this information was available there would likely still be many uncertainties and biases thus it is not guaranteed that the model would be able to adequately learn these interactions especially in a lumped model 3 3 time steps of influence in this study we followed the findings of a previous large scale study f kratzert et al 2019b to set the model hyperparameters however one important aspect that can change for different regions and climates and that should be considered when building the lstm models is the length of the lookback series for example using an overly extensive lookback series takes longer to train and can add unnecessary noise to the model in contrast a short lookback series may not be able to fully capture the effects related to the water balance and soil moisture accounting fig 8 presents the time step of influence tsoi observed within each of the major hydrographic basins intersecting the cerrado biome the catchments within the north northeast atlantic east atlantic and são francisco basins show a lower tsoi than the catchments within the amazon tocantins and parana basins the maximum median tsois of the north northeast atlantic east atlantic and são francisco are 101 115 and 114 respectively the tsoi begins increasing at the beginning of the wet season and starts decreasing in the transition between the wet and dry seasons as precipitation inputs decrease during the dry season so does tsoi which shows less influence from distant time steps the maximum median tsois of the amazon tocantins and paraná are 268 263 and 180 respectively catchments with higher streamflow and precipitation magnitudes tend to have a higher dependency on the lookback series because soil moisture is a key factor in predicting runoff ghajarnia et al 2020 thus longer series are required for the lstm model to adequately represent the effects of antecedent soil moisture on rainfall runoff events and model the processes as soil moisture accumulation however it seems that the 270 time step lookback series as suggested by f kratzert et al 2019b for the camels data set and adopted herein may not have been enough for some catchments in the cerrado especially in the amazon and tocantins basins even if we find that some catchments benefit from longer lookback series we are building a single regional model thus further tests are required to assess whether using much longer lookback series can truly affect predictions for catchments influenced by shorter series the alternative would be to find the best trade off for the lookback series length across all catchments via hyperparameter tuning or using multiple regional models that cover smaller regions because the threshold used to determine the tsoi section 2 6 2 was empirically derived by f kratzert et al 2019a considering only two catchments there may be inconsistencies in the tsoi analysis in our empirical observations the threshold may actually differ for different catchments and periods of the year thus there is a degree of uncertainty in using a single threshold value perhaps more adequate methodologies can be developed for example the time step along the sum of integrated gradients across features that surpasses a small percentage of the sum of integrated gradients in the last step 4 conclusions in this study a single regional hydrological model is developed for the cerrado biome based on long short term memory neural networks using different input configurations three input configurations are assessed one considers only the meteorological forcing i1 another considers meteorological forcings and static catchment attributes i2 and a third also considers meteorological forcings and catchment attributes but where the land cover characteristics are dynamic i3 considering catchment attributes significantly improved the performance of the models median kge 0 69 when compared to using only meteorological forcings median kge 0 40 in addition considering the land cover changes resulted in significant improvement for predictions made under low flow conditions median rnse 0 62 as opposed to assuming these attributes as static median rnse 0 53 the models were benchmarked against a conceptual hydrological model calibrated on each basin individually median kge 0 71 and performed closely despite not performing as well as the benchmark model calibrated on individual basins we expect the regional lstm model to be more robust to environmental and climate changes since it has learned from a diverse number of examples in different climates and under significant land cover changes this hypothesis should be tested in a future study by separating catchments during cross validation and benchmarking against traditional streamflow regionalization techniques among the catchment attributes pasture grassland and savanna formation fractions showed the highest importance for streamflow prediction followed by the catchments mean slope and crop fractions previous hydrological knowledge of the region was compared to the features overall attribution to streamflow to confirm that the lstm hydrological model adequately learned from these attributes the number of time steps of influence for the model was also explored in the context of the major hydrographic basins intersecting the cerrado biome we can conclude that longer lookback series perhaps longer than 270 days are required to account for soil moisture accumulation in regions with higher precipitation and streamflow throughout the year however shorter lookback series 200 days seem sufficient in regions with shorter wet seasons and more arid conditions besides assessing the model for predicting streamflow series in ungauged catchments there are a few directions where future studies can go some of them are i better tuning the hyperparameters of the lstm model ii exploring other data sets available for catchment attributes or dynamic characteristics iii assessing different deep learning structures and their ability to learn from catchment attributes and iv putting together data sets from different

269,the impacts of land cover change have traditionally been assessed in hydrological modeling with a priori knowledge e g using methods based on the curve number or by calibrating hydrological models over different time periods however how hydrological processes respond to such changes is extremely context dependent thus there is an opportunity for the development of hydrological models that can learn from large hydrological data sets under the context of severe environmental changes in this study a single regional hydrological model is developed based on long short term memory lstm neural networks using different input configurations one model considers only meteorological forcings as inputs i1 another model considers meteorological forcings and static catchment attributes i2 and a third model also considers meteorological forcings and catchment attributes but where the land cover characteristics are dynamic i3 the models are trained using information from 411 catchments in the brazilian cerrado biome the data set includes for each catchment the daily streamflow observations target daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration meteorological forcings and 21 catchment attributes including topography climate indices soil characteristics and land cover characteristics considering catchment attributes increases the performance of the lstm model i2 and i3 median kge 0 69 considering the land use cover characteristics as dynamic improves the predictions under low flow conditions i3 median rnse 0 62 when compared to the model considering such characteristics as static i2 median rnse 0 53 this study also uses the deep network with the integrated gradients technique to explore the contribution of the catchment characteristics to streamflow and the number of time steps of influence for the deep network in different regions keywords cerrado data driven explainable artificial intelligence regional hydrological model 1 introduction a longstanding challenge in hydrological modeling is extrapolating hydrological information from gauged monitored areas to areas lacking information kratzert et al 2019b the prediction in ungauged basins pub initiative by the international association of hydrological sciences iahs has brought further attention to this challenge in the last two decades hrachowitz et al 2013 inaccurate knowledge of water availability can affect local water resource planning and management and severely harm social well being and economic development because river discharge is the major water resource for agricultural industrial and urban water use guo et al 2021 adequately extrapolating such information is crucial thus ungauged regions often depend on regionalization approaches to transfer information from hydrological model calibrated gauged catchments guo et al 2021 razavi and coulibaly 2013 the most common techniques used to transfer information are approaches based on the calibration of hydrological models on individual gauged catchments and i donating parameters to ungauged catchments by physical proximity and or similarity arsenault and brissette 2016 beck et al 2016 pool et al 2019 qi et al 2020 or ii building regressions to derive parameters at ungauged catchments based on catchment attributes arsenault and brissette 2016 beck et al 2016 h e 2020 however regression approaches are usually limited by the equifinality issue of parameter sets whereas parameter donation can be limited by the gage station network density regional heterogeneity with respect to topography climate and geology and low robustness of parameters to environmental and climate changes when working at larger scales i e regional or continental scales models can be calibrated for an entire region or subset of regions kratzert et al 2018 pagliero et al 2019 macroscale models are usually calibrated to regions clustered by physical similarities and spatial proximity so that the model is aware of characteristics such as vegetation topography and pedology another alternative as shown by beck et al 2016 is to produce parameter maps by regionalizing parameter sets of donor catchments this approach is also based on catchment attributes in the hope that the model adequately learns different hydrological behaviors data driven methods have recently gained much popularity by succeeding over process based models in mapping streamflows from meteorological forcing data bai et al 2021 fan et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 f kratzert et al 2019b the main advantage of these methods is that they are free from predetermined conceptual structures and can learn how to represent hydrological processes themselves nearing et al 2020 discuss how deep learning algorithms can better learn from hydrological variability in large samples and outperform models trained on individual catchments for example a recent study by f kratzert et al 2019b showed that ancillary data from catchment attributes were able to improve streamflow estimates of a single long short term memory neural network lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997a hydrological model trained on data from 531 catchments in the united states of america in fact the model proposed by the authors outperformed many popular conceptual hydrological models calibrated catchment by catchment or regionally as ancillary data f kratzert et al 2019b used 27 catchment attributes as static input features they recognized that treating catchment attributes as static is a strong assumption especially over long time periods moreover several studies have reported on the impacts of hydrological process dynamics inherent to land cover changes abdulkareem et al 2019 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 zhou et al 2015 traditionally the impacts of anthropogenic land cover changes have been simulated with methodologies based on the curve number abdulkareem et al 2019 gashaw et al 2018 oliveira et al 2016 v de p r da silva et al 2018 wang et al 2018 or calibrations over different periods liu et al 2009 however the use of the curve number can be limited by the many uncertainties related to land cover e g degraded pastures and grasslands density of forests cultivated crop varieties and soil and water conservation strategies assumptions made for catchment characteristics can be detrimental to hydrological modeling when enough information is not available however nearing et al 2020 discuss how deep learning has the potential to skip steps that introduce uncertainty in the modeling chain thus there is an opportunity for the development of a data driven hydrological model that can benefit and learn from inputting high quality land cover data as a dynamic feature in addition recent advances in model explainability for artificial intelligence sundararajan et al 2017 can help hydrologists gain new insights from their models f kratzert et al 2019a given the importance of land cover changes on hydrological responses the objective of this study is to develop a hydrological model that considers land cover characteristics as dynamic and assess whether including such information can improve the predictions made by the model 2 materials and methods the study area in this paper is the brazilian cerrado biome its watersheds are characterized by a tropical climate and strong seasonality the cerrado biome is a good candidate for this study because significant land cover changes have been reported in recent decades althoff et al 2020 mapbiomas 2020 it is considered the most important biome with respect to agriculture and has many areas classified as high potential for expanding irrigation activities althoff and rodrigues 2019 fealq 2014 however many regions of the cerrado biome have also reported conflicts over water use pousa et al 2019 thus hydrological models developed for the region should able to leverage land cover changes from the past and to predict future changes the following subsections describe the data driven hydrological model the input configurations tested the streamflow and features data sets the criteria used to assess performance the benchmarking strategies and the techniques used for model interpretation 2 1 hydrological model the hydrological model used for this study is a type of recurrent neural network rnn specifically the long short term memory lstm neural network hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997a in particular the lstm configuration does not suffer from vanishing gradients and is suited for learning long term dependencies hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997b recurrent layers consist of memory cells that are able to store information over sequential time steps similar to state vectors f kratzert et al 2019b the lstm is therefore able to model watershed processes such as soil moisture and or snow accumulation comparably to process based models f kratzert et al 2019a the following subsections describe the operations behind the lstm network section 2 1 1 and the model and training setups chosen for the study section 2 1 2 2 1 1 long short term neural network lstm layers consist of a number of consecutive memory cells that are responsible for transferring updating two states over consecutive time steps a cell state and a hidden state the cell state characterizes the memory of the system and the hidden state characterizes what the layer will eventually output at the last time step of the sequence in a memory cell the hidden state of the previous time step output of the previous memory cell and the input vector at the current time step pass through three gate units that control which information is added or removed from the cell and hidden states these gate units are the input gate the forget gate and the output gate the forget gate ft eq 1 deletes information from the cell state while the input gate it eq 2 and cell update gt eq 3 add new information to it eq 4 the input gate controls which components of the cell state are updated and the cell updates what information is added last the output gate ot eq 5 controls which information is updated to the hidden state ht eq 6 given an input sequence x x1 xt with t time steps where xt is a vector of input features at time step t 1 t t the forward pass through the lstm layer can be described by the following equations 1 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f 2 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i 3 g t tanh w g x t u g h t 1 b g 4 c t f t c t 1 i t g t 5 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where ft it and ot are the forget gate input gate and output gate respectively and gt is the cell update at time step t 1 t t ht 1 and ct 1 are the hidden state and cell state at the previous time step t 1 respectively w and u are weight matrices and b is a weight vector representing the learnable parameters for each gate the subscripts indicate their respective gates σ is the sigmoid function outputs between 0 and 1 tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function outputs between 1 and 1 and is the elementwise multiplication 2 1 2 hyperparameters and training setups the structure chosen for the study consisted of an input layer a single hidden layer lstm and an output layer the input layer received an input array of two dimensions one dimension representing the number of input features and the other dimension representing the number of time steps lookback series the number of input features depended on the input configuration see section 2 2 whereas the lookback series was fixed at 270 time steps a dropout rate of 0 4 was applied to the lstm layer during the training phase which consisted of 256 memory cell units the dropout rate was adopted as a regularization technique i e to reduce the chances of overfitting the model srivastava et al 2014 the number of time steps memory cells and the dropout rate were chosen based on the study by f kratzert et al 2019b the lstm was run in a sequence to value mode to output a single prediction the daily discharge the models were trained considering the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as an objective function for training the model the batch size was set to 1024 and the epochs were set to 100 both based on computer limitations and experimentation the data set see section 2 3 the hydrocerrado data set was split into training and testing periods the training period consisted of the first 75 of available observations of the time series for each catchment while the testing period consisted of the remaining 25 of available observations a validation set with 20 of the observations in the training period was randomly subset from the training set the validation set was used to track performance improvements over each epoch and avoid choosing weights from an overfitted model the models were built and trained using the r programming language and environment r core team 2020 and the following r packages were used dplyr wickham et al 2020 tensorflow falbel allaire rstudio et al 2020 keras falbel et al 2020 and kerasgenerator herlambang 2019 the keras callback model checkpoint was used to save the model s weights after each epoch in the training phase the weights that performed best for the validation set and without signs of overfitting were chosen as the final set of weights for the models 2 2 input configurations instead of the traditional station by station calibration of multiple models this study focuses on the ability of a single regional model to capture hydrologic behaviors in different catchments therefore three input configurations are used to train different lstm hydrological models lstm with no attributes a single lstm hydrological model is trained on combined calibration data of all catchments using meteorological features lstm with static attributes a single lstm hydrological model is trained on combined calibration data of all catchments using time series of meteorological features and 21 static catchment attributes lstm with static and dynamic attributes a single lstm hydrological model is trained on combined calibration data of all catchments using time series of meteorological features and 12 static and 9 dynamic catchment attributes the meteorological features are time series of the daily precipitation p and daily penman monteith reference evapotranspiration e averaged over each catchment i e the pixels from daily grids within a given catchment boundary are averaged as a single value for each day while only precipitation and evapotranspiration are considered for the first input configuration 21 catchment attributes are considered for the second and third input configurations these attributes relate to catchment topography log transformed area mean elevation and mean slope climate indices mean annual precipitation mean annual evapotranspiration timing of precipitation index and aridity index soil characteristics clay content silt content sand content organic carbon content and bulk density and land cover characteristics forest formation forest plantation savanna formation grassland pasture crops urban infrastructure river and lake and wetland fractions all sources of input features are described in section 2 3 although all the catchment attributes are considered static for the second input configuration substantial changes in land cover characteristics have been documented in many regions of the cerrado biome over the last few decades mapbiomas 2020 althoff et al 2021 submitted therefore the third input configuration assesses whether accounting for environmental changes represented by yearly information on land cover fractions can improve streamflow predictions while the second input configuration considers these variables static i e the same values for the entire time series for each land cover fraction the third input configuration updates the values of land cover fractions for different years 2 3 the hydrocerrado data set the hydrocerrado data set consists of a regional sample data set for catchments in the cerrado biome compiled by althoff et al 2021 and made available at https github com daniel althoff hydrocerrado the data set includes information on catchment boundaries daily time series of observed streamflow daily time series of meteorological forcing precipitation and penman monteith evapotranspiration and catchment attributes a brief description overview is given in the following subsections for the target variable of the lstm hydrological model the daily streamflow and the input features 2 3 1 daily streamflow the streamflow database consists of daily streamflow observations for 411 catchments within or intersecting the cerrado biome the observations in the database cover the period from 2000 06 01 to 2014 12 31 where catchments have at least 5 years of equivalent observed data median 14 6 years mean 14 0 years catchment areas range from 51 to 746 000 km2 and the mean daily streamflow ranges from 0 005 to 2 844 mm day 1 more information on the data quality assessment can be found in althoff et al 2021 according to the pfafstetter hierarchical classification of basins furnans and olivera 2001 pfafstetter 1989 the cerrado catchments are distributed over 6 of brazil s 8 major basins fig 1 a the locations of the gage stations and respective catchment boundaries are shown in fig 1b 2 3 2 input features p and e daily time series were derived from the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2019 2019 and the gridded reference evapotranspiration for brazil based on machine learning eto brazil althoff et al 2020a althoff 2020b respectively and averaged over catchment areas the log transform area mean altitude and mean slope are derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model at 3 arc seconds earth resources observation and science center 2017 the mean annual precipitation p and the mean annual evapotranspiration e are derived from the p and e time series the timing of the precipitation index is estimated using sine curves to represent the annual e and p cycles eq 14 in woods 2009 the aridity index is the ratio between mean annual evapotranspiration and rainfall e p soil characteristics are derived from the soilgrids data sets hengl et al 2017 for the top 2 0 m soil layer land use characteristics are derived from the mapbiomas data sets mapbiomas 2020 an overview of several catchment attributes is given in fig 2 before training all features are standardized to their respective mean and standard deviation of the training period we recognize that as derived gridded products there is a general uncertainty in the catchment attributes for example taking the mean elevation or annual rainfall from different digital elevation models or different precipitation gridded products would lead to different values however using multiple sources of the same feature e g different gridded rainfall products has been shown to improve performance in rainfall runoff modeling with deep learning kratzert et al 2020 2 4 assessment of model performance the performance of the lstm hydrological models was assessed for each catchment using the following criteria kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and relative nse rnse krause et al 2005 these criteria are calculated as follows 7 k g e 1 e d k g e 1 w i t h e d r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 8 n s e 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 n s e 1 9 r n s e 1 i 1 n x i x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x x 2 r n s e 1 where xi and x i are the observed and predicted streamflow at time step i respectively x is the mean observed streamflow n is the number of observations ed is the euclidian distance r is the linear correlation coefficient between x i and xi α is the variability ratio or the ratio between the standard deviation of predicted values and the standard deviation of observed values σ x σ x and β is the ratio between the mean predicted and mean observed values μ x μ x the nse is one of the most traditional goodness of fit criteria used in water resources and is reported in most applicable studies due to some well reported nse limitations gupta et al 2009 krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 schaefli and gupta 2007 the kge is chosen as the main performance indicator and objective function for training the models the kge decomposes errors in terms of mean flow flow variability and flow dynamics gupta et al 2009 since the rnse gives more emphasis to low flow conditions it is chosen considering the importance of water availability in the cerrado biome during the dry season the paired wilcoxon test is used to compare scores found for different models input configurations where p 0 05 means that there is a statistical difference between scores the adoption of intervals and thresholds with respect to performance criteria can be viewed as a subjective means to assess the performance of hydrological models especially in large scale hydrology this is because the criteria are not intercomparable among basins under different contexts i e different seasonality and rainfall runoff dynamics gupta et al 2009 thus the performance of the hydrological models is compared to the performance of benchmarks section 2 5 if a model performs better than the lower limit benchmark the model can be considered useful 2 5 benchmarking the intention in using benchmarks is to assess if the models result in reasonable simulations therefore we compare the performance achieved by the lstm hydrological models against a high and a low quality benchmark the benchmark model high quality benchmark is a conceptual bucket style hydrological model calibrated to individual catchments the benchmark series low quality benchmark is a mean monthly streamflow series observed for each catchment in the training period the high quality benchmark represents an upper limit of expected performance for lumped hydrological models in this case we adopt the performance obtained for the testing period in a previous study althoff et al 2021 by running the gr5j model benchmark model for the same catchments and on the same meteorological forcing the gr5j model le moine 2008 pushpalatha et al 2011 is a conceptual bucket style rainfall runoff model requiring only meteorological forcings as input this is considered a high quality benchmark since models were calibrated for each catchment individually in an attempt to better adjust to catchment uniqueness the mean monthly streamflow series is considered a low quality benchmark because it simply repeats the mean monthly streamflow for all days in a corresponding month thus it has no complexity and considers no processes despite being documented to provide high performance scores in some cases althoff et al 2021 2 6 lstm model interpretation to interpret the lstm hydrological models the integrated gradients technique sundararajan et al 2017 is adopted gradients are analogous to model coefficients and measure the attribution of each input feature to the output since neural networks are completely differentiable it is possible to calculate the exact gradient with respect to the input features f kratzert et al 2019b therefore the gradients can be integrated along the path of the input dimension lookback series for lstms and a baseline vector sequence of zeros measuring the attribution of each feature in the final prediction in this study the gradient integral was approximated using the trapezoidal rule more details on the procedures for this technique are found in kratzert et al 2019a and sundararajan et al 2017 the following subsections describe how this technique is used to rank catchment attribute importance and compute the number of time steps of influence for the model 2 6 1 importance of features to estimate the importance of the features used to train the models i e catchment attributes a global sensitivity analysis was performed gradients were obtained for all features and for each observation in the testing period the global sensitivity measure of individual features was derived for each catchment by taking their average absolute gradient f kratzert et al 2019b because the magnitude of the streamflow varies for different catchments for each catchment we normalized the feature sensitivity with respect to the sum of sensitivities obtained for the catchment attributes 2 6 2 time steps of influence the time steps of influence tsoi is a measure of how many past days actually influence the streamflow prediction f kratzert et al 2019a to compute the tsoi the procedure presented by f kratzert et al 2019a was used first integrated gradients were summed across features for each time step then the difference from time step to time step was computed to find the time step t 1 t t when the difference exceeded a threshold of 0 002 this threshold was empirically set by f kratzert et al 2019a to ignore noise in the integrated gradient signal for each observation in the testing period the tsoi was calculated by the following 10 t s o i t t where t is the total length of the sequence i e 270 and t is the time step when the difference between consecutive time steps exceeds the threshold 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance obtained by different input configurations this section presents the comparison between three different input configurations used for the lstm hydrological models discussed in section 2 2 fig 3 shows the cumulative density functions for the performance scores obtained for each catchment in the testing period when considering only the meteorological forcing the model obtained median kge nse and rnse values of 0 40 0 16 and 0 17 respectively approximately 25 of the stations gave a kge score greater than 0 59 this input configuration for the lstm hydrological model was able to improve the median kge and median rnse by 0 04 and 0 51 respectively in relation to the benchmark series on the other hand by not considering catchment attributes the median kge and rnse achieved by the model were 0 31 and 0 55 lower than those obtained by the high quality benchmark i e the performance obtained using gr5j models calibrated for each catchment by considering catchment attributes the lstm model showed significant improvement in the overall performance for the catchments which was expected when considering all the catchment attributes as static the lstm model scored median kge nse and rnse values of 0 69 0 56 and 0 53 respectively these data indicate a kge that is 0 33 times higher than that of the benchmark series and 0 29 times higher than that of the lstm model considering no attributes in contrast the lstm model trained on both static and dynamic catchment attributes i e land characteristics as dynamic in time resulted in median kge nse and rnse values of 0 69 0 59 and 0 62 respectively overall both models that considered catchment attributes scored closer to the high quality benchmark kge 0 71 and rnse 0 72 although the median rnse score was higher by 0 09 for the lstm model considering changes in land cover characteristics as opposed to considering such characteristics as static this means that by considering the environmental changes over time the model was able to give a better prediction under low flow conditions f kratzert et al 2019b also highlight that randomness in the training procedures may be further mitigated by running model ensembles and improving final predictions the advantage of calibrating a model for each catchment is that the model is able to better capture the catchment uniqueness beven 2020 such uniqueness may be difficult for a regional model to capture since it may be poorly reflected in the available considered attributes in contrast the conceptual structure of a hydrological model can also limit the performance for particular catchments in addition it is difficult for conceptual models to extend their calibrated parameters to consider changes in land cover these models are less robust to changes in both the environment and climate the regional model on the other hand learns from a very diverse number of scenarios overall the lstm model with both static and dynamic attributes has lower kge and rnse scores in 55 paired wilcoxon test p 0 001 and 54 p 0 001 of the catchments respectively when compared to the benchmark model fig 4 a although with similar performance the wilcoxon test shows that the performance of the lstm model is still lacking when compared to a model calibrated on individual catchments considering land cover as dynamic also resulted in kge and rnse scores higher than 52 p 0 52 and 60 p 0 001 of the catchments respectively when compared to assuming these characteristics as static this means that considering land cover changes significantly improved the predictions under low flow conditions there are a few catchments that perform better by considering only the meteorological forcing which is due to the general simulations of the lstm that considers catchment attributes failing to represent the unique hydrological responses of particular catchments in fact the structure of the lstm model has also failed to map hydrological processes for some catchments since the lower limit benchmark the time series based on mean monthly streamflow observed in the training period is able to outperform the lstm model in 10 of the catchments nevertheless the model is useful for 90 of the catchments outperforming the lower limit benchmark perhaps by considering different model structures and hyperparameters a better overall performance could be reached for the lstm model another alternative would be to mitigate randomness in predictions by running model ensembles f kratzert et al 2019b however in both cases running multiple calibrations on such a large data set would take a considerable amount of time for an ordinary computer although it is well known that machine learning models can perform well under the stationarity assumption f kratzert et al 2019b wu et al 2019 they will hardly be applicable for non stationary data non stationarity may come from changes in climate and environment which will affect how rainfall is partitioned into evaporation runoff and surface and subsurface storages thus considering the current attributes of a given catchment can help to address its streamflow prediction in different years of the study period however the length of the lookback series may not be enough to address for example long term changes in groundwater storage that are fundamental in regulating streamflow this could perhaps be better explored in a future study for individual catchments that experienced severe disturbances considering catchment attributes as input makes the models developed here a great alternative for the regionalization of streamflow series to ungauged areas when conceptual hydrological models are considered the regionalization usually relies on donating the parameters calibrated at gauged catchments to ungauged catchments based on their similarity guo et al 2021 similarity can be measured either by spatial proximity or physical similarity the success attributed to donating parameters by spatial proximity comes from nearby catchments presenting similar climate and environment in contrast the pitfall of regionalization approaches based on the physical similarities of catchments is not knowing how much weight should be given to the different attributes considered the advantage of using data driven models for regionalization is that these models learn to generalize the effect of different attributes on streamflow at a given region in addition all the variables considered here as input to these models are readily available to make predictions for any ungauged catchment in the region 3 2 feature ranking after confirming that catchment attributes increased the ability of the lstm hydrological model to simulate streamflow we assessed the overall importance of such features for predictions made in the testing period by collecting their individual integrated gradients fig 5 presents the average sensitivity of each catchment attribute for the 411 catchments in the testing period this analysis was carried out only for the model which considered besides meteorological forcings 12 static and 9 dynamic attributes as input the feature importance was ranked considering the lstm model with both static and dynamic attributes as inputs among the catchment attributes the land cover characteristics which are the dynamic attributes were the ones that showed the highest sensitivities e g pasture 1 grassland 2 savanna formation 3 crop 5 and forest formation 7 fractions pastures occupy most of the land cover in the cerrado catchments average from 411 catchments in 2014 35 2 followed by savanna formation 24 7 forest formation 15 8 crops 13 3 and grassland 8 0 despite the large areas of forest in the cerrado catchments its lesser attribution on streamflow may be because they are generally less prone to runoff generation than the other aforementioned land covers falcão et al 2020 this is because forests are better at intercepting and infiltrating rainfall and at the same time make use of water available in deeper soil layers for evapotranspiration the remaining land cover characteristics occupy relatively small portions of areas in the cerrado biome and show lower sensitivity in the model the topographic characteristic that showed the highest sensitivity was the catchment mean slope 4 followed by area and 10 mean elevation 11 the effect of slope on runoff and infiltration has long been studied nassif and wilson 1975 where an increased slope generally results in increased runoff and lower infiltration i e higher or lower flows during the wet or dry season to confirm whether the model correctly learns these effects the median gradients by catchment attribute and year are plotted against the catchment attributes fig 6 the gradients and attribute values are standardized for each plot to better assess their relationship regardless of their magnitude indeed fig 6 shows a positive slope for the catchment mean slope while the area and mean elevation show slopes close to 0 i e no clear relationship between the variable and their attribution to streamflow for climate characteristics the mean precipitation 6 and timing index 8 show higher sensitivities than the mean evapotranspiration 12 and aridity index 18 fig 5 the mean precipitation sensitivity is higher likely because it is the main driver of runoff generation and shows a positive correlation with the gradient fig 6 the precipitation timing index on the other hand indicates whether rainfall occurs in the warmer positive index or colder negative index season positive timing index values are related to lower attribution to streamflow since water is made available for evaporation in a more arid environment this relationship is also confirmed by the negative slope in fig 6 in contrast mean evapotranspiration and the aridity index show a positive slope fig 6 which is not expected generally higher evapotranspiration and more arid environments are related to lower streamflow and a negative correlation to gradients is expected the gradient decreases as the mean evapotranspiration increases until a given point but increases for higher mean evapotranspiration values as the final streamflow prediction depends on the sum of all feature gradients it is possible that the relationships of gradients to higher mean evapotranspiration and higher aridity became weak thus presenting gradients closer to 0 nonstandardized gradient values for higher values of these variables soil characteristics show the least importance to the lstm model considering both static and dynamic features fig 5 and therefore the least attribution to streamflow generally sand and organic carbon show a positive correlation with infiltration rates whereas clay silt and bulk density show a negative correlation with infiltration rates patle et al 2019 fig 6 shows a negative or positive slope for sand or silt which confirms our previous knowledge sand or silt with higher or lower infiltration rates results in less or more direct runoff generation normally a positive slope would be expected for clay however the soils in the cerrado biome are older and well structured providing soil with larger macropore volumes e m silva et al 2003 therefore higher infiltration rates occur in the cerrado biome despite loamy soils reflecting a negative slope between clay and the gradient bulk density and soil organic matter on the other hand have slopes close to 0 although we recognize that the uncertainties and biases related to using a global gridded soil product can reflect poor learning of the model the soil characteristics provide some useful information to the model that agrees with previous hydrological knowledge in the region for land cover characteristics fig 6 shows a negative correlation with forest plantations grasslands and savanna formations while forest formations show a slope close to zero in general this means that greater natural formation fractions result in a decreased attribution to runoff likely because of increased infiltration in contrast pasture and crop fractions show positive slopes i e less infiltration and increased attribution to runoff rivers and lakes and urban infrastructure also show positive slopes because they usually directly translate rainfall into direct runoff with the exception of reservoirs or other structures engineered to retain runoff harvest rainfall to provide a closer look at the land cover attribution to streamflow throughout the year the median gradient is taken for each day of the year and catchment and the interquartile ranges for all catchments are highlighted in fig 7 for instance vegetated land cover with the exception of wetlands show similar behavior although at different magnitudes it has a higher positive attribution gradient to streamflow in the wet season and a lower attribution in the dry season the median attribution gradient of urban infrastructure and river and lake fractions to streamflow generation is close to zero with interquartile ranges showing both positive and negative values the positive attribution in the wet season can be related to rainfall translating directly to streamflow which would result in a negative attribution in the dry season i e lower base flow in contrast the negative attribution in the wet season can be related to the interception of excess runoff in reservoirs or rain harvesting structures and could result in a positive attribution in the dry season higher base flow wetland fractions likely show lower importance because of their small representativeness in terms of area and variance close to 0 fig 5 however their hydrological behavior is accurately captured this result shows a positive attribution to streamflow in the wet season because precipitation falls in saturated areas in contrast lower infiltration results in a negative attribution in the dry season overall there is also much information with respect to the land cover characteristics that influence hydrological responses that are not available for instance how dense are the forests how old are the forest plantations are pastures and grasslands degraded which crops are planted in which period of the year what tillage systems are used however even if this information was available there would likely still be many uncertainties and biases thus it is not guaranteed that the model would be able to adequately learn these interactions especially in a lumped model 3 3 time steps of influence in this study we followed the findings of a previous large scale study f kratzert et al 2019b to set the model hyperparameters however one important aspect that can change for different regions and climates and that should be considered when building the lstm models is the length of the lookback series for example using an overly extensive lookback series takes longer to train and can add unnecessary noise to the model in contrast a short lookback series may not be able to fully capture the effects related to the water balance and soil moisture accounting fig 8 presents the time step of influence tsoi observed within each of the major hydrographic basins intersecting the cerrado biome the catchments within the north northeast atlantic east atlantic and são francisco basins show a lower tsoi than the catchments within the amazon tocantins and parana basins the maximum median tsois of the north northeast atlantic east atlantic and são francisco are 101 115 and 114 respectively the tsoi begins increasing at the beginning of the wet season and starts decreasing in the transition between the wet and dry seasons as precipitation inputs decrease during the dry season so does tsoi which shows less influence from distant time steps the maximum median tsois of the amazon tocantins and paraná are 268 263 and 180 respectively catchments with higher streamflow and precipitation magnitudes tend to have a higher dependency on the lookback series because soil moisture is a key factor in predicting runoff ghajarnia et al 2020 thus longer series are required for the lstm model to adequately represent the effects of antecedent soil moisture on rainfall runoff events and model the processes as soil moisture accumulation however it seems that the 270 time step lookback series as suggested by f kratzert et al 2019b for the camels data set and adopted herein may not have been enough for some catchments in the cerrado especially in the amazon and tocantins basins even if we find that some catchments benefit from longer lookback series we are building a single regional model thus further tests are required to assess whether using much longer lookback series can truly affect predictions for catchments influenced by shorter series the alternative would be to find the best trade off for the lookback series length across all catchments via hyperparameter tuning or using multiple regional models that cover smaller regions because the threshold used to determine the tsoi section 2 6 2 was empirically derived by f kratzert et al 2019a considering only two catchments there may be inconsistencies in the tsoi analysis in our empirical observations the threshold may actually differ for different catchments and periods of the year thus there is a degree of uncertainty in using a single threshold value perhaps more adequate methodologies can be developed for example the time step along the sum of integrated gradients across features that surpasses a small percentage of the sum of integrated gradients in the last step 4 conclusions in this study a single regional hydrological model is developed for the cerrado biome based on long short term memory neural networks using different input configurations three input configurations are assessed one considers only the meteorological forcing i1 another considers meteorological forcings and static catchment attributes i2 and a third also considers meteorological forcings and catchment attributes but where the land cover characteristics are dynamic i3 considering catchment attributes significantly improved the performance of the models median kge 0 69 when compared to using only meteorological forcings median kge 0 40 in addition considering the land cover changes resulted in significant improvement for predictions made under low flow conditions median rnse 0 62 as opposed to assuming these attributes as static median rnse 0 53 the models were benchmarked against a conceptual hydrological model calibrated on each basin individually median kge 0 71 and performed closely despite not performing as well as the benchmark model calibrated on individual basins we expect the regional lstm model to be more robust to environmental and climate changes since it has learned from a diverse number of examples in different climates and under significant land cover changes this hypothesis should be tested in a future study by separating catchments during cross validation and benchmarking against traditional streamflow regionalization techniques among the catchment attributes pasture grassland and savanna formation fractions showed the highest importance for streamflow prediction followed by the catchments mean slope and crop fractions previous hydrological knowledge of the region was compared to the features overall attribution to streamflow to confirm that the lstm hydrological model adequately learned from these attributes the number of time steps of influence for the model was also explored in the context of the major hydrographic basins intersecting the cerrado biome we can conclude that longer lookback series perhaps longer than 270 days are required to account for soil moisture accumulation in regions with higher precipitation and streamflow throughout the year however shorter lookback series 200 days seem sufficient in regions with shorter wet seasons and more arid conditions besides assessing the model for predicting streamflow series in ungauged catchments there are a few directions where future studies can go some of them are i better tuning the hyperparameters of the lstm model ii exploring other data sets available for catchment attributes or dynamic characteristics iii assessing different deep learning structures and their ability to learn from catchment attributes and iv putting together data sets from different
