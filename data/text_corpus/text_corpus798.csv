3990,the construction of three gorges dam tgd has exerted substantial effects on local hydrological regime and eco system since its operation in 2003 due to this significant anthropogenic activity drought propagation processes from meteorological drought to hydrological m h and soil moisture m s drought are inevitably modified however current studies are still insufficient to answer whether the tgd operation mitigated or exacerbated the drought propagation process due to its complex impacts to explore this key issue this study proposed an integrated framework to quantify the impact of tgd construction on drought propagation process in the yangtze river basin yrb the drought characteristics propagation models and propagation time were calculated to identify the modification of drought propagation process between different tgd operation scenarios trend and attribution analyses were also utilized to explore potential influence factors results demonstrated that tgd construction did significantly aggravate the drought characteristics propagation specifically the slopes of hydrological drought duration and severity in linear propagation models increased 23 98 and 29 23 in average while for m s propagation the slopes of duration and severity models increased 28 72 and 21 91 respectively this research also found that after tgd operation the m h propagation speed had been slowed down but the m s lag time became shorter additionally the variations and trend patterns of six potential influence factors at four separate periods were full analyzed to provide implications for the drought propagation modifications and tgd operation was confirmed to become a major factor inducing the variations of annual runoff which accounted for 56 75 for the entire yrb the above quantitative findings are expected to reveal the potential changes of drought propagation process caused by the construction of tgd in yrb the proposed integrated framework is also beneficial to the drought early warning system and understanding of drought development not only in yrb but also in other basins at the global scale keywords drought propagation model construction three gorges dam yangtze river basin 1 introduction drought is a complex and multifaceted disaster affecting agriculture water resources economy and even human s lives wilhite 2000 dai 2011 sheffield and wood 2012 zhang et al 2019 besides the great progresses achieved in drought monitoring and prediction researches van loon et al 2016 xu et al 2018 deng et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 there are still many challenges needed to be solved drought propagation as the conceptualization of drought emergence evolution and development has been one of these critical challenges and attracted much attention in recent years eltahir and yeh 1999 van loon 2015 there is no doubt that climate change affects drought propagation van loon et al 2016 mishra and singh 2010 while in this human influenced era the intensification of anthropogenic activities e g carbon dioxide emission deforestation urbanization dam construction have also become the main driving forces of the changes of drought evolution lópez moreno et al 2009 mo 2011 zhang et al 2015 gu et al 2019a b as the largest concrete gravity dam in the world the three gorges dam tgd was constructed and commissioned since 2003 tgd is of great significance for various water and hydropower supplies in central and eastern china however a number of researches have pointed out that its operation has also affected and posed great challenges to hydrological circle and eco system of the entire yangtze river basin wang et al 2020b zhao et al 2017 peng et al 2020 li et al 2013 investigated that the initial operation of tgd slightly aggravated the hydrological drought at one downstream hydrological station in yangtze river basin yrb during 2003 to 2011 yu et al 2018 concluded that significant abrupt changes of hydrological drought were identified and highly correlated the impoundment stages of tgd thus the drought propagation process is also believed to be affected aghakouchak et al 2015 aghakouchak 2016 apurv and cai 2020 however it is still unknown whether the construction of tgd after 2003 had exacerbated the drought propagation process or mitigated it especially for this particular region in other words the key scientific question is that did the soil moisture drought or hydrological drought triggered by meteorological drought evolve faster and stronger or slower and weaker due to the tgd operation to date topics regarding the effects of dam construction on drought have focused on single types of droughts huang et al 2015 huang et al 2017 for example wu et al 2018 found the reservoir regulation reduced hydrological drought duration and severity in dongjiang river basin china most drought propagation related studies began around 21st century when scientists focused on the correlation and propagation time between the sub types of droughts li et al 2020b wang et al 2020a van loon and laaha 2015 leng et al 2015 for example zhou et al 2021 investigated the hydrological drought propagation time based on pearson correlation coefficient in pearl river basin and concluded that large scale climate patterns were important influence factor xu et al 2019 studied the human impact to the propagation of meteorological and hydrological drought in the northern china and initially revealed the reservoir construction and urbanization shortened the propagation time while agricultural activities increased it although some researchers have investigated the quantification of drought propagation and its driven factors at some certain regions there are still some critical issues that have not been fully solved on one hand most previous studies targeted on the propagation time but ignored other important drought characteristics e g duration severity which could provide more insights in the propagation of other sub types of droughts based on the meteorological drought characteristics li et al 2016 wu et al 2017a chen et al 2020 on the other hand variable infiltration capacity vic and soil and water assessment tool swat have been usually adopted in some studies to attribute the human and climate influences in modifying drought propagation however such hydrological models usually require large amount of good quality data while the parameterizations and the structure of the models are difficult to be optimized in this case statistical models are superiors in its simple forms and powerful capabilities of capturing features from data along with fast and easy calculation procedure which have been widely applied in drought related studies edossa et al 2009 ye et al 2016 chen et al 2020 as aforementioned current studies are insufficient to fully reveal the drought propagation characteristics including the propagation modification caused by human activities like tgd operation therefore it is vital to construct a scientific framework to quantify the effects of tgd construction on drought propagation process in yangtze river basin yrb to this point the main objectives of this study are to answer the following key questions 1 did the drought characteristics of soil moisture and hydrological drought triggered by meteorological drought show variations under the tgd operation 2 how did the response time of m h meteorological drought to hydrological drought and m s meteorological drought to soil moisture drought change before and after the construction of tgd 3 what were potential factors leading to the modification of drought propagation in yrb and to what extent tgd operation and other factors e g climate change contributed to this modification building off the investigation of these questions this study will form a comprehensive understanding of the impact of tgd construction on drought propagation in yrb and provide valuable input for drought precaution and early warning system in the near future 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yrb is the third largest river basin in the world contributing significantly to the economy and climate in china and even the world the entire watershed covers an area of 1 8 million km2 accounting for nearly 18 8 of the whole country and accommodates 33 of china s total population with the higher altitude in the west and lower in the east the yrb shows a three step ladder distribution therefore the climate hydrology characteristic and land cover vary greatly in different sub regions although the water resources in yrb is relatively rich the distribution is quite uneven with a range of annual precipitation from 500 mm in the west to 2500 mm to the east mainly concentrated in summer in recent decades the intensified human activities and climate change accelerate the variation of drought characteristic and water cycle in yrb lu et al 2014 it was found that the frequency of drought showed an upward trend in the middle region of yrb from 1965 to 2005 zhai et al 2010 and lu et al 2016 predicted that the duration and frequency of drought would increase during 2021 2050 compared to 1971 2000 in the upper reach of yrb since the operation of tgd in 2003 the hydrological patterns and ecosystem of yrb have been alerted significantly to this point a comprehensive analysis on the modification of drought propagation process between different types of droughts is of great importance in understanding the drought development in yrb to analysis the spatial heterogeneity within this large basin total 9 sub basin table 1 in yrb were identified according to their topography hydrological characteristics and ground cover as shown in fig 1 2 2 data in this study monthly surface runoff and soil moisture were adopted to calculate drought indices and monitor hydrological and soil moisture drought although station based observations can be relatively more accurate at point scale the uneven distribution and density of the network may still be insufficient to fully describe the spatial distribution of runoff and soil moisture in yrb ma et al 2021 xu et al 2021 zhang and chen 2016 to this point grid based reanalysis data was considered as a supplement for in situ measurements to conduct drought analysis shi et al 2020 harrigan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 in this study monthly total runoff surface soil moisture and precipitation were obtained from era5 land reanalysis data provided by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 land combines model data with in situ observations from across the world using the 4d var data assimilation technique and improves from the originally era interim hersbach et al 2020 the data has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and ranges from 1981 to 2020 compared to era5 which applies tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land tessel model the era5 land adopts hydrology tessel htessel model to simulate land surface variables htessel uses the formulation of soil hydrologic conductivity and diffusivity and improves the surface runoff generation according to a variable infiltration capacity based on soil type and local topography alfieri et al 2020 ecmwf 2016 the era5 land runoff has been validated against long term in situ observations and the results indicate high consistence muñoz sabater et al 2021 tan et al 2020 fan et al 2021 besides era5 land runoff has also been used to conduct drought propagation researches by previous studies zhou et al 2021 to evaluate the runoff data in era5 land we compared the runoff data which was from global flood awareness system glofas that provides the global hydrologic reanalysis data based on the era5 land datasets with in situ observations at three hydrological stations i e huatan pingshan shigu fan et al 2021 results are shown in fig s1 it can be seen that era5 based runoff data represented high correlation coefficients nearly 0 9 with in situ runoff therefore era5 land runoff could provide reasonable confidence to calculate drought index in addition other meteorological data including sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity were obtained from 184 weather stations surrounding yrb provided by china meteorological data service center cmdc 3 methods fig 2 presented the proposed method to explore the drought propagation in yrb in this study first standardized precipitation index spi standardized runoff index sri and standardized soil moisture index ssmi were adopted to represent meteorological hydrological and soil moisture droughts respectively then the drought characteristics propagation models were constructed and validated based on the drought events identified by run theory to further analyze the linkage between m h and m s propagation the cross wavelet transform was performed on the drought indices series and based on that the pearson correlation coefficient was used to calculate the propagation time additionally sen s slope and mann kendall trend test were utilized to explore the potential influence factors leading to the modification of drought propagation process in yrb while attribution analysis based on budyko hypothesis was conducted to determine the role of tgd operation in modifying drought propagation the proposed framework fully excavated the propagation features such as drought characteristics and propagation speed and revealed the potential influence factors by tgd operation based on the statistical methods which made it possible to be transferred to other similar basins at global scale 3 1 standardized drought indices to quantify meteorological drought hydrological and soil moisture drought the drought indices including spi sri and ssmi were taken respectively mckee et al 1993 shukla and wood 2008 hao and aghakouchak 2013 all these indices follow the same steps in computation which make the analysis and comparison possible taking spi as an example the first step is to fit a proper probability function for the precipitation series here precipitation runoff and soil moisture were fitted with gamma pearson iii and weibull distribution which had been validated by the previous studies mckee et al 1993 shukla et al 2011 and then spi is calculated through converting the cumulative probability to standard normal deviation since spi can be calculated in different time scales it is usually adopted to represent different drought patterns e g short term and long term in this study 1 month sri and ssmi were calculated while time scales of spi ranged from 1 to 24 months in order to better describe the response between m h and m s propagation more detail about the calculation can refer to mckee et al 1993 the drought level classification of these indices was listed in table s1 3 2 construction of drought characteristics propagation models since the drought characteristic duration and severity usually contains much information related to drought development a propagation model considering the relationship between drought characteristic of meteorological hydrological and soil moisture drought is crucial for the comprehensive understanding of drought propagation this hidden information has long been ignored by most studies the specific process to build drought propagation model follows the steps below step 1 based on the precipitation runoff and soil moisture data the drought indices including spi sri ssmi were calculated respectively step 2 in order to better describe the response relationship between meteorological hydrological and soil moisture drought the pearson correlation coefficient was adopted to select the spi time scales which had the highest correlation coefficients with sri 1 and ssmi 1 separately here sri 1 and ssmi 1 indicate the sri and ssmi in one month time scale step 3 by using run theory yevjevich 1969 the drought events were extracted from the time series of drought indices run theory is a threshold based algorithm which defines a drought event as the consistent negative values below the threshold the flowchart of run theory was presented in fig s2 in this study the threshold y0 y1 y2 were set as 0 5 0 3 0 further the drought characteristic including duration and severity were obtained here drought duration means the length of a drought event while drought severity indicates the accumulation of negative drought index value during a drought event more descriptions about the run theory can refer to herbst et al 1966 step 4 match the drought events for meteorological hydrological and meteorological soil moisture drought for example if a hydrological drought event starts during a meteorological drought event we considered the hydrological drought was triggered by the meteorological drought for other situations such as multiple hydrological drought events happened during the period of one or more than one meteorological drought events the consistent drought events were grouped together to better illustrate the drought event matching we defined that there were m meteorological drought events and n hydrological drought events in a matched drought patch m 1 n 1 then a total of four cases were generalize and shown in fig s3 for instance case 1 1 1 represented one meteorological drought event triggered one hydrological drought event while case 4 m n meant m meteorological drought events triggered n hydrological drought events finally the duration severity of the drought patch was the cumulative value of duration severity for all meteorological or hydrological events in the drought patch step 5 model construction and validation in this study the propagation model indicated the statistical relationship of drought characteristics i e drought duration or drought severity between meteorological drought and hydrological or soil moisture drought the construction of propagation models had potential to reveal the hydrological or soil moisture drought characteristics by giving the meteorological drought characteristics which would aid the understanding of drought propagation and evolution chen et al 2020 ye et al 2016 li et al 2021 wu et al 2021 taking meteorological and hydrological drought as examples the input of the model was defined as the drought characteristics of meteorological event while the output was the matched hydrological drought characteristics based on the matched drought events to fit the relationship seven linear and non linear functions were tested table s2 the cross validation was also adopted to select the best models shao 1997 specifically the sample data was divided into two parts 3 1 to construct the models training set and validate the models test set for the validation three goodness of fit indices were introduced including the coefficient of determination average of absolute error and nash sutcliffe coefficient as listed in table 2 finally the model with minimum error was selected as the best fitted model 3 3 cross wavelet transform for exploring time lag and frequency relationships the cross wavelet transform xwt proposed by hudgins et al 1993 is a widely used and effective signal processing method to examine the correlation between two time series peng et al 2018 li et al 2020a it is a combination of wavelet transform and cross spectrum analysis that makes it capable to identify the linkage of two series in both time and frequency domain hudgins and huang 1996 the xwt has powerful capabilities of signal coupling and resolution which is suitable for exploring the distribution and phase relationship between time series in this study the xwt was adopted to reveal the temporal linkage between meteorological drought hydrological and soil moisture drought defining two time series as x n and y n then the cross wavelet transform can be expressed as 1 w xy α τ c x α τ c y α τ where c x α τ is the wavelet transform of x n and c y α τ is the complex conjugation of the wavelet transform of y n w xy α τ denotes the cross wavelet spectrum of two series more detail of xwt can see torrence and compo 1997 3 4 exploration of potential factors influencing drought propagation 3 4 1 sen s slope mann kendall trend test trend analysis was conducted for various meteorological series based on sen s slope and mann kendall trend test sen s slope developed by sen 1968 is a nonparametric trend estimation method sen s slope is widely used due to its high efficiency and insensitivity to the outlier and errors the trend is given as 2 β median x j x i j i j i where x j and x i are the drought values at time j and i if β 0 the time series shows an increasing trend and vice versa besides the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 a nonparametric statistical test method highly recommended by the world meteorological organization was used to detect the significance level of the trend slope the mk z value is calculated as follow 3 z s var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sign x j x i and var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 the null hypothesis no significant trend here is rejected at a 5 significance level when z 1 96 and at a 10 significance level if z 1 645 3 4 2 attribution analysis based on budyko framework to evaluate the different impacts from anthropogenic behavior and climate change on hydrological cycle in yrb after the tgd operation and provide some implications to the drought propagation modification budyko hypothesis was applied in this study to conduct attribution analysis the budyko hypothesis considers that on a relatively long time scale the evapotranspiration of the watershed is a function containing precipitation and runoff which has six commonly used forms and has been widely adopted to estimate the contributions of human activities and climate change in previous studies li et al 2021 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2017b based on it yang et al 2014 derived the water energy balance equation 4 e p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where e p e 0 n is the average of annual actual evapotranspiration annual precipitation annual potential evapotranspiration which is calculated based on penman monteith equation allan et al 1998 and underlying surface characteristic respectively according to the water balance equation r p e the runoff can be expressed as r f p e 0 n by giving the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff n can be calculated based on the following equation 5 r p p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n then the variation of annual runoff can be given as 6 dr f p d p f e 0 d e 0 f n d n by further combining the budyko water energy balance equation the impact of precipitation evapotranspiration and underlying surface characteristic to the runoff can be expressed as yang and yang 2011 7 dr r ε p dp p ε e 0 d e 0 e 0 ε n dn n where ε p dr r dp p ε p dr r dp p ε p dr r dp p are the elasticity of corresponding variables which is the ratio of the change rate of the runoff to the change rate of other variables the negative elasticity of a variable v indicates that the increase of v will lead to the decrease of runoff then the influence of each factor can be quantified as 8 δ r x ε x r x δ x where r is the average of annual runoff x represents the specific factor i e precipitation evapotranspiration underlying surface characteristic while δ x indicates the difference of influence factor between post tgd period and pre tgd period in this study the influence of climate change on annual runoff was defined as the combined effects induced by precipitation and evapotranspiration variations based on the budyko hypothesis zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 besides since 2003 was selected to divide the entire period into pre tgd and post tgd periods we assumed that the human behavior which led to the variation of underlying surface characteristics was mainly dominated by tgd operation li et al 2013 wang et al 2020b yu et al 2018 jehanzaib et al 2020 therefore the contribution of human activities and climate change are then equal to 9 δ r human δ r n δ r n δ r p δ r e 0 δ r c lim a t e 1 δ r human 4 results and discussions 4 1 drought identification of yrb to better describe the response between meteorological hydrological drought and meteorological soil moisture drought the time scales of spi were selected for each watershed based on the correlation coefficients of spi n n 1 48 with sri 1 and ssmi 1 as shown in supplementary fig s4 and table s3 the drought events were then extracted through drought sequences by run theory and fig 3 showed the distribution of drought characteristics in each watershed fig 3 a presented the frequencies of drought events happened in each region during 1981 to 2020 it was found for the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought the average frequencies of meteorological drought for all sub basin were 36 which was slightly higher than that of hydrological drought events 33 in average for meteorological to soil moisture drought the average frequencies of meteorological drought events and soil moisture events were 56 and 49 respectively this result illustrated that the occurrence of meteorological drought was more frequent than hydrological drought and soil moisture drought in most sub basins while soil moisture drought happened more than hydrological drought fig 3 b e presented the distribution of the average drought characteristics in each watershed the duration ranged from 5 to 10 months while the severity was generally from 4 0 to 8 0 units for the hydrological drought and the corresponding meteorological drought events the fluctuation of drought duration was flat but the severity differed from each other specifically ylr had the lowest average drought severity while the average severity in hr was the largest for soil moisture drought and its matched meteorological drought events the average duration and severity were lower than hydrological drought characteristics where the duration ranged from 3 to 6 months while the severity ranged from 2 5 to 4 5 units among them historical drought in hr had the highest duration and severity in average for both hydrological drought and soil moisture drought 4 2 variations of drought characteristics propagation under the construction of tgd 4 2 1 propagation model construction and validation following the method presented in section 3 3 the drought characteristics propagation models of m h were constructed for each sub basin since the overall proportions of mismatched drought events were lower than 10 fig s5 they were not considered in the construction of drought propagation models according to the goodness of fit test table 3 presented the specific propagation models that best described the propagation from meteorological drought characteristics to hydrological drought characteristics table 4 listed the corresponding results of goodness of fit test it can be seen that more than half 55 56 of the propagation models were better performed in linear form indicating that the linear model could well illustrate the characteristics propagation in m h besides by the validation of the selected models the r 2 and n s c of the duration models and severity models were all greater than 0 9 while the ave a e was lower than 0 34 these results further confirmed that the models were capable of characterizing the propagation of m h drought characteristics tables s4 and s5 showed the propagation models of m s drought characteristics generally it was similar to the m h models that most m s propagation models could be better described using linear model according to the cross validation for the selected models the r 2 was all greater than 0 9 while the ave a e was less than 0 21 detailed information about the performance of propagation models could also be found in tables s6 and s7 which presented the statistical metrics for top three best fitted m h and m s propagation models based on the above constructed drought propagation models it was possible and more importantly reliable to predict the duration and severity of the hydrological and soil moisture drought based on prior meteorological drought characteristics for example given the meteorological drought duration and severity as 5 months and 2 5 in yrb it could estimate reliably that the duration and severity of hydrological drought would range from 4 61 5 35 months and 1 86 2 87 units respectively while for soil moisture the duration could be 4 76 5 31 months and 2 26 3 20 units 4 2 2 the effects on characteristics propagation models under changing environment the propagation models before and after 2003 were constructed in all sub basins to explore whether the tgd construction intensified or mitigated the drought characteristics propagation the results of cross validation indicated that the r 2 and n s c of linear model in each sub basin was all higher than 0 8 thus in order to facilitate the comparison of the models in different periods linear model was adopted to describe the drought characteristics propagation in all regions to identify the differences more intuitively between the models in two periods we plotted them in the same graph for each watershed as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that for drought duration the slope was from 0 6866 to 1 012 in the period of 1981 to 2003 blue line while the extent changed to 0 8534 to 1 1645 in 2003 2020 orange lines the slope increased in all sub basins except three upstream sub basins including ylr mr and wr it clearly indicated that the hydrological drought duration was lengthened after the construction tgd when giving the same meteorological drought duration fig s6 presented the m h severity propagation models similarly the range of slopes for severity models increased from 0 6683 1 0399 to 0 956 1 3515 the results demonstrated that after the construction and operation of tgd since 2003 the propagation process of drought duration and severity from meteorological drought to hydrological drought got aggravated in middle reach and downstream of yrb meanwhile we analyzed the variation rates for the slopes of the propagation models in the upper middle and lower region of yrb the slope of m h duration propagation model in the upper reach of yrb decreased by 3 38 in average after the tgd operation while the slopes in middle region and lower region increased by 44 08 and 33 33 respectively in addition the average variation rates for the severity propagation models were 4 1 49 09 and 43 08 in each region results indicated that tgd operation exerted more influences in the middle region of yrb where the slopes for the propagation models experienced more significant increases in duration and severity than the other regions using the same method the m s propagation models before and after tgd construction were constructed and shown in fig 5 and fig s5 for drought duration except for two upstream sub basins the slopes for the remaining sub basins all represented as an increasing trend specifically the slopes in the post period for jlr and hr 0 5976 and 0 6176 respectively were nearly twice as large as that in the previous period 1 0083 and 1 0342 respectively besides from fig s7 the drought severity propagation models showed similar patterns in the variation between two scenarios comparing each region in yrb it can be also concluded that more pronounced increases in duration and severity of m s propagation happened in the middle region through a comparative analysis of the m h and m s models before and after 2003 in general no matter the duration or the severity the slopes had an upward trend in most sub basins after 2003 in other words if there is the same meteorological drought the duration and severity of hydrological drought and soil moisture drought would increase after 2003 and the patterns were more obvious in the midstream of yrb which is close to the location of tgd while upper region did not indicate a pronounced variation of the slopes post studies demonstrated the significant changes of sediment load and runoff due to the construction of tgd the study from jiang et al 2014 concluded that middle and lower yrb suffered more serious hydrological alterations and the effects decreased with the distance increased from tgd which was in agreement with the above statistical results and analysis meanwhile liu et al 2018 and yu et al 2018 also concluded that the downstream of tgd experienced more severe hydrological alterations in a word aforementioned analysis indicated that the impoundment of tgd finally contributed to the aggravation of propagation processes of drought duration and severity specifically given the same meteorological drought characteristics e g 10 months in duration and 10 units in severity the hydrological drought duration and severity increased by 0 76 months and 1 21 units in average for m s propagation the duration and severity increased 1 4 months and 1 3 units respectively 4 3 variations of drought propagation time under the construction of tgd 4 3 1 the linkage of the m h and m s drought propagation the analysis in section 4 1 has demonstrated that there was a close relationship between the drought characteristics of m h and m s to further explore the linkage of m h and m s in different time scales in this section the cross wavelet transform was firstly conducted on the drought series in each sub basin from 1981 to 2020 fig 6 showed the xwt result between spi and sri it can be seen that there was a strong connection between spi and sri in different scales for wr jlr hr yrms and tl the scales with obvious significance were mainly concentrated around 1 32 months and strong positive correlation with the arrows heading to the lower right can be observed in different periods for ylr mr dtl and pyl the obvious correlation existed in both small and large higher than 32 time scales for example during 1992 2007 spi and sri were highly correlated in 105 months scale in ylr with the arrows pointing to the lower right demonstrating the change of sri lagged behind spi in general there was a significant positive phase relationship between spi and sri in yrb the obvious periodicities were 1 32 months in the upper and middle region of yrb while higher periodicities were detected in lower regions fig 7 presented the xwt between spi and ssmi similarly strong correlation was also existed in all sub basins compared to the result of m s the power spectrum of m h was relatively higher the high correlation in the upper and middle region was still around 1 32 months while significant relationship in higher scales was detected in the downstream of yrb the overall variation of ssmi also lagged behind spi the results described the statistically significant correlation between meteorological drought and hydrological soil moisture drought the lag relationship could well explain the meteorological drought was the driving forces of hydrological drought and soil moisture drought in yrb which was the foundation of the following analysis of the propagation time 4 3 2 the effects on drought propagation time under changing environment the previous section illustrated that there was a lag relationship in m h and m s in order to obtain the comprehensive understanding of the effects of tgd construction on drought propagation time in m h and m s the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was conducted between the drought sequences meanwhile the differences of the lag time before and after 2003 were also analyzed fig 8 showed the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought fig 8 a c were the pcc which passed the confidence test of 0 05 between sri 1 and spi in multi scales the maximum pcc in all sub basins were higher than 0 6 fig 8 d f were the bar charts of the propagation time in different periods during 1981 2020 the lag time was around 2 6 months which was high in the middle region of yrb 4 months in average and short in the upper region 3 5 months in average to analyze the influences of tgd operation brought to the propagation time the lags in 1981 2003 and 2003 2020 were calculated in 1981 2003 the propagation time of the yrb was from 2 to 5 months of which the distribution was similar to the period of 1981 2020 but when it came to 2003 2020 the lag time in most sub basins 77 78 had a certain increase the propagation time in yrms represented no changes in the post tgd period which may attribute to its complicated environment covering western middle and eastern china and climate condition mountainous plateau climate in the western part subtropical monsoon climate in the eastern part overall the average increased in the upper middle and lower region were 0 5 months 1 67 months and 2 months respectively the results indicated that since the construction of tgd in 2003 the propagation speed from meteorological to the hydrological drought had been alleviated moreover the propagation time of meteorological drought to the soil moisture drought in different periods was also shown in fig 9 during 1981 2020 the lag time in yrb was generally lower than 2 months and even in each region in 1981 2003 the propagation time was around 1 4 months which is high in the midstream and low in the upstream of yrb however after 2003 the change of the lag time in m s showed the opposite trend of m h propagation the lag time in the midstream decreased by an average of 1 67 months while it was reduced by 1 months in the downstream the result illustrated that the impact of tgd operation accelerated the propagation from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought after 2003 comparatively it was also found that the lag time of the m s propagation was generally shorter than the m h propagation in yrb based on the aforementioned analysis it was apparent that the construction of tgd did have caused alterations in the drought propagation process in yrb on the one hand the soil moisture drought and hydrological drought duration and severity propagation in yrb got aggravated which showed increasing trend in the post period on the other hand however the m h and m s drought propagation time presented different modifications specifically the m h drought propagation speed was slowed down while the m s drought propagation was accelerated in this study the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought and soil moisture drought were separated and the anthropogenic activities e g afforestation irrigation may post different impacts in these processes for instance shah et al 2021 investigated the influences of human activities on hydrological drought and agriculture drought in india and found contrasting effects and distinct results were also given in the variations of m h extended and m s shortened propagation time in wei river in china which may attribute to the changes of underlying surface characteristics and vegetation covers huang et al 2015 huang et al 2017 during the tgd initial operation period the hydrological circle and water resources in yrb suffered substantial changes drought propagation modification at this time was dominated by the intensified anthropogenic activities such as dam construction which greatly influenced the underlying surface characteristics and soil is the most directly affected variable in this case it is also worth mentioning that soil and water conservation practices have been carried out to solve the problem of soil loss dam construction is a significant and efficient method along with afforestation the increased evapotranspiration from plants may then be a potential factor influencing the m s propagation as time went by the changing environment in yrb tended to be relatively stable which may be the reason for the slowing propagation speed of the m h propagation besides previous research also pointed out that reservoir regulation could extend the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought due to different operations e g increasing water availability during dry seasons and inherent characteristics such as the water storage capacity lópez moreno et al 2013 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 guo et al 2021 investigated the influences of mega reservoir on the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought they also demonstrated that the reservoir operation delayed the m h propagation and the effects attenuated with the increase of the distance to the reservoir which coincided with the results in this study to further support the assumption the potential influence factors were analyzed in the next section and an in depth model based exploration was also required to provide more physical explanations in the future study 4 4 potential factors influencing drought propagation and attribution analysis 4 4 1 trend analysis for the potential influencing factors the above results had illustrated that the changes of drought propagation process had strong relationship with the construction of tgd understanding potential factors influencing the modification of drought propagation under tgd operation is also crucial for revealing the internal mechanism of drought development in this study six drought related variables were considered including precipitation runoff soil moisture potential evapotranspiration pet average air temperature tavg and relative humidity rhu the calculation of pet was based on the penman monteith method we firstly calculated the variations of these six factors before and after 2003 for each sub basin as shown in fig 10 for each variable all sub basins represented as similar change patterns precipitation runoff and soil moisture all decreased after the construction of tgd especially for the midstream and downstream of yrb wang et al 2020b found that tgd accounted for about 50 of the runoff reduction in yrb and gao et al 2021 concluded that the attenuation of the flow process changes in the water surface slope and bedload coarsening induced by tgd impoundment led to the decrease in dominant discharge in yrb which consequently exacerbated the hydrological drought at the downstream sub basins li et al 2013 shah et al 2021 guo et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 besides with the rising of temperature the potential evapotranspiration also indicated as an upward trend the increasing temperature and pet and the decreasing runoff humidity and precipitation then reduce the water amount in the surface soil which became one potential factor that led to the aggravation of soil moisture drought propagation we also performed sen s slope method and mk trend test on the time series for these factors at four periods which were 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 fig 11 the trend with significance level over 90 was considered as obvious although total precipitation decreased after 2003 the trends were not apparent except for the period of 2000 2010 at middle and lower region of yrb for runoff significant downward trends were observed for most sub basins at the tgd initial operation period this result was consistent with the analysis above but during 2011 to 2020 the decreasing trend was no longer significant while some sub basins yrl mr tl and dtl got upward trend for runoff xu et al 2020 investigated the runoff response to the global warming of 1 5 and 2 scenarios in yrb and both cases demonstrated that the runoff in yrb would increase as the average temperature represented as increasing trend in most sub basins it was feasible to infer that at the tgd initial operation period the rapid modifications of the hydrological regimes and eco system caused the reduction of runoff directly but with the changing environment caused by anthropogenic activities tended to be stable in the last period climate change such as global warming gradually exerted more impacts relating to drought propagation the overall decrease runoff after 2003 aggravated the hydrological drought duration and severity since the drought event identification was directly linked to the variations of runoff propagation time as a variable describing propagation process may be affected by many factors e g aforementioned increasing trend of runoff during the last period the combined effects of these factors finally led to the increase of propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 4 4 2 attribution analysis for drought propagation modification in yrb in order to provide implications about to what extent the anthropogenic activity i e tgd operation and climate change contributed to the variations of drought propagation we conducted attribution analysis from the aspect of runoff modification based on the budyko hypothesis firstly the elasticities of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface characteristics were calculated table 5 which reflected the sensitivity of the runoff variation to each factor it can be observed that the runoff modification was relatively more sensitive to the precipitation and underlying surface characteristics rather than potential evapotranspiration specifically the elasticity of precipitation ranged from 1 55 to 2 17 while the elasticity of underlying surface characteristics was around 2 18 0 85 which was high in the middle and lower region of yrb the results indicated that changes of underlying surface characteristics exerted negative effects on the amount of runoff which further influenced drought propagation then the contributions of human activities and climate change were obtained following the equations listed in section 3 4 2 and shown in fig 12 generally tgd operation dominated the modification of runoff at a total of seven sub basins in yrb except ylr and mr the contributions of human behaviors mainly from tgd construction were 47 76 66 54 and 55 69 for the upper middle and lower regions of yrb respectively it should be noted that the contribution of human activities here represented negative impact on runoff variations i e decrease runoff since the elasticities of underlying surface characteristics were negative according to table 5 significant effects of anthropogenic behavior were observed at the middle reach of yrb which was close to the location of tgd considering the entire yrb the contribution of human activities and climate change were 56 75 and 43 25 the result illustrated that after 2003 due to the impact of human activities especially the tgd construction the natural water cycle had changed and the influences were greater than that of climate change in a word the analysis of potential factors and attribution of human activities and climate change provided a proof of concept that tgd construction did modify the hydrological patterns and further influence drought propagation in yrb but not the complete physics mechanism in future work a more comprehensive physical model based analysis would be considered to investigate the underlying mechanism of tgd effects on drought propagation 5 conclusions in order to explore the construction of tgd in modifying drought propagation process this study took yrb as the study area and firstly constructed the drought characteristics propagation models for m h and m s propagation then the variations of drought characteristics propagation process as well as the drought propagation time were identified before and after tgd operation meanwhile potential influence factors leading to the changes of drought propagation were also investigated the main conclusions were listed below 1 from 1981 to 2020 the frequency of meteorological drought was relatively the highest in yrb while hydrological drought occurred the least for meteorological and hydrological drought events the average duration and severity were 5 10 months and 4 0 8 0 units respectively but for soil moisture drought the values were generally lower 2 there were significant connections between the drought characteristics of m h and m s and linear model had good performance on describing the propagation process comparing the propagation models before and after 2003 it was found that the construction of tgd exacerbated the hydrological drought and soil moisture drought characteristics triggered by meteorological drought specifically given the meteorological drought duration and severity at 10 months and 10 units respectively the hydrological drought duration and severity were reduced by 0 76 months and 1 21 in average for m s propagation the duration and severity decreased 1 4 months and 1 3 respectively on one hand the modifications of the propagation models could reveal the changes of drought evolution under tgd construction and provide evidence for drought related policy formulation on the other hand the propagation models could also contribute to the prediction of hydrological drought and soil moisture drought duration and severity based on the meteorological drought characteristics 3 strong positive correlation was detected between drought propagation for m h and m s and the changes of hydrological and soil moisture drought series all lagged behind meteorological drought by calculating the propagation time variations between two scenarios due to the tgd operation the m h propagation time had an upward trend increased 1 3 months in average while the trend for m s lag time was opposite decreased 0 89 months in average in other words the propagation speed from meteorological drought to hydrological drought had been slowed down while soil moisture drought propagation speed was accelerated to this point more attention should be paid to understand the deep mechanism of soil moisture propagation process and provide scientific suggestions to its improvement 4 the influences of six potential factors brought to drought propagation modification were explored post periods of the tgd construction witnessed the decrease of runoff precipitation soil moisture and relative humidity with the rising of temperature and potential evapotranspiration combined with the trend analysis for four separate periods from 1981 to 2020 the evidences for the aggravation of propagated hydrological drought and soil moisture drought characteristics duration and severity as well as the different changes of propagation time were provided meanwhile the results of attribution analysis also indicated that tgd operation accounted for 56 75 of the total variations of annual runoff in yrb which provided insight into the tgd effects on drought propagation while the contribution was more pronounced 66 54 in the midstream results of this study are expected to reveal the drought propagation modification caused by the construction of tgd in yrb and be beneficial to the drought early warning system although this research gave some proofs for the potential reasons of drought propagation variation based on statistical methods the complicated interaction of multiple drought variables and the contrasting results of m h and m s propagation time variations cannot be directly analyzed due to the lack of sophisticated physics model in yrb at present thus if the physics driven model can be available in the future the combination of physical and statistical models can be a more powerful tool for understanding drought propagation features declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

3990,the construction of three gorges dam tgd has exerted substantial effects on local hydrological regime and eco system since its operation in 2003 due to this significant anthropogenic activity drought propagation processes from meteorological drought to hydrological m h and soil moisture m s drought are inevitably modified however current studies are still insufficient to answer whether the tgd operation mitigated or exacerbated the drought propagation process due to its complex impacts to explore this key issue this study proposed an integrated framework to quantify the impact of tgd construction on drought propagation process in the yangtze river basin yrb the drought characteristics propagation models and propagation time were calculated to identify the modification of drought propagation process between different tgd operation scenarios trend and attribution analyses were also utilized to explore potential influence factors results demonstrated that tgd construction did significantly aggravate the drought characteristics propagation specifically the slopes of hydrological drought duration and severity in linear propagation models increased 23 98 and 29 23 in average while for m s propagation the slopes of duration and severity models increased 28 72 and 21 91 respectively this research also found that after tgd operation the m h propagation speed had been slowed down but the m s lag time became shorter additionally the variations and trend patterns of six potential influence factors at four separate periods were full analyzed to provide implications for the drought propagation modifications and tgd operation was confirmed to become a major factor inducing the variations of annual runoff which accounted for 56 75 for the entire yrb the above quantitative findings are expected to reveal the potential changes of drought propagation process caused by the construction of tgd in yrb the proposed integrated framework is also beneficial to the drought early warning system and understanding of drought development not only in yrb but also in other basins at the global scale keywords drought propagation model construction three gorges dam yangtze river basin 1 introduction drought is a complex and multifaceted disaster affecting agriculture water resources economy and even human s lives wilhite 2000 dai 2011 sheffield and wood 2012 zhang et al 2019 besides the great progresses achieved in drought monitoring and prediction researches van loon et al 2016 xu et al 2018 deng et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 there are still many challenges needed to be solved drought propagation as the conceptualization of drought emergence evolution and development has been one of these critical challenges and attracted much attention in recent years eltahir and yeh 1999 van loon 2015 there is no doubt that climate change affects drought propagation van loon et al 2016 mishra and singh 2010 while in this human influenced era the intensification of anthropogenic activities e g carbon dioxide emission deforestation urbanization dam construction have also become the main driving forces of the changes of drought evolution lópez moreno et al 2009 mo 2011 zhang et al 2015 gu et al 2019a b as the largest concrete gravity dam in the world the three gorges dam tgd was constructed and commissioned since 2003 tgd is of great significance for various water and hydropower supplies in central and eastern china however a number of researches have pointed out that its operation has also affected and posed great challenges to hydrological circle and eco system of the entire yangtze river basin wang et al 2020b zhao et al 2017 peng et al 2020 li et al 2013 investigated that the initial operation of tgd slightly aggravated the hydrological drought at one downstream hydrological station in yangtze river basin yrb during 2003 to 2011 yu et al 2018 concluded that significant abrupt changes of hydrological drought were identified and highly correlated the impoundment stages of tgd thus the drought propagation process is also believed to be affected aghakouchak et al 2015 aghakouchak 2016 apurv and cai 2020 however it is still unknown whether the construction of tgd after 2003 had exacerbated the drought propagation process or mitigated it especially for this particular region in other words the key scientific question is that did the soil moisture drought or hydrological drought triggered by meteorological drought evolve faster and stronger or slower and weaker due to the tgd operation to date topics regarding the effects of dam construction on drought have focused on single types of droughts huang et al 2015 huang et al 2017 for example wu et al 2018 found the reservoir regulation reduced hydrological drought duration and severity in dongjiang river basin china most drought propagation related studies began around 21st century when scientists focused on the correlation and propagation time between the sub types of droughts li et al 2020b wang et al 2020a van loon and laaha 2015 leng et al 2015 for example zhou et al 2021 investigated the hydrological drought propagation time based on pearson correlation coefficient in pearl river basin and concluded that large scale climate patterns were important influence factor xu et al 2019 studied the human impact to the propagation of meteorological and hydrological drought in the northern china and initially revealed the reservoir construction and urbanization shortened the propagation time while agricultural activities increased it although some researchers have investigated the quantification of drought propagation and its driven factors at some certain regions there are still some critical issues that have not been fully solved on one hand most previous studies targeted on the propagation time but ignored other important drought characteristics e g duration severity which could provide more insights in the propagation of other sub types of droughts based on the meteorological drought characteristics li et al 2016 wu et al 2017a chen et al 2020 on the other hand variable infiltration capacity vic and soil and water assessment tool swat have been usually adopted in some studies to attribute the human and climate influences in modifying drought propagation however such hydrological models usually require large amount of good quality data while the parameterizations and the structure of the models are difficult to be optimized in this case statistical models are superiors in its simple forms and powerful capabilities of capturing features from data along with fast and easy calculation procedure which have been widely applied in drought related studies edossa et al 2009 ye et al 2016 chen et al 2020 as aforementioned current studies are insufficient to fully reveal the drought propagation characteristics including the propagation modification caused by human activities like tgd operation therefore it is vital to construct a scientific framework to quantify the effects of tgd construction on drought propagation process in yangtze river basin yrb to this point the main objectives of this study are to answer the following key questions 1 did the drought characteristics of soil moisture and hydrological drought triggered by meteorological drought show variations under the tgd operation 2 how did the response time of m h meteorological drought to hydrological drought and m s meteorological drought to soil moisture drought change before and after the construction of tgd 3 what were potential factors leading to the modification of drought propagation in yrb and to what extent tgd operation and other factors e g climate change contributed to this modification building off the investigation of these questions this study will form a comprehensive understanding of the impact of tgd construction on drought propagation in yrb and provide valuable input for drought precaution and early warning system in the near future 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yrb is the third largest river basin in the world contributing significantly to the economy and climate in china and even the world the entire watershed covers an area of 1 8 million km2 accounting for nearly 18 8 of the whole country and accommodates 33 of china s total population with the higher altitude in the west and lower in the east the yrb shows a three step ladder distribution therefore the climate hydrology characteristic and land cover vary greatly in different sub regions although the water resources in yrb is relatively rich the distribution is quite uneven with a range of annual precipitation from 500 mm in the west to 2500 mm to the east mainly concentrated in summer in recent decades the intensified human activities and climate change accelerate the variation of drought characteristic and water cycle in yrb lu et al 2014 it was found that the frequency of drought showed an upward trend in the middle region of yrb from 1965 to 2005 zhai et al 2010 and lu et al 2016 predicted that the duration and frequency of drought would increase during 2021 2050 compared to 1971 2000 in the upper reach of yrb since the operation of tgd in 2003 the hydrological patterns and ecosystem of yrb have been alerted significantly to this point a comprehensive analysis on the modification of drought propagation process between different types of droughts is of great importance in understanding the drought development in yrb to analysis the spatial heterogeneity within this large basin total 9 sub basin table 1 in yrb were identified according to their topography hydrological characteristics and ground cover as shown in fig 1 2 2 data in this study monthly surface runoff and soil moisture were adopted to calculate drought indices and monitor hydrological and soil moisture drought although station based observations can be relatively more accurate at point scale the uneven distribution and density of the network may still be insufficient to fully describe the spatial distribution of runoff and soil moisture in yrb ma et al 2021 xu et al 2021 zhang and chen 2016 to this point grid based reanalysis data was considered as a supplement for in situ measurements to conduct drought analysis shi et al 2020 harrigan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 in this study monthly total runoff surface soil moisture and precipitation were obtained from era5 land reanalysis data provided by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 land combines model data with in situ observations from across the world using the 4d var data assimilation technique and improves from the originally era interim hersbach et al 2020 the data has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and ranges from 1981 to 2020 compared to era5 which applies tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land tessel model the era5 land adopts hydrology tessel htessel model to simulate land surface variables htessel uses the formulation of soil hydrologic conductivity and diffusivity and improves the surface runoff generation according to a variable infiltration capacity based on soil type and local topography alfieri et al 2020 ecmwf 2016 the era5 land runoff has been validated against long term in situ observations and the results indicate high consistence muñoz sabater et al 2021 tan et al 2020 fan et al 2021 besides era5 land runoff has also been used to conduct drought propagation researches by previous studies zhou et al 2021 to evaluate the runoff data in era5 land we compared the runoff data which was from global flood awareness system glofas that provides the global hydrologic reanalysis data based on the era5 land datasets with in situ observations at three hydrological stations i e huatan pingshan shigu fan et al 2021 results are shown in fig s1 it can be seen that era5 based runoff data represented high correlation coefficients nearly 0 9 with in situ runoff therefore era5 land runoff could provide reasonable confidence to calculate drought index in addition other meteorological data including sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity were obtained from 184 weather stations surrounding yrb provided by china meteorological data service center cmdc 3 methods fig 2 presented the proposed method to explore the drought propagation in yrb in this study first standardized precipitation index spi standardized runoff index sri and standardized soil moisture index ssmi were adopted to represent meteorological hydrological and soil moisture droughts respectively then the drought characteristics propagation models were constructed and validated based on the drought events identified by run theory to further analyze the linkage between m h and m s propagation the cross wavelet transform was performed on the drought indices series and based on that the pearson correlation coefficient was used to calculate the propagation time additionally sen s slope and mann kendall trend test were utilized to explore the potential influence factors leading to the modification of drought propagation process in yrb while attribution analysis based on budyko hypothesis was conducted to determine the role of tgd operation in modifying drought propagation the proposed framework fully excavated the propagation features such as drought characteristics and propagation speed and revealed the potential influence factors by tgd operation based on the statistical methods which made it possible to be transferred to other similar basins at global scale 3 1 standardized drought indices to quantify meteorological drought hydrological and soil moisture drought the drought indices including spi sri and ssmi were taken respectively mckee et al 1993 shukla and wood 2008 hao and aghakouchak 2013 all these indices follow the same steps in computation which make the analysis and comparison possible taking spi as an example the first step is to fit a proper probability function for the precipitation series here precipitation runoff and soil moisture were fitted with gamma pearson iii and weibull distribution which had been validated by the previous studies mckee et al 1993 shukla et al 2011 and then spi is calculated through converting the cumulative probability to standard normal deviation since spi can be calculated in different time scales it is usually adopted to represent different drought patterns e g short term and long term in this study 1 month sri and ssmi were calculated while time scales of spi ranged from 1 to 24 months in order to better describe the response between m h and m s propagation more detail about the calculation can refer to mckee et al 1993 the drought level classification of these indices was listed in table s1 3 2 construction of drought characteristics propagation models since the drought characteristic duration and severity usually contains much information related to drought development a propagation model considering the relationship between drought characteristic of meteorological hydrological and soil moisture drought is crucial for the comprehensive understanding of drought propagation this hidden information has long been ignored by most studies the specific process to build drought propagation model follows the steps below step 1 based on the precipitation runoff and soil moisture data the drought indices including spi sri ssmi were calculated respectively step 2 in order to better describe the response relationship between meteorological hydrological and soil moisture drought the pearson correlation coefficient was adopted to select the spi time scales which had the highest correlation coefficients with sri 1 and ssmi 1 separately here sri 1 and ssmi 1 indicate the sri and ssmi in one month time scale step 3 by using run theory yevjevich 1969 the drought events were extracted from the time series of drought indices run theory is a threshold based algorithm which defines a drought event as the consistent negative values below the threshold the flowchart of run theory was presented in fig s2 in this study the threshold y0 y1 y2 were set as 0 5 0 3 0 further the drought characteristic including duration and severity were obtained here drought duration means the length of a drought event while drought severity indicates the accumulation of negative drought index value during a drought event more descriptions about the run theory can refer to herbst et al 1966 step 4 match the drought events for meteorological hydrological and meteorological soil moisture drought for example if a hydrological drought event starts during a meteorological drought event we considered the hydrological drought was triggered by the meteorological drought for other situations such as multiple hydrological drought events happened during the period of one or more than one meteorological drought events the consistent drought events were grouped together to better illustrate the drought event matching we defined that there were m meteorological drought events and n hydrological drought events in a matched drought patch m 1 n 1 then a total of four cases were generalize and shown in fig s3 for instance case 1 1 1 represented one meteorological drought event triggered one hydrological drought event while case 4 m n meant m meteorological drought events triggered n hydrological drought events finally the duration severity of the drought patch was the cumulative value of duration severity for all meteorological or hydrological events in the drought patch step 5 model construction and validation in this study the propagation model indicated the statistical relationship of drought characteristics i e drought duration or drought severity between meteorological drought and hydrological or soil moisture drought the construction of propagation models had potential to reveal the hydrological or soil moisture drought characteristics by giving the meteorological drought characteristics which would aid the understanding of drought propagation and evolution chen et al 2020 ye et al 2016 li et al 2021 wu et al 2021 taking meteorological and hydrological drought as examples the input of the model was defined as the drought characteristics of meteorological event while the output was the matched hydrological drought characteristics based on the matched drought events to fit the relationship seven linear and non linear functions were tested table s2 the cross validation was also adopted to select the best models shao 1997 specifically the sample data was divided into two parts 3 1 to construct the models training set and validate the models test set for the validation three goodness of fit indices were introduced including the coefficient of determination average of absolute error and nash sutcliffe coefficient as listed in table 2 finally the model with minimum error was selected as the best fitted model 3 3 cross wavelet transform for exploring time lag and frequency relationships the cross wavelet transform xwt proposed by hudgins et al 1993 is a widely used and effective signal processing method to examine the correlation between two time series peng et al 2018 li et al 2020a it is a combination of wavelet transform and cross spectrum analysis that makes it capable to identify the linkage of two series in both time and frequency domain hudgins and huang 1996 the xwt has powerful capabilities of signal coupling and resolution which is suitable for exploring the distribution and phase relationship between time series in this study the xwt was adopted to reveal the temporal linkage between meteorological drought hydrological and soil moisture drought defining two time series as x n and y n then the cross wavelet transform can be expressed as 1 w xy α τ c x α τ c y α τ where c x α τ is the wavelet transform of x n and c y α τ is the complex conjugation of the wavelet transform of y n w xy α τ denotes the cross wavelet spectrum of two series more detail of xwt can see torrence and compo 1997 3 4 exploration of potential factors influencing drought propagation 3 4 1 sen s slope mann kendall trend test trend analysis was conducted for various meteorological series based on sen s slope and mann kendall trend test sen s slope developed by sen 1968 is a nonparametric trend estimation method sen s slope is widely used due to its high efficiency and insensitivity to the outlier and errors the trend is given as 2 β median x j x i j i j i where x j and x i are the drought values at time j and i if β 0 the time series shows an increasing trend and vice versa besides the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 a nonparametric statistical test method highly recommended by the world meteorological organization was used to detect the significance level of the trend slope the mk z value is calculated as follow 3 z s var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sign x j x i and var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 the null hypothesis no significant trend here is rejected at a 5 significance level when z 1 96 and at a 10 significance level if z 1 645 3 4 2 attribution analysis based on budyko framework to evaluate the different impacts from anthropogenic behavior and climate change on hydrological cycle in yrb after the tgd operation and provide some implications to the drought propagation modification budyko hypothesis was applied in this study to conduct attribution analysis the budyko hypothesis considers that on a relatively long time scale the evapotranspiration of the watershed is a function containing precipitation and runoff which has six commonly used forms and has been widely adopted to estimate the contributions of human activities and climate change in previous studies li et al 2021 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2017b based on it yang et al 2014 derived the water energy balance equation 4 e p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where e p e 0 n is the average of annual actual evapotranspiration annual precipitation annual potential evapotranspiration which is calculated based on penman monteith equation allan et al 1998 and underlying surface characteristic respectively according to the water balance equation r p e the runoff can be expressed as r f p e 0 n by giving the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff n can be calculated based on the following equation 5 r p p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n then the variation of annual runoff can be given as 6 dr f p d p f e 0 d e 0 f n d n by further combining the budyko water energy balance equation the impact of precipitation evapotranspiration and underlying surface characteristic to the runoff can be expressed as yang and yang 2011 7 dr r ε p dp p ε e 0 d e 0 e 0 ε n dn n where ε p dr r dp p ε p dr r dp p ε p dr r dp p are the elasticity of corresponding variables which is the ratio of the change rate of the runoff to the change rate of other variables the negative elasticity of a variable v indicates that the increase of v will lead to the decrease of runoff then the influence of each factor can be quantified as 8 δ r x ε x r x δ x where r is the average of annual runoff x represents the specific factor i e precipitation evapotranspiration underlying surface characteristic while δ x indicates the difference of influence factor between post tgd period and pre tgd period in this study the influence of climate change on annual runoff was defined as the combined effects induced by precipitation and evapotranspiration variations based on the budyko hypothesis zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 besides since 2003 was selected to divide the entire period into pre tgd and post tgd periods we assumed that the human behavior which led to the variation of underlying surface characteristics was mainly dominated by tgd operation li et al 2013 wang et al 2020b yu et al 2018 jehanzaib et al 2020 therefore the contribution of human activities and climate change are then equal to 9 δ r human δ r n δ r n δ r p δ r e 0 δ r c lim a t e 1 δ r human 4 results and discussions 4 1 drought identification of yrb to better describe the response between meteorological hydrological drought and meteorological soil moisture drought the time scales of spi were selected for each watershed based on the correlation coefficients of spi n n 1 48 with sri 1 and ssmi 1 as shown in supplementary fig s4 and table s3 the drought events were then extracted through drought sequences by run theory and fig 3 showed the distribution of drought characteristics in each watershed fig 3 a presented the frequencies of drought events happened in each region during 1981 to 2020 it was found for the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought the average frequencies of meteorological drought for all sub basin were 36 which was slightly higher than that of hydrological drought events 33 in average for meteorological to soil moisture drought the average frequencies of meteorological drought events and soil moisture events were 56 and 49 respectively this result illustrated that the occurrence of meteorological drought was more frequent than hydrological drought and soil moisture drought in most sub basins while soil moisture drought happened more than hydrological drought fig 3 b e presented the distribution of the average drought characteristics in each watershed the duration ranged from 5 to 10 months while the severity was generally from 4 0 to 8 0 units for the hydrological drought and the corresponding meteorological drought events the fluctuation of drought duration was flat but the severity differed from each other specifically ylr had the lowest average drought severity while the average severity in hr was the largest for soil moisture drought and its matched meteorological drought events the average duration and severity were lower than hydrological drought characteristics where the duration ranged from 3 to 6 months while the severity ranged from 2 5 to 4 5 units among them historical drought in hr had the highest duration and severity in average for both hydrological drought and soil moisture drought 4 2 variations of drought characteristics propagation under the construction of tgd 4 2 1 propagation model construction and validation following the method presented in section 3 3 the drought characteristics propagation models of m h were constructed for each sub basin since the overall proportions of mismatched drought events were lower than 10 fig s5 they were not considered in the construction of drought propagation models according to the goodness of fit test table 3 presented the specific propagation models that best described the propagation from meteorological drought characteristics to hydrological drought characteristics table 4 listed the corresponding results of goodness of fit test it can be seen that more than half 55 56 of the propagation models were better performed in linear form indicating that the linear model could well illustrate the characteristics propagation in m h besides by the validation of the selected models the r 2 and n s c of the duration models and severity models were all greater than 0 9 while the ave a e was lower than 0 34 these results further confirmed that the models were capable of characterizing the propagation of m h drought characteristics tables s4 and s5 showed the propagation models of m s drought characteristics generally it was similar to the m h models that most m s propagation models could be better described using linear model according to the cross validation for the selected models the r 2 was all greater than 0 9 while the ave a e was less than 0 21 detailed information about the performance of propagation models could also be found in tables s6 and s7 which presented the statistical metrics for top three best fitted m h and m s propagation models based on the above constructed drought propagation models it was possible and more importantly reliable to predict the duration and severity of the hydrological and soil moisture drought based on prior meteorological drought characteristics for example given the meteorological drought duration and severity as 5 months and 2 5 in yrb it could estimate reliably that the duration and severity of hydrological drought would range from 4 61 5 35 months and 1 86 2 87 units respectively while for soil moisture the duration could be 4 76 5 31 months and 2 26 3 20 units 4 2 2 the effects on characteristics propagation models under changing environment the propagation models before and after 2003 were constructed in all sub basins to explore whether the tgd construction intensified or mitigated the drought characteristics propagation the results of cross validation indicated that the r 2 and n s c of linear model in each sub basin was all higher than 0 8 thus in order to facilitate the comparison of the models in different periods linear model was adopted to describe the drought characteristics propagation in all regions to identify the differences more intuitively between the models in two periods we plotted them in the same graph for each watershed as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that for drought duration the slope was from 0 6866 to 1 012 in the period of 1981 to 2003 blue line while the extent changed to 0 8534 to 1 1645 in 2003 2020 orange lines the slope increased in all sub basins except three upstream sub basins including ylr mr and wr it clearly indicated that the hydrological drought duration was lengthened after the construction tgd when giving the same meteorological drought duration fig s6 presented the m h severity propagation models similarly the range of slopes for severity models increased from 0 6683 1 0399 to 0 956 1 3515 the results demonstrated that after the construction and operation of tgd since 2003 the propagation process of drought duration and severity from meteorological drought to hydrological drought got aggravated in middle reach and downstream of yrb meanwhile we analyzed the variation rates for the slopes of the propagation models in the upper middle and lower region of yrb the slope of m h duration propagation model in the upper reach of yrb decreased by 3 38 in average after the tgd operation while the slopes in middle region and lower region increased by 44 08 and 33 33 respectively in addition the average variation rates for the severity propagation models were 4 1 49 09 and 43 08 in each region results indicated that tgd operation exerted more influences in the middle region of yrb where the slopes for the propagation models experienced more significant increases in duration and severity than the other regions using the same method the m s propagation models before and after tgd construction were constructed and shown in fig 5 and fig s5 for drought duration except for two upstream sub basins the slopes for the remaining sub basins all represented as an increasing trend specifically the slopes in the post period for jlr and hr 0 5976 and 0 6176 respectively were nearly twice as large as that in the previous period 1 0083 and 1 0342 respectively besides from fig s7 the drought severity propagation models showed similar patterns in the variation between two scenarios comparing each region in yrb it can be also concluded that more pronounced increases in duration and severity of m s propagation happened in the middle region through a comparative analysis of the m h and m s models before and after 2003 in general no matter the duration or the severity the slopes had an upward trend in most sub basins after 2003 in other words if there is the same meteorological drought the duration and severity of hydrological drought and soil moisture drought would increase after 2003 and the patterns were more obvious in the midstream of yrb which is close to the location of tgd while upper region did not indicate a pronounced variation of the slopes post studies demonstrated the significant changes of sediment load and runoff due to the construction of tgd the study from jiang et al 2014 concluded that middle and lower yrb suffered more serious hydrological alterations and the effects decreased with the distance increased from tgd which was in agreement with the above statistical results and analysis meanwhile liu et al 2018 and yu et al 2018 also concluded that the downstream of tgd experienced more severe hydrological alterations in a word aforementioned analysis indicated that the impoundment of tgd finally contributed to the aggravation of propagation processes of drought duration and severity specifically given the same meteorological drought characteristics e g 10 months in duration and 10 units in severity the hydrological drought duration and severity increased by 0 76 months and 1 21 units in average for m s propagation the duration and severity increased 1 4 months and 1 3 units respectively 4 3 variations of drought propagation time under the construction of tgd 4 3 1 the linkage of the m h and m s drought propagation the analysis in section 4 1 has demonstrated that there was a close relationship between the drought characteristics of m h and m s to further explore the linkage of m h and m s in different time scales in this section the cross wavelet transform was firstly conducted on the drought series in each sub basin from 1981 to 2020 fig 6 showed the xwt result between spi and sri it can be seen that there was a strong connection between spi and sri in different scales for wr jlr hr yrms and tl the scales with obvious significance were mainly concentrated around 1 32 months and strong positive correlation with the arrows heading to the lower right can be observed in different periods for ylr mr dtl and pyl the obvious correlation existed in both small and large higher than 32 time scales for example during 1992 2007 spi and sri were highly correlated in 105 months scale in ylr with the arrows pointing to the lower right demonstrating the change of sri lagged behind spi in general there was a significant positive phase relationship between spi and sri in yrb the obvious periodicities were 1 32 months in the upper and middle region of yrb while higher periodicities were detected in lower regions fig 7 presented the xwt between spi and ssmi similarly strong correlation was also existed in all sub basins compared to the result of m s the power spectrum of m h was relatively higher the high correlation in the upper and middle region was still around 1 32 months while significant relationship in higher scales was detected in the downstream of yrb the overall variation of ssmi also lagged behind spi the results described the statistically significant correlation between meteorological drought and hydrological soil moisture drought the lag relationship could well explain the meteorological drought was the driving forces of hydrological drought and soil moisture drought in yrb which was the foundation of the following analysis of the propagation time 4 3 2 the effects on drought propagation time under changing environment the previous section illustrated that there was a lag relationship in m h and m s in order to obtain the comprehensive understanding of the effects of tgd construction on drought propagation time in m h and m s the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was conducted between the drought sequences meanwhile the differences of the lag time before and after 2003 were also analyzed fig 8 showed the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought fig 8 a c were the pcc which passed the confidence test of 0 05 between sri 1 and spi in multi scales the maximum pcc in all sub basins were higher than 0 6 fig 8 d f were the bar charts of the propagation time in different periods during 1981 2020 the lag time was around 2 6 months which was high in the middle region of yrb 4 months in average and short in the upper region 3 5 months in average to analyze the influences of tgd operation brought to the propagation time the lags in 1981 2003 and 2003 2020 were calculated in 1981 2003 the propagation time of the yrb was from 2 to 5 months of which the distribution was similar to the period of 1981 2020 but when it came to 2003 2020 the lag time in most sub basins 77 78 had a certain increase the propagation time in yrms represented no changes in the post tgd period which may attribute to its complicated environment covering western middle and eastern china and climate condition mountainous plateau climate in the western part subtropical monsoon climate in the eastern part overall the average increased in the upper middle and lower region were 0 5 months 1 67 months and 2 months respectively the results indicated that since the construction of tgd in 2003 the propagation speed from meteorological to the hydrological drought had been alleviated moreover the propagation time of meteorological drought to the soil moisture drought in different periods was also shown in fig 9 during 1981 2020 the lag time in yrb was generally lower than 2 months and even in each region in 1981 2003 the propagation time was around 1 4 months which is high in the midstream and low in the upstream of yrb however after 2003 the change of the lag time in m s showed the opposite trend of m h propagation the lag time in the midstream decreased by an average of 1 67 months while it was reduced by 1 months in the downstream the result illustrated that the impact of tgd operation accelerated the propagation from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought after 2003 comparatively it was also found that the lag time of the m s propagation was generally shorter than the m h propagation in yrb based on the aforementioned analysis it was apparent that the construction of tgd did have caused alterations in the drought propagation process in yrb on the one hand the soil moisture drought and hydrological drought duration and severity propagation in yrb got aggravated which showed increasing trend in the post period on the other hand however the m h and m s drought propagation time presented different modifications specifically the m h drought propagation speed was slowed down while the m s drought propagation was accelerated in this study the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought and soil moisture drought were separated and the anthropogenic activities e g afforestation irrigation may post different impacts in these processes for instance shah et al 2021 investigated the influences of human activities on hydrological drought and agriculture drought in india and found contrasting effects and distinct results were also given in the variations of m h extended and m s shortened propagation time in wei river in china which may attribute to the changes of underlying surface characteristics and vegetation covers huang et al 2015 huang et al 2017 during the tgd initial operation period the hydrological circle and water resources in yrb suffered substantial changes drought propagation modification at this time was dominated by the intensified anthropogenic activities such as dam construction which greatly influenced the underlying surface characteristics and soil is the most directly affected variable in this case it is also worth mentioning that soil and water conservation practices have been carried out to solve the problem of soil loss dam construction is a significant and efficient method along with afforestation the increased evapotranspiration from plants may then be a potential factor influencing the m s propagation as time went by the changing environment in yrb tended to be relatively stable which may be the reason for the slowing propagation speed of the m h propagation besides previous research also pointed out that reservoir regulation could extend the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought due to different operations e g increasing water availability during dry seasons and inherent characteristics such as the water storage capacity lópez moreno et al 2013 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 guo et al 2021 investigated the influences of mega reservoir on the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought they also demonstrated that the reservoir operation delayed the m h propagation and the effects attenuated with the increase of the distance to the reservoir which coincided with the results in this study to further support the assumption the potential influence factors were analyzed in the next section and an in depth model based exploration was also required to provide more physical explanations in the future study 4 4 potential factors influencing drought propagation and attribution analysis 4 4 1 trend analysis for the potential influencing factors the above results had illustrated that the changes of drought propagation process had strong relationship with the construction of tgd understanding potential factors influencing the modification of drought propagation under tgd operation is also crucial for revealing the internal mechanism of drought development in this study six drought related variables were considered including precipitation runoff soil moisture potential evapotranspiration pet average air temperature tavg and relative humidity rhu the calculation of pet was based on the penman monteith method we firstly calculated the variations of these six factors before and after 2003 for each sub basin as shown in fig 10 for each variable all sub basins represented as similar change patterns precipitation runoff and soil moisture all decreased after the construction of tgd especially for the midstream and downstream of yrb wang et al 2020b found that tgd accounted for about 50 of the runoff reduction in yrb and gao et al 2021 concluded that the attenuation of the flow process changes in the water surface slope and bedload coarsening induced by tgd impoundment led to the decrease in dominant discharge in yrb which consequently exacerbated the hydrological drought at the downstream sub basins li et al 2013 shah et al 2021 guo et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 besides with the rising of temperature the potential evapotranspiration also indicated as an upward trend the increasing temperature and pet and the decreasing runoff humidity and precipitation then reduce the water amount in the surface soil which became one potential factor that led to the aggravation of soil moisture drought propagation we also performed sen s slope method and mk trend test on the time series for these factors at four periods which were 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 fig 11 the trend with significance level over 90 was considered as obvious although total precipitation decreased after 2003 the trends were not apparent except for the period of 2000 2010 at middle and lower region of yrb for runoff significant downward trends were observed for most sub basins at the tgd initial operation period this result was consistent with the analysis above but during 2011 to 2020 the decreasing trend was no longer significant while some sub basins yrl mr tl and dtl got upward trend for runoff xu et al 2020 investigated the runoff response to the global warming of 1 5 and 2 scenarios in yrb and both cases demonstrated that the runoff in yrb would increase as the average temperature represented as increasing trend in most sub basins it was feasible to infer that at the tgd initial operation period the rapid modifications of the hydrological regimes and eco system caused the reduction of runoff directly but with the changing environment caused by anthropogenic activities tended to be stable in the last period climate change such as global warming gradually exerted more impacts relating to drought propagation the overall decrease runoff after 2003 aggravated the hydrological drought duration and severity since the drought event identification was directly linked to the variations of runoff propagation time as a variable describing propagation process may be affected by many factors e g aforementioned increasing trend of runoff during the last period the combined effects of these factors finally led to the increase of propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 4 4 2 attribution analysis for drought propagation modification in yrb in order to provide implications about to what extent the anthropogenic activity i e tgd operation and climate change contributed to the variations of drought propagation we conducted attribution analysis from the aspect of runoff modification based on the budyko hypothesis firstly the elasticities of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface characteristics were calculated table 5 which reflected the sensitivity of the runoff variation to each factor it can be observed that the runoff modification was relatively more sensitive to the precipitation and underlying surface characteristics rather than potential evapotranspiration specifically the elasticity of precipitation ranged from 1 55 to 2 17 while the elasticity of underlying surface characteristics was around 2 18 0 85 which was high in the middle and lower region of yrb the results indicated that changes of underlying surface characteristics exerted negative effects on the amount of runoff which further influenced drought propagation then the contributions of human activities and climate change were obtained following the equations listed in section 3 4 2 and shown in fig 12 generally tgd operation dominated the modification of runoff at a total of seven sub basins in yrb except ylr and mr the contributions of human behaviors mainly from tgd construction were 47 76 66 54 and 55 69 for the upper middle and lower regions of yrb respectively it should be noted that the contribution of human activities here represented negative impact on runoff variations i e decrease runoff since the elasticities of underlying surface characteristics were negative according to table 5 significant effects of anthropogenic behavior were observed at the middle reach of yrb which was close to the location of tgd considering the entire yrb the contribution of human activities and climate change were 56 75 and 43 25 the result illustrated that after 2003 due to the impact of human activities especially the tgd construction the natural water cycle had changed and the influences were greater than that of climate change in a word the analysis of potential factors and attribution of human activities and climate change provided a proof of concept that tgd construction did modify the hydrological patterns and further influence drought propagation in yrb but not the complete physics mechanism in future work a more comprehensive physical model based analysis would be considered to investigate the underlying mechanism of tgd effects on drought propagation 5 conclusions in order to explore the construction of tgd in modifying drought propagation process this study took yrb as the study area and firstly constructed the drought characteristics propagation models for m h and m s propagation then the variations of drought characteristics propagation process as well as the drought propagation time were identified before and after tgd operation meanwhile potential influence factors leading to the changes of drought propagation were also investigated the main conclusions were listed below 1 from 1981 to 2020 the frequency of meteorological drought was relatively the highest in yrb while hydrological drought occurred the least for meteorological and hydrological drought events the average duration and severity were 5 10 months and 4 0 8 0 units respectively but for soil moisture drought the values were generally lower 2 there were significant connections between the drought characteristics of m h and m s and linear model had good performance on describing the propagation process comparing the propagation models before and after 2003 it was found that the construction of tgd exacerbated the hydrological drought and soil moisture drought characteristics triggered by meteorological drought specifically given the meteorological drought duration and severity at 10 months and 10 units respectively the hydrological drought duration and severity were reduced by 0 76 months and 1 21 in average for m s propagation the duration and severity decreased 1 4 months and 1 3 respectively on one hand the modifications of the propagation models could reveal the changes of drought evolution under tgd construction and provide evidence for drought related policy formulation on the other hand the propagation models could also contribute to the prediction of hydrological drought and soil moisture drought duration and severity based on the meteorological drought characteristics 3 strong positive correlation was detected between drought propagation for m h and m s and the changes of hydrological and soil moisture drought series all lagged behind meteorological drought by calculating the propagation time variations between two scenarios due to the tgd operation the m h propagation time had an upward trend increased 1 3 months in average while the trend for m s lag time was opposite decreased 0 89 months in average in other words the propagation speed from meteorological drought to hydrological drought had been slowed down while soil moisture drought propagation speed was accelerated to this point more attention should be paid to understand the deep mechanism of soil moisture propagation process and provide scientific suggestions to its improvement 4 the influences of six potential factors brought to drought propagation modification were explored post periods of the tgd construction witnessed the decrease of runoff precipitation soil moisture and relative humidity with the rising of temperature and potential evapotranspiration combined with the trend analysis for four separate periods from 1981 to 2020 the evidences for the aggravation of propagated hydrological drought and soil moisture drought characteristics duration and severity as well as the different changes of propagation time were provided meanwhile the results of attribution analysis also indicated that tgd operation accounted for 56 75 of the total variations of annual runoff in yrb which provided insight into the tgd effects on drought propagation while the contribution was more pronounced 66 54 in the midstream results of this study are expected to reveal the drought propagation modification caused by the construction of tgd in yrb and be beneficial to the drought early warning system although this research gave some proofs for the potential reasons of drought propagation variation based on statistical methods the complicated interaction of multiple drought variables and the contrasting results of m h and m s propagation time variations cannot be directly analyzed due to the lack of sophisticated physics model in yrb at present thus if the physics driven model can be available in the future the combination of physical and statistical models can be a more powerful tool for understanding drought propagation features declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

3991,exterior i e outside the building soil gas sampling has been often used to estimate the sub slab soil gas concentration and to assess the risk of indoor vapor intrusion however the effectiveness of this method can be influenced by rainfall events in this study a two dimensional water air two phase flow numerical model is developed to investigate the effect of rainfall infiltration on the temporal variation of the soil gas concentration at different depths outside and beneath the building footprint it is found that rainfall infiltration generally exerts the capping effect and the dilution effect resulting the increase and decrease in the soil gas concentration respectively given the soil type of sandy loam the variation of the shallow and mid depth soil gas concentration depends respectively on the rainfall intensity and the total amount of rainwater while the deep soil gas concentration is found insensitive to a rainfall event moreover the response timescale of the soil gas concentration to a rainfall event is larger for a soil type with lower permeability considering a rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h the response timescales of the soil gas concentration at a depth of 2 m below the ground surface are larger than 1 year for silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam and about 5 and 2 months for loamy sand and sand respectively where evapotranspiration is not considered for the soil type of sand rainfall infiltration can yield a maximum underestimation error of 12 when using exterior soil gas sampling to estimate the sub slab soil gas concentration for the relatively less permeable soil type such as sandy loam silt loam and sandy clay loam by contrast a maximum overestimation error of 8 is found the results obtained in this study can offer important implications for practitioners to assess the indoor vapor intrusion risk through exterior soil gas sampling under the rainfall effect keywords vapor intrusion rainfall infiltration soil gas sampling numerical modeling water air two phase flow tough2 t2voc 1 introduction transport of volatile organic compounds vocs or other volatile contaminant vapors from the subsurface into overlying buildings is known as vapor intrusion because of the difficulty in characterizing the vapor intrusion pathway soil gas sampling is considered by the u s environmental protection agency epa to be an effective way to support the risk assessment of vapor intrusion usepa 2015 generally two soil gas sampling methods are adopted usepa 2012a i e sub slab soil gas sampling and exterior soil gas sampling i e soil gas samples collected exterior to the building footprint some innovative investigation techniques are also available such as flux chambers that can help supplement traditional vapor intrusion investigations ma et al 2012 2020a b verginelli et al 2018 sub slab soil gas is the gas that exists immediately beneath the floor of the building so the corresponding sampling method is more representative for the vapor intrusion risk assessment of the overlying building however this method may be constrained at sites where a large number of buildings are affected or where it is difficult to access the sub slab soil gas through the building floor usepa 2015 thus exterior soil gas sampling is more commonly used because sampling can be conducted with less interference to the building residents and the sampling point can be viewed as a representative of buildings around it mcalary et al 2011 temporal variability in voc concentrations has received increasing attention in recent years previous studies have shown that temporal variability in voc concentrations is higher for exterior soil gas samples compared to sub slab samples arising from the slab capping effect i e the shielding effect of the slab holton 2015 pennell et al 2016 the epa s vapor intrusion database usepa 2012a indicates that vapor concentrations in exterior soil gas samples are not strongly correlated to sub slab concentrations this is partly due to the difficulty in considering the influence of a variety of environmental conditions such as soil heterogeneity bozkurt et al 2009 seasonal temperature changes bekele et al 2014 barometric fluctuations mchugh et al 2012 yao et al 2020 groundwater fluctuations picone et al 2012 qi et al 2020 liu et al 2021 man et al 2021 and rainfall infiltration among these conditions rainfall infiltration may lead to the most significant short term variation in the concentration of soil gas samples for example in a field study by mcalary et al 2009 it was observed that soil gas sampling results declined by orders of magnitude due to continuous rainfall events in the superfund vapor intrusion faqs usepa 2012b however the epa contends that soil gas concentrations measured during or immediately after a significant rainfall event greater than2 5 cm might provide a worst case scenario because infiltrated water may displace soil gas and result in an increase of vapor intrusion potential but they also noted that infiltrated water may create a clean water lens over the groundwater which may trap the contaminant vapor and reduce the vapor intrusion risk usepa 2012b multiple field tests of vapor intrusion have indicated the significant effect of rainfall infiltration on vapor intrusion fitzpatrick and fitzgerald 2002 holton et al 2013 mcalary et al 2009 pennell et al 2016 fitzpatrick and fitzgerald 2002 evaluated the soil gas concentration data collected from voc contaminated sites in massachusetts and indicated that a clean water lens was formed above the water table due to rainfall infiltration serving as an effective barrier to inhibit voc from partitioning into the vadose zone shen et al 2012 established a 1 d numerical model and confirmed that the formation of a clean water lens played a significant role in determining the vapor intrusion risk the shortcomings of their study lie in that only a 1 d model is considered and the effect of rainfall infiltration on the sub slab soil gas concentration was not investigated tillman and weaver 2007 modeled temporal soil moisture changes induced by rainfall events and used time dependent average moisture contents as input parameters for the johnson and ettinger j e model johnson and ettinger 1991 to calculate indoor air concentrations they concluded that exterior soil moisture measurements could underestimate the vapor intrusion risk under the rainfall effect however since the j e model is based on the steady state assumption the flow and concentration in the study of tillman and weaver 2007 are not fully coupled using time dependent average moisture contents as input parameters may not represent the real situation because the timescales for moisture content dynamics are usually shorter than those for the corresponding effects on vapor transport pennell et al 2016 despite these studies the effect of rainfall infiltration on temporal variability in the sub slab soil gas concentration has not been explored moreover it is of practical interest to know how rainfall infiltration affects differently the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentration therefore a systematic evaluation of the effect of rainfall infiltration on the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentration is needed the process of rainfall infiltration has been studied for a long time a milestone paper describing the process of infiltration was presented by green and ampt 1911 based on that numerous models have been established for more complicated conditions e g smith et al 1999 corradini et al 2000 moreover other mathematic models have been developed based on solving the richards equation richards 1931 philip 1957 derived an analytical solution of richards equation swartzendruber 1987 presented a quasi solution that expressed the soil depth of a certain water content as an explicit function of time and water content these analytical models mainly considered the 1d downward infiltration process vapor intrusion coupled with rainfall infiltration involves both soil water flow and soil gas flow while it is challenging to develop an analytical solution for this scenario numerical methods have been employed to solve various complex problems e g gerke and van genuchten 1993 grifoll and cohen 1996 sleep and sykes 1989 in the present research a numerical model is established to study the impact of rainfall infiltration on the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentration tough2 t2voc falta et al 1995 capable of simulating three phase flow of water air and a volatile organic compound in porous media is used to study the temporospatial distribution of the soil gas concentration resulting from contaminant migration in response to rainfall infiltration in addition to rainfall parameters i e the intensity and duration the effects of the soil depth and soil texture will be also evaluated the objective of the current study is to gain insights into how the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentration are influenced differently by rainfall infiltration and how the rainfall event affects the assessment of indoor vapor intrusion risk through exterior soil gas sampling 2 numerical modeling 2 1 domain description a 2d vapor intrusion scenario is simulated to investigate the soil gas concentration variation induced by rainfall infiltration as shown in fig 1 such a vapor intrusion scenario was often assumed in previous theoretical studies e g abreu and johnson 2005 bozkurt et al 2009 pennell et al 2009 ström et al 2019 yao et al 2011 yao et al 2012 yao et al 2014 yao et al 2017 yao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 we assume the length of the building footprint is 10 m built on a field with the length of 24 m a half domain is simulated due to symmetry the foundation depth is set to be 2 m below the ground surface bgs and a perimeter foundation crack is assumed in our study with a width of 0 005 m the water table is assumed to be located at 6 m below the building basement serving as an infinite source of contamination for shallow soil gas sampling the depth of the water table is believed to have an insignificant impact on the soil gas concentration because the capillary zone can greatly resist the upward soil gas flow and the impact of the atmosphere plays a more important role yao et al 2018 therefore the water table is fixed at 8 m bgs in our study no flow boundary conditions are applied at the foundation wall and the slab except for a crack the vertical plane of symmetry and the exterior vertical boundary the crack is assumed to be located at the perimeter of the foundation and a flux boundary is applied at the crack the top boundary outside the building is set to be the atmospheric boundary with a fixed pressure of 101 3 kpa and a fixed contaminant concentration c air 0 for the bottom boundary the boundary conditions of water flow and gas flow are specified separately specifically for soil gas flow a no flow boundary is set while for soil water flow an open boundary is defined shen et al 2012 representing that the infiltrated water drains and joins the groundwater while the water table keeps constant moreover a fixed concentration c source 1 normalized concentration is set at the bottom boundary for simplicity evapotranspiration is neglected in our study 2 2 numerical method numerical solutions of the mathematical model are obtained using t2voc which is a 3d numerical simulation program for modeling the transport of volatile organic compound in non isothermal multiphase systems falta et al 1995 the detailed description about the governing equations is presented in the supplementary material t2voc uses the finite volume method fvm and the governing equations are integrated over each cell which enables the fvm better than the finite element method fem and the finite difference method fdm to satisfy the mass and energy balance equations moreover in the fvm the discretization process is carried out directly in the physical domain so physical meanings of discretization equations are also preserved the fvm can also meet the need of modeling complex geometries as it incorporates non structured gridding transport of trichloroethylene tce is simulated under the isothermal condition 25 c in the current study tce is a typical chlorinated volatile organic contaminant and its chemical characteristics are taken from the u s epa s vapor intrusion database usepa 2012a biodegradation is not considered in our study because tce is highly resistant to biodegradation yao et al 2018 the effect of kinetic mass transfer at phase interfaces is neglected instead the local equilibrium of tce in two phases i e soil gas and water is assumed grifoll and cohen 1996 picone et al 2012 shen et al 2012 the effect of adsorption to the solid phase is not considered in our simulation the contaminant concentration in soil gas is in relation to that in the water phase by applying henry s law 1 c g h c w where c g is the soil gas concentration c w is the soil water concentration and h is the henry s constant all the parameters used in our simulation are listed in table 1 in our simulation the cartesian mesh is used for modeling a geometrically regular site variable grid spacing is adopted as recommended by abreu and johnson 2005 grid spacing is the finest near the model boundaries water table i e contaminant source and foundation crack specifically the size of grids is 0 01 m near the crack and foundation and 0 1 m near the atmospheric boundary and the water table boundary the maximum size of grids is 0 5 m to establish the initial condition we run our model in two steps firstly the model is run without contaminant to reach a capillarity gravity equilibrium and to obtain the soil moisture retention curve then the contaminant i e tce is released to the groundwater and the model is run again to reach a diffusion equilibrium the saturation condition and contaminant concentration simulated are used as the initial condition for the subsequent runs infiltration is applied evenly to the uncovered portion of the modeling domain which is an idealized condition because the rooftop can collect the rainwater and causes the amount of rainwater around the perimeter of the building to be greater than the precipitation rate we select four representative sampling points a d to discuss the simulation results as shown in fig 1 and their coordinates are listed in table 2 point d located under the foundation crack is selected to explore the temporal variation of the contaminant concentration around the crack under the effect of a rainfall event point a b and c located at 0 4 m shallow 2 0 m middle and 6 0 m deep bgs respectively are selected to investigate the variation of the exterior soil gas concentrations at different depths point b and d are selected at the same depth to illustrate the effect of the building structure on the soil gas concentration under the effect of a rainfall event 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with previous experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the numerical model we compare the results between the numerical method and previous infiltration experiments touma and vauclin 1986 conducted several experiments of infiltration into a vertical sandy soil column to analyze the soil gas flow and soil water flow during the process of water infiltration the sandy soil column with 6 cm inside diameter is 93 5 cm high all parameters used in our simulation are the same as those in their laboratory test the infiltration rates used here are 8 3 cm h and 20 cm h which correspond to the experiments under non ponding and ponding condition respectively transport of contaminant was not considered in this simulation fig 2 shows the comparison of soil water saturation between experimental results and our numerical results for the non ponding condition the soil water saturation obtained from our simulation matches well with the experimental results marked as dots for the ponding condition however the infiltration wetting front in our simulation propagates slightly slower than that in the experiments in the early state this can be attributed to the fact that the initial water content of the shallow soil in the experiment is higher than that in the simulation which may result in faster infiltration rates however they gradually fit well over time which shows the reliability of our numerical model 3 2 comparison with field data here we also use the numerical model to simulate a field case at 422 east 28th st indianapolis in where practitioners measured the long term soil gas concentrations near an old building usepa 2012c soil boring results show that the first 0 4 m beneath the surface is sand or silt mixed with cinders coal fragments from 0 4 m to about 1 8 m is loam sand with varying amounts of clay and beneath 1 8 m is mainly sands and gravels the depth of the water table is range from 3 3 to 6 m with an average value about 4 5 m for simplicity we develop a two layer numerical model to simulate this scenario the first layer is a loam sand layer with a depth from 0 to 1 8 m and the second layer is a sand layer with a depth from 1 8 m to 4 5 m the water table which serves as the source of contaminant is fixed at 4 5 m bgs due to the lack of field data the soil properties are taken from the epa s implementation of the j e model usepa 2017 fig 3 shows the comparison of the numerical results and measured soil gas concentrations located at 1 8 m bgs as can be seen from fig 3 numerical results fit well with the measured data in the first 200 days which is the main period of rainfall events as for the last 150 days the simulation results show deviations from the measured data this may be due to the effect of the temperature variation which is not considered in our simulation however an interesting phenomenon observed from the simulation results is that soil gas concentrations are insensitive to those rainfall events with small amounts of rainwater this is probably because wetting fonts in these rainfall events propagate very slowly and the upward soil gas diffusion flux counteracts the impact of the rainwater furthermore in reality rainfall events with a small amount of rainwater may only affect the very shallow soil due to evapotranspiration and plant interception by contrast rainfall events with a large amount of rainwater occurred in a short time could play a significant role in the deeper soil gas concentration and the impact may last several weeks to months which may lead to a biased assessment of the long term vapor intrusion risk thus in the current study we focus our attention on the rainfall events with a large amount of rainwater occurred in a short time 3 3 scenario with a single rainfall event under the no diffusion condition as mentioned above we simulate 2d vapor intrusion scenarios where the water table is fixed at 8 m bgs the infiltrated water drains and joins the groundwater with the constant water level sandy loam is selected in our simulation and soil parameters are taken from the soil database compiled by carsel and parrish 1988 k 1 12 10 12 m 2 θ 0 41 s wr 0 158 s ws 1 α 7 5 m 1 and n 1 89 for simplicity rainfall intensities used in our simulation refer to the non ponding condition the initial condition is obtained by two steps as described above fig 4 shows the initial distribution of the soil gas concentration it is found that the concentration of soil gas near the water table drops greatly a short distance away from the water table into the vadose zone this is because the capillary fringe significantly inhibits upward vapor transport similar phenomena have been also observed in previous numerical studies shen et al 2012 2013 and field experiments fitzpatrick and fitzgerald 2002 pennell et al 2016 it is found that in general the influence of rainfall infiltration on vapor intrusion is mainly embodied in two aspects on one hand the clean rainwater flows downward and mixes with contaminated soil water leading to a decrease in soil water contaminant concentration due to dilution and a decrease in soil gas concentration due to mass transfer from gas to water on the other hand rainfall events increase the water content of the shallow soil which could act as a barrier to inhibit contaminated gas from diffusing into the atmosphere resulting in an increase in the soil gas concentration to facilitate our discussion we refer to the former as the dilution effect of rainwater and the latter the capping effect of rainwater to illustrate the dilution effect of rainwater we run the numerical model under the no diffusion condition i e d g c 0 note that this scenario is hypothetical fig 5 shows the time varying soil moisture and soil gas concentration at the exterior locations point a b and c in such a hypothetical scenario with the rainfall intensity q rain of 4 mm h and the rainfall duration of 24 h in the shallow soil it can be seen from fig 5 a1 and 5 a2 that the water content increases during the raining period and decreases after raining the soil gas concentration drops sharply during the raining period and barely increases after raining this is because there exists mass transfer from the soil gas phase into the clean rainwater due to the non equilibrium condition between the two phases in the mid depth soil i e point b as can be seen from fig 5 b1 and 5 b2 the soil moisture contents hardly change during the raining period but increase after raining while the soil gas concentration decreases slightly during and after the raining period in the deep soil i e point c as can be seen from fig 5 c1 and 5 c2 the soil moisture contents keep constant during the first week since raining while the variation of the soil gas concentration is similar to that in the mid depth soil after analyzing the flow field of gas and water not shown here we find that a small amount of shallow gas is pushed into the deeper soil by rainwater and mixed with deeper soil gas leading to a decrease in the soil gas concentration at point b and c in previous numerical studies grifoll and cohen 1996 shen et al 2012 it was assumed that the velocity of soil gas is the inverse of the velocity of soil water and therefore the flow equations can be simplified this assumption indicates that the volume of soil gas escapes from the soil is equal to the volume of rainwater our simulation results support this assumption because the effect of the shallow gas downflow is not significant however this assumption may not be appropriate for cases under the surface ponding condition where soil gas is more likely to be pushed into the deep soil rather than escaping from the soil surface 3 4 scenarios with different single rainfall events to compare the response of the soil gas concentration to different rainfall conditions with a large amount of rainwater three rainfall events are considered in our simulation 2 mm h light rainfall for 24 h duration 4 mm h moderate rainfall for 24 h duration and 24 mm h heavy rainfall for 4 h duration it is worth mentioning that the former two rainfall events keep the same duration of rainfall while the latter two rainfall events keep the same total amount of rainwater the rainfall intensity is classified according to llasat 2001 although the former two rainfall events are classified respectively as light rainfall and moderate rainfall they still contain sufficient rainwater due to the relatively long rainfall duration 3 4 1 effect on exterior soil gas concentration fig 6 shows the variation of the water content and exterior soil gas concentration under three rainfall events at different depths where the dashed line refers to the end time of the first two cases i e 2 mm h for 24 h and 4 mm h for 24 h and the dash dotted line refers to the end time of the last case 24 mm h for 4 h as can be seen from the left panel the wetting front propagates faster for the case with a larger rainfall intensity moreover the impact of rainfall events on the soil gas concentration decreases significantly with increasing soil depth indicating that it would be not appropriate for practitioners to measure the shallow soil gas concentration after the rainfall event in the shallow soil i e point a the water content increases during the raining period and decreases after raining see fig 6 a1 a higher increment rate during the raining period occurs in the case with a higher rainfall intensity as shown in fig 6 a2 the soil gas concentration varies significantly with the rainfall intensity during the raining period the soil gas concentration continuously increases for the rainfall intensity of 2 mm h light rainfall first increases and then decreases for the rainfall intensity of 4 mm h moderate rainfall and continuously decreases for the rainfall intensity of 24 mm h heavy rainfall respectively these results illustrate that the soil gas concentration during the raining period is dominated by the capping effect for a light rainfall event and dominated by the dilution effect for a heavy rainfall event when the rainfall event is moderate the soil gas concentration during the raining period is initially controlled by the capping effect and then by the dilution effect immediately after the raining period the soil gas concentration in the shallow soil increases in all cases this is because that a large amount of deep soil gas with a high contaminant concentration moves upward due to rainwater infiltration resulting in the increase of the soil gas concentration and the decrease of the water content in the mid depth soil i e point b as shown in fig 6 b1 the soil water content increases slightly after the rainfall event in all cases and increases faster in the case with a higher rainfall intensity as for the soil gas concentration three rainfall events show the similar trend see fig 6 b2 specifically the soil gas concentration decreases slightly during the raining period due to the push effect of rainwater and then gradually increases after the raining event due to the capping effect moreover it is found that the changes of the soil gas concentration in the two cases with the same total amount of rainwater are quite similar this phenomenon suggests that the total amount of rainwater plays a significant role in the soil gas concentration of the mid depth soil more amount of rainwater represents a stronger capping effect and hence a higher total amount of rainwater results in a higher soil gas concentration in the deep soil i e point c the soil moisture content remains the same in all cases during the simulation time while the soil gas concentration decreases slightly in all cases see fig 6 c1 and 6 c2 since a small amount of shallow gas with the lower concentration is pushed into the deeper soil by the infiltration water 3 4 2 effect on sub slab soil gas concentration fig 7 shows the variation of the soil gas concentration under the edge of the foundation slab i e point d in response to three rainfall events it can be seen that the variation trend of the sub slab soil gas concentration is similar to that of the exterior location at the same depth see fig 6 b2 the sub slab soil gas concentration in all three cases decreases during the raining period and increases after raining however the difference of the rainfall induced variation of soil gas concentrations between the sub slab and exterior locations exists in specific during the raining period the sub slab soil gas concentration decreases more significantly than the exterior soil gas concentration at point b according to the gas velocity field not shown here the gas pushed into the deep soil by rainwater tends to transport laterally this is partly due to the relatively low soil gas pressure under the building foundation induced by the indoor air depressurization which results in the lateral transport of external soil gas to the foundation crack and a more significant decrease in the sub slab soil gas concentration the similar phenomenon has been observed in previous simulation results presented by pennell et al 2009 yao et al 2020 also mentioned that the pressure distribution in the sub foundation zone can be significantly heterogeneous another difference is the degree of increase in the soil gas concentration during 7 days since raining between the two locations i e point b and d taking the rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h as an example the sub slab soil gas concentration of point d increases by about 4 from 0 098 to 0 102 at the end of simulation time 7 days while the exterior soil gas concentration of point b increases by about 10 from 0 048 to 0 053 during the same period the differences in the incrementratio of the soil gas concentration between the two sampling points in response to the rainfall event may lead to a biased estimation of the indoor vapor intrusion risk through the measurements of the exterior soil gas concentration 3 4 3 simulated vs estimated sub slab soil gas concentration previous studies have given an analytical method to estimate the sub slab soil gas concentration based on the exterior soil gas sampling yao et al 2012 2014 written as 2 c ss m c e where c ss is the sub slab soil gas concentration estimated by the exterior soil gas concentration ce at the same depth and m is the correction factor and can be derived analytically yao et al 2012 yao et al 2014 to avoid the errors resulting from the analytical calculation of m m is determined in our study based on the simulated results of c ss and c e under the initial steady state condition i e m c ss c e fig 8 shows the variation of simulated and estimated sub slab soil gas concentration in response to a rainfall event the simulated sub slab soil gas concentration is obtained from point d while the estimated sub slab soil gas concentration is calculated from eq 2 where ce is the simulated exterior soil gas concentration at point b m is obtained by c ss c e 2 0338 it is found that the impact of a single rainfall event on the soil gas concentration can last for a very long time if evapotranspiration is not considered both simulated and estimated sub slab soil gas concentrations in three cases increase continuously in the first month after the rainfall event and then decrease it is clearly shown that estimated sub slab soil gas concentration is larger than the simulated one during a period of several months after a significant rainfall event suggesting that using the exterior soil gas sampling could lead to the overestimation of the indoor vapor intrusion risk moreover both simulated and estimated sub slab soil gas concentrations of two cases with the same amount of rainwater i e 4 mm h for 24 h and 24 mm h for 4 h show very similar trends confirming that the total amount of rainwater controls the mid depth soil gas concentration fig 9 shows the transient water saturation distribution and the soil water darcy velocity where a rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h is considered it is clearly shown that the rainwater forms a water lens on the exterior soil of the concerned building in the first 30 days then the water lens disappears gradually as the soil water infiltrates downward while the sub foundation zone remains relatively dry it is interesting that the soil gas concentration has not returned to the initial condition after one year indicating that without the consideration of evapotranspiration the rainfall event with a large amount of rainwater plays a significant role in the long term change of the soil gas concentration as mentioned above the rainfall induced increment rate of the soil gas concentration in the sub slab zone is lower than that in the exterior zone taking the rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h as an example the sub slab soil gas concentration increases by 13 about 30 days after the rainfall event while the exterior soil gas concentration increases by 24 during the same period the higher increase of the soil gas concentration in the exterior location can lead to an overestimation of the sub slab soil gas concentration and the risk of indoor vapor intrusion if only exterior soil gas sampling is adopted this is consistent with the epa s recommendation that the worst scenario may be provided if the gas concentration is measured after a significant rainfall event usepa 2012b the epa also point out that creating a clean water lens in groundwater may trap the contaminant vapor and reduce the risk of vapor intrusion however our simulation results show that a contrary phenomenon is observed that is the risk of vapor intrusion could be enhanced when a relatively clean water lens is formed in the shallow soil and serves as a barrier to prevent soil gas entering the atmosphere 3 5 scenarios with different soil types since the process of rainfall infiltration depends significantly on soil permeability it is necessary to evaluate the impact of the soil type on the change of the soil gas concentration caused by the rainfall event here we select five soil types silt loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand covering a wide range of representative permeability conditions soil parameters of these soil types taken from the soil database compiled by carsel and parrish 1988 are summarized in table 3 the moderate rainfall event 4 mm h for 24 h is adopted for all cases all simulations are run from the first two steps to establish the initial water content and soil gas concentration for each soil texture fig 10 shows the variation of the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentrations in response of a rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h for five different soil types including silt loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand it is shown that for a given soil texture the variation trends of the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentrations are quite similar for soils with relatively small permeability such as silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam the rainfall event mainly exerts the capping effect on the soil gas concentration resulting in the increase of the soil gas concentration the speed of the increase in the soil gas concentration highly depends on the soil type and a more permeable soil leads to a smaller period of the increase i e a faster increase the times needed to reach the maximum value of the soil gas concentration are about 1 2 and 5 months for sandy loam sandy clay loam and silt loam respectively after reaching the maximum soil gas concentration the concentration slowly approaches the steady state value it is shown in fig 10 that the response timescale of the soil gas concentration to the rainfall event is larger for a soil type with less permeability in specific the response timescales are larger than 1 year for silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam and about 5 and 2 months for loamy sand and sand respectively in reality however the recovery timescale may be greatly reduced due to the evapotranspiration effect which is not considered in our study for relatively permeable soil types loamy sand and sand it is interesting that the soil gas concentration first increases sharply to reach the maximum after 7 days for loamy sand and 2 days for sand then decreases quickly to a value that is less than the initial concentration and is eventually recovered to the initial value see fig 10 d1 10 d2 10 e1 and 10 e2 this indicates that for these two high permeability soil types rainfall infiltration initially produces the capping effect followed by the dilution effect on the soil gas concentration to evaluate the rainfall induced biased estimation of the indoor vapor intrusion through exterior soil gas sampling we explore the ratio of the simulated sub slab soil gas concentration to the estimated value i e the value calculated from eq 2 the ratio greater and smaller than 1 represents respectively the underestimation and overestimation of the sub slab soil gas concentration through exterior soil gas sampling simulation results show that correction factors m for silt loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand are 2 3287 2 3368 2 0338 1 9311 and 1 9331 respectively fig 11 shows the influence of soil types on the ratio between the simulated and estimated sub slab soil gas concentration as shown all ratios equal to 1 at the initial condition i e without the rainfall effect during the rainfall event the ratios of all five soil types tend to decrease despite that the extent of the decrease is not significant after raining all ratios first decrease and then increase while the times of rebounding are different the ratio of the soil type with higher permeability rebounds earlier the rebounding times of the ratio are 2 days 6 days 21 days 49 days and 150 days for sand loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam and silt loam respectively moreover for the soil types with high permeability such as sandy loam loamy sand and sand the ratio can rebound to be larger than 1 during the simulation time i e 1 year indicating that the sub slab soil gas concentration can be underestimated through exterior soil gas sampling the periods of overestimation i e c ss c ss 1 and underestimation i e c s s c s s 1 are 147 days and 218 days for sandy loam 14 days and 180 days for loamy sand and 2 days and 89 days for sand respectively it is found that the soil type of sand can yield a maximum underestimation error of 12 when using exterior soil gas sampling to estimate the sub slab soil gas concentration for the soil types of relatively low permeability i e silt loam and sandy clay loam however the ratio is always less than 1 indicating that an overestimation occurs during the simulation time i e 1 year the maximum overestimation error of 8 is found in these cases 4 conclusion in this study we employ a 2 d two phase flow numerical model to simulate the temporal variations of soil gas concentrations at different depths in response to a single rainfall event the influence of rainwater on the soil gas concentration is mainly reflected in two aspects on one hand clean rainwater is mixed with soil water which reduces the soil water concentration due to dilution and at the same time the soil gas concentration is reduced due to mass transfer between the two phases on the other hand rainwater increases the moisture content of the shallow soil and inhibits the diffusion of contaminant vapors into the atmosphere leading to an increase in the soil gas concentration assuming the soil type of sandy loam it is found that the variation of the shallow and mid depth soil gas concentration depends respectively on the rainfall intensity and the total amount of rainwater however the deep soil gas concentration is found insensitive to a rainfall event moreover the response timescale of the soil gas concentration to a rainfall event is highly dependent on the soil texture and larger for a soil type with lower permeability considering a rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h the response timescales of the soil gas concentration at a depth of 2 m below the ground surface are larger than 1 year for silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam and about 5 and 2 months for loamy sand and sand respectively where evapotranspiration is not considered importantly the rainfall event may lead to a biased estimation of the sub slab soil gas concentration through exterior soil gas sampling for high permeability soil types such as sandy loam loamy sand and sand soil gas sampling results in first an overestimation and then an underestimation by contrast for low permeability soil types such as silt loam and sandy clay loam only the overestimation is found during the simulation time furthermore it is found that rainfall infiltration in sand soil can yield a maximum underestimation error of 12 while a maximum overestimation error of 8 is found in the soil types of silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam in conclusion the temporal response of the soil gas concentration to rainfall events varies greatly with the rainfall intensity soil depth location and soil type special attention should be paid to the rainfall event when using exterior soil gas sampling to estimate the indoor vapor intrusion risk despite that our study is based on a simplified conceptual model the findings obtained in this study can offer important implications for practitioners to assess the indoor vapor intrusion through exterior soil gas sampling under the effect of rainfall events future work is required to explore other coupling effects such as evapotranspiration soil permeability heterogeneity temperature variations barometric fluctuations and water table fluctuations in addition the effects of multiple rainfall events are worthy of being

3991,exterior i e outside the building soil gas sampling has been often used to estimate the sub slab soil gas concentration and to assess the risk of indoor vapor intrusion however the effectiveness of this method can be influenced by rainfall events in this study a two dimensional water air two phase flow numerical model is developed to investigate the effect of rainfall infiltration on the temporal variation of the soil gas concentration at different depths outside and beneath the building footprint it is found that rainfall infiltration generally exerts the capping effect and the dilution effect resulting the increase and decrease in the soil gas concentration respectively given the soil type of sandy loam the variation of the shallow and mid depth soil gas concentration depends respectively on the rainfall intensity and the total amount of rainwater while the deep soil gas concentration is found insensitive to a rainfall event moreover the response timescale of the soil gas concentration to a rainfall event is larger for a soil type with lower permeability considering a rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h the response timescales of the soil gas concentration at a depth of 2 m below the ground surface are larger than 1 year for silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam and about 5 and 2 months for loamy sand and sand respectively where evapotranspiration is not considered for the soil type of sand rainfall infiltration can yield a maximum underestimation error of 12 when using exterior soil gas sampling to estimate the sub slab soil gas concentration for the relatively less permeable soil type such as sandy loam silt loam and sandy clay loam by contrast a maximum overestimation error of 8 is found the results obtained in this study can offer important implications for practitioners to assess the indoor vapor intrusion risk through exterior soil gas sampling under the rainfall effect keywords vapor intrusion rainfall infiltration soil gas sampling numerical modeling water air two phase flow tough2 t2voc 1 introduction transport of volatile organic compounds vocs or other volatile contaminant vapors from the subsurface into overlying buildings is known as vapor intrusion because of the difficulty in characterizing the vapor intrusion pathway soil gas sampling is considered by the u s environmental protection agency epa to be an effective way to support the risk assessment of vapor intrusion usepa 2015 generally two soil gas sampling methods are adopted usepa 2012a i e sub slab soil gas sampling and exterior soil gas sampling i e soil gas samples collected exterior to the building footprint some innovative investigation techniques are also available such as flux chambers that can help supplement traditional vapor intrusion investigations ma et al 2012 2020a b verginelli et al 2018 sub slab soil gas is the gas that exists immediately beneath the floor of the building so the corresponding sampling method is more representative for the vapor intrusion risk assessment of the overlying building however this method may be constrained at sites where a large number of buildings are affected or where it is difficult to access the sub slab soil gas through the building floor usepa 2015 thus exterior soil gas sampling is more commonly used because sampling can be conducted with less interference to the building residents and the sampling point can be viewed as a representative of buildings around it mcalary et al 2011 temporal variability in voc concentrations has received increasing attention in recent years previous studies have shown that temporal variability in voc concentrations is higher for exterior soil gas samples compared to sub slab samples arising from the slab capping effect i e the shielding effect of the slab holton 2015 pennell et al 2016 the epa s vapor intrusion database usepa 2012a indicates that vapor concentrations in exterior soil gas samples are not strongly correlated to sub slab concentrations this is partly due to the difficulty in considering the influence of a variety of environmental conditions such as soil heterogeneity bozkurt et al 2009 seasonal temperature changes bekele et al 2014 barometric fluctuations mchugh et al 2012 yao et al 2020 groundwater fluctuations picone et al 2012 qi et al 2020 liu et al 2021 man et al 2021 and rainfall infiltration among these conditions rainfall infiltration may lead to the most significant short term variation in the concentration of soil gas samples for example in a field study by mcalary et al 2009 it was observed that soil gas sampling results declined by orders of magnitude due to continuous rainfall events in the superfund vapor intrusion faqs usepa 2012b however the epa contends that soil gas concentrations measured during or immediately after a significant rainfall event greater than2 5 cm might provide a worst case scenario because infiltrated water may displace soil gas and result in an increase of vapor intrusion potential but they also noted that infiltrated water may create a clean water lens over the groundwater which may trap the contaminant vapor and reduce the vapor intrusion risk usepa 2012b multiple field tests of vapor intrusion have indicated the significant effect of rainfall infiltration on vapor intrusion fitzpatrick and fitzgerald 2002 holton et al 2013 mcalary et al 2009 pennell et al 2016 fitzpatrick and fitzgerald 2002 evaluated the soil gas concentration data collected from voc contaminated sites in massachusetts and indicated that a clean water lens was formed above the water table due to rainfall infiltration serving as an effective barrier to inhibit voc from partitioning into the vadose zone shen et al 2012 established a 1 d numerical model and confirmed that the formation of a clean water lens played a significant role in determining the vapor intrusion risk the shortcomings of their study lie in that only a 1 d model is considered and the effect of rainfall infiltration on the sub slab soil gas concentration was not investigated tillman and weaver 2007 modeled temporal soil moisture changes induced by rainfall events and used time dependent average moisture contents as input parameters for the johnson and ettinger j e model johnson and ettinger 1991 to calculate indoor air concentrations they concluded that exterior soil moisture measurements could underestimate the vapor intrusion risk under the rainfall effect however since the j e model is based on the steady state assumption the flow and concentration in the study of tillman and weaver 2007 are not fully coupled using time dependent average moisture contents as input parameters may not represent the real situation because the timescales for moisture content dynamics are usually shorter than those for the corresponding effects on vapor transport pennell et al 2016 despite these studies the effect of rainfall infiltration on temporal variability in the sub slab soil gas concentration has not been explored moreover it is of practical interest to know how rainfall infiltration affects differently the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentration therefore a systematic evaluation of the effect of rainfall infiltration on the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentration is needed the process of rainfall infiltration has been studied for a long time a milestone paper describing the process of infiltration was presented by green and ampt 1911 based on that numerous models have been established for more complicated conditions e g smith et al 1999 corradini et al 2000 moreover other mathematic models have been developed based on solving the richards equation richards 1931 philip 1957 derived an analytical solution of richards equation swartzendruber 1987 presented a quasi solution that expressed the soil depth of a certain water content as an explicit function of time and water content these analytical models mainly considered the 1d downward infiltration process vapor intrusion coupled with rainfall infiltration involves both soil water flow and soil gas flow while it is challenging to develop an analytical solution for this scenario numerical methods have been employed to solve various complex problems e g gerke and van genuchten 1993 grifoll and cohen 1996 sleep and sykes 1989 in the present research a numerical model is established to study the impact of rainfall infiltration on the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentration tough2 t2voc falta et al 1995 capable of simulating three phase flow of water air and a volatile organic compound in porous media is used to study the temporospatial distribution of the soil gas concentration resulting from contaminant migration in response to rainfall infiltration in addition to rainfall parameters i e the intensity and duration the effects of the soil depth and soil texture will be also evaluated the objective of the current study is to gain insights into how the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentration are influenced differently by rainfall infiltration and how the rainfall event affects the assessment of indoor vapor intrusion risk through exterior soil gas sampling 2 numerical modeling 2 1 domain description a 2d vapor intrusion scenario is simulated to investigate the soil gas concentration variation induced by rainfall infiltration as shown in fig 1 such a vapor intrusion scenario was often assumed in previous theoretical studies e g abreu and johnson 2005 bozkurt et al 2009 pennell et al 2009 ström et al 2019 yao et al 2011 yao et al 2012 yao et al 2014 yao et al 2017 yao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 we assume the length of the building footprint is 10 m built on a field with the length of 24 m a half domain is simulated due to symmetry the foundation depth is set to be 2 m below the ground surface bgs and a perimeter foundation crack is assumed in our study with a width of 0 005 m the water table is assumed to be located at 6 m below the building basement serving as an infinite source of contamination for shallow soil gas sampling the depth of the water table is believed to have an insignificant impact on the soil gas concentration because the capillary zone can greatly resist the upward soil gas flow and the impact of the atmosphere plays a more important role yao et al 2018 therefore the water table is fixed at 8 m bgs in our study no flow boundary conditions are applied at the foundation wall and the slab except for a crack the vertical plane of symmetry and the exterior vertical boundary the crack is assumed to be located at the perimeter of the foundation and a flux boundary is applied at the crack the top boundary outside the building is set to be the atmospheric boundary with a fixed pressure of 101 3 kpa and a fixed contaminant concentration c air 0 for the bottom boundary the boundary conditions of water flow and gas flow are specified separately specifically for soil gas flow a no flow boundary is set while for soil water flow an open boundary is defined shen et al 2012 representing that the infiltrated water drains and joins the groundwater while the water table keeps constant moreover a fixed concentration c source 1 normalized concentration is set at the bottom boundary for simplicity evapotranspiration is neglected in our study 2 2 numerical method numerical solutions of the mathematical model are obtained using t2voc which is a 3d numerical simulation program for modeling the transport of volatile organic compound in non isothermal multiphase systems falta et al 1995 the detailed description about the governing equations is presented in the supplementary material t2voc uses the finite volume method fvm and the governing equations are integrated over each cell which enables the fvm better than the finite element method fem and the finite difference method fdm to satisfy the mass and energy balance equations moreover in the fvm the discretization process is carried out directly in the physical domain so physical meanings of discretization equations are also preserved the fvm can also meet the need of modeling complex geometries as it incorporates non structured gridding transport of trichloroethylene tce is simulated under the isothermal condition 25 c in the current study tce is a typical chlorinated volatile organic contaminant and its chemical characteristics are taken from the u s epa s vapor intrusion database usepa 2012a biodegradation is not considered in our study because tce is highly resistant to biodegradation yao et al 2018 the effect of kinetic mass transfer at phase interfaces is neglected instead the local equilibrium of tce in two phases i e soil gas and water is assumed grifoll and cohen 1996 picone et al 2012 shen et al 2012 the effect of adsorption to the solid phase is not considered in our simulation the contaminant concentration in soil gas is in relation to that in the water phase by applying henry s law 1 c g h c w where c g is the soil gas concentration c w is the soil water concentration and h is the henry s constant all the parameters used in our simulation are listed in table 1 in our simulation the cartesian mesh is used for modeling a geometrically regular site variable grid spacing is adopted as recommended by abreu and johnson 2005 grid spacing is the finest near the model boundaries water table i e contaminant source and foundation crack specifically the size of grids is 0 01 m near the crack and foundation and 0 1 m near the atmospheric boundary and the water table boundary the maximum size of grids is 0 5 m to establish the initial condition we run our model in two steps firstly the model is run without contaminant to reach a capillarity gravity equilibrium and to obtain the soil moisture retention curve then the contaminant i e tce is released to the groundwater and the model is run again to reach a diffusion equilibrium the saturation condition and contaminant concentration simulated are used as the initial condition for the subsequent runs infiltration is applied evenly to the uncovered portion of the modeling domain which is an idealized condition because the rooftop can collect the rainwater and causes the amount of rainwater around the perimeter of the building to be greater than the precipitation rate we select four representative sampling points a d to discuss the simulation results as shown in fig 1 and their coordinates are listed in table 2 point d located under the foundation crack is selected to explore the temporal variation of the contaminant concentration around the crack under the effect of a rainfall event point a b and c located at 0 4 m shallow 2 0 m middle and 6 0 m deep bgs respectively are selected to investigate the variation of the exterior soil gas concentrations at different depths point b and d are selected at the same depth to illustrate the effect of the building structure on the soil gas concentration under the effect of a rainfall event 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with previous experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the numerical model we compare the results between the numerical method and previous infiltration experiments touma and vauclin 1986 conducted several experiments of infiltration into a vertical sandy soil column to analyze the soil gas flow and soil water flow during the process of water infiltration the sandy soil column with 6 cm inside diameter is 93 5 cm high all parameters used in our simulation are the same as those in their laboratory test the infiltration rates used here are 8 3 cm h and 20 cm h which correspond to the experiments under non ponding and ponding condition respectively transport of contaminant was not considered in this simulation fig 2 shows the comparison of soil water saturation between experimental results and our numerical results for the non ponding condition the soil water saturation obtained from our simulation matches well with the experimental results marked as dots for the ponding condition however the infiltration wetting front in our simulation propagates slightly slower than that in the experiments in the early state this can be attributed to the fact that the initial water content of the shallow soil in the experiment is higher than that in the simulation which may result in faster infiltration rates however they gradually fit well over time which shows the reliability of our numerical model 3 2 comparison with field data here we also use the numerical model to simulate a field case at 422 east 28th st indianapolis in where practitioners measured the long term soil gas concentrations near an old building usepa 2012c soil boring results show that the first 0 4 m beneath the surface is sand or silt mixed with cinders coal fragments from 0 4 m to about 1 8 m is loam sand with varying amounts of clay and beneath 1 8 m is mainly sands and gravels the depth of the water table is range from 3 3 to 6 m with an average value about 4 5 m for simplicity we develop a two layer numerical model to simulate this scenario the first layer is a loam sand layer with a depth from 0 to 1 8 m and the second layer is a sand layer with a depth from 1 8 m to 4 5 m the water table which serves as the source of contaminant is fixed at 4 5 m bgs due to the lack of field data the soil properties are taken from the epa s implementation of the j e model usepa 2017 fig 3 shows the comparison of the numerical results and measured soil gas concentrations located at 1 8 m bgs as can be seen from fig 3 numerical results fit well with the measured data in the first 200 days which is the main period of rainfall events as for the last 150 days the simulation results show deviations from the measured data this may be due to the effect of the temperature variation which is not considered in our simulation however an interesting phenomenon observed from the simulation results is that soil gas concentrations are insensitive to those rainfall events with small amounts of rainwater this is probably because wetting fonts in these rainfall events propagate very slowly and the upward soil gas diffusion flux counteracts the impact of the rainwater furthermore in reality rainfall events with a small amount of rainwater may only affect the very shallow soil due to evapotranspiration and plant interception by contrast rainfall events with a large amount of rainwater occurred in a short time could play a significant role in the deeper soil gas concentration and the impact may last several weeks to months which may lead to a biased assessment of the long term vapor intrusion risk thus in the current study we focus our attention on the rainfall events with a large amount of rainwater occurred in a short time 3 3 scenario with a single rainfall event under the no diffusion condition as mentioned above we simulate 2d vapor intrusion scenarios where the water table is fixed at 8 m bgs the infiltrated water drains and joins the groundwater with the constant water level sandy loam is selected in our simulation and soil parameters are taken from the soil database compiled by carsel and parrish 1988 k 1 12 10 12 m 2 θ 0 41 s wr 0 158 s ws 1 α 7 5 m 1 and n 1 89 for simplicity rainfall intensities used in our simulation refer to the non ponding condition the initial condition is obtained by two steps as described above fig 4 shows the initial distribution of the soil gas concentration it is found that the concentration of soil gas near the water table drops greatly a short distance away from the water table into the vadose zone this is because the capillary fringe significantly inhibits upward vapor transport similar phenomena have been also observed in previous numerical studies shen et al 2012 2013 and field experiments fitzpatrick and fitzgerald 2002 pennell et al 2016 it is found that in general the influence of rainfall infiltration on vapor intrusion is mainly embodied in two aspects on one hand the clean rainwater flows downward and mixes with contaminated soil water leading to a decrease in soil water contaminant concentration due to dilution and a decrease in soil gas concentration due to mass transfer from gas to water on the other hand rainfall events increase the water content of the shallow soil which could act as a barrier to inhibit contaminated gas from diffusing into the atmosphere resulting in an increase in the soil gas concentration to facilitate our discussion we refer to the former as the dilution effect of rainwater and the latter the capping effect of rainwater to illustrate the dilution effect of rainwater we run the numerical model under the no diffusion condition i e d g c 0 note that this scenario is hypothetical fig 5 shows the time varying soil moisture and soil gas concentration at the exterior locations point a b and c in such a hypothetical scenario with the rainfall intensity q rain of 4 mm h and the rainfall duration of 24 h in the shallow soil it can be seen from fig 5 a1 and 5 a2 that the water content increases during the raining period and decreases after raining the soil gas concentration drops sharply during the raining period and barely increases after raining this is because there exists mass transfer from the soil gas phase into the clean rainwater due to the non equilibrium condition between the two phases in the mid depth soil i e point b as can be seen from fig 5 b1 and 5 b2 the soil moisture contents hardly change during the raining period but increase after raining while the soil gas concentration decreases slightly during and after the raining period in the deep soil i e point c as can be seen from fig 5 c1 and 5 c2 the soil moisture contents keep constant during the first week since raining while the variation of the soil gas concentration is similar to that in the mid depth soil after analyzing the flow field of gas and water not shown here we find that a small amount of shallow gas is pushed into the deeper soil by rainwater and mixed with deeper soil gas leading to a decrease in the soil gas concentration at point b and c in previous numerical studies grifoll and cohen 1996 shen et al 2012 it was assumed that the velocity of soil gas is the inverse of the velocity of soil water and therefore the flow equations can be simplified this assumption indicates that the volume of soil gas escapes from the soil is equal to the volume of rainwater our simulation results support this assumption because the effect of the shallow gas downflow is not significant however this assumption may not be appropriate for cases under the surface ponding condition where soil gas is more likely to be pushed into the deep soil rather than escaping from the soil surface 3 4 scenarios with different single rainfall events to compare the response of the soil gas concentration to different rainfall conditions with a large amount of rainwater three rainfall events are considered in our simulation 2 mm h light rainfall for 24 h duration 4 mm h moderate rainfall for 24 h duration and 24 mm h heavy rainfall for 4 h duration it is worth mentioning that the former two rainfall events keep the same duration of rainfall while the latter two rainfall events keep the same total amount of rainwater the rainfall intensity is classified according to llasat 2001 although the former two rainfall events are classified respectively as light rainfall and moderate rainfall they still contain sufficient rainwater due to the relatively long rainfall duration 3 4 1 effect on exterior soil gas concentration fig 6 shows the variation of the water content and exterior soil gas concentration under three rainfall events at different depths where the dashed line refers to the end time of the first two cases i e 2 mm h for 24 h and 4 mm h for 24 h and the dash dotted line refers to the end time of the last case 24 mm h for 4 h as can be seen from the left panel the wetting front propagates faster for the case with a larger rainfall intensity moreover the impact of rainfall events on the soil gas concentration decreases significantly with increasing soil depth indicating that it would be not appropriate for practitioners to measure the shallow soil gas concentration after the rainfall event in the shallow soil i e point a the water content increases during the raining period and decreases after raining see fig 6 a1 a higher increment rate during the raining period occurs in the case with a higher rainfall intensity as shown in fig 6 a2 the soil gas concentration varies significantly with the rainfall intensity during the raining period the soil gas concentration continuously increases for the rainfall intensity of 2 mm h light rainfall first increases and then decreases for the rainfall intensity of 4 mm h moderate rainfall and continuously decreases for the rainfall intensity of 24 mm h heavy rainfall respectively these results illustrate that the soil gas concentration during the raining period is dominated by the capping effect for a light rainfall event and dominated by the dilution effect for a heavy rainfall event when the rainfall event is moderate the soil gas concentration during the raining period is initially controlled by the capping effect and then by the dilution effect immediately after the raining period the soil gas concentration in the shallow soil increases in all cases this is because that a large amount of deep soil gas with a high contaminant concentration moves upward due to rainwater infiltration resulting in the increase of the soil gas concentration and the decrease of the water content in the mid depth soil i e point b as shown in fig 6 b1 the soil water content increases slightly after the rainfall event in all cases and increases faster in the case with a higher rainfall intensity as for the soil gas concentration three rainfall events show the similar trend see fig 6 b2 specifically the soil gas concentration decreases slightly during the raining period due to the push effect of rainwater and then gradually increases after the raining event due to the capping effect moreover it is found that the changes of the soil gas concentration in the two cases with the same total amount of rainwater are quite similar this phenomenon suggests that the total amount of rainwater plays a significant role in the soil gas concentration of the mid depth soil more amount of rainwater represents a stronger capping effect and hence a higher total amount of rainwater results in a higher soil gas concentration in the deep soil i e point c the soil moisture content remains the same in all cases during the simulation time while the soil gas concentration decreases slightly in all cases see fig 6 c1 and 6 c2 since a small amount of shallow gas with the lower concentration is pushed into the deeper soil by the infiltration water 3 4 2 effect on sub slab soil gas concentration fig 7 shows the variation of the soil gas concentration under the edge of the foundation slab i e point d in response to three rainfall events it can be seen that the variation trend of the sub slab soil gas concentration is similar to that of the exterior location at the same depth see fig 6 b2 the sub slab soil gas concentration in all three cases decreases during the raining period and increases after raining however the difference of the rainfall induced variation of soil gas concentrations between the sub slab and exterior locations exists in specific during the raining period the sub slab soil gas concentration decreases more significantly than the exterior soil gas concentration at point b according to the gas velocity field not shown here the gas pushed into the deep soil by rainwater tends to transport laterally this is partly due to the relatively low soil gas pressure under the building foundation induced by the indoor air depressurization which results in the lateral transport of external soil gas to the foundation crack and a more significant decrease in the sub slab soil gas concentration the similar phenomenon has been observed in previous simulation results presented by pennell et al 2009 yao et al 2020 also mentioned that the pressure distribution in the sub foundation zone can be significantly heterogeneous another difference is the degree of increase in the soil gas concentration during 7 days since raining between the two locations i e point b and d taking the rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h as an example the sub slab soil gas concentration of point d increases by about 4 from 0 098 to 0 102 at the end of simulation time 7 days while the exterior soil gas concentration of point b increases by about 10 from 0 048 to 0 053 during the same period the differences in the incrementratio of the soil gas concentration between the two sampling points in response to the rainfall event may lead to a biased estimation of the indoor vapor intrusion risk through the measurements of the exterior soil gas concentration 3 4 3 simulated vs estimated sub slab soil gas concentration previous studies have given an analytical method to estimate the sub slab soil gas concentration based on the exterior soil gas sampling yao et al 2012 2014 written as 2 c ss m c e where c ss is the sub slab soil gas concentration estimated by the exterior soil gas concentration ce at the same depth and m is the correction factor and can be derived analytically yao et al 2012 yao et al 2014 to avoid the errors resulting from the analytical calculation of m m is determined in our study based on the simulated results of c ss and c e under the initial steady state condition i e m c ss c e fig 8 shows the variation of simulated and estimated sub slab soil gas concentration in response to a rainfall event the simulated sub slab soil gas concentration is obtained from point d while the estimated sub slab soil gas concentration is calculated from eq 2 where ce is the simulated exterior soil gas concentration at point b m is obtained by c ss c e 2 0338 it is found that the impact of a single rainfall event on the soil gas concentration can last for a very long time if evapotranspiration is not considered both simulated and estimated sub slab soil gas concentrations in three cases increase continuously in the first month after the rainfall event and then decrease it is clearly shown that estimated sub slab soil gas concentration is larger than the simulated one during a period of several months after a significant rainfall event suggesting that using the exterior soil gas sampling could lead to the overestimation of the indoor vapor intrusion risk moreover both simulated and estimated sub slab soil gas concentrations of two cases with the same amount of rainwater i e 4 mm h for 24 h and 24 mm h for 4 h show very similar trends confirming that the total amount of rainwater controls the mid depth soil gas concentration fig 9 shows the transient water saturation distribution and the soil water darcy velocity where a rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h is considered it is clearly shown that the rainwater forms a water lens on the exterior soil of the concerned building in the first 30 days then the water lens disappears gradually as the soil water infiltrates downward while the sub foundation zone remains relatively dry it is interesting that the soil gas concentration has not returned to the initial condition after one year indicating that without the consideration of evapotranspiration the rainfall event with a large amount of rainwater plays a significant role in the long term change of the soil gas concentration as mentioned above the rainfall induced increment rate of the soil gas concentration in the sub slab zone is lower than that in the exterior zone taking the rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h as an example the sub slab soil gas concentration increases by 13 about 30 days after the rainfall event while the exterior soil gas concentration increases by 24 during the same period the higher increase of the soil gas concentration in the exterior location can lead to an overestimation of the sub slab soil gas concentration and the risk of indoor vapor intrusion if only exterior soil gas sampling is adopted this is consistent with the epa s recommendation that the worst scenario may be provided if the gas concentration is measured after a significant rainfall event usepa 2012b the epa also point out that creating a clean water lens in groundwater may trap the contaminant vapor and reduce the risk of vapor intrusion however our simulation results show that a contrary phenomenon is observed that is the risk of vapor intrusion could be enhanced when a relatively clean water lens is formed in the shallow soil and serves as a barrier to prevent soil gas entering the atmosphere 3 5 scenarios with different soil types since the process of rainfall infiltration depends significantly on soil permeability it is necessary to evaluate the impact of the soil type on the change of the soil gas concentration caused by the rainfall event here we select five soil types silt loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand covering a wide range of representative permeability conditions soil parameters of these soil types taken from the soil database compiled by carsel and parrish 1988 are summarized in table 3 the moderate rainfall event 4 mm h for 24 h is adopted for all cases all simulations are run from the first two steps to establish the initial water content and soil gas concentration for each soil texture fig 10 shows the variation of the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentrations in response of a rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h for five different soil types including silt loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand it is shown that for a given soil texture the variation trends of the sub slab and exterior soil gas concentrations are quite similar for soils with relatively small permeability such as silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam the rainfall event mainly exerts the capping effect on the soil gas concentration resulting in the increase of the soil gas concentration the speed of the increase in the soil gas concentration highly depends on the soil type and a more permeable soil leads to a smaller period of the increase i e a faster increase the times needed to reach the maximum value of the soil gas concentration are about 1 2 and 5 months for sandy loam sandy clay loam and silt loam respectively after reaching the maximum soil gas concentration the concentration slowly approaches the steady state value it is shown in fig 10 that the response timescale of the soil gas concentration to the rainfall event is larger for a soil type with less permeability in specific the response timescales are larger than 1 year for silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam and about 5 and 2 months for loamy sand and sand respectively in reality however the recovery timescale may be greatly reduced due to the evapotranspiration effect which is not considered in our study for relatively permeable soil types loamy sand and sand it is interesting that the soil gas concentration first increases sharply to reach the maximum after 7 days for loamy sand and 2 days for sand then decreases quickly to a value that is less than the initial concentration and is eventually recovered to the initial value see fig 10 d1 10 d2 10 e1 and 10 e2 this indicates that for these two high permeability soil types rainfall infiltration initially produces the capping effect followed by the dilution effect on the soil gas concentration to evaluate the rainfall induced biased estimation of the indoor vapor intrusion through exterior soil gas sampling we explore the ratio of the simulated sub slab soil gas concentration to the estimated value i e the value calculated from eq 2 the ratio greater and smaller than 1 represents respectively the underestimation and overestimation of the sub slab soil gas concentration through exterior soil gas sampling simulation results show that correction factors m for silt loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand are 2 3287 2 3368 2 0338 1 9311 and 1 9331 respectively fig 11 shows the influence of soil types on the ratio between the simulated and estimated sub slab soil gas concentration as shown all ratios equal to 1 at the initial condition i e without the rainfall effect during the rainfall event the ratios of all five soil types tend to decrease despite that the extent of the decrease is not significant after raining all ratios first decrease and then increase while the times of rebounding are different the ratio of the soil type with higher permeability rebounds earlier the rebounding times of the ratio are 2 days 6 days 21 days 49 days and 150 days for sand loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam and silt loam respectively moreover for the soil types with high permeability such as sandy loam loamy sand and sand the ratio can rebound to be larger than 1 during the simulation time i e 1 year indicating that the sub slab soil gas concentration can be underestimated through exterior soil gas sampling the periods of overestimation i e c ss c ss 1 and underestimation i e c s s c s s 1 are 147 days and 218 days for sandy loam 14 days and 180 days for loamy sand and 2 days and 89 days for sand respectively it is found that the soil type of sand can yield a maximum underestimation error of 12 when using exterior soil gas sampling to estimate the sub slab soil gas concentration for the soil types of relatively low permeability i e silt loam and sandy clay loam however the ratio is always less than 1 indicating that an overestimation occurs during the simulation time i e 1 year the maximum overestimation error of 8 is found in these cases 4 conclusion in this study we employ a 2 d two phase flow numerical model to simulate the temporal variations of soil gas concentrations at different depths in response to a single rainfall event the influence of rainwater on the soil gas concentration is mainly reflected in two aspects on one hand clean rainwater is mixed with soil water which reduces the soil water concentration due to dilution and at the same time the soil gas concentration is reduced due to mass transfer between the two phases on the other hand rainwater increases the moisture content of the shallow soil and inhibits the diffusion of contaminant vapors into the atmosphere leading to an increase in the soil gas concentration assuming the soil type of sandy loam it is found that the variation of the shallow and mid depth soil gas concentration depends respectively on the rainfall intensity and the total amount of rainwater however the deep soil gas concentration is found insensitive to a rainfall event moreover the response timescale of the soil gas concentration to a rainfall event is highly dependent on the soil texture and larger for a soil type with lower permeability considering a rainfall event with the intensity of 4 mm h and the duration of 24 h the response timescales of the soil gas concentration at a depth of 2 m below the ground surface are larger than 1 year for silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam and about 5 and 2 months for loamy sand and sand respectively where evapotranspiration is not considered importantly the rainfall event may lead to a biased estimation of the sub slab soil gas concentration through exterior soil gas sampling for high permeability soil types such as sandy loam loamy sand and sand soil gas sampling results in first an overestimation and then an underestimation by contrast for low permeability soil types such as silt loam and sandy clay loam only the overestimation is found during the simulation time furthermore it is found that rainfall infiltration in sand soil can yield a maximum underestimation error of 12 while a maximum overestimation error of 8 is found in the soil types of silt loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam in conclusion the temporal response of the soil gas concentration to rainfall events varies greatly with the rainfall intensity soil depth location and soil type special attention should be paid to the rainfall event when using exterior soil gas sampling to estimate the indoor vapor intrusion risk despite that our study is based on a simplified conceptual model the findings obtained in this study can offer important implications for practitioners to assess the indoor vapor intrusion through exterior soil gas sampling under the effect of rainfall events future work is required to explore other coupling effects such as evapotranspiration soil permeability heterogeneity temperature variations barometric fluctuations and water table fluctuations in addition the effects of multiple rainfall events are worthy of being

3992,climate change and riparian management are major drivers of hydrological change with important implications for nutrient fluxes in lowland streams however the coupling of hydrological and nutrient dynamics is complex due to time variant flow paths interacting biogeochemical processes and variation in land use fertilization levels and management measures here we assessed the long term 30 year changes in climate discharge groundwater levels and stream water quality in a mixed land use catchment demnitzer mill creek catchment dmc in northern germany the catchment was subject to wetland restoration and subsequent beaver castor fiber recolonization over the last 15 years climatic variability is the primary driver of the hydrological regime with discharge and groundwater variations closely coupled to increases in annual air temperature and fluctuations of annual rainfall over the past 8 years stream flows have been greatly reduced during a prolonged drought period meanwhile beaver dams have also moderated flow regimes and facilitated groundwater recharge in terms of water quality regimes the concentration discharge c q relationship for nitrate no3 n and soluble reactive phosphate srp showed positive and negative chemodynamic behavior respectively whilst dissolved organic carbon doc exhibited chemostatic behavior these differences were dictated by the intrinsic properties of each solute in terms of contrasting catchment storage and immobilization processes moreover the changing hydrological conditions regulated such patterns and strengthened the c q relationships for nutrients during the drought as an integrated result of drought and wetland restoration nutrient concentrations and fluxes in stream water have been reduced in recent years

therefore further process based analysis is essential for a better understanding of climate and management effects on hydrochemical processes and their dynamics here we focussed on a long term monitoring site in ne germany the demnitzer mill creek dmc catchment in brandenburg germany is a lowland mixed land use catchment that is representative of the wider agricultural landscapes of the northern european plain in order to assess long term characteristics of hydroclimatic change and the associated implications for nutrient dynamics we analyzed dmc long term data sets that stretch back to the early 1990 s when an ecohydrological observatory was established to examine nutrient export from a mixed agricultural landscape smith et al 2020 the catchment has been historically drained for cultivation since 1990 n and p fertilization have been reduced probably by around 30 cf kirschke et al 2020 moreover pro active riparian management with wetland restoration circa 2000 and beaver recolonization circa 2007 has also occurred enhancing biodiversity and aiding nutrient retention smith et al 2020 these measures have resulted in a change in the hydrological regime such as elevated groundwater levels and more moderated flow regimes however they also coincided with increased drought conditions in both winter and summer in recent years kleine et al 2020 in the paper we explore the role of climatic variability and riparian management in catchment hydrological and no3 n cycling over a 30 year period the specific aims are 1 to characterize the long term hydroclimate variability 2 to understand how this has influenced catchment runoff processes in the context of changing riparian land management 3 to understand what the implications of these changes are for the spatiotemporal

catchment local fertilizer amounts are not available but n and p applications for germany have been reducing by 10 per decade kirschke et al 2020 forestry conifer broadleaved and mixed is also important and percentage cover increases downstream dominating the southern catchment and accounting for 36 of the total area fig 1 there are 5000 residents living in several dispersed settlements in the catchment with a single wastewater treatment facility in the nw the nutrient contribution to stream water from these areas only 2 of the catchment is negligible due to the low population and effective sewage treatment smith et al 2020 the local hydrogeology and aquifer structure reflect extensive accumulation of sediments at the end of the last glaciation 10000 15000 years bp gelbrecht et al 2005 in the north the catchment is dominated by unconsolidated till with intermittent peat fens distributed along the river fig 1b glacial fluvial deposits dominate the mid and southern parts giving rise to sandy soils which coincide with the forestry an extensive riparian wetland area 1 73 km2 dominated by minerotrophic peat is located in the mid lowland region the southernmost part of the catchment near the outlet is dominated by a glacial valley where the channel drains into the river spree via a small lake at berkenbrück fig 1a the major soils are silty brown earths which cover 73 3 of the catchment and are associated with tills in the north fig 1c the middle lowland region of the catchment apart from the central wetland is underlain by brown podzolic soils the wetland and riparian zones are covered and fringed by sandy peats and peaty gleys the hydrological regime of dmc has been greatly altered as major artificial drainage networks were established since the 18th century gücker et al 2006 artificial connections of glacial hollows expanded the stream network increasing channel length from 20 to 88 km and creating a larger cross sectional channel profile nützmann et al 2011 the main channel network was straightened deepened and partly constrained by fascines water was drained from the central wetland resulting in lower groundwater levels and peatland degradation gelbrecht et al 1996 drainage maintenance ceased in 1990 and the effectiveness of tile drainage was gradually reduced with a re naturalization of the channel properties in 2000 more proactive measures were taken towards the restoration of the central wetland including excavation of backwaters connected to the main channel installation of in channel bunds and reprofiling the incised channel following this increase in water storage vegetation flourished on the bunds leading to further flow attenuation and enhanced wetland regeneration smith et al 2020 after restoration recolonization by beavers castor fiber was observed in dmc during 2007 2008 the beavers rapidly repopulated the channel network and progressed from the catchment outlet to the restored wetland in 1 year the beaver dams are generally constructed in the deep incised channels with a channel width ranging from 1 to 3 m once established the inundated area behind the beaver dam can exceed 100 m2 smith et al 2020 3 data and methods 3 1 hydroclimatic data daily precipitation and air temperature data were obtained from the german weather service deutscher wetterdienst dwd measured at the müncheberg weather station located 9 5 km nw of dmc two discharge gauges were established at demnitz mill and berkenbrück fig 1a table a1 water height at demnitz mill was manually recorded until 2001 when a pressure transducer was installed from then onwards data were recorded hourly until 2007 and every three hours after 2010 daily stream water levels at berkenbrück have been recorded since 1982 by the brandenburg state department for the environment lfu bb and landesamt für umwelt 2019 using pressure transducers water levels were translated into discharge via rating curves developed using regular manual stream gauging throughout the period of data collection further four riparian groundwater wells in the middle sections in dmc see fig 1a monitored groundwater levels from 2001 3 2 water quality measurement stream water sampling was conducted between 1992 and 2019 at the entrance peat north and outlet of the central wetland peat south the discharge gauge demnitz mill and the outlet of dmc berkenbrück fig 1a table a1 the number of samples are 423 390 906 and 385 respectively the sampling frequency is weekly at demnitz mill while at other sites there are several prolonged data gaps due to restrictions in funding availability despite these limitations this gives an extensive long term data set for inferring changes over a prolonged period stream water was collected in 1000 ml bottles and transported to the lab for same day processing and analyses analyses generally followed the methods of the german institute for standardization din 2019 total phosphorus tp was determined in homogenized original samples by molybdenum blue spectroscopy after wet digestion with h2o2 h2so4 precision 5 soluble reactive phosphorus srp was measured in filtered 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane samples by the same method after filtration precision 3 until 2018 after 2018 srp together with nitrate nitrogen no3 n was analyzed in filtered and acidified 2 m hcl samples by flow segmented analysis skalar san seal aa3 dissolved organic carbon doc was measured in filtered samples by infrared spectrometry after high temperature oxidation shimadzu toc v and l precision 3 the normalized chemical fluxes f were calculated based on concentration c discharge q and sub catchment area a 1 f c q a 3 3 data analysis 3 3 1 standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi is a common index used to characterize meteorological droughts the cumulative probability of precipitation is drawn from a gamma cumulative distribution function gamma cdf the standard normal variate z score determined by inverse standard normal cdf for precipitation data is termed as spi the python package climate indices was used to realize spi calculations using monthly average precipitation from the nearest weather station müncheberg adams 2017 table a1 the aggregated timescales were set as 3 6 12 and 24 months which represent time spans indicating short term soil moisture deficits to long term subsurface storage changes all indices spi 3 spi 6 spi 12 spi 24 were categorized according to the classification described by the world meteorological organization wmo 2012 the spi 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 denote wet very wet and extreme wet conditions while those less than 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 means dry very dry and extreme dry conditions respectively 3 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall rank correlation detects monotonic trends in climatic studies kendall 1938 together with the theil sen slope algorithm for trend slope estimation sen 1968 both methods were applied with annual climate data and average values during the growing april september and winter season october to march next year table a1 three indices mk statistics kendall s t and z given by the mann kendall test describe the monotonic relationship between air temperature precipitation and time while z gives the significance the null hypothesis was tested at 95 confidence level for both temperature and precipitation with a trend significant when z 1 96 3 3 3 concentration discharge relationships a commonly used metric to define concentration discharge c q relationships uses the direction and magnitude of their co variation which generally based on a power law relationship between concentration and discharge 2 lnc l n a b l n q γ l n w with a b and γ are constants with concentration c discharge q and random error w the slope b indicates whether the relationships between discharge is positive or negative godsey et al 2009 defined chemostatic behavior as b 0 however concentration can be independent and highly variable from discharge when b 0 but γ is high therefore the ratio of the coefficients of variation of concentration and discharge has been introduced cv ratio thompson et al 2011 3 cv c cv q μ q σ c μ c σ q with the coefficient of variance for concentration cv c the coefficient of variance for discharge cv q the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of concentration µc σc and the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of discharge µq and σq lower cv ratios mean that the concentration behaves more chemostatic compared to discharge according to previous studies musolff et al 2015 rose et al 2018 a chemostatic or chemodynamic behavior is defined as cv ratio 0 5 or 0 5 respectively 3 3 4 detection and classification of runoff events the detection of runoff events was realized with an r script based on algorithmic peak selection zhang et al 2020 the inputs consisted of sub daily discharge t threshold temporal range for events detection and d threshold the minimum maximum limit of peak trough hourly and 3 hourly discharge time series were resampled to 4 hourly resolution we then calculated the maxima and minima within the t threshold the peak and trough were defined as the maxima and minimum values higher and lower than the d threshold respectively to determine the start and end of runoff events the difference of every peak and trough was calculated to arrange a matrix number of peaks trough the rising and recession periods were then determined as the minima of positive values and maxima of negative values of the differences the t threshold and d threshold were set as 7 d and 1 m3 s and the start and end of events were manually checked and adjusted to ensure the selected events were realistic to note is that the period with two or more intermittent rainfall events and high discharge in between was regarded as a continuous runoff event every detected event was operationally categorized as a high flow medium flow or low flow event depending on whether the respective maxima of the specific event discharge was 1 0 m3 s between 0 2 and 1 0 m3 s or 0 2 m3 s for the intuitive visualization of multi events the increasing ratio between every time step 4 h was calculated according to 4 i n c r e a s i n g r a t i o q t q t 4 h q t the increasing ratios of all the events were plotted as heatmap which provided intuitive visualization of hydrological responses during the storm events a data classification method was also applied in order to categorize the nutrient and doc data by flow classes pionke et al 1999 samples taken during a the rising limb peak or the first 4 h recession of a storm hydrograph b post storm drainage periods in the hydrograph recession or c stable non stormflows e g high discharge in winter season were classified as stormflows elevated baseflows and baseflows respectively a python script was developed to realize the classification https github com songjun wu event classification 4 results 4 1 hydroclimate variability over a 30 years period a gradual but significant increase in annual air temperature of 1 2 was observed over the past 30 years at dmc fig 2 with a rate of increase of 0 05 y in the growing season table 2 this increasing trend was also reflected in the elevated number of cumulative days with mean daily temperature per year above 15 20 or 25 with 111 37 or 4 days after 2013 compared to 100 30 or 2 days before respectively fig a1a no significant increase was detected in winter although there was an increase of winter temperature after 2013 fig 2b no monotonic trend in precipitation was found in either season table 2 or in event sizes fig a1c d instead precipitation was characterized by pronounced inter annual variability fig 2c d periodic transitions between wet spi 0 and dry periods spi 0 were observed before 2008 fig 3 such transitions generally took 1 5 2 5 years using the spi calculated from a 24 months window which is commonly used as a period for assessing long term reservoir storage and groundwater recharge guttman 1999 the main wet periods were 1993 1995 2002 2004 while the main dry periods were 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2007 since 2008 a prolonged wet period with high spi values lasted almost four years fig 3 the average spi 24 reached 1 76 indicating very wet conditions according to the spi drought categories wmo 2012 after that we have seen a 7 year dry period since 2012 there was a short re wetting period over the winter of 2017 2018 however the spi 24 remained 0 and the average value during 2013 2019 was still negative 0 67 4 2 hydrological response to variability in climate and water management the dmc has a strongly seasonal groundwater dominated flow regime with annual high flows being almost exclusively in winter fig 4 there were strong differences between the two monitoring sites with average daily flows of 0 13 and 0 08 m3 s at demnitz mill and berkenbrück respectively fig 4 and fig a2 the decrease in downstream discharge was significant in different seasons as discharge at demnitz mill was 1 53 1 84 times of that at berkenbrück in growing winter season respectively annual discharge is positively correlated p 0 05 with annual rainfall and long term patterns of discharge are generally aligned with precipitation with regular transitions 4 years between low flow and high flow periods before 2008 and prolonged high and low flow periods during 2008 2011 and post 2012 fig 4 high flow periods before 2008 1994 1995 2002 2003 reflected the high precipitation inputs but with 6 to 12 month time lags indicated by the spi 24 in the subsequent prolonged wet period 2008 2011 discharge increased with an average of 0 56 m3 s in the winter at demnitz mill 3 16 times higher than the long term average demnitz and berkenbrück also reached their recorded maxima of winter discharge in 2011 however subsequently a near continuous decrease of discharge was observed with a low flow period continuing into 2019 fig 4 flow duration curves also show pronounced sensitivity of flow regimes to wetness conditions at demnitz mill fig 5 occurrence of high 2 5 exceedance q 1 m3 s and medium flows 30 4 exceedance 0 2 q 1 m3 s were greatest during the long wet period 2008 2012 in the prolonged dry period 2013 2019 there were no high flows only a short spell of medium flows 11 6 exceedance and longer periods of flow cessation 19 8 of the time the lack of high flows during dry period further resulted in a decrease in cvq while highest cvq was found in wet period table a3 this long term variability was also evident in runoff coefficients fig a2 the groundwater levels generally aligned with the discharge at demnitz mill at an annual scale p 0 05 however the correlations with annual precipitation differed between sites mainly dependent on the distance to central wetland the annual average of groundwater level at gw8 closely correlated to the annual precipitation p 0 05 fig 6 while at other sites gw3 5 7 within the central wetland the groundwater levels were more independent to inter annual wetness conditions before 2008 groundwater at all sites mainly fluctuated annually with no clear monotonic trend table 2 and the inter annual variability in recharge was controlled by precipitation since 2008 less marked variability and weaker relationships with rainfall were found at sites gw 3 5 7 coinciding with the wetter period but also beaver recolonization together with a significant increase of average groundwater levels by 0 29 0 60 m in 2011 fig 6 this effect was most marked in the growing season with an average increase of 0 5 0 8 m and is consistent with increased recharge from beaver impacted areas for event analysis at demnitz mill fig 7 runoff events with medium flow were the most common 62 4 and no high flow events have occurred since 2011 much shorter rising limbs were found in runoff events in the recent dry period since 2013 with an average rising limb lasting 2 3 days compared to 3 7 days before a similar reduction of the recession limb to 2 8 days was also observed during 2013 14 but this was followed by the recovery back to the long term average 3 8 days since 2015 4 3 spatio temporal variability of nutrient and doc concentrations interpreting the water quality data is constrained by differences in sampling times between sites fig a3 however continuity of data from demnitz mill and periods of overlap from other sites allow identification of some notable changes in general nutrients showed downstream decreases peat north peat south demnitz mill berkenbrück fig 8 tp srp and no3 n concentrations respectively decreased on average by 42 56 and 58 from peat north to berkenbrück strongest decreases 40 of tp srp and no3 n concentrations were found in the central wetland between peat north and peat south in contrast doc increased downstream which mostly occurred in the wetland with concentrations increasing by 60 between peat north and peat south over the longer term a moderate declining trend of soluble fertilizer derived nutrients was observed fig 8 fig a3 with annual average of srp and no3 n concentrations at the four sites decreased by 10 8 24 3 in 2017 2019 compared to 1992 1999 the inter annual dynamics of no3 n concentrations were generally positively correlated to precipitation with peaks observed in wet years 1994 1998 2002 2010 and 2017 fig a3 in contrast phosphorus dynamics were relatively independent to annual precipitation with moderately negative but non significant correlation an exception was found immediately after the wetland restoration in 2000 when all nutrients increased between 2000 and 2007 the concentration of no3 n at the four sites increased by an average of 17 compared to 1992 1999 this increase was mainly in the north of the catchment at peat north and south while 23 29 decreases were observed at the downstream sites similarly tp and srp at all four sites increased by 13 0 and 22 5 on average after restoration however in contrast to no3 n which increased at both the entrance and the outlet of central wetland a slight decrease of srp 3 1 and stable tp 0 0 were found at peat north doc concentrations increased after restoration by 58 42 and 58 1992 2000 at peat south demnitz mill and berkenbrück respectively while the increase was only 4 5 at peat north 4 4 hydrochemical relationships the interpretation of c q relationships was limited by the weekly resolution of nutrient time series as shorter time scale responses of specific runoff events over a few days cannot be well characterised however as the response dynamics of the catchment are attenuated such events involving relatively small transient flow increases are quite rare given the longevity of the time series general hydrological influences on concentrations could be inferred despite considerable scatter in the data fig 9 contrasting responsiveness to discharge was observed in different constituents using cv ratio as a metric fig 9 a d chemodynamic behavior was observed for srp tp and no3 n with average cv ratios at all sites varying between 0 72 and 0 87 during 1992 2019 see table a3 for details for doc the cv ratio was 0 23 indicating strongly chemostatic behavior the slope b also showed differences between constituents details in table a2 discharge and no3 n showed a positive relationships with an average slope b of 0 81 at all sites during 1992 2019 while slightly negative or no relationships were found between discharge and srp tp and doc with near zero slopes fig 9e f in terms of the spatial heterogeneity the most significant c q relationships for all solutes were found at peat south with average cv ratios and absolute slope b values all being the highest over whole sampling period 1990 2019 fig 9e f a slight increase in the cv ratio for doc was also found at peat south but the value remained near zero in contrast c q relationships at other sites showed more chemostatic behavior a significant decrease of absolute slope b for no3 n was observed at peat north which was only 31 5 44 3 of those at other sites temporal variations in chemical responsiveness were also evident fig 9e before the prolonged wet period and beaver recolonization i e 1992 2007 c q relationships were highly diverse from 1992 to 2007 cv ratios of srp and tp slightly increased at peat south while decreasing at other sites slope b however increased only at demnitz mill while decreasing at all other sites the cv ratios for no3 n consistently decreased at most sites with the only exception of increasing slope at demnitz mill in the prolonged wet period 2008 2012 cv ratios declined for all chemical parameters which was consistent with the decreasing slope b for no3 n however the negative c q relationships of srp and tp became stronger when the wetter period ended and the extended drought period started in 2013 significant shifts towards more chemodynamic regimes were found at all sites reflected by significantly elevated cv ratios 39 70 higher see tables a2 a3 this was mainly attributed to the elevated cvc as the decrease of cvq only ranged within 24 28 the stronger relationships between discharge and concentrations of no3 n were also reflected in the increase of absolute slope b at demnitz mill since 2013 in addition to these longer term changes seasonality effects were also evident fig 9f tables a2 a3 c q relationships of srp and tp became substantially weaker in the winter compared to the growing season reflected by the decreasing slopes at all sites in contrast the relationships of no3 n only decreased at peat south and demnitz mill while increased at the other sites no trend was found in slope b of seasonal doc distribution more specific event based separation of baseflows and storm flows table 3 showed that the average discharge was 2 54 times in storm events compared to baseflows despite the scatter in the c q plots looking at water quality data in relation to hydrograph classes revealed some of the likely subtler hydrological influences no3 n mobilization was enhanced under higher flows at all sites especially in winter with 43 higher concentrations in stormflows compared to baseflows table 3 moreover elevated no3 n remained high during the recession period with the concentration only decreasing by 12 8 in elevated baseflows in contrast storm driven export of phosphorus was relatively weak as tp and srp concentrations during storm events only increased by 11 2 and 10 4 from those in baseflows respectively the only exception was at peat north where srp and tp both significantly increased during storm events table 5 moreover significant declines of srp 34 1 and tp 26 2 occurred during recessions compared to increasing periods reduced concentrations of srp and tp in elevated baseflows were 18 and 27 lower than in baseflows in contrast limited storm drive enrichment of doc was observed although on average concentrations were 14 9 higher concentrations in stormflows than baseflows base flow concentrations remained high and highest absolute doc concentrations were found in elevated baseflows 4 5 nutrient and doc fluxes nutrient fluxes exhibited the same downstream decreasing trend as concentrations fluxes decreased on average by 83 tp 86 srp and 83 no3 n from peat north to berkenbrück fig 10 doc fluxes exhibited a lesser decrease 32 due to the elevated concentrations downstream of the wetland following restoration from a long term perspective dynamics in nutrient and doc fluxes were more closely aligned to long term discharge variations than concentrations this can be attributed to the much higher variability in discharge compared to nutrient concentrations table a3 the only exception was observed immediately after wetland restoration during which the increased nutrient fluxes were mainly explained by elevated concentrations by 2003 the average fluxes of tp srp and no3 n increased by 4 3 2 9 and 0 8 times compared to those in 1999 in the subsequent wet years 2008 2012 we saw a high flux period the average fluxes of tp srp no3 n and doc reached 0 09 0 05 4 36 and 8 79 kg km2 d at demnitz mill which were 1 7 1 5 1 7 2 8 times the long term average over 1992 2019 subsequently a low flux period established during the long dry period since 2013 with suppressed average tp srp and no3 n fluxes of 0 03 0 02 1 18 kg km2 d during 2013 2019 5 discussion 5 1 hydroclimatic variability climate change is impacting ecohydrological systems water supplies food security and human health in catchments around the world dai 2013 thornton et al 2014 during the past 30 years the air temperature increased 1 2 in dmc which is consistent with global warming trends cook et al 2013 hughes 2000 and exceeds the respective european average of 1 moberg et al 2006 similar to other studies hisdal et al 2001 meehl et al 2007 wentz et al 2007 precipitation in dmc showed no clear trend but strong inter annual variability fig 3 interestingly a clustering tendency of wet and dry periods was observed since 2008 with a prolonged wet 2008 2012 and dry period since 2013 the latter resulted in a gradual drying pattern over the past 7 years and serious drought conditions in 2015 2016 and particularly 2018 such anomalies were also reported in other catchments in central europe garcía herrera et al 2019 hartick et al 2019 leach et al 2020 and may reflect the acceleration of a drying trend over the past century briffa et al 2009 further the frequency of more intense precipitation events also increased in recent summers compared to pre 2008 which is consistent with projected climate change over much of europe christensen and christensen 2004 van den besselaar et al 2013 zolina 2012 resulting from increased atmospheric moisture and higher temperature dankers and feyen 2008 this non stationarity in climate appeared to have moved dmc to drier and warmer conditions which has major implications for the catchment s hydrology and nutrient export 5 2 variability in stream flow response like much of northern germany döll and fiedler 2008 dmc is a groundwater dominated catchment with high infiltration and recharge and low surface runoff due to the dominant sandy soils the extensive glacial deposits near the outlet integrates the dmc with the regional groundwater system in the valley of the river spree resulting groundwater leakage in this area was simulated previously 4 mm month on average see smith et al 2021 and explains the lower discharge at berkenbrück longer term stream flow trends were driven by rainfall with a positive relationship between annual discharge and precipitation p 0 01 though the strong seasonality of streamflow is common in many catchments in western and central europe stahl et al 2010 the inter annual trend differed from the general longer term trends in germany concluded as decreasing in the growing season and increasing in winter season stahl et al 2010 instead the tendency of clustered wet and dry years in dmc reflecting slow changing mesoscale circulation in the atmosphere gillett et al 2003 dominates stream flow variation during the 2008 12 wet period significantly increased discharge and elevated groundwater levels were observed peaking in 2011 despite annual precipitation being similar to or less than other wet years e g 2002 and 2017 this highlights the importance of antecedent conditions on slower changes in catchment storage smith et al 2020 in the recent 7 year long dry period discharge and summer groundwater levels significantly decreased prolonged streamflow cessation was observed in three successive summers reflecting cumulative effects of low winter precipitation and greater evapotranspiration due to increasing temperatures smith et al 2020 the length of the drought also led to soil moisture deficits and lower groundwater recharge in winter kleine et al 2020 the moderately wetter year of 2017 was not sufficient to replenish water deficits as streamflow still ceased for 5 months in 2018 given this context it is notable that shorter rising limbs of hydrographs were observed since 2013 however the shortened rising limb here does not equate to a quicker discharge response when we focused on the events dominated by concentrated and intense rainfall 15 mm d to exclude the impacts from antecedent precipitation the average lag time between peak discharge and peak precipitation was similar before and after 2013 1 3 and 1 6 days respectively suggesting that discharge response time to intense rainfall events remained stable instead the shortened rising limbs were mostly observed in smaller rainfall events when the higher soil water deficit under drier conditions constrained stream recharge until it reached a threshold and then triggered a lagged response of rising limb such discharge thresholds were also found in previous studies rose et al 2018 underwood et al 2017 as being required to activate hydrologic connections between deeper groundwater and shallower subsurface flow paths similarly soil water deficits accelerated the streamflow recession during the prolonged drought since 2013 5 3 management effects on catchment hydrology the impacts from beaver activities on catchment hydrology was apparent riparian groundwater levels increased after recolonization consistent with the facilitated surface water leakage to groundwater aquifers and moderated surface runoff due to beaver dams shown in other studies e g hill and duval 2009 in contrast wetland restoration had only a minor impact on discharge and groundwater before 2007 this limited early effect may simply be attributed to the small wetland area 1 7 km2 as the size of restored areas is usually directly related to impacts martinez martinez et al 2014 however in recent dry years groundwater remained at a relatively high level in the restored wetland compared to earlier dry years e g 2003 we believe wetland restoration contributed to this phenomenon because the increase in groundwater levels was only observed in wells within the restored wetland gw3 5 7 in fig 5 such lagged response of riparian groundwater to restoration has been observed elsewhere and attributed to the memory effects of long term degradation and drainage holden et al 2011 5 4 nutrients and doc an overall downward trend of all nutrients concentrations was observed in dmc possibly driven by a decrease of fertilizer application following the changes in agricultural policy after german reunification ehrhardt et al 2019 however this overall trend had some variability reflecting the additional integrated effects of hydrologic and biogeochemical filtering of stochastic hydroclimatic forcing musolff et al 2017 here the three major controlling factors of solute behavior in dmc are considered 5 4 1 intrinsic characteristics and the catchment storage in dmc we saw contrasting behaviors of srp tp no3 n and doc showing respective moderate chemodynamic moderate chemodynamic and chemostatic behavior and different relationships with discharge negative positive and insignificant these distinct behaviors remained stable with little variation over the monitoring period reflecting that the response of a solute was primarily dictated by its intrinsic characteristics e g solubility reactivity and availability in catchment moatar et al 2017 for phosphorus the chemodynamic behavior in dmc has been observed in many catchments e g musolff et al 2015 as it is regarded as a highly reactive species with rapid in stream processing birgand et al 2007 these in stream effects which would have been enhanced by restoration effects e g redox dependent retention in wetlands are generally fast enough to mask mobilization by hydrological flow paths which leads to phosphorus being decoupled from discharge dependent variability thompson et al 2011 and showing strong spatial heterogeneities musolff et al 2015 rose et al 2018 in dmc we saw dilution patterns of both srp and tp which were similar to those reports in catchments with limited phosphorus storage and external inputs hoffmann et al 2012 given that phosphorus enrichment during storm events was most marked at peat north closest to arable land table 3 while dilution occurred at the other sites downstream dmc probably experiences source limitation of phosphorus in non agricultural areas in addition to retention in restored wetlands highest tp and srp concentrations tended to be in summer though fluxes were flow driven and highest in winter fig 10 and fig a4 considering the limited contribution from upstream due to the low discharge and from groundwater due to its low concentration table a4 the release from soils i e the dissolution of fe bound phosphorus under low redox conditions may play an important role in summer fig a3 in contrast no3 n responded positively to increasing discharge even under high flows which is consistent with the positive coupling of no3 n and discharge reported in some agricultural catchments kamjunke et al 2013 kyllmar et al 2006 such patterns in dmc were determined by the contrasting no3 n sources and storage in the agricultural north abundant and forested south limited under dry conditions streamflow in central wetland and forested area generally exhibited low concentration as it was mainly fed by deeper groundwater which was generally low in no3 n concentration table a4 in contrast rewetting of the catchment allowed greater no3 n transport via shallow subsurface flow paths or directly from upstream and resulted in higher concentrations it is important to emphasis that the observed behavior was closely related to the in situ land use the four sampling sites in our study are all located in wetland or forested areas thus it is possible that no3 n exhibited a more chemostatic behavior in intensively managed agricultural areas upstream of peat north in these northerly areas greater groundwater contamination and more extensive fertilizer applications may lead to constantly high concentrations such chemostatic behavior has been reported in many intensively managed catchments e g basu et al 2010 thompson et al 2011 though no direct evidence was available in dmc doc exhibited a typical chemostasis in dmc which has been observed in a broad range of catchments see general chemostatic behaviors derived from discharge doc slope in godsey et al 2019 this was probably attributed to the ubiquitous doc sources in organic soils especially after wetland restoration allowing doc to be mobilized proportionally to water fluxes and thus chemostatic behaviors bieroza et al 2018 rose et al 2018 although the doc pools were less spatially extensive than the geogenic solutes riparian wetlands which have been shown to be a dominating factor of doc export musolff et al 2018 zarnetske et al 2018 can still provide abundant source at all flows and result in the chemostatic behavior in dmc 5 4 2 changing hydroclimate climatic variability has a critical influence in regulating nutrient dynamics as it is a main driver for both the biogeochemical and hydrological processes which regulate nutrient cycling the close interactions between climate hydrology and nutrients have been widely demonstrated in both observation and modelling haygarth et al 2012 rozemeijer and broers 2007 yang et al 2018 here we investigated how hydroclimatic variability affected nutrient and doc dynamics in dmc at three different time scales inter annual annual and event scale over the longer term annual average of no3 n concentrations was significantly correlated to annual precipitation r 0 44 p 0 02 which is likely explained by distinct hydrologic connectivity regimes under the different wetness conditions bechtold et al 2003 jaeger et al 2014 underwood et al 2017 smith et al 2021 in dry years the nitrate transport to streams during events was likely limited to connected riparian areas while more extensive hydrological connectivity across the landscape during wet conditions allowed greater no3 n mobilization from more extensive areas of soil and shallow groundwater under arable land anderson et al 2014 lower in stream concentrations in dry years were also likely attributed to its greater accumulation in the soil due to limited hydrological transport such no3 n accumulation will lead to a higher potential of no3 n export in the following wet years bechtold et al 2003 bernal et al 2002 as no3 n in dmc increased in nearly every re wetting year after drier spells 1993 1994 2001 2002 2008 2011 2016 2017 phosphorus species showed less sensitivity to climate and negative non significant relationships with annual precipitation the dilution patterns were not only controlled by source limitation but also affected by changing pathways of hydrological transport studies in catchments with riparian wetlands have shown that when landscape connectivity is enhanced in wetter conditions contributions from phosphorus sources shift from the riparian zone generally high in phosphorus due to the low redox in shallow groundwater interacting with the organic soils to upslope areas generally with higher redox potential and lower phosphorus content due to less interaction between deeper groundwater and top soils dupas et al 2017 dupas et al 2018 such extended pathways may also lead to the phosphorus dilution in wet years in dmc though simple patterns are confounded by high reactivity climate also affected long term hydrochemical relationships as lower discharge not only decreases transport capacity but increases residence times smith et al 2021 this probably enhanced the relative importance of biogeochemical processes e g denitrification and assimilation which contributes to a steeper c q slope for no3 n and tp in drier years fig 9 moatar et al 2017 drier years also resulted in a tendency to increase chemodynamic behavior as the lack of high flows constrained the discharge variance table a3 while the concentration variance was enhanced probably due to the biogeochemical processes prior to the most recent drought period the general magnitude of nutrient concentration variations was not comparable to discharge variations similar to observations in other german catchments musolff et al 2015 this means that the nutrient fluxes were mainly dominated by discharge rather than concentrations however in the recent drought the relative influence of concentrations on instantaneous nutrient fluxes has increased e g the cv ratios of tp and srp ranged from 1 0 to 1 6 during 2013 2019 though the influence of flows on low annual export remains dominant fig 10 at the annual scale both srp and no3 n concentrations showed strong but opposing seasonality though fluxes of both were dominated by winter high flows this finding aligned with previous studies which showed the differential mobility of srp and no3 n in rewetting peats and fens cabezas et al 2013 zak et al 2010 in dmc srp release was dominant in the growing season which can be attributed to the supply of available phosphorus as mentioned above section 5 4 1 in contrast during the winter higher hydrological connectivity provided better transport capacity from no3 n rich soils and shallow groundwater upstream leading to higher no3 n concentrations in streamflow lin et al 2019 also the low capacity of denitrification oehler et al 2009 and concentrated release from snow pack during melting kincaid et al 2020 pellerin et al 2012 could potentially contribute to the no3 n peaks in winter but their effects are likely secondary although specific storm event sampling was limited the event classification of the scatter in weekly water quality datasets clearly showed the tendency of an increase in no3 n concentrations during storm events which was consistent with its long term behavior and underline again the hydrological transport as the primary controlling factor of no3 n dynamics in contrast tp and srp enrichments were observed during high flow samples which contrasts with their long term negative relationships with discharge this different behavior during specific events might be attributed to the dominant runoff sources abruptly shifting in a highly transient way from groundwater to surface runoff from saturated and compacted areas as pore waters stored in upper layers of soils become increasingly connected to the stream mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 however the phosphorus mobilization was limited to specific sites and seasons both seasons in peat north winter seasons in peat south and the highest values tended to be on the recession limbs rather than at storm peaks similar lags between peaks in discharge and phosphorus were observed in other studies which showed that during early storm phases discharge was primarily generated by deep groundwater flowpaths rather than shallow riparian areas of the development of saturated zones mclaughlin and kaplan 2013 sawyer et al 2014 thus constrained the phosphorus supply in the rising limb 5 4 3 impacts from restoration management and wider implication effects of restoration on nutrients like hydrological impacts were limited in the initial few years after intervention but accelerated after beaver recolonization no3 n concentrations during the re wetting year of 2017 were notably lower downstream of the wetland compared to previous re wetting years consistent with enhanced capacity for denitrification and nutrient retention hill and duval 2009 the enhanced mixing of sub surface and surface water over a larger inundated area as well as the more active carbon decomposition due to longer retention likely contributed to the significant doc enrichment in the wetland bossio et al 2006 westbrook et al 2020 coupled with climatic effects the changes to catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry will continue to increasingly impact water quality a major issue for nutrient dynamics is the lower rainfall and increased evapotranspiration which is combining with increased groundwater recharge in restored wetlands to reduce stream flows only with ongoing monitoring will we see if the streamflow regime shifts from perennial to ephemeral and overall reduced hydrological connectivity becomes permanent smith et al 2021 such conditions are likely given climate projections in such lowland headwater catchments and will have strong implications for habitat structure and biodiversity as well as water quality larned et al 2010 the next phase of work at dmc will seek to fuse the long term data sets considered here with models of catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry to fully understand the roles of climate change and riparian management on past and future hydrology and water quality this will have important implications for land and water management if greater catchment nutrient retention occurs as a result of reduced stream flows 6 conclusion we assessed the effects of climatic variability and wetland restoration on the response of streamflow and some solutes in the demnitzer mill creek dmc catchment annual temperature increased 1 2 in the past 30 years and a regular transition between wet and dry periods 2 3 years long was observed until a persistent run of drier years started in 2013 this climatic variability strongly influenced the catchment s hydrology with the recent drought leading to a decrease in discharge and groundwater levels as well as prolonged streamflow cessation and limited hydrological connectivity in three successive summers nutrient dynamics were primarily controlled by intrinsic solute characteristics given that srp no3 n and doc showed different behaviors as negative chemodynamic positive chemodynamic and chemostatic however hydroclimatic conditions also affected the nutrient variations with nitrate notably retained in dry years and mobilized in wet years phosphorus showed a more independent response to wetness conditions probably due to its high reactivity and source limitation doc showed increased mobilization with flooding of organic soils in wetland restoration riparian management played a critical role in modulating long term hydrological and nutrient variations both wetland restoration and beaver dams effectively increased the groundwater level since 2007 and limited its decrease in the recent drought a stronger nutrient retention was also observed in the restored wetland however there was a delay before the wetland restoration functioned effectively this integrated assessment of long term hydrology and water quality provided valuable context for understanding water and nutrient cycles under changing climate and

3992,climate change and riparian management are major drivers of hydrological change with important implications for nutrient fluxes in lowland streams however the coupling of hydrological and nutrient dynamics is complex due to time variant flow paths interacting biogeochemical processes and variation in land use fertilization levels and management measures here we assessed the long term 30 year changes in climate discharge groundwater levels and stream water quality in a mixed land use catchment demnitzer mill creek catchment dmc in northern germany the catchment was subject to wetland restoration and subsequent beaver castor fiber recolonization over the last 15 years climatic variability is the primary driver of the hydrological regime with discharge and groundwater variations closely coupled to increases in annual air temperature and fluctuations of annual rainfall over the past 8 years stream flows have been greatly reduced during a prolonged drought period meanwhile beaver dams have also moderated flow regimes and facilitated groundwater recharge in terms of water quality regimes the concentration discharge c q relationship for nitrate no3 n and soluble reactive phosphate srp showed positive and negative chemodynamic behavior respectively whilst dissolved organic carbon doc exhibited chemostatic behavior these differences were dictated by the intrinsic properties of each solute in terms of contrasting catchment storage and immobilization processes moreover the changing hydrological conditions regulated such patterns and strengthened the c q relationships for nutrients during the drought as an integrated result of drought and wetland restoration nutrient concentrations and fluxes in stream water have been reduced in recent years headwater catchments like dmc where much of the hydrochemical signature of larger downstream river networks are generated are critical observatories for integrating understanding of the linkages

enrichment from nitrogen and phosphorous in agricultural fertilizers is a widespread cause of pollution in both surface waters and groundwaters erisman et al 2011 over the past 60 years nutrient accumulation and storage in soils and groundwater have been characteristic of many agricultural catchments as a results of long term fertilizer surplus leip et al 2011 the long residence time of

associated with such long term pollution are well recognized vörösmarty et al 2010 climate change as a driver of hydrological change has important implications for future nutrient fluxes in lowland catchments nijssen et al 2001 most predictions for central europe project warmer drier summers and more intense precipitation events déqué et al 2005 madsen et al 2014 nikulin et al 2011 such long

and causing loss of agricultural production water shortages and low river flows over extensive areas imbery et al 2018 these droughts probably preview warmer drier conditions that climate change is expected to bring across central europe as the 21st century progresses nikulin et al 2011 climate change will also profoundly alter biogeochemical processes and nutrient fluxes through changes in

connectivity in catchments regulates the transfer of nutrients and other solutes from surface and near surface sources to ground water and stream waters pretty et al 2006 reduced connectivity during drier phases may retain nutrients longer in the soil and or increase groundwater contamination at the expense of short term surface water pollution in storm events further if droughts result in more frequent cessation of river flow reduced connectivity in the channel network is likely to entirely change the dynamics of nutrient export shanafield et al 2021 land and water management also affect hydrological and nutrient dynamics in agricultural landscapes many of which were drained historically saadat et al 2018 more recently wetland restoration smith et al 2020 nyssen et al 2011 has been applied in europe as part of environmental stewardship schemes that seek to maintain agricultural productivity whilst rehabilitating ecological functioning however the consequent changes in catchment flow paths are likely to affect biogeochemical cycling and nutrient transport darwiche criado et al 2017 evaluating the role of such anthropogenic changes and disentangling them from the impacts of climatic variability requires long term monitoring as many restoration projects take time before effects become apparent due to the memory of the initial disturbance and prolonged impacts holden et al 2011 where such long term data sets exist integrated studies of hydrology and hydrochemistry can provide insights into both the cycling of water and transport of dissolved solutes soulsby et al 2002 hydrological conditions exert a strong control on stream chemistry with the greatest changes in concentration and flux of nutrients in surface waters usually observed during storm events duncan et al 2017 knapp et al 2020 rode et al 2016 when stream discharge increases concentrations of solutes can either increase enrichment decrease dilution or remain stable chemostasis clow and mast 2010 godsey et al 2009 such relationships can be determined to some extent by the intrinsic characteristics e g solubility and reactivity of an individual solute basu et al 2010 moatar et al 2017 and its storage in the catchment musolff et al 2017 webster et al 2019 while some atmospherically derived and geogenic solutes cl mg2 na typically behave chemostatically in relation to flow botter et al 2020 nutrients like n and p show a high variability at different spatio temporal scales moatar et al 2017 this is attributed to the complex suite of factors involved including hydrological connectivity and associated biogeochemical processes musolff et al 2015 yang et al 2019 and their responsiveness to extrinsic factors including landscape connectivity seasonality timing of fertilizer applications use of organic or inorganic fertilizers etc fazekas et al 2020 li et al 2019 contrasting concentration discharge c q relationships of nutrients are thus common in different catchments basu et al 2010 moatar et al 2017 musolff et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 such relationship can also be temporally variable showing differences seasonally or inter annually within the same catchment zimmer et al 2019 therefore further process based analysis is essential for a better understanding of climate and management effects on hydrochemical processes and their dynamics here we focussed on a long term monitoring site in ne germany the demnitzer mill creek dmc catchment in brandenburg germany is a lowland mixed land use catchment that is representative of the wider agricultural landscapes of the northern european plain in order to assess long term characteristics of hydroclimatic change and the associated implications for nutrient dynamics we analyzed dmc long term data sets that stretch back to the early 1990 s when an ecohydrological observatory was established to examine nutrient export from a mixed agricultural landscape smith et al 2020 the catchment has been historically drained for cultivation since 1990 n and p fertilization have been reduced probably by around 30 cf kirschke et al 2020 moreover pro active riparian management with wetland restoration circa 2000 and beaver recolonization circa 2007 has also occurred enhancing biodiversity and aiding nutrient retention smith et al 2020 these measures have resulted in a change in the hydrological regime such as elevated groundwater levels and more moderated flow regimes however they also coincided with increased drought conditions in both winter and summer in recent years kleine et al 2020 in the paper we explore the role of climatic variability and riparian management in catchment hydrological and no3 n cycling over a 30 year period the specific aims are 1 to characterize the long term hydroclimate variability 2 to understand how this has influenced catchment runoff processes in the context of changing riparian land management 3 to understand what the implications of these changes are for the spatiotemporal variability of nutrient concentrations and fluxes 2 study site the dmc study site is 55 km se of berlin germany 52 23 n 14 15 e fig 1 the 66 km2 basin is a tributary of the river spree and is more generally typical of the extensive northern european plain the catchment is flat with an average slope of 2 table 1 the orientation is nne ssw along which elevation decreases from 83 to 38 m a s l annual precipitation at dmc is relatively low 569 mm year 1 summer rainfall is mainly in convective events some of which are high intensity exceeding 40 mm d in contrast the intensity of rainfall events is low in winter average 2 5 mm d though seasonal totals are similar average daily temperatures since 1990 are 0 2 and 19 c in january and july respectively dwd 2020 the annual potential evapotranspiration pet ranges from 650 to 700 mm year 1 1990 2019 as with other study sites in europe e g austria duethmann and blöschl 2018 and ireland stanhill and möller 2008 small increases in actual evapotranspiration have occurred at dmc over the past 30 years from 491 to 506 mm year 1 smith et al 2020 agriculture is the main catchment land use with over 60 used for arable farming and grazing fig 1a prior to 1990 fertilizer applications mostly n p and k were already extensive the scale has reduced slightly though application is still widespread in the northern parts of the catchment local fertilizer amounts are not available but n and p applications for germany have been reducing by 10 per decade kirschke et al 2020 forestry conifer broadleaved and mixed is also important and percentage cover increases downstream dominating the southern catchment and accounting for 36 of the total area fig 1 there are 5000 residents living in several dispersed settlements in the catchment with a single wastewater treatment facility in the nw the nutrient contribution to stream water from these areas only 2 of the catchment is negligible due to the low population and effective sewage treatment smith et al 2020 the local hydrogeology and aquifer structure reflect extensive accumulation of sediments at the end of the last glaciation 10000 15000 years bp gelbrecht et al 2005 in the north the catchment is dominated by unconsolidated till with intermittent peat fens distributed along the river fig 1b glacial fluvial deposits dominate the mid and southern parts giving rise to sandy soils which coincide with the forestry an extensive riparian wetland area 1 73 km2 dominated by minerotrophic peat is located in the mid lowland region the southernmost part of the catchment near the outlet is dominated by a glacial valley where the channel drains into the river spree via a small lake at berkenbrück fig 1a the major soils are silty brown earths which cover 73 3 of the catchment and are associated with tills in the north fig 1c the middle lowland region of the catchment apart from the central wetland is underlain by brown podzolic soils the wetland and riparian zones are covered and fringed by sandy peats and peaty gleys the hydrological regime of dmc has been greatly altered as major artificial drainage networks were established since the 18th century gücker et al 2006 artificial connections of glacial hollows expanded the stream network increasing channel length from 20 to 88 km and creating a larger cross sectional channel profile nützmann et al 2011 the main channel network was straightened deepened and partly constrained by fascines water was drained from the central wetland resulting in lower groundwater levels and peatland degradation gelbrecht et al 1996 drainage maintenance ceased in 1990 and the effectiveness of tile drainage was gradually reduced with a re naturalization of the channel properties in 2000 more proactive measures were taken towards the restoration of the central wetland including excavation of backwaters connected to the main channel installation of in channel bunds and reprofiling the incised channel following this increase in water storage vegetation flourished on the bunds leading to further flow attenuation and enhanced wetland regeneration smith et al 2020 after restoration recolonization by beavers castor fiber was observed in dmc during 2007 2008 the beavers rapidly repopulated the channel network and progressed from the catchment outlet to the restored wetland in 1 year the beaver dams are generally constructed in the deep incised channels with a channel width ranging from 1 to 3 m once established the inundated area behind the beaver dam can exceed 100 m2 smith et al 2020 3 data and methods 3 1 hydroclimatic data daily precipitation and air temperature data were obtained from the german weather service deutscher wetterdienst dwd measured at the müncheberg weather station located 9 5 km nw of dmc two discharge gauges were established at demnitz mill and berkenbrück fig 1a table a1 water height at demnitz mill was manually recorded until 2001 when a pressure transducer was installed from then onwards data were recorded hourly until 2007 and every three hours after 2010 daily stream water levels at berkenbrück have been recorded since 1982 by the brandenburg state department for the environment lfu bb and landesamt für umwelt 2019 using pressure transducers water levels were translated into discharge via rating curves developed using regular manual stream gauging throughout the period of data collection further four riparian groundwater wells in the middle sections in dmc see fig 1a monitored groundwater levels from 2001 3 2 water quality measurement stream water sampling was conducted between 1992 and 2019 at the entrance peat north and outlet of the central wetland peat south the discharge gauge demnitz mill and the outlet of dmc berkenbrück fig 1a table a1 the number of samples are 423 390 906 and 385 respectively the sampling frequency is weekly at demnitz mill while at other sites there are several prolonged data gaps due to restrictions in funding availability despite these limitations this gives an extensive long term data set for inferring changes over a prolonged period stream water was collected in 1000 ml bottles and transported to the lab for same day processing and analyses analyses generally followed the methods of the german institute for standardization din 2019 total phosphorus tp was determined in homogenized original samples by molybdenum blue spectroscopy after wet digestion with h2o2 h2so4 precision 5 soluble reactive phosphorus srp was measured in filtered 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane samples by the same method after filtration precision 3 until 2018 after 2018 srp together with nitrate nitrogen no3 n was analyzed in filtered and acidified 2 m hcl samples by flow segmented analysis skalar san seal aa3 dissolved organic carbon doc was measured in filtered samples by infrared spectrometry after high temperature oxidation shimadzu toc v and l precision 3 the normalized chemical fluxes f were calculated based on concentration c discharge q and sub catchment area a 1 f c q a 3 3 data analysis 3 3 1 standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi is a common index used to characterize meteorological droughts the cumulative probability of precipitation is drawn from a gamma cumulative distribution function gamma cdf the standard normal variate z score determined by inverse standard normal cdf for precipitation data is termed as spi the python package climate indices was used to realize spi calculations using monthly average precipitation from the nearest weather station müncheberg adams 2017 table a1 the aggregated timescales were set as 3 6 12 and 24 months which represent time spans indicating short term soil moisture deficits to long term subsurface storage changes all indices spi 3 spi 6 spi 12 spi 24 were categorized according to the classification described by the world meteorological organization wmo 2012 the spi 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 denote wet very wet and extreme wet conditions while those less than 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 means dry very dry and extreme dry conditions respectively 3 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall rank correlation detects monotonic trends in climatic studies kendall 1938 together with the theil sen slope algorithm for trend slope estimation sen 1968 both methods were applied with annual climate data and average values during the growing april september and winter season october to march next year table a1 three indices mk statistics kendall s t and z given by the mann kendall test describe the monotonic relationship between air temperature precipitation and time while z gives the significance the null hypothesis was tested at 95 confidence level for both temperature and precipitation with a trend significant when z 1 96 3 3 3 concentration discharge relationships a commonly used metric to define concentration discharge c q relationships uses the direction and magnitude of their co variation which generally based on a power law relationship between concentration and discharge 2 lnc l n a b l n q γ l n w with a b and γ are constants with concentration c discharge q and random error w the slope b indicates whether the relationships between discharge is positive or negative godsey et al 2009 defined chemostatic behavior as b 0 however concentration can be independent and highly variable from discharge when b 0 but γ is high therefore the ratio of the coefficients of variation of concentration and discharge has been introduced cv ratio thompson et al 2011 3 cv c cv q μ q σ c μ c σ q with the coefficient of variance for concentration cv c the coefficient of variance for discharge cv q the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of concentration µc σc and the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of discharge µq and σq lower cv ratios mean that the concentration behaves more chemostatic compared to discharge according to previous studies musolff et al 2015 rose et al 2018 a chemostatic or chemodynamic behavior is defined as cv ratio 0 5 or 0 5 respectively 3 3 4 detection and classification of runoff events the detection of runoff events was realized with an r script based on algorithmic peak selection zhang et al 2020 the inputs consisted of sub daily discharge t threshold temporal range for events detection and d threshold the minimum maximum limit of peak trough hourly and 3 hourly discharge time series were resampled to 4 hourly resolution we then calculated the maxima and minima within the t threshold the peak and trough were defined as the maxima and minimum values higher and lower than the d threshold respectively to determine the start and end of runoff events the difference of every peak and trough was calculated to arrange a matrix number of peaks trough the rising and recession periods were then determined as the minima of positive values and maxima of negative values of the differences the t threshold and d threshold were set as 7 d and 1 m3 s and the start and end of events were manually checked and adjusted to ensure the selected events were realistic to note is that the period with two or more intermittent rainfall events and high discharge in between was regarded as a continuous runoff event every detected event was operationally categorized as a high flow medium flow or low flow event depending on whether the respective maxima of the specific event discharge was 1 0 m3 s between 0 2 and 1 0 m3 s or 0 2 m3 s for the intuitive visualization of multi events the increasing ratio between every time step 4 h was calculated according to 4 i n c r e a s i n g r a t i o q t q t 4 h q t the increasing ratios of all the events were plotted as heatmap which provided intuitive visualization of hydrological responses during the storm events a data classification method was also applied in order to categorize the nutrient and doc data by flow classes pionke et al 1999 samples taken during a the rising limb peak or the first 4 h recession of a storm hydrograph b post storm drainage periods in the hydrograph recession or c stable non stormflows e g high discharge in winter season were classified as stormflows elevated baseflows and baseflows respectively a python script was developed to realize the classification https github com songjun wu event classification 4 results 4 1 hydroclimate variability over a 30 years period a gradual but significant increase in annual air temperature of 1 2 was observed over the past 30 years at dmc fig 2 with a rate of increase of 0 05 y in the growing season table 2 this increasing trend was also reflected in the elevated number of cumulative days with mean daily temperature per year above 15 20 or 25 with 111 37 or 4 days after 2013 compared to 100 30 or 2 days before respectively fig a1a no significant increase was detected in winter although there was an increase of winter temperature after 2013 fig 2b no monotonic trend in precipitation was found in either season table 2 or in event sizes fig a1c d instead precipitation was characterized by pronounced inter annual variability fig 2c d periodic transitions between wet spi 0 and dry periods spi 0 were observed before 2008 fig 3 such transitions generally took 1 5 2 5 years using the spi calculated from a 24 months window which is commonly used as a period for assessing long term reservoir storage and groundwater recharge guttman 1999 the main wet periods were 1993 1995 2002 2004 while the main dry periods were 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2007 since 2008 a prolonged wet period with high spi values lasted almost four years fig 3 the average spi 24 reached 1 76 indicating very wet conditions according to the spi drought categories wmo 2012 after that we have seen a 7 year dry period since 2012 there was a short re wetting period over the winter of 2017 2018 however the spi 24 remained 0 and the average value during 2013 2019 was still negative 0 67 4 2 hydrological response to variability in climate and water management the dmc has a strongly seasonal groundwater dominated flow regime with annual high flows being almost exclusively in winter fig 4 there were strong differences between the two monitoring sites with average daily flows of 0 13 and 0 08 m3 s at demnitz mill and berkenbrück respectively fig 4 and fig a2 the decrease in downstream discharge was significant in different seasons as discharge at demnitz mill was 1 53 1 84 times of that at berkenbrück in growing winter season respectively annual discharge is positively correlated p 0 05 with annual rainfall and long term patterns of discharge are generally aligned with precipitation with regular transitions 4 years between low flow and high flow periods before 2008 and prolonged high and low flow periods during 2008 2011 and post 2012 fig 4 high flow periods before 2008 1994 1995 2002 2003 reflected the high precipitation inputs but with 6 to 12 month time lags indicated by the spi 24 in the subsequent prolonged wet period 2008 2011 discharge increased with an average of 0 56 m3 s in the winter at demnitz mill 3 16 times higher than the long term average demnitz and berkenbrück also reached their recorded maxima of winter discharge in 2011 however subsequently a near continuous decrease of discharge was observed with a low flow period continuing into 2019 fig 4 flow duration curves also show pronounced sensitivity of flow regimes to wetness conditions at demnitz mill fig 5 occurrence of high 2 5 exceedance q 1 m3 s and medium flows 30 4 exceedance 0 2 q 1 m3 s were greatest during the long wet period 2008 2012 in the prolonged dry period 2013 2019 there were no high flows only a short spell of medium flows 11 6 exceedance and longer periods of flow cessation 19 8 of the time the lack of high flows during dry period further resulted in a decrease in cvq while highest cvq was found in wet period table a3 this long term variability was also evident in runoff coefficients fig a2 the groundwater levels generally aligned with the discharge at demnitz mill at an annual scale p 0 05 however the correlations with annual precipitation differed between sites mainly dependent on the distance to central wetland the annual average of groundwater level at gw8 closely correlated to the annual precipitation p 0 05 fig 6 while at other sites gw3 5 7 within the central wetland the groundwater levels were more independent to inter annual wetness conditions before 2008 groundwater at all sites mainly fluctuated annually with no clear monotonic trend table 2 and the inter annual variability in recharge was controlled by precipitation since 2008 less marked variability and weaker relationships with rainfall were found at sites gw 3 5 7 coinciding with the wetter period but also beaver recolonization together with a significant increase of average groundwater levels by 0 29 0 60 m in 2011 fig 6 this effect was most marked in the growing season with an average increase of 0 5 0 8 m and is consistent with increased recharge from beaver impacted areas for event analysis at demnitz mill fig 7 runoff events with medium flow were the most common 62 4 and no high flow events have occurred since 2011 much shorter rising limbs were found in runoff events in the recent dry period since 2013 with an average rising limb lasting 2 3 days compared to 3 7 days before a similar reduction of the recession limb to 2 8 days was also observed during 2013 14 but this was followed by the recovery back to the long term average 3 8 days since 2015 4 3 spatio temporal variability of nutrient and doc concentrations interpreting the water quality data is constrained by differences in sampling times between sites fig a3 however continuity of data from demnitz mill and periods of overlap from other sites allow identification of some notable changes in general nutrients showed downstream decreases peat north peat south demnitz mill berkenbrück fig 8 tp srp and no3 n concentrations respectively decreased on average by 42 56 and 58 from peat north to berkenbrück strongest decreases 40 of tp srp and no3 n concentrations were found in the central wetland between peat north and peat south in contrast doc increased downstream which mostly occurred in the wetland with concentrations increasing by 60 between peat north and peat south over the longer term a moderate declining trend of soluble fertilizer derived nutrients was observed fig 8 fig a3 with annual average of srp and no3 n concentrations at the four sites decreased by 10 8 24 3 in 2017 2019 compared to 1992 1999 the inter annual dynamics of no3 n concentrations were generally positively correlated to precipitation with peaks observed in wet years 1994 1998 2002 2010 and 2017 fig a3 in contrast phosphorus dynamics were relatively independent to annual precipitation with moderately negative but non significant correlation an exception was found immediately after the wetland restoration in 2000 when all nutrients increased between 2000 and 2007 the concentration of no3 n at the four sites increased by an average of 17 compared to 1992 1999 this increase was mainly in the north of the catchment at peat north and south while 23 29 decreases were observed at the downstream sites similarly tp and srp at all four sites increased by 13 0 and 22 5 on average after restoration however in contrast to no3 n which increased at both the entrance and the outlet of central wetland a slight decrease of srp 3 1 and stable tp 0 0 were found at peat north doc concentrations increased after restoration by 58 42 and 58 1992 2000 at peat south demnitz mill and berkenbrück respectively while the increase was only 4 5 at peat north 4 4 hydrochemical relationships the interpretation of c q relationships was limited by the weekly resolution of nutrient time series as shorter time scale responses of specific runoff events over a few days cannot be well characterised however as the response dynamics of the catchment are attenuated such events involving relatively small transient flow increases are quite rare given the longevity of the time series general hydrological influences on concentrations could be inferred despite considerable scatter in the data fig 9 contrasting responsiveness to discharge was observed in different constituents using cv ratio as a metric fig 9 a d chemodynamic behavior was observed for srp tp and no3 n with average cv ratios at all sites varying between 0 72 and 0 87 during 1992 2019 see table a3 for details for doc the cv ratio was 0 23 indicating strongly chemostatic behavior the slope b also showed differences between constituents details in table a2 discharge and no3 n showed a positive relationships with an average slope b of 0 81 at all sites during 1992 2019 while slightly negative or no relationships were found between discharge and srp tp and doc with near zero slopes fig 9e f in terms of the spatial heterogeneity the most significant c q relationships for all solutes were found at peat south with average cv ratios and absolute slope b values all being the highest over whole sampling period 1990 2019 fig 9e f a slight increase in the cv ratio for doc was also found at peat south but the value remained near zero in contrast c q relationships at other sites showed more chemostatic behavior a significant decrease of absolute slope b for no3 n was observed at peat north which was only 31 5 44 3 of those at other sites temporal variations in chemical responsiveness were also evident fig 9e before the prolonged wet period and beaver recolonization i e 1992 2007 c q relationships were highly diverse from 1992 to 2007 cv ratios of srp and tp slightly increased at peat south while decreasing at other sites slope b however increased only at demnitz mill while decreasing at all other sites the cv ratios for no3 n consistently decreased at most sites with the only exception of increasing slope at demnitz mill in the prolonged wet period 2008 2012 cv ratios declined for all chemical parameters which was consistent with the decreasing slope b for no3 n however the negative c q relationships of srp and tp became stronger when the wetter period ended and the extended drought period started in 2013 significant shifts towards more chemodynamic regimes were found at all sites reflected by significantly elevated cv ratios 39 70 higher see tables a2 a3 this was mainly attributed to the elevated cvc as the decrease of cvq only ranged within 24 28 the stronger relationships between discharge and concentrations of no3 n were also reflected in the increase of absolute slope b at demnitz mill since 2013 in addition to these longer term changes seasonality effects were also evident fig 9f tables a2 a3 c q relationships of srp and tp became substantially weaker in the winter compared to the growing season reflected by the decreasing slopes at all sites in contrast the relationships of no3 n only decreased at peat south and demnitz mill while increased at the other sites no trend was found in slope b of seasonal doc distribution more specific event based separation of baseflows and storm flows table 3 showed that the average discharge was 2 54 times in storm events compared to baseflows despite the scatter in the c q plots looking at water quality data in relation to hydrograph classes revealed some of the likely subtler hydrological influences no3 n mobilization was enhanced under higher flows at all sites especially in winter with 43 higher concentrations in stormflows compared to baseflows table 3 moreover elevated no3 n remained high during the recession period with the concentration only decreasing by 12 8 in elevated baseflows in contrast storm driven export of phosphorus was relatively weak as tp and srp concentrations during storm events only increased by 11 2 and 10 4 from those in baseflows respectively the only exception was at peat north where srp and tp both significantly increased during storm events table 5 moreover significant declines of srp 34 1 and tp 26 2 occurred during recessions compared to increasing periods reduced concentrations of srp and tp in elevated baseflows were 18 and 27 lower than in baseflows in contrast limited storm drive enrichment of doc was observed although on average concentrations were 14 9 higher concentrations in stormflows than baseflows base flow concentrations remained high and highest absolute doc concentrations were found in elevated baseflows 4 5 nutrient and doc fluxes nutrient fluxes exhibited the same downstream decreasing trend as concentrations fluxes decreased on average by 83 tp 86 srp and 83 no3 n from peat north to berkenbrück fig 10 doc fluxes exhibited a lesser decrease 32 due to the elevated concentrations downstream of the wetland following restoration from a long term perspective dynamics in nutrient and doc fluxes were more closely aligned to long term discharge variations than concentrations this can be attributed to the much higher variability in discharge compared to nutrient concentrations table a3 the only exception was observed immediately after wetland restoration during which the increased nutrient fluxes were mainly explained by elevated concentrations by 2003 the average fluxes of tp srp and no3 n increased by 4 3 2 9 and 0 8 times compared to those in 1999 in the subsequent wet years 2008 2012 we saw a high flux period the average fluxes of tp srp no3 n and doc reached 0 09 0 05 4 36 and 8 79 kg km2 d at demnitz mill which were 1 7 1 5 1 7 2 8 times the long term average over 1992 2019 subsequently a low flux period established during the long dry period since 2013 with suppressed average tp srp and no3 n fluxes of 0 03 0 02 1 18 kg km2 d during 2013 2019 5 discussion 5 1 hydroclimatic variability climate change is impacting ecohydrological systems water supplies food security and human health in catchments around the world dai 2013 thornton et al 2014 during the past 30 years the air temperature increased 1 2 in dmc which is consistent with global warming trends cook et al 2013 hughes 2000 and exceeds the respective european average of 1 moberg et al 2006 similar to other studies hisdal et al 2001 meehl et al 2007 wentz et al 2007 precipitation in dmc showed no clear trend but strong inter annual variability fig 3 interestingly a clustering tendency of wet and dry periods was observed since 2008 with a prolonged wet 2008 2012 and dry period since 2013 the latter resulted in a gradual drying pattern over the past 7 years and serious drought conditions in 2015 2016 and particularly 2018 such anomalies were also reported in other catchments in central europe garcía herrera et al 2019 hartick et al 2019 leach et al 2020 and may reflect the acceleration of a drying trend over the past century briffa et al 2009 further the frequency of more intense precipitation events also increased in recent summers compared to pre 2008 which is consistent with projected climate change over much of europe christensen and christensen 2004 van den besselaar et al 2013 zolina 2012 resulting from increased atmospheric moisture and higher temperature dankers and feyen 2008 this non stationarity in climate appeared to have moved dmc to drier and warmer conditions which has major implications for the catchment s hydrology and nutrient export 5 2 variability in stream flow response like much of northern germany döll and fiedler 2008 dmc is a groundwater dominated catchment with high infiltration and recharge and low surface runoff due to the dominant sandy soils the extensive glacial deposits near the outlet integrates the dmc with the regional groundwater system in the valley of the river spree resulting groundwater leakage in this area was simulated previously 4 mm month on average see smith et al 2021 and explains the lower discharge at berkenbrück longer term stream flow trends were driven by rainfall with a positive relationship between annual discharge and precipitation p 0 01 though the strong seasonality of streamflow is common in many catchments in western and central europe stahl et al 2010 the inter annual trend differed from the general longer term trends in germany concluded as decreasing in the growing season and increasing in winter season stahl et al 2010 instead the tendency of clustered wet and dry years in dmc reflecting slow changing mesoscale circulation in the atmosphere gillett et al 2003 dominates stream flow variation during the 2008 12 wet period significantly increased discharge and elevated groundwater levels were observed peaking in 2011 despite annual precipitation being similar to or less than other wet years e g 2002 and 2017 this highlights the importance of antecedent conditions on slower changes in catchment storage smith et al 2020 in the recent 7 year long dry period discharge and summer groundwater levels significantly decreased prolonged streamflow cessation was observed in three successive summers reflecting cumulative effects of low winter precipitation and greater evapotranspiration due to increasing temperatures smith et al 2020 the length of the drought also led to soil moisture deficits and lower groundwater recharge in winter kleine et al 2020 the moderately wetter year of 2017 was not sufficient to replenish water deficits as streamflow still ceased for 5 months in 2018 given this context it is notable that shorter rising limbs of hydrographs were observed since 2013 however the shortened rising limb here does not equate to a quicker discharge response when we focused on the events dominated by concentrated and intense rainfall 15 mm d to exclude the impacts from antecedent precipitation the average lag time between peak discharge and peak precipitation was similar before and after 2013 1 3 and 1 6 days respectively suggesting that discharge response time to intense rainfall events remained stable instead the shortened rising limbs were mostly observed in smaller rainfall events when the higher soil water deficit under drier conditions constrained stream recharge until it reached a threshold and then triggered a lagged response of rising limb such discharge thresholds were also found in previous studies rose et al 2018 underwood et al 2017 as being required to activate hydrologic connections between deeper groundwater and shallower subsurface flow paths similarly soil water deficits accelerated the streamflow recession during the prolonged drought since 2013 5 3 management effects on catchment hydrology the impacts from beaver activities on catchment hydrology was apparent riparian groundwater levels increased after recolonization consistent with the facilitated surface water leakage to groundwater aquifers and moderated surface runoff due to beaver dams shown in other studies e g hill and duval 2009 in contrast wetland restoration had only a minor impact on discharge and groundwater before 2007 this limited early effect may simply be attributed to the small wetland area 1 7 km2 as the size of restored areas is usually directly related to impacts martinez martinez et al 2014 however in recent dry years groundwater remained at a relatively high level in the restored wetland compared to earlier dry years e g 2003 we believe wetland restoration contributed to this phenomenon because the increase in groundwater levels was only observed in wells within the restored wetland gw3 5 7 in fig 5 such lagged response of riparian groundwater to restoration has been observed elsewhere and attributed to the memory effects of long term degradation and drainage holden et al 2011 5 4 nutrients and doc an overall downward trend of all nutrients concentrations was observed in dmc possibly driven by a decrease of fertilizer application following the changes in agricultural policy after german reunification ehrhardt et al 2019 however this overall trend had some variability reflecting the additional integrated effects of hydrologic and biogeochemical filtering of stochastic hydroclimatic forcing musolff et al 2017 here the three major controlling factors of solute behavior in dmc are considered 5 4 1 intrinsic characteristics and the catchment storage in dmc we saw contrasting behaviors of srp tp no3 n and doc showing respective moderate chemodynamic moderate chemodynamic and chemostatic behavior and different relationships with discharge negative positive and insignificant these distinct behaviors remained stable with little variation over the monitoring period reflecting that the response of a solute was primarily dictated by its intrinsic characteristics e g solubility reactivity and availability in catchment moatar et al 2017 for phosphorus the chemodynamic behavior in dmc has been observed in many catchments e g musolff et al 2015 as it is regarded as a highly reactive species with rapid in stream processing birgand et al 2007 these in stream effects which would have been enhanced by restoration effects e g redox dependent retention in wetlands are generally fast enough to mask mobilization by hydrological flow paths which leads to phosphorus being decoupled from discharge dependent variability thompson et al 2011 and showing strong spatial heterogeneities musolff et al 2015 rose et al 2018 in dmc we saw dilution patterns of both srp and tp which were similar to those reports in catchments with limited phosphorus storage and external inputs hoffmann et al 2012 given that phosphorus enrichment during storm events was most marked at peat north closest to arable land table 3 while dilution occurred at the other sites downstream dmc probably experiences source limitation of phosphorus in non agricultural areas in addition to retention in restored wetlands highest tp and srp concentrations tended to be in summer though fluxes were flow driven and highest in winter fig 10 and fig a4 considering the limited contribution from upstream due to the low discharge and from groundwater due to its low concentration table a4 the release from soils i e the dissolution of fe bound phosphorus under low redox conditions may play an important role in summer fig a3 in contrast no3 n responded positively to increasing discharge even under high flows which is consistent with the positive coupling of no3 n and discharge reported in some agricultural catchments kamjunke et al 2013 kyllmar et al 2006 such patterns in dmc were determined by the contrasting no3 n sources and storage in the agricultural north abundant and forested south limited under dry conditions streamflow in central wetland and forested area generally exhibited low concentration as it was mainly fed by deeper groundwater which was generally low in no3 n concentration table a4 in contrast rewetting of the catchment allowed greater no3 n transport via shallow subsurface flow paths or directly from upstream and resulted in higher concentrations it is important to emphasis that the observed behavior was closely related to the in situ land use the four sampling sites in our study are all located in wetland or forested areas thus it is possible that no3 n exhibited a more chemostatic behavior in intensively managed agricultural areas upstream of peat north in these northerly areas greater groundwater contamination and more extensive fertilizer applications may lead to constantly high concentrations such chemostatic behavior has been reported in many intensively managed catchments e g basu et al 2010 thompson et al 2011 though no direct evidence was available in dmc doc exhibited a typical chemostasis in dmc which has been observed in a broad range of catchments see general chemostatic behaviors derived from discharge doc slope in godsey et al 2019 this was probably attributed to the ubiquitous doc sources in organic soils especially after wetland restoration allowing doc to be mobilized proportionally to water fluxes and thus chemostatic behaviors bieroza et al 2018 rose et al 2018 although the doc pools were less spatially extensive than the geogenic solutes riparian wetlands which have been shown to be a dominating factor of doc export musolff et al 2018 zarnetske et al 2018 can still provide abundant source at all flows and result in the chemostatic behavior in dmc 5 4 2 changing hydroclimate climatic variability has a critical influence in regulating nutrient dynamics as it is a main driver for both the biogeochemical and hydrological processes which regulate nutrient cycling the close interactions between climate hydrology and nutrients have been widely demonstrated in both observation and modelling haygarth et al 2012 rozemeijer and broers 2007 yang et al 2018 here we investigated how hydroclimatic variability affected nutrient and doc dynamics in dmc at three different time scales inter annual annual and event scale over the longer term annual average of no3 n concentrations was significantly correlated to annual precipitation r 0 44 p 0 02 which is likely explained by distinct hydrologic connectivity regimes under the different wetness conditions bechtold et al 2003 jaeger et al 2014 underwood et al 2017 smith et al 2021 in dry years the nitrate transport to streams during events was likely limited to connected riparian areas while more extensive hydrological connectivity across the landscape during wet conditions allowed greater no3 n mobilization from more extensive areas of soil and shallow groundwater under arable land anderson et al 2014 lower in stream concentrations in dry years were also likely attributed to its greater accumulation in the soil due to limited hydrological transport such no3 n accumulation will lead to a higher potential of no3 n export in the following wet years bechtold et al 2003 bernal et al 2002 as no3 n in dmc increased in nearly every re wetting year after drier spells 1993 1994 2001 2002 2008 2011 2016 2017 phosphorus species showed less sensitivity to climate and negative non significant relationships with annual precipitation the dilution patterns were not only controlled by source limitation but also affected by changing pathways of hydrological transport studies in catchments with riparian wetlands have shown that when landscape connectivity is enhanced in wetter conditions contributions from phosphorus sources shift from the riparian zone generally high in phosphorus due to the low redox in shallow groundwater interacting with the organic soils to upslope areas generally with higher redox potential and lower phosphorus content due to less interaction between deeper groundwater and top soils dupas et al 2017 dupas et al 2018 such extended pathways may also lead to the phosphorus dilution in wet years in dmc though simple patterns are confounded by high reactivity climate also affected long term hydrochemical relationships as lower discharge not only decreases transport capacity but increases residence times smith et al 2021 this probably enhanced the relative importance of biogeochemical processes e g denitrification and assimilation which contributes to a steeper c q slope for no3 n and tp in drier years fig 9 moatar et al 2017 drier years also resulted in a tendency to increase chemodynamic behavior as the lack of high flows constrained the discharge variance table a3 while the concentration variance was enhanced probably due to the biogeochemical processes prior to the most recent drought period the general magnitude of nutrient concentration variations was not comparable to discharge variations similar to observations in other german catchments musolff et al 2015 this means that the nutrient fluxes were mainly dominated by discharge rather than concentrations however in the recent drought the relative influence of concentrations on instantaneous nutrient fluxes has increased e g the cv ratios of tp and srp ranged from 1 0 to 1 6 during 2013 2019 though the influence of flows on low annual export remains dominant fig 10 at the annual scale both srp and no3 n concentrations showed strong but opposing seasonality though fluxes of both were dominated by winter high flows this finding aligned with previous studies which showed the differential mobility of srp and no3 n in rewetting peats and fens cabezas et al 2013 zak et al 2010 in dmc srp release was dominant in the growing season which can be attributed to the supply of available phosphorus as mentioned above section 5 4 1 in contrast during the winter higher hydrological connectivity provided better transport capacity from no3 n rich soils and shallow groundwater upstream leading to higher no3 n concentrations in streamflow lin et al 2019 also the low capacity of denitrification oehler et al 2009 and concentrated release from snow pack during melting kincaid et al 2020 pellerin et al 2012 could potentially contribute to the no3 n peaks in winter but their effects are likely secondary although specific storm event sampling was limited the event classification of the scatter in weekly water quality datasets clearly showed the tendency of an increase in no3 n concentrations during storm events which was consistent with its long term behavior and underline again the hydrological transport as the primary controlling factor of no3 n dynamics in contrast tp and srp enrichments were observed during high flow samples which contrasts with their long term negative relationships with discharge this different behavior during specific events might be attributed to the dominant runoff sources abruptly shifting in a highly transient way from groundwater to surface runoff from saturated and compacted areas as pore waters stored in upper layers of soils become increasingly connected to the stream mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 however the phosphorus mobilization was limited to specific sites and seasons both seasons in peat north winter seasons in peat south and the highest values tended to be on the recession limbs rather than at storm peaks similar lags between peaks in discharge and phosphorus were observed in other studies which showed that during early storm phases discharge was primarily generated by deep groundwater flowpaths rather than shallow riparian areas of the development of saturated zones mclaughlin and kaplan 2013 sawyer et al 2014 thus constrained the phosphorus supply in the rising limb 5 4 3 impacts from restoration management and wider implication effects of restoration on nutrients like hydrological impacts were limited in the initial few years after intervention but accelerated after beaver recolonization no3 n concentrations during the re wetting year of 2017 were notably lower downstream of the wetland compared to previous re wetting years consistent with enhanced capacity for denitrification and nutrient retention hill and duval 2009 the enhanced mixing of sub surface and surface water over a larger inundated area as well as the more active carbon decomposition due to longer retention likely contributed to the significant doc enrichment in the wetland bossio et al 2006 westbrook et al 2020 coupled with climatic effects the changes to catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry will continue to increasingly impact water quality a major issue for nutrient dynamics is the lower rainfall and increased evapotranspiration which is combining with increased groundwater recharge in restored wetlands to reduce stream flows only with ongoing monitoring will we see if the streamflow regime shifts from perennial to ephemeral and overall reduced hydrological connectivity becomes permanent smith et al 2021 such conditions are likely given climate projections in such lowland headwater catchments and will have strong implications for habitat structure and biodiversity as well as water quality larned et al 2010 the next phase of work at dmc will seek to fuse the long term data sets considered here with models of catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry to fully understand the roles of climate change and riparian management on past and future hydrology and water quality this will have important implications for land and water management if greater catchment nutrient retention occurs as a result of reduced stream flows 6 conclusion we assessed the effects of climatic variability and wetland restoration on the response of streamflow and some solutes in the demnitzer mill creek dmc catchment annual temperature increased 1 2 in the past 30 years and a regular transition between wet and dry periods 2 3 years long was observed until a persistent run of drier years started in 2013 this climatic variability strongly influenced the catchment s hydrology with the recent drought leading to a decrease in discharge and groundwater levels as well as prolonged streamflow cessation and limited hydrological connectivity in three successive summers nutrient dynamics were primarily controlled by intrinsic solute characteristics given that srp no3 n and doc showed different behaviors as negative chemodynamic positive chemodynamic and chemostatic however hydroclimatic conditions also affected the nutrient variations with nitrate notably retained in dry years and mobilized in wet years phosphorus showed a more independent response to wetness conditions probably due to its high reactivity and source limitation doc showed increased mobilization with flooding of organic soils in wetland restoration riparian management played a critical role in modulating long term hydrological and nutrient variations both wetland restoration and beaver dams effectively increased the groundwater level since 2007 and limited its decrease in the recent drought a stronger nutrient retention was also observed in the restored wetland however there was a delay before the wetland restoration functioned effectively this integrated assessment of long term hydrology and water quality provided valuable context for understanding water and nutrient cycles under changing climate and

3993,the travel time or age of groundwater affects catchment responses to hydrologic changes geochemical reactions and time lags between management actions and responses at down gradient streams and wells use of atmospheric tracers has facilitated the characterization of groundwater ages but most wells lack such measurements this study applied machine learning to predict ages in wells across a large region around the great lakes basin using well chemistry and landscape characteristics for a dataset of age tracers in 961 samples the travel time from the land surface to the sample location was estimated for each sample using parametric functions the mean travel times were then modeled using a gradient boosting machine gbm algorithm with cross validation tuning of model metaparameters the gbm approach was able to closely match estimated ages for the training data rmse 0 26 natural log scale years and provided a reasonable match to testing data rmse 0 84 of the variables tested well characteristics e g depth land use hydrologic indicators e g topographic wetness index and water chemistry e g nitrate fluoride and ph substantially affected the predictions of age gbm prediction was applied to 14 335 groundwater samples with median sample depth of 5 4 m indicating for the great lakes basin a broad distribution of ages among wells with a median of 32 9 years lag times of decades are likely for these wells to respond to changing solute fluxes near land surface while depth variables most strongly affected predicted mean ages chemical constituents exhibited smooth trends with age consistent with prevailing conceptual models of evolving sources and geochemistry flowpaths the results provide proof of concept for use of readily available variables of well landscape and chemical characteristics to improve groundwater age estimates across large regions keywords regional groundwater resources groundwater travel time groundwater age tracers machine learning boosted regression trees groundwater age prediction 1 introduction many environmental and water resources issues depend on knowledge of the travel time of water and solutes groundwater travel time or age refers to the elapsed time during transport along a flowpath from the land surface to a downgradient receptor such as a well spring or stream a common example is the transport assessment of non point source agricultural chemicals from fields to wells or surface waters böhlke 2002 the distribution of travel times from multiple travel paths converging at a receiving location well or stream is the basis for transfer function methods that allow characterization of input histories and reaction rates kolbe et al 2019 and generate forecasts of future concentrations of non point source solutes osenbrück et al 2006 liao et al 2012 kourakos et al 2012 green et al 2018 the age of groundwater has also been used as an indicator of the sustainability of extraction zongyu et al 2005 gleeson et al 2010 as an indicator of general vulnerability to anthropogenic influences eberts et al 2012 and as a factor in short circuit flows that can result in rapid movement of pathogens and introduction of contaminants into otherwise isolated aquifers bradbury et al 2013 koh et al 2016 koh et al 2018 characterization of ages has been conducted for several decades using atmospheric tracers such as radionuclides and refractory trace gases such as chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulfur hexafluoride that are well mixed in the atmosphere phillips and castro 2003 coordinated research programs such as the u s geological survey usgs national water quality program have established publicly available datasets of age tracers in well samples from across large regions usgs 2020 yet most wells and areas remain uncharacterized water quality and ecological health across large regions will benefit from additional quantitative information about travel times to characterize the hydrogeochemical systems and to inform or support optimization of management strategies while additional sampling of atmospheric tracers is a central component of characterizing ages there is also potential to augment and improve age estimates based on ancillary information from hydrologic and geochemical studies the role of hydrologic factors in determining the age of a groundwater sample has been studied using numerical models that provide a framework to directly relate the hydrology to simulated ages e g sanford 2011 eberts et al 2012 engdahl 2017 starn and belitz 2018 starn et al 2021 early work included simulations of local and regional flowpaths with corresponding age differences based on cross sections with various water table configurations freeze and witherspoon 1967 winter 1978 or illustrated the spatial variation of ages based on mathematical models for simplified geometries with uniform properties małoszewski and zuber 1982 böhlke 2002 more recently studies have combined statistical and deterministic models to provide quantitative links to predict age from hydrologic characteristics starn and belitz 2018 estimated regional groundwater residence times from a machine learning algorithm trained on ages from advective particle tracking models similarly fienen et al 2018 used numerical flow models with particle tracking and gradient boosting machine metamodeling in the lake michigan basin usa and showed that well construction features can be important predictors of age characteristics such as the fraction of young water in a sample while numerical representations have not incorporated all the relevant features of natural systems that can potentially affect a well sample fienen et al 2018 these studies establish a basis for relating age to measurable hydrologic parameters the signals of geogenic and anthropogenic solutes have also contributed to understanding patterns of ages in aquifers and streambeds naturally occurring products of mineral dissolution such as silica and fluoride can augment information about travel times from atmospheric tracers in local settings burns et al 2003 kim and jeong 2005 stewart et al 2007 morgenstern et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2020 for example stewart et al 2007 and morgenstern et al 2010 examined time series in streams of tritium and silica and found that mineral dissolution resulted in systematic trends of silica with age similar correlations have been observed between geogenic solutes and age in other locations e g burns et al 2003 kim and jeong 2005 mcmahon et al 2020 in contrast to the tendency for increasing concentrations of geogenic solutes with age anthropogenic non point source solutes such as nitrate and pesticides are typically associated with modern recharge and so vertical profiles of age tracers in recharge areas often conform to simple conceptual models of increasing age and decreasing non point contaminants with depth böhlke 2002 application of these concepts at regional scales is challenging because of scarcity of data and complex spatial variations of geology and geochemistry machine learning methods have shown promise for analyzing complex geochemical relationships at large scales a particular advantage is the ability to assimilate locally varying factors across large regions with hydrogeochemically diverse sub regions in tree based methods for example the trees comprise many different baskets i e tree branches and are well suited to detecting local features that influence the response variable nolan et al 2018 used boosted regression trees to analyze parameters from vertical flux method vfm estimates of reactive transport of nitrate for central eastern wisconsin green et al 2018 to extrapolate transport characteristics beyond sampled areas other machine learning studies have made large scale hydrogeochemical predictions for nitrate nolan et al 2015 ransom et al 2017 nolan et al 2018 ph rosecrans et al 2017 kingsbury et al 2020 redox conditions desimone et al 2020 erickson et al 2021 arsenic ayotte et al 2016 and salinity knierim et al 2020 all based on readily available datasets for hydrogeology and landscape characteristics this approach has not yet been applied to predict well sample ages across regions with training on age estimates from measured atmospheric tracers in this study we apply a machine learning approach to predict groundwater sample mean ages at the regional scale from landscape hydrologic and geochemical variables a gradient boosting machine model was trained and tested against tracer derived tritium tritiogenic helium carbon 14 chlorofluorocarbons 11 12 and 113 and sulfur hexafluoride age distributions from well samples in the great lakes basin we further evaluate the relative importance of the various landscape and hydrogeochemical variables for prediction of groundwater ages the resulting gradient boosting machine model was then used to predict ages in wells throughout the great lakes basin that have not been sampled for atmospheric age tracers and to characterize age attributes of regional water resources this is the first application to our knowledge of machine learning predicated on measured age tracer concentrations to predict groundwater sample ages 2 study area the great lakes basin glb is a large region in the north eastern united states and southern canada that encompasses the watershed of five major lakes lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario the glb has experienced several periods of glaciation ranging from over a million years ago to around 11 thousand years ago the current lakes were formed by depressions left from melting glaciers and the resulting continental uplift botts and krushelnicki 1987 the areal extent of groundwater contributing to the great lakes is affected by geological heterogeneities and groundwater withdrawals avery 1995 feinstein et al 2004 this study focuses on the u s side of the glb generally the southern half fig 1 the u s portion of the glb is 780 877 km2 and is dominated by forest and agricultural land use but has also experienced rapid urban development wolter et al 2006 water quality constituents of concern come from natural and anthropogenic sources and include manganese arsenic and radon from geologic sources nitrate and pesticides in intensively farmed regions particularly well drained areas with sandy soil and chloride applied for road deicing in urban areas warner and ayotte 2014 groundwater contamination can have adverse effects on surface water quality of the great lakes because groundwater accounts for a substantial portion of direct and indirect flows into the lakes grannemann and van stempvoort 2016 hydrogeology varies across the study region depending on thickness and type of glacial deposits as well as the bedrock characteristics grannemann et al 2000 glacial deposits range from highly permeable outwash and ice contact deposits to less productive till and glacial lake deposits thickness of unconsolidated deposits ranges from 1 to 50 m across much of the study area but can be greater than 100 m primarily in a zone between lake huron and the northern half of lake michigan soller and garrity 2018 fig 1 productive bedrock aquifers across the region consist primarily of carbonate rocks and some sandstone areas of low permeability bedrock occur between lake michigan and lake huron mostly shale south of lake erie shale and to the northwest of lake michigan granite and gneiss groundwater is a critical natural resource in the glb grannemann et al 2000 glsab ijc 2010 the volume of water in storage in aquifers on the u s side of the basin has been estimated as 5600 km3 coon and sheets 2006 comparable to the volume of lake michigan withdrawals are from discontinuous surficial aquifers of alluvial and glacial origin present throughout the basin as well as consolidated carbonate and sandstone aquifers grannemann et al 2000 coon and sheets 2006 more wells are installed in the surficial aquifers than any other geologic unit glsab ijc 2010 although bedrock wells are also important sources of drinking water bradbury and runkel 2011 the hydrogeological setting and construction of wells used in this study are discussed in section 3 2 3 methods 3 1 conceptual basis of age distributions the representation of the groundwater age distribution in a well needs to be simple enough to allow a unique solution while also incorporating the basic attributes of age distributions a single sample of groundwater contains a distribution of water ages rather than a single age because mixing occurs via diffusion and dispersion in aquifer materials during transport varni and carrera 1998 weissmann et al 2002 engdahl et al 2012 as well as from different vertical and circumferential locations on a well screen or open interval in bedrock contributing water into a well and therefore to a single mixed sample green et al 2010 horn and harter 2009 henri and harter 2019 these processes can produce complex age distributions with multiple peaks varni and carrera 1998 green et al 2014 and heavy tails zhang et al 2013 contained within a single well water sample for most purposes however the complexity of the representation of the age distribution within a water sample generates less uncertainty than other factors such as quantity and quality of age tracer data eberts et al 2012 green et al 2014 green et al 2014 used calibration of multiple forms of the age distribution in a well water sample by using synthetic simulated data and found that an advection dispersion equation ade based age distribution similar to the inverse gaussian performed favorably for predicting age and solute concentrations in wells the current study uses the ade approach section 3 6 to estimate the age distributions in well samples with age tracer data while more complex solutions have been applied for some samples with multiple age tracers e g solder 2019 use of the ade in this study allows characterization of the age distribution based primarily on a single parameter mean age section 3 6 that can be used as a target for a machine learning model in a complex region sections 3 2 3 5 3 2 well selection and groundwater chemistry compilation a database of groundwater chemistry was constructed for the glb study area by selecting all available samples with analytes relevant to non point source water quality see below from publicly available data sources the study area included a 100 km buffer region around the great lakes basin boundary to expand the dataset in areas of limited measurements fig 1 samples from the same day were averaged and samples taken in the same wells but on a different day were treated as unique samples the chemistry database consisted of seven atmospheric age tracers used to estimate tracer based age distributions tritium tritiogenic helium carbon 14 chlorofluorocarbons 11 12 and 113 and sulfur hexafluoride as well as 21 chemical constituents e g nitrate oxygen iron silica for use as predictor variables chemical data were from publicly available sources solder 2019 solder and jurgens 2019 jurgens et al 2017 green et al 2018 usgs 2020 and are compiled in the supplementary material table s1 the final data set included 15 296 samples 14 335 samples without an age tracer measurement and 961 samples with an age tracer measurement from over 6 000 unique locations sampled between the years 1979 2017 characteristics of the chemical data are discussed in section 4 1 samples were selected based on date and well characteristics to provide an internally consistent set of data samples were limited to the time period of age tracer availability may 1979 to july 2017 so that the set of samples for prediction would represent the same time period as the samples used to develop the gbm model samples from wells deeper than 152 m and wells in confined aquifers were removed from the analysis to emphasize the shallow groundwater under the influence of modern land use practices while maintaining an adequate number of age tracer data the 152 m 500 ft cutoff was based on initial analysis of the dataset which revealed relatively few wells deeper than the cutoff and few age tracer measurements from the deeper versus shallower wells the majority of wells were medium diameter construction typically for domestic use as described below in unconsolidated sediments detailed well construction information provided indirect information about well type of the wells with available construction info 55 of all wells 24 had construction typical of monitoring wells 5 08 cm diameter plastic construction 55 had construction typical of domestic wells 10 16 to 15 24 cm diameter steel construction and 21 had greater diameters common for public water supplies national aquifer codes were available for 65 of the study wells of those 64 were in sand and gravel aquifers glaciated regions 10 were in silurian devonian aquifers 11 were in other aquifers consisting of local consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers and the remainder were in various consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers wells were sampled using equipment and techniques according to usgs standard procedures usgs 2006 wilde 2010 initial summary and spatial analysis of the dataset revealed several hundred samples with low ph less than about 4 5 and relatively high iron concentrations average of around 400 000 µg l most of the low ph and high iron samples were clustered in clarion county pennsylvania a region with historical strip mining the low ph and high iron samples likely represent groundwater affected by acid mine drainage and were removed from further analysis due to the highly clustered location and unique chemistry samples marked as contaminated in the national water information system nwis database usgs 2020 were also removed from further analysis 3 3 treatment of detection limits censored value imputation reported concentrations marked as not detected above the laboratory detection limit were imputed according to a log normal imputation routine lubin et al 2004 palarea albaladejo and martin fernandez 2015 the routine estimated a random value between zero and the reported detection limit for each sample such that the estimated values of the censored data conformed to a best fit log normal distribution for the set of estimated and non censored measurements for that constituent with the exception of temperature tritium chlorofluorocarbons 11 12 and 113 and sulfur hexafluoride chemical constituents with a reported value of zero were replaced with the most common detection limit or in cases where the most common detection limit was relatively high with the second most common detection limit marked as censored and imputed 3 4 well characteristics compilation the final database included well depth depth to water depth to top and bottom of open interval and sample depth well characteristics were obtained from the national water information system usgs 2020 and are compiled in supplementary materials tables s2 and s3 hole depth was substituted for well depth when well depth was not available depth to water measurements downloaded for the sampling sites were averaged by site and day to create a unique set of water level measurements by day some sites had multiple measurements per day depth to water measurements were assigned to samples by site and sample day often a depth to water measurement was not available for the well on the sampling day in this case the sample was assigned a depth to water measurement from the closest measurement date within a 30 day window the sample depth was calculated as the distance from the water table to the center of the saturated open interval of the well for samples with available information 3 5 explanatory variables a database of 123 publicly available explanatory variables was compiled including chemistry and well characteristics above and gis attributed variables that characterized the climate land use hydrogeology soil characteristics and hydrological position of the sample locations tables s2 and s3 land use characteristics were sampled in 1974 and 1982 based on availability relevance to the time frame of the samples and for the potential to represent two different fingerprints on age the explanatory variables were attributed to sampling sites in arcgis by either point extract or summary statistics within 500 m radius circular buffers around each site from raster or shapefile coverages of each variable after gis variable attribution the final dataset was separated into two samples with age tracer measurements and samples without n 961 and n 14 335 the dataset with age tracer measurements was further subdivided into a training dataset representing eighty percent of the samples with age tracer measurements and a sequestered hold out dataset to test the predictive capability of the final model representing twenty percent of the samples with age tracer measurements the dataset without age tracer measurements was used to compute a mean total travel time prediction based on each well s associated explanatory variables for samples across the glb 3 6 groundwater age estimation to build the training and hold out datasets for the statistical machine learning model section 3 7 a tracer based age distribution was estimated for each sample in the database table s1 a single age distribution was estimated for samples with multiple age tracer measurements section 4 1 the tracer based age distribution was estimated by adjusting the mean age of the sample to provide as close a match as possible between the observed and estimated tracer concentrations the procedure was based on a simplified version of the vertical flux method welch et al 2011 liao et al 2012 green et al 2018 this approach of adjusting the age distribution to provide as close as possible a match to an observed tracer concentration is widely used in age estimation approaches such as tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 and is applicable to any groundwater sample in which the tracer concentrations are representative of the date of recharge a fundamental assumption of age tracing methods in the age estimation algorithm the calculation of tracer concentrations depends on the age distribution of the sample and the input over time of the tracer the reactive transport of a solute can be modeled over a range of times at a sample point with a convolution equation e g zuber and maloszewski 1982 1 c s t t c 0 t g t t exp k t t d t where cs is the sampled concentration m l3 of tracer at sample date t c0 is the concentration at the date t when the solute enters the subsurface g is an age distribution describing output of a conservative tracer injected instantaneously at the inlet and k is a first order decay rate coefficient 1 t the total travel time between input at ground surface and time of sampling is defined as τ t t and includes travel time in the unsaturated and saturated zones see below individual tracers were estimated as follows for sf6 and cfcs k was set to zero the first order radioactive decay of 14c and 3h was assumed to begin at time t for 3hetrit produced by decay of tritium the 3hetrit generated in the unsaturated zone is lost to the atmosphere e g osenbrück et al 2006 and so the 3hetrit in the sample is equal to the tritium concentration at the water table minus the tritium concentration in the sample and equation 1 becomes 2 c s h e t t c 0 t t g τ exp k t τ u exp k t τ d t where subscript he is for 3hetrit subscript t is for tritium and τ u is unsaturated zone travel time the total travel time τ is the primary focus of this study and is equal to the sum of the travel times in the unsaturated zone τ u and saturated zone τ s τ τ u τ s these parameters were calibrated as described below the age distribution is governed by advection and dispersion kreft and zuber 1978 małoszewski and zuber 1982 green et al 2018 3 g τ d τ 4 π d τ 3 exp d τ 4 τ 1 τ τ 2 where d is a dimensionless dispersion ratio that can be defined as the transport distance divided by dispersivity assigned a uniform starting value as described below and τ is the mean travel time total unsaturated or saturated use of the dimensionless dispersion ratio d allows generality because a constant value can capture increasing dispersivity over greater transport distances and times as observed previously e g pickens and grisak 1981 this form of the advection dispersion age distribution has been found to produce relatively low errors among various types of travel time distributions ttds with one or two parameters massoudieh et al 2014 green et al 2014 differences of predictions from the various ttd models tend to be relatively small as compared to uncertainty stemming from errors in measurements and historical inputs eberts et al 2012 green et al 2014 visser et al 2014 to estimate the age distribution of a sample the mean age in equation 3 was adjusted to produce as close a match as possible between the modeled tracer concentration and the observed value in cases where multiple mean ages could produce the same tracer concentration the mean age most consistent with regional hydrologic properties was selected based on the following two stage calibration process first the mean total travel time was calibrated for all samples by adjusting homogeneous regional values of effective recharge r unsaturated zone travel time τ u and dispersion parameter d to minimize the differences between observed and estimated age tracer concentrations mean total travel time increases with decreasing r and increasing τ u as shown in equations 8 and 9 of green et al 2018 in the second stage of calibration the mean total travel time was estimated for each well sample independently for each sample with a single tracer n 695 the mean total travel time was calibrated by adjusting r from the starting value 0 22 m yr for any sample with 2 or more tracers n 266 the mean total travel time was further calibrated by adjusting τ u and d if needed to improve the fit of the multiple tracers for both stages of the calibration parameters were adjusted to minimize the sample s objective function φs consisting of the weighted error between the observed and predicted age tracer concentrations 4 φ s j 1 nj ω j 2 c j c j 2 where j is the observation number nj is the number of observations ω j is the weight cj is an observed value and cj is the predicted value the weights were set to 1 0 25cj for all tracers to eliminate effects of different concentration scales except for 14c which was set to 1 2cj based on initial testing that indicated large errors for 14c the objective function φs was minimized using a non linear generalized reduced gradient solver lasdon et al 1978 the tracer based mean ages were natural log transformed for further statistical modeling below in which machine learning was used to extend mean total travel time estimates to wells without tracer data 3 7 statistical machine learning the machine learning technique known as gradient boosting machine gbm friedman 2001 2002 was used to develop a model of groundwater mean total travel time mean travel time from land surface to sample point see equation 3 gbm is an ensemble learning technique based on decision trees a decision tree generates an estimate of an output variable based on optimized thresholds of predictor variables that divide the data into multiple groups breiman et al 1984 for example a basic tree using silica as the only predictor variable could predict that samples with silica concentrations above a certain threshold tend to have a certain travel time based on optimized values of the threshold and the predicted travel time as opposed to methods that use single large trees gbm uses many simplified regression trees or weak learners the algorithm builds each new tree based on the residuals of the previous tree de ath 2007 the method recalculates the estimated value for each observation with each successive tree and the final model is an additive combination of all the trees elith et al 2008 gbm requires the choice of several metaparameters that control model complexity and size the number of trees interaction depth which controls the size of each individual tree the shrinkage factor which controls the value added to each observation s current estimated value at each tree model learning rate and the minimum number of observations in each terminal node friedman 2002 we used gbm within a statistical learning framework nolan et al 2015 that included cross validation tuning of gbm metaparameter combinations to pre screen the combinations for reasonable performance we performed 10 fold cross validation tuning with the training dataset on a range of each of the metaparameters 490 possible combinations with the r package caret kuhn et al 2019 the optimal model metaparameters based on cross validation testing minimum root mean square error rmse zambrano bigiarini 2017 were retained but not selected for final modeling to avoid overfit on the small dataset of tracer based groundwater ages we tested simpler metaparameter combinations that resulted in cross validation testing rmse within one standard error 1se analysis of the minimum cross validation testing rmse while not substantially increasing hold out rmse metaparameter combinations were given a model complexity ranking determined by sorting the combinations by interaction depth shrinkage minimum number of observations in each terminal node reverse order and the number of trees sequestered hold out data served to test the final model after metaparameter evaluation via cross validation tuning the simplest metaparameter combination within one standard error of the best cross validation testing combination that also exhibited adequate predictive performance for the hold out dataset was selected as the 1se model the gbm method can appropriately handle missing values in the predictor variables for both model training and prediction without the need for imputation friedman 2001 gbm manages missing values by the use of surrogate splits within the trees in the case where there is a missing value for the current split variable a split is instead made with another variable that has the highest measure of predictive association with the current variable from among the remaining variables which are not missing breiman et al 1984 a scenario was tested with imputed well characteristics for samples that lacked a reported or measured value initial results indicated reduced model performance when imputed values were used for missing well characteristics versus leaving the values as missing therefore we did not fill in or impute missing well construction characteristics in order to avoid increased uncertainty recursive feature elimination rfe was performed with the 1se model to select a more parsimonious set of predictor variables the r package caret kuhn et al 2019 was used to perform rfe with backwards feature elimination where variables were ranked based on gbm s internal importance ranking scheme and removed one by one in order of lowest importance variables were re ranked with each iteration the method involves a ten fold cross validation and ranks the variables according to a consensus ranking from the results of each fold we chose variables to remove from the model with a backward selection technique based on caret s rfe consensus ranking until the cross validation rfe error increased by about one percent yielding the final model after rfe the final gbm model was run outside of caret using the r package gbm greenwell et al 2019 and tested on the hold out data the final variables were ranked according to their relative normalized importance which is a summary measure of the reduction in model error along model split points for each variable friedman 2001 we compared the estimated mean total travel time to the tracer based mean total travel time for the hold out data to approximately quantify the model estimation error to new data to characterize regional mean total travel time in the glb the final model was used to predict natural log mean total travel time to well sample locations without a measured age tracer fig 1 after prediction mean total travel times in log space were back transformed and bias corrected with a smearing estimator helsel and hirsch 2002 a method that corrects for bias introduced by log transformation of the dependent variable all statistical modeling analysis and prediction was performed with r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 final datasets and tracer based groundwater travel time the final regional dataset consisted of 14 335 samples without an age tracer measurement from 6 782 unique nwis sites at 6 077 unique locations samples are unique by day and sites are unique by depth and geographic location fig 1 and sampled during the time period between may 1979 and july 2017 table 1 lists summary statistics for well characteristics and water level for the samples in the final regional dataset including samples with and without age tracer measurements as mentioned above samples in the dataset were limited to a maximum depth of approximately 152 m the resulting samples had a fairly shallow median depth of about 14 m and 75 of wells were shallower than 32 m representing groundwater more likely to be younger and influenced by modern anthropogenic practices compared to the deeper zones below 152 m the final age tracer dataset consisted of 961 samples with a tracer measurement from 797 unique nwis sites and 702 unique locations which were sampled during the time period between may 1979 and june 2017 fig 1 table s1 of the 961 samples with an age tracer measurement 695 had only one age tracing constituent 128 had two and 138 had three to five measurements table 2 most of the measurements were for tritium n 913 table 2 lists summary statistics for the compiled age tracer measurements after censored value imputation and fit statistics for the measured versus estimated tracer concentrations from the calibration procedure adjustment of mean age in eq 4 the root mean square errors rmses are below 33 of the median for all tracers and r squared values are above 0 8 for all tracers except 14c the low r squared and moderate rmse for 14c reflects high uncertainty for that tracer over the range of relatively young ages for these shallow wells the greater r squared and moderate rmse for the other tracers indicate a close match between estimated and observed concentrations of modern age tracers estimation of the tracer based age distribution for each of the 961 samples with one or more age tracer measurements resulted in a minimum mean total travel time of 0 02 years median of 45 years and maximum of 239 years the 80 20 split of tracer based mean total travel time resulted in 771 samples in the training dataset and 190 samples in the hold out dataset the mean total travel times for the training and hold out datasets were similarly distributed fig 2 4 2 statistical modeling results this analysis provides the first reported results to our knowledge of cross validation of a model of tracer derived age the final gbm model was well fitted to the training data and provided reasonable estimates of the hold out data table 3 and fig 3 the final metaparameters after cross validation tuning and 1se analysis were 2000 for number of trees 6 for interaction depth 0 012 for shrinkage and 8 for minimum number of observations in terminal nodes training and hold out r2 values were 0 96 and 0 57 respectively for the final model and rmse values were 0 28 and 0 85 respectively hold out performance was reasonable and consistent with previous models of groundwater chemistry and transport characteristics for eastern wisconsin nolan et al 2018 table 3 note that outliers with greatest hold out error on fig 3b tended to be very shallow wells the hold out r2 increases to 0 66 and rmse decreases to 0 64 for wells deeper than 5 5 m below ground surface locally many variables determine and are affected by the groundwater age it is therefore not surprising to find differences between the gbm model and the tracer based estimates of age there is substantial uncertainty in tracer based groundwater age estimates green et al 2014 visser et al 2014 massoudieh et al 2014 especially for example for a sample with only a single tracer consisting of a low tritium concentration in the gbm changes in hydrogeochemistry over the timespan of sampling 1979 to 2017 potentially add noise and complexity to the relationships of predictor variables with age for example applicability of nitrate as a surrogate for age depends on agricultural land use changes that may be difficult to capture with a small number of snapshots in time estimates of sample depth may be incorrect in wells with long open intervals and focused inflow at discrete depths these issues point to potential improvements of age estimates through additional groundwater tracer sampling particularly with multiple age tracer measurements in each sample to reduce uncertainty of age estimates as well as predictor variables for groundwater age such as improved characterization of land use hydrogeological and chemical characteristics in this context there is significant value in first order approximations of mean groundwater ages for comparisons and indicators of hydrologic processes recursive feature elimination rfe resulted in 64 final variables supplementary material table s3 in general the model slightly underestimated groundwater total travel time though the calculated percent bias an average measure of the tendency for the model to under or over estimate for hold out data was low at near two percent table 3 removal of the 59 variables by the rfe resulted in less than 2 increase in model hold out rmse 4 3 predictor variables the rfe selected variables were ranked according to the normalized reduction in model error also known as variable importance fig 4 shows the top twelve most important predictor variables in the final model which includes variables related to land use chemistry and hydrology the relationship between each variable and the mean total travel time is visualized using a partial dependence plot pdp which summarizes the model s overall response to a change in the variable fig 5 more specifically a pdp shows the average estimated values among all samples given a range of values for the variable of interest while all other variables are held at their observed value greenwell 2017 fig 5 shows pdps for the top 12 most important variables in the model older groundwater was associated with increasing depth to bottom of well open interval sample depth and fluoride concentration and decreasing nitrate and chloride concentrations relationships between the predictor variables and mean total travel time are discussed in more detail below note that the thickness of each pdp trend line indicates the frequency of data values in the training data e g with a relatively high frequency of wells with depth 20 m which is also reflected in the spacing of the blue tick marks for data deciles on the x axis thin portions of the pdp trend lines and widely spaced deciles indicate relatively scarce data values and reduced relevance of data in those ranges to the prediction model 4 3 1 landscape position factors related to the vertical position of the sample and the position of the well on the topographic landscape often relate to the length of flowpaths between recharge area and sample point fig 6 these factors tended to rank highly among predictor variables as mentioned above depth to bottom of well screen or open interval in bedrock was ranked as the most influential variable in the model this effect was observed predominantly at depths shallower than 30 m where mean total travel time tended to increase sharply with increased depth to the bottom of the open interval fig 5 consistent with standard conceptual models of age depth relationships böhlke 2002 fig 6 depth to bottom of open interval has a greater influence on mean total travel times than depth to top of open interval which was ranked as seventh but exhibited a similar pattern on the pdp fig 5 the sensitivity of groundwater age to the variable depth of the bottom of open interval in addition to depth to top of open interval reflects the influence of screen or open interval length on the sampled horizons the well water is a mixture of water ages entering the well along the length of the screen or open interval horn and harter 2009 green et al 2010 and henri and harter 2019 and at the same depth to bottom of screen longer screens shallower depth to top of screen will include shallower and younger water than shorter screens fig 6 topographic wetness index twi was the next most important landscape position variable after the well depth related variables and the eighth most important variable in the model fig 4 groundwater age tended to increase with increasing twi over the range of high frequency values thicker line weight on fig 5 increasing values of twi indicate increased tendency for an area to exfiltrate groundwater and therefore to have longer flowpaths with greater residence times twi is calculated for any point in a watershed with the equation ln a tan β where a is the upslope area per unit contour length from the location and tan β is the slope at the location wolock and mccabe 1995 greater values of twi indicate areas near a break in slope where a relatively large uphill area transitions to horizontal fig 6 when the water table follows the contours of the land surface such locations tend to correspond to areas of groundwater exfiltration and upward flow due to the change in pressure gradient freeze and witherspoon 1967 winter 1999 conversely low values of twi indicate locations with small contributing areas and steep slopes typical of recharge areas with predominantly downward gradients in groundwater fig 6 freeze and witherspoon 1967 nolan et al 2007 found estimated values of groundwater recharge at sites in the eastern united states were sensitive to the value of twi and twi was inversely related to groundwater recharge and positively related to subsurface contact time 4 3 2 chemistry groundwater chemistry variables were consistently linked to the tracer based ages of the 21 chemical variables tested 18 were retained as relevant variables in the final model see section 3 7 a greater proportion than any other category of variable except well depth table s3 nitrate fluoride ph chloride iron and temperature were in the top twelve most important variables and silica was ranked fifteenth based on the pdps fig 5 older groundwater was associated with lower nitrate and chloride concentrations and with greater temperature iron concentration ph and fluoride concentration older groundwater was also associated with greater silica concentration fig s1 in addition to the top 12 variables shown in fig 5 silica is discussed below for comparison with other studies using silica as an age tracer these findings indicate an opportunity to include a broad range of solutes in characterizing residence times in the great lakes basin chemical indicators of groundwater age show distinct trends depending on anthropogenic versus geogenic origins anthropogenic constituents tend to be associated with modern recharge fig 6 association of nitrate with younger mean ages in groundwater has been observed across a wide range of hydrogeological settings böhlke 2002 koh et al 2006 green et al 2008 gourcy et al 2009 kagabu et al 2017 as a result of increased fluxes from intensifying anthropogenic land uses as well as the tendency for denitrification to remove nitrate from water following reduction of o2 which is relatively uniform in recharge tesoriero and puckett 2011 the relationship is however affected by factors such as sample date denitrification rate and the presence of tile drains spalding and exner 1993 these findings are consistent with other machine learning studies ransom et al 2017 found in agricultural regions of california that groundwater nitrate concentration decreased with increasing groundwater age and increasing depth chloride has also been observed as an anthropogenic constituent the association between chloride and younger groundwater has been observed in local studies of agricultural areas modern agricultural sources of chloride include manure and potassium chloride fertilizers mullaney et al 2009 hamilton et al 1993 hamilton et al 1993 found a significant correlation between nitrate and chloride concentration for wells affected by agricultural activities in the delmarva peninsula usa liao et al 2012 used estimates of agricultural chloride loading as a conservative tracer along with atmospheric age tracers to characterize travel times in vertical profiles of recharging groundwater another major source of chloride in groundwater in the glacial region of the united states which contains the glb is deicing salts applied to roadways in winter months mullaney et al 2009 younger groundwater is more likely to be affected by runoff from deicing salts as well as agricultural practices which is consistent with the trend of decreasing ages associated with increasing chloride concentration figs 5 and 6 increasing groundwater ph iron and fluoride with increasing groundwater age are likely associated with dissolution and interaction with aquifer and bedrock materials along flow paths palmer and cherry 1984 stuyfzand 1999 fig 6 the pdp for ph exhibits a threshold or a steep increase in the predictions between ph of 7 and 8 indicating that younger groundwater age samples tended to be acidic while older samples tended to be alkaline likely due to buffering by carbonate mineral dissolution and other weathering reactions that consume acids stuyfzand 1999 older groundwater ages are associated with greater likelihood of anoxic and alkaline conditions and increased arsenic and iron concentrations in the surrounding glacial aquifer system warner and ayotte 2014 erickson et al 2021 stackelberg et al 2021 a study of groundwater age and oxidation reduction processes in a glacial outwash aquifer in west central minnesota found an increase of iron concentrations due to decreasing redox potential and increasing abundance of more soluble ferrous iron species with an increase in groundwater age puckett and cowdery 2002 as oxidation reduction processes proceed along flow paths oxidation of pyrite and reduction of ferric iron produces soluble ferrous iron groundwater samples from domestic wells in the central glacial deposits of the united states showed that concentration of iron increases with depth and the abundance of redox sensitive species reflected the succession of oxidation reduction reactions mcmahon and chapelle 2008 studies examining groundwater age and fluoride specifically in the glb region are lacking however analysis of fluoride concentrations have shown an increase in concentration with increased residence time and depth in assessment studies of u s aquifers mcmahon et al 2020 and elsewhere kim and jeong 2005 edmunds and smedley 2013 fluoride is influenced by water rock especially granite but also limestone or water sediment interaction edmunds and smedley 2013 fluoride in groundwater in western ohio is from dissolution of minerals containing fluoride within the limestone aquifer odh 2012 results of the current study indicate that an analogous process of weathering of fluoride minerals in bedrock or sediments likely contributes to increased fluoride concentrations with age in some wells in the glb the pdp for silica indicated increasing concentrations with age fig s1 consistent with existing studies that use silica as a proxy for age e g stewart et al 2007 it has long been known that silica tends to increase along flowpaths as silicate minerals are dissolved in a study of aquifer chemistry in the zone of a public supply well in the glacial aquifer system in woodbury connecticut silica saturation had a positive linear relationship with groundwater age and was greater in wells screened in glacial till and bedrock likely due to increased contact time between the groundwater and the quartz source material brown et al 2009 silica also tends to correlate inversely with modern anthropogenic agricultural contaminants severini et al 2020 other studies have used silica to quantify groundwater age locally marçais et al 2018 the current results demonstrate the potential to incorporate such information regionally like geogenic constituents temperature tends to increase with age and depth which is consistent with the pdp for temperature fig 6 classical type curves of temperature profiles predict greater temperatures at greater depth and with lower downward water velocity bredehoeft and papadopulos 1995 both of which correspond to increased mean age temperature profile studies have observed this relationship across a range of settings mansure and reiter 1979 taniguchi et al 1999 reiter 2001 and temperature can correlate with geogenic constituents such as fluoride mcmahon et al 2020 the regional data for this study show a statistically significant positive correlation of temperature with depth p value 0 001 temperature may therefore provide information about transport e g if a well is in a location of upwelling of deeper warmer groundwater or if greater rates of sustained recharge cause downward migration of the shallow groundwater temperature signature fig 6 in the current study the associations of chemical constituents with mean age highlight an opportunity for a paradigm shift in data driven modeling of the age of groundwater samples towards integration of locally variable chemical processes and features to improve regional predictions this advancement is facilitated by the machine learning gbm which is well suited to detecting and segregating the effects of local features in predictor variables into separate branches during the tree building process this is critical for geochemical data which vary depending on local conditions the connection between age and regional chemical variations has been captured in other recent machine learning studies in the glacial aquifer system that predicted ph stackelberg et al 2021 and redox indicators erickson et al 2021 using numerical model estimates of age in the current study the trends of the chemical constituents with respect to mean age fig 5 are relatively monotonic compared for example to twi relatively free of noise compared to percent pasture and are consistent with the prevailing conceptual models of the evolution of sources and of geochemistry along flowpaths these findings demonstrate the potential for incorporation of groundwater chemistry into quantitative estimates of age which has been achieved locally for example with individual constituents e g marçais et al 2018 but not at regional scales leveraging a broad range of constituents 4 3 3 land use the most influential land use variables were 1982 land use as pasture and 1982 land use as crops the pdps of fig 5 do not show a clearly defined relationship between groundwater age and either land use the range of sensitivity to these variables is limited e g 3 15 to 3 25 ln years for pasture though both exhibit local trends for some portions of the plot where observed values are the most common for example for land use as pasture groundwater age tended to increase from 0 to 10 pasture land use and then generally decreased from 10 to 40 pasture pasture land use above 40 represents a small portion of the observed data points indicated by the line thickness and vertical blue tics on fig 5 the land use as crops pdp generally shows older groundwater for samples with higher percentages of land use as crops this trend is consistent with reduction of downward velocities by tile drainage however given the noise in the pdp trends and the complexities of hydrological factors associated with agricultural land uses it is difficult to relate the pdp trends to definitive mechanisms tile drainage irrigation and geographic placement of agricultural lands all can differently affect the age of water at a given depth future studies of age relationships in these land use areas may help to clarify these effects 4 3 4 regional mean total travel time predictions the collection of predicted mean total travel times provides insight into the general characteristics of groundwater ages in wells in the u s portion of the great lakes basin figure s2 the distribution of travel times from ground surface to sample was approximately exponential for the 14 335 samples without a measured age tracer with a mean of 44 6 yr and median of 32 9 yr fig 7 the gbm predicted mean total travel times of samples were generally within the range of the tracer based travel times exponential distributions are consistent with the conceptual model of exponentially distributed residence times in a laterally continuous aquifer with uniform recharge małoszewski and zuber 1982 and have been observed in other broad scale studies of shallow aquifer samples green et al 2016 the high frequency of young ages fig 7 and shallow samples highlights the importance of the shallow groundwater resources for domestic consumption in the great lakes basin the mean and median of the exponential distribution indicate that while some shallow wells will show rapid responses to management actions current changes of solute fluxes near land surface will take decades to propagate to many downgradient wells for the regional predictions a correlation between well depth and age is expected based on rankings of variable importance fig 4 and partial dependencies fig 5 the predicted mean total travel times were categorized based on the quartiles of depth to bottom of open interval for the 12 255 wells with available depth measurements fig 8 the median predicted groundwater travel time for each quartile increased with increasing depth to bottom of open interval category the nonparametric kruskal wallis rank sum test for groundwater total travel time grouped by the quartiles of depth to bottom of open interval was highly significant p value 0 001 and results of the post hoc dunn s test indicated that the distribution of total travel times within each depth category not including the unknown depth category are significantly different from each of the other categories p values 0 001 for all two way comparisons the significance of the trend is not surprising given the large number of predictions and the observed relationships in the partial dependence plots fig 5 the strong influence of well depth as a predictor variable raises questions about the relevance of the additional variables to predictions of age the importance of variables other than well depth on predictions is however evident from the range of predicted ages at a given well depth for example the predicted mean total travel time ranged from 0 5 to 50 years in the first quartile of depths less than 6 1 m fig 8 and there was considerable overlap of the ranges of predicted ages among all depth quartiles such variations of age with depth arise as a result of hydrogeological variability e g gassiat et al 2013 and hydrologic position starn and belitz 2018 fig 6 and necessitate the use of the additional variables other than well depth for improved estimates of age heatmaps show the relevance of the secondary variables other than open interval bottom depth to the predictions of age meaningful patterns of variable interactions with the age predictions across a range of well depths are often consistent with conceptual models of age versus physical and chemical characteristics fig 6 in fig 9 each color panel is for one of the variables that ranked 2nd to 9th in relative importance fig 4 in each panel the color of a pixel shows the average value of the variable in that bin of well depth and mean total travel time consistent gradients of color indicate systematic relationships that pervade the complex decision tree of the gbm the overall gradients in the heatmaps are consistent with the partial dependence plots fig 5 and the prevailing conceptual models of spatial distribution of ages and temporal evolution of geochemistry fig 6 section 4 3 for example older samples at the top of each panel tend to associate with greater yellow and green sample depth fluoride ph and twi as well as lower values blue of no3 the heatmaps also show detailed patterns that indicate relevance of the lower ranked variables in certain ranges of well depths for example a substantial number of samples from wells less than 20 m deep fig 9a show no trend in depth related variables across the range of predicted ages uniform blue columns on left side of fig 9b and 9g but show distinct gradients of no3 f ph and twi across the range of predicted ages similarly wells with predicted ages less than 20 years bottom row show no gradient across well depths for the depth related variables but consistent gradients of no3 twi and to a lesser extent f the influence of chemical variables on predicted age is also evident in time series predictions from the gbm model of mean total travel time for single wells the gbm model can be used to estimate temporal as well as spatial variations of the age distribution which is an important component of vulnerability assessments and understanding groundwater transport processes fig 10 shows wells with more than 10 time series chemistry samples the chemical variables change depending on the date of sampling while the other predictor variables based on location and depth remain constant for each well the ages shown include only samples with the same variables for example if nitrate was sampled on most dates for a well any samples missing nitrate were excluded for that well the violin plots include the individual datapoints and curves showing the kernel smoothed estimate of the data distribution for each well example time series shown on the right of fig 10 indicate long term e g decadal variations the variation of travel times for a well tends to increase as the mean travel time increases with coefficients of variation standard deviation divided by mean ranging from 5 to 15 this predicted variability of mean age is in the range of observations of tracer based ages coefficients of variation from time series of tracer based ages in three wells in new hampshire were 5 9 and 27 levitt et al 2019 5 summary and conclusions we developed a machine learning model of groundwater mean total travel time over a large region encompassing the great lakes basin in the united states with the gradient boosting machine gbm method groundwater mean total travel time was calibrated for groundwater samples with at least one age tracer measurement mostly tritium 3h for 961 groundwater samples the gbm model was trained on the tracer based mean total travel times and a comprehensive dataset of 123 explanatory variables related to climate land use hydrogeology soil characteristics and hydrological position the ability of the model to predict groundwater age was confirmed by cross validation testing and hold out data as well as the consistency of predicted relationships between predictor variables and age with prevailing conceptual models the model estimated the training data well and the fit to hold out data was reasonable considering the relatively small dataset uncertainties of tracer based groundwater ages and simplifications inherent in estimated hydrogeochemical landscape variables it is important to note that age predictions will tend to be poorer for samples affected by processes that are not influential in the sampled locations in the training dataset future collection of tracer data to characterize a wide range of settings therefore remains a critical element in predicting regional ages the current study also highlights the need for methods development of tracer based estimates of groundwater age distributions across large regions with variable hydrogeochemistry future studies may explore combining this type of broad regional approach with mechanistic conceptual or numerical models of travel times based on detailed interpretations of hydrogeology and geochemistry the physical and chemical variables identified as important in this study may serve as ancillary age tracers that can be used in combination with atmospheric age tracers to improve quantitative estimates relevant well characteristics and gis based variables such as topographic wetness index and multi order hydrologic position are widely available groundwater chemistry variables were also consistently important eighteen of 21 chemical variables tested were retained for the final model and fluoride ph chloride iron and temperature ranked in the top 12 most important variables the relationships between age and chemistry in the gbm were consistent with prevailing conceptual models of geochemical evolution along flowpaths based on the influence of chemical variables their ability to provide information about temporal variations of age and their relatively low cost and availability as compared to atmospheric age tracers increased collection and use of chemical data to inform age estimates will be advantageous for future studies and applications of machine learning in this and other study areas predictions of groundwater mean total travel time to the 14 335 samples with no age tracer measurement illustrate the opportunity to use the gbm approach in support of regional water resources assessments the predicted ages indicate decadal time lags of water quality responses at wells to land use changes while depth is a key factor affecting predicted age variability of predicted ages for wells of similar depth was substantial as was variability of time series of ages in individual wells these variations indicate sensitivity of the model to regionally heterogeneous hydrogeochemistry and to temporal chemical signals respectively the ability to distinguish these spatially and temporally local effects across a large region will facilitate improved screening level tools for water resource management age predictions at wells will be useful in estimates of solute reaction rates historical inputs vulnerability assessments and scenario testing for future water quality conditions given the level of uncertainty in the age predictions more work will be needed to achieve accuracy suitable for using age estimates as targets in numerical model calibrations this study provides the first application to our knowledge of a machine learning application to predict the travel time distribution of groundwater samples based on calibrated distributions from age tracer data the proof of concept and identification of key variables relevant to age prediction provides a basis for applications to other study areas future work can build on these findings and fill in gaps in predictive capability an advantage of the current approach is the ability to quantitatively link hydrogeochemical variables to age to improve accuracy of age predictions and better understand the governing processes limitations include uncertainties stemming from errors in tracer based age estimates and input histories limited availability of multi tracer estimates of groundwater age to better characterize the mean and shape of age distributions and lack of detailed hydrogeological information at individual well locations the methods developed in the current study provide synergistic support for understanding local and regional factors affecting age of groundwater samples and can be combined with other numerical or empirical methods to support detailed hydrogeological assessments the current approach to estimate groundwater age can contribute to better understanding of regional flow rates and patterns analysis of reaction rates of solutes such as oxygen and nitrate and assessment of vulnerability of wells to non point source contaminants

3993,the travel time or age of groundwater affects catchment responses to hydrologic changes geochemical reactions and time lags between management actions and responses at down gradient streams and wells use of atmospheric tracers has facilitated the characterization of groundwater ages but most wells lack such measurements this study applied machine learning to predict ages in wells across a large region around the great lakes basin using well chemistry and landscape characteristics for a dataset of age tracers in 961 samples the travel time from the land surface to the sample location was estimated for each sample using parametric functions the mean travel times were then modeled using a gradient boosting machine gbm algorithm with cross validation tuning of model metaparameters the gbm approach was able to closely match estimated ages for the training data rmse 0 26 natural log scale years and provided a reasonable match to testing data rmse 0 84 of the variables tested well characteristics e g depth land use hydrologic indicators e g topographic wetness index and water chemistry e g nitrate fluoride and ph substantially affected the predictions of age gbm prediction was applied to 14 335 groundwater samples with median sample depth of 5 4 m indicating for the great lakes basin a broad distribution of ages among wells with a median of 32 9 years lag times of decades are likely for these wells to respond to changing solute fluxes near land surface while depth variables most strongly affected predicted mean ages chemical constituents exhibited smooth trends with age consistent with prevailing conceptual models of evolving sources and geochemistry flowpaths the results provide proof of concept for use of readily available variables of well landscape and chemical characteristics to improve groundwater age estimates across large regions keywords regional groundwater resources groundwater travel time groundwater age tracers machine learning boosted regression trees groundwater age prediction 1 introduction many environmental and water resources issues depend on knowledge of the travel time of water and solutes groundwater travel time or age refers to the elapsed time during transport along a flowpath from the land surface to a downgradient receptor such as a well spring or stream a common example is the transport assessment of non point source agricultural chemicals from fields to wells or surface waters böhlke 2002 the distribution of travel times from multiple travel paths converging at a receiving location well or stream is the basis for transfer function methods that allow characterization of input histories and reaction rates kolbe et al 2019 and generate forecasts of future concentrations of non point source solutes osenbrück et al 2006 liao et al 2012 kourakos et al 2012 green et al 2018 the age of groundwater has also been used as an indicator of the sustainability of extraction zongyu et al 2005 gleeson et al 2010 as an indicator of general vulnerability to anthropogenic influences eberts et al 2012 and as a factor in short circuit flows that can result in rapid movement of pathogens and introduction of contaminants into otherwise isolated aquifers bradbury et al 2013 koh et al 2016 koh et al 2018 characterization of ages has been conducted for several decades using atmospheric tracers such as radionuclides and refractory trace gases such as chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulfur hexafluoride that are well mixed in the atmosphere phillips and castro 2003 coordinated research programs such as the u s geological survey usgs national water quality program have established publicly available datasets of age tracers in well samples from across large regions usgs 2020 yet most wells and areas remain uncharacterized water quality and ecological health across large regions will benefit from additional quantitative information about travel times to characterize the hydrogeochemical systems and to inform or support optimization of management strategies while additional sampling of atmospheric tracers is a central component of characterizing ages there is also potential to augment and improve age estimates based on ancillary information from hydrologic and geochemical studies the role of hydrologic factors in determining the age of a groundwater sample has been studied using numerical models that provide a framework to directly relate the hydrology to simulated ages e g sanford 2011 eberts et al 2012 engdahl 2017 starn and belitz 2018 starn et al 2021 early work included simulations of local and regional flowpaths with corresponding age differences based on cross sections with various water table configurations freeze and witherspoon 1967 winter 1978 or illustrated the spatial variation of ages based on mathematical models for simplified geometries with uniform properties małoszewski and zuber 1982 böhlke 2002 more recently studies have combined statistical and deterministic models to provide quantitative links to predict age from hydrologic characteristics starn and belitz 2018 estimated regional groundwater residence times from a machine learning algorithm trained on ages from advective particle tracking models similarly fienen et al 2018 used numerical flow models with particle tracking and gradient boosting machine metamodeling in the lake michigan basin usa and showed that well construction features can be important predictors of age characteristics such as the fraction of young water in a sample while numerical representations have not incorporated all the relevant features of natural systems that can potentially affect a well sample fienen et al 2018 these studies establish a basis for relating age to measurable hydrologic parameters the signals of geogenic and anthropogenic solutes have also contributed to understanding patterns of ages in aquifers and streambeds naturally occurring products of mineral dissolution such as silica and fluoride can augment information about travel times from atmospheric tracers in local settings burns et al 2003 kim and jeong 2005 stewart et al 2007 morgenstern et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2020 for example stewart et al 2007 and morgenstern et al 2010 examined time series in streams of tritium and silica and found that mineral dissolution resulted in systematic trends of silica with age similar correlations have been observed between geogenic solutes and age in other locations e g burns et al 2003 kim and jeong 2005 mcmahon et al 2020 in contrast to the tendency for increasing concentrations of geogenic solutes with age anthropogenic non point source solutes such as nitrate and pesticides are typically associated with modern recharge and so vertical profiles of age tracers in recharge areas often conform to simple conceptual models of increasing age and decreasing non point contaminants with depth böhlke 2002 application of these concepts at regional scales is challenging because of scarcity of data and complex spatial variations of geology and geochemistry machine learning methods have shown promise for analyzing complex geochemical relationships at large scales a particular advantage is the ability to assimilate locally varying factors across large regions with hydrogeochemically diverse sub regions in tree based methods for example the trees comprise many different baskets i e tree branches and are well suited to detecting local features that influence the response variable nolan et al 2018 used boosted regression trees to analyze parameters from vertical flux method vfm estimates of reactive transport of nitrate for central eastern wisconsin green et al 2018 to extrapolate transport characteristics beyond sampled areas other machine learning studies have made large scale hydrogeochemical predictions for nitrate nolan et al 2015 ransom et al 2017 nolan et al 2018 ph rosecrans et al 2017 kingsbury et al 2020 redox conditions desimone et al 2020 erickson et al 2021 arsenic ayotte et al 2016 and salinity knierim et al 2020 all based on readily available datasets for hydrogeology and landscape characteristics this approach has not yet been applied to predict well sample ages across regions with training on age estimates from measured atmospheric tracers in this study we apply a machine learning approach to predict groundwater sample mean ages at the regional scale from landscape hydrologic and geochemical variables a gradient boosting machine model was trained and tested against tracer derived tritium tritiogenic helium carbon 14 chlorofluorocarbons 11 12 and 113 and sulfur hexafluoride age distributions from well samples in the great lakes basin we further evaluate the relative importance of the various landscape and hydrogeochemical variables for prediction of groundwater ages the resulting gradient boosting machine model was then used to predict ages in wells throughout the great lakes basin that have not been sampled for atmospheric age tracers and to characterize age attributes of regional water resources this is the first application to our knowledge of machine learning predicated on measured age tracer concentrations to predict groundwater sample ages 2 study area the great lakes basin glb is a large region in the north eastern united states and southern canada that encompasses the watershed of five major lakes lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario the glb has experienced several periods of glaciation ranging from over a million years ago to around 11 thousand years ago the current lakes were formed by depressions left from melting glaciers and the resulting continental uplift botts and krushelnicki 1987 the areal extent of groundwater contributing to the great lakes is affected by geological heterogeneities and groundwater withdrawals avery 1995 feinstein et al 2004 this study focuses on the u s side of the glb generally the southern half fig 1 the u s portion of the glb is 780 877 km2 and is dominated by forest and agricultural land use but has also experienced rapid urban development wolter et al 2006 water quality constituents of concern come from natural and anthropogenic sources and include manganese arsenic and radon from geologic sources nitrate and pesticides in intensively farmed regions particularly well drained areas with sandy soil and chloride applied for road deicing in urban areas warner and ayotte 2014 groundwater contamination can have adverse effects on surface water quality of the great lakes because groundwater accounts for a substantial portion of direct and indirect flows into the lakes grannemann and van stempvoort 2016 hydrogeology varies across the study region depending on thickness and type of glacial deposits as well as the bedrock characteristics grannemann et al 2000 glacial deposits range from highly permeable outwash and ice contact deposits to less productive till and glacial lake deposits thickness of unconsolidated deposits ranges from 1 to 50 m across much of the study area but can be greater than 100 m primarily in a zone between lake huron and the northern half of lake michigan soller and garrity 2018 fig 1 productive bedrock aquifers across the region consist primarily of carbonate rocks and some sandstone areas of low permeability bedrock occur between lake michigan and lake huron mostly shale south of lake erie shale and to the northwest of lake michigan granite and gneiss groundwater is a critical natural resource in the glb grannemann et al 2000 glsab ijc 2010 the volume of water in storage in aquifers on the u s side of the basin has been estimated as 5600 km3 coon and sheets 2006 comparable to the volume of lake michigan withdrawals are from discontinuous surficial aquifers of alluvial and glacial origin present throughout the basin as well as consolidated carbonate and sandstone aquifers grannemann et al 2000 coon and sheets 2006 more wells are installed in the surficial aquifers than any other geologic unit glsab ijc 2010 although bedrock wells are also important sources of drinking water bradbury and runkel 2011 the hydrogeological setting and construction of wells used in this study are discussed in section 3 2 3 methods 3 1 conceptual basis of age distributions the representation of the groundwater age distribution in a well needs to be simple enough to allow a unique solution while also incorporating the basic attributes of age distributions a single sample of groundwater contains a distribution of water ages rather than a single age because mixing occurs via diffusion and dispersion in aquifer materials during transport varni and carrera 1998 weissmann et al 2002 engdahl et al 2012 as well as from different vertical and circumferential locations on a well screen or open interval in bedrock contributing water into a well and therefore to a single mixed sample green et al 2010 horn and harter 2009 henri and harter 2019 these processes can produce complex age distributions with multiple peaks varni and carrera 1998 green et al 2014 and heavy tails zhang et al 2013 contained within a single well water sample for most purposes however the complexity of the representation of the age distribution within a water sample generates less uncertainty than other factors such as quantity and quality of age tracer data eberts et al 2012 green et al 2014 green et al 2014 used calibration of multiple forms of the age distribution in a well water sample by using synthetic simulated data and found that an advection dispersion equation ade based age distribution similar to the inverse gaussian performed favorably for predicting age and solute concentrations in wells the current study uses the ade approach section 3 6 to estimate the age distributions in well samples with age tracer data while more complex solutions have been applied for some samples with multiple age tracers e g solder 2019 use of the ade in this study allows characterization of the age distribution based primarily on a single parameter mean age section 3 6 that can be used as a target for a machine learning model in a complex region sections 3 2 3 5 3 2 well selection and groundwater chemistry compilation a database of groundwater chemistry was constructed for the glb study area by selecting all available samples with analytes relevant to non point source water quality see below from publicly available data sources the study area included a 100 km buffer region around the great lakes basin boundary to expand the dataset in areas of limited measurements fig 1 samples from the same day were averaged and samples taken in the same wells but on a different day were treated as unique samples the chemistry database consisted of seven atmospheric age tracers used to estimate tracer based age distributions tritium tritiogenic helium carbon 14 chlorofluorocarbons 11 12 and 113 and sulfur hexafluoride as well as 21 chemical constituents e g nitrate oxygen iron silica for use as predictor variables chemical data were from publicly available sources solder 2019 solder and jurgens 2019 jurgens et al 2017 green et al 2018 usgs 2020 and are compiled in the supplementary material table s1 the final data set included 15 296 samples 14 335 samples without an age tracer measurement and 961 samples with an age tracer measurement from over 6 000 unique locations sampled between the years 1979 2017 characteristics of the chemical data are discussed in section 4 1 samples were selected based on date and well characteristics to provide an internally consistent set of data samples were limited to the time period of age tracer availability may 1979 to july 2017 so that the set of samples for prediction would represent the same time period as the samples used to develop the gbm model samples from wells deeper than 152 m and wells in confined aquifers were removed from the analysis to emphasize the shallow groundwater under the influence of modern land use practices while maintaining an adequate number of age tracer data the 152 m 500 ft cutoff was based on initial analysis of the dataset which revealed relatively few wells deeper than the cutoff and few age tracer measurements from the deeper versus shallower wells the majority of wells were medium diameter construction typically for domestic use as described below in unconsolidated sediments detailed well construction information provided indirect information about well type of the wells with available construction info 55 of all wells 24 had construction typical of monitoring wells 5 08 cm diameter plastic construction 55 had construction typical of domestic wells 10 16 to 15 24 cm diameter steel construction and 21 had greater diameters common for public water supplies national aquifer codes were available for 65 of the study wells of those 64 were in sand and gravel aquifers glaciated regions 10 were in silurian devonian aquifers 11 were in other aquifers consisting of local consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers and the remainder were in various consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers wells were sampled using equipment and techniques according to usgs standard procedures usgs 2006 wilde 2010 initial summary and spatial analysis of the dataset revealed several hundred samples with low ph less than about 4 5 and relatively high iron concentrations average of around 400 000 µg l most of the low ph and high iron samples were clustered in clarion county pennsylvania a region with historical strip mining the low ph and high iron samples likely represent groundwater affected by acid mine drainage and were removed from further analysis due to the highly clustered location and unique chemistry samples marked as contaminated in the national water information system nwis database usgs 2020 were also removed from further analysis 3 3 treatment of detection limits censored value imputation reported concentrations marked as not detected above the laboratory detection limit were imputed according to a log normal imputation routine lubin et al 2004 palarea albaladejo and martin fernandez 2015 the routine estimated a random value between zero and the reported detection limit for each sample such that the estimated values of the censored data conformed to a best fit log normal distribution for the set of estimated and non censored measurements for that constituent with the exception of temperature tritium chlorofluorocarbons 11 12 and 113 and sulfur hexafluoride chemical constituents with a reported value of zero were replaced with the most common detection limit or in cases where the most common detection limit was relatively high with the second most common detection limit marked as censored and imputed 3 4 well characteristics compilation the final database included well depth depth to water depth to top and bottom of open interval and sample depth well characteristics were obtained from the national water information system usgs 2020 and are compiled in supplementary materials tables s2 and s3 hole depth was substituted for well depth when well depth was not available depth to water measurements downloaded for the sampling sites were averaged by site and day to create a unique set of water level measurements by day some sites had multiple measurements per day depth to water measurements were assigned to samples by site and sample day often a depth to water measurement was not available for the well on the sampling day in this case the sample was assigned a depth to water measurement from the closest measurement date within a 30 day window the sample depth was calculated as the distance from the water table to the center of the saturated open interval of the well for samples with available information 3 5 explanatory variables a database of 123 publicly available explanatory variables was compiled including chemistry and well characteristics above and gis attributed variables that characterized the climate land use hydrogeology soil characteristics and hydrological position of the sample locations tables s2 and s3 land use characteristics were sampled in 1974 and 1982 based on availability relevance to the time frame of the samples and for the potential to represent two different fingerprints on age the explanatory variables were attributed to sampling sites in arcgis by either point extract or summary statistics within 500 m radius circular buffers around each site from raster or shapefile coverages of each variable after gis variable attribution the final dataset was separated into two samples with age tracer measurements and samples without n 961 and n 14 335 the dataset with age tracer measurements was further subdivided into a training dataset representing eighty percent of the samples with age tracer measurements and a sequestered hold out dataset to test the predictive capability of the final model representing twenty percent of the samples with age tracer measurements the dataset without age tracer measurements was used to compute a mean total travel time prediction based on each well s associated explanatory variables for samples across the glb 3 6 groundwater age estimation to build the training and hold out datasets for the statistical machine learning model section 3 7 a tracer based age distribution was estimated for each sample in the database table s1 a single age distribution was estimated for samples with multiple age tracer measurements section 4 1 the tracer based age distribution was estimated by adjusting the mean age of the sample to provide as close a match as possible between the observed and estimated tracer concentrations the procedure was based on a simplified version of the vertical flux method welch et al 2011 liao et al 2012 green et al 2018 this approach of adjusting the age distribution to provide as close as possible a match to an observed tracer concentration is widely used in age estimation approaches such as tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 and is applicable to any groundwater sample in which the tracer concentrations are representative of the date of recharge a fundamental assumption of age tracing methods in the age estimation algorithm the calculation of tracer concentrations depends on the age distribution of the sample and the input over time of the tracer the reactive transport of a solute can be modeled over a range of times at a sample point with a convolution equation e g zuber and maloszewski 1982 1 c s t t c 0 t g t t exp k t t d t where cs is the sampled concentration m l3 of tracer at sample date t c0 is the concentration at the date t when the solute enters the subsurface g is an age distribution describing output of a conservative tracer injected instantaneously at the inlet and k is a first order decay rate coefficient 1 t the total travel time between input at ground surface and time of sampling is defined as τ t t and includes travel time in the unsaturated and saturated zones see below individual tracers were estimated as follows for sf6 and cfcs k was set to zero the first order radioactive decay of 14c and 3h was assumed to begin at time t for 3hetrit produced by decay of tritium the 3hetrit generated in the unsaturated zone is lost to the atmosphere e g osenbrück et al 2006 and so the 3hetrit in the sample is equal to the tritium concentration at the water table minus the tritium concentration in the sample and equation 1 becomes 2 c s h e t t c 0 t t g τ exp k t τ u exp k t τ d t where subscript he is for 3hetrit subscript t is for tritium and τ u is unsaturated zone travel time the total travel time τ is the primary focus of this study and is equal to the sum of the travel times in the unsaturated zone τ u and saturated zone τ s τ τ u τ s these parameters were calibrated as described below the age distribution is governed by advection and dispersion kreft and zuber 1978 małoszewski and zuber 1982 green et al 2018 3 g τ d τ 4 π d τ 3 exp d τ 4 τ 1 τ τ 2 where d is a dimensionless dispersion ratio that can be defined as the transport distance divided by dispersivity assigned a uniform starting value as described below and τ is the mean travel time total unsaturated or saturated use of the dimensionless dispersion ratio d allows generality because a constant value can capture increasing dispersivity over greater transport distances and times as observed previously e g pickens and grisak 1981 this form of the advection dispersion age distribution has been found to produce relatively low errors among various types of travel time distributions ttds with one or two parameters massoudieh et al 2014 green et al 2014 differences of predictions from the various ttd models tend to be relatively small as compared to uncertainty stemming from errors in measurements and historical inputs eberts et al 2012 green et al 2014 visser et al 2014 to estimate the age distribution of a sample the mean age in equation 3 was adjusted to produce as close a match as possible between the modeled tracer concentration and the observed value in cases where multiple mean ages could produce the same tracer concentration the mean age most consistent with regional hydrologic properties was selected based on the following two stage calibration process first the mean total travel time was calibrated for all samples by adjusting homogeneous regional values of effective recharge r unsaturated zone travel time τ u and dispersion parameter d to minimize the differences between observed and estimated age tracer concentrations mean total travel time increases with decreasing r and increasing τ u as shown in equations 8 and 9 of green et al 2018 in the second stage of calibration the mean total travel time was estimated for each well sample independently for each sample with a single tracer n 695 the mean total travel time was calibrated by adjusting r from the starting value 0 22 m yr for any sample with 2 or more tracers n 266 the mean total travel time was further calibrated by adjusting τ u and d if needed to improve the fit of the multiple tracers for both stages of the calibration parameters were adjusted to minimize the sample s objective function φs consisting of the weighted error between the observed and predicted age tracer concentrations 4 φ s j 1 nj ω j 2 c j c j 2 where j is the observation number nj is the number of observations ω j is the weight cj is an observed value and cj is the predicted value the weights were set to 1 0 25cj for all tracers to eliminate effects of different concentration scales except for 14c which was set to 1 2cj based on initial testing that indicated large errors for 14c the objective function φs was minimized using a non linear generalized reduced gradient solver lasdon et al 1978 the tracer based mean ages were natural log transformed for further statistical modeling below in which machine learning was used to extend mean total travel time estimates to wells without tracer data 3 7 statistical machine learning the machine learning technique known as gradient boosting machine gbm friedman 2001 2002 was used to develop a model of groundwater mean total travel time mean travel time from land surface to sample point see equation 3 gbm is an ensemble learning technique based on decision trees a decision tree generates an estimate of an output variable based on optimized thresholds of predictor variables that divide the data into multiple groups breiman et al 1984 for example a basic tree using silica as the only predictor variable could predict that samples with silica concentrations above a certain threshold tend to have a certain travel time based on optimized values of the threshold and the predicted travel time as opposed to methods that use single large trees gbm uses many simplified regression trees or weak learners the algorithm builds each new tree based on the residuals of the previous tree de ath 2007 the method recalculates the estimated value for each observation with each successive tree and the final model is an additive combination of all the trees elith et al 2008 gbm requires the choice of several metaparameters that control model complexity and size the number of trees interaction depth which controls the size of each individual tree the shrinkage factor which controls the value added to each observation s current estimated value at each tree model learning rate and the minimum number of observations in each terminal node friedman 2002 we used gbm within a statistical learning framework nolan et al 2015 that included cross validation tuning of gbm metaparameter combinations to pre screen the combinations for reasonable performance we performed 10 fold cross validation tuning with the training dataset on a range of each of the metaparameters 490 possible combinations with the r package caret kuhn et al 2019 the optimal model metaparameters based on cross validation testing minimum root mean square error rmse zambrano bigiarini 2017 were retained but not selected for final modeling to avoid overfit on the small dataset of tracer based groundwater ages we tested simpler metaparameter combinations that resulted in cross validation testing rmse within one standard error 1se analysis of the minimum cross validation testing rmse while not substantially increasing hold out rmse metaparameter combinations were given a model complexity ranking determined by sorting the combinations by interaction depth shrinkage minimum number of observations in each terminal node reverse order and the number of trees sequestered hold out data served to test the final model after metaparameter evaluation via cross validation tuning the simplest metaparameter combination within one standard error of the best cross validation testing combination that also exhibited adequate predictive performance for the hold out dataset was selected as the 1se model the gbm method can appropriately handle missing values in the predictor variables for both model training and prediction without the need for imputation friedman 2001 gbm manages missing values by the use of surrogate splits within the trees in the case where there is a missing value for the current split variable a split is instead made with another variable that has the highest measure of predictive association with the current variable from among the remaining variables which are not missing breiman et al 1984 a scenario was tested with imputed well characteristics for samples that lacked a reported or measured value initial results indicated reduced model performance when imputed values were used for missing well characteristics versus leaving the values as missing therefore we did not fill in or impute missing well construction characteristics in order to avoid increased uncertainty recursive feature elimination rfe was performed with the 1se model to select a more parsimonious set of predictor variables the r package caret kuhn et al 2019 was used to perform rfe with backwards feature elimination where variables were ranked based on gbm s internal importance ranking scheme and removed one by one in order of lowest importance variables were re ranked with each iteration the method involves a ten fold cross validation and ranks the variables according to a consensus ranking from the results of each fold we chose variables to remove from the model with a backward selection technique based on caret s rfe consensus ranking until the cross validation rfe error increased by about one percent yielding the final model after rfe the final gbm model was run outside of caret using the r package gbm greenwell et al 2019 and tested on the hold out data the final variables were ranked according to their relative normalized importance which is a summary measure of the reduction in model error along model split points for each variable friedman 2001 we compared the estimated mean total travel time to the tracer based mean total travel time for the hold out data to approximately quantify the model estimation error to new data to characterize regional mean total travel time in the glb the final model was used to predict natural log mean total travel time to well sample locations without a measured age tracer fig 1 after prediction mean total travel times in log space were back transformed and bias corrected with a smearing estimator helsel and hirsch 2002 a method that corrects for bias introduced by log transformation of the dependent variable all statistical modeling analysis and prediction was performed with r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 final datasets and tracer based groundwater travel time the final regional dataset consisted of 14 335 samples without an age tracer measurement from 6 782 unique nwis sites at 6 077 unique locations samples are unique by day and sites are unique by depth and geographic location fig 1 and sampled during the time period between may 1979 and july 2017 table 1 lists summary statistics for well characteristics and water level for the samples in the final regional dataset including samples with and without age tracer measurements as mentioned above samples in the dataset were limited to a maximum depth of approximately 152 m the resulting samples had a fairly shallow median depth of about 14 m and 75 of wells were shallower than 32 m representing groundwater more likely to be younger and influenced by modern anthropogenic practices compared to the deeper zones below 152 m the final age tracer dataset consisted of 961 samples with a tracer measurement from 797 unique nwis sites and 702 unique locations which were sampled during the time period between may 1979 and june 2017 fig 1 table s1 of the 961 samples with an age tracer measurement 695 had only one age tracing constituent 128 had two and 138 had three to five measurements table 2 most of the measurements were for tritium n 913 table 2 lists summary statistics for the compiled age tracer measurements after censored value imputation and fit statistics for the measured versus estimated tracer concentrations from the calibration procedure adjustment of mean age in eq 4 the root mean square errors rmses are below 33 of the median for all tracers and r squared values are above 0 8 for all tracers except 14c the low r squared and moderate rmse for 14c reflects high uncertainty for that tracer over the range of relatively young ages for these shallow wells the greater r squared and moderate rmse for the other tracers indicate a close match between estimated and observed concentrations of modern age tracers estimation of the tracer based age distribution for each of the 961 samples with one or more age tracer measurements resulted in a minimum mean total travel time of 0 02 years median of 45 years and maximum of 239 years the 80 20 split of tracer based mean total travel time resulted in 771 samples in the training dataset and 190 samples in the hold out dataset the mean total travel times for the training and hold out datasets were similarly distributed fig 2 4 2 statistical modeling results this analysis provides the first reported results to our knowledge of cross validation of a model of tracer derived age the final gbm model was well fitted to the training data and provided reasonable estimates of the hold out data table 3 and fig 3 the final metaparameters after cross validation tuning and 1se analysis were 2000 for number of trees 6 for interaction depth 0 012 for shrinkage and 8 for minimum number of observations in terminal nodes training and hold out r2 values were 0 96 and 0 57 respectively for the final model and rmse values were 0 28 and 0 85 respectively hold out performance was reasonable and consistent with previous models of groundwater chemistry and transport characteristics for eastern wisconsin nolan et al 2018 table 3 note that outliers with greatest hold out error on fig 3b tended to be very shallow wells the hold out r2 increases to 0 66 and rmse decreases to 0 64 for wells deeper than 5 5 m below ground surface locally many variables determine and are affected by the groundwater age it is therefore not surprising to find differences between the gbm model and the tracer based estimates of age there is substantial uncertainty in tracer based groundwater age estimates green et al 2014 visser et al 2014 massoudieh et al 2014 especially for example for a sample with only a single tracer consisting of a low tritium concentration in the gbm changes in hydrogeochemistry over the timespan of sampling 1979 to 2017 potentially add noise and complexity to the relationships of predictor variables with age for example applicability of nitrate as a surrogate for age depends on agricultural land use changes that may be difficult to capture with a small number of snapshots in time estimates of sample depth may be incorrect in wells with long open intervals and focused inflow at discrete depths these issues point to potential improvements of age estimates through additional groundwater tracer sampling particularly with multiple age tracer measurements in each sample to reduce uncertainty of age estimates as well as predictor variables for groundwater age such as improved characterization of land use hydrogeological and chemical characteristics in this context there is significant value in first order approximations of mean groundwater ages for comparisons and indicators of hydrologic processes recursive feature elimination rfe resulted in 64 final variables supplementary material table s3 in general the model slightly underestimated groundwater total travel time though the calculated percent bias an average measure of the tendency for the model to under or over estimate for hold out data was low at near two percent table 3 removal of the 59 variables by the rfe resulted in less than 2 increase in model hold out rmse 4 3 predictor variables the rfe selected variables were ranked according to the normalized reduction in model error also known as variable importance fig 4 shows the top twelve most important predictor variables in the final model which includes variables related to land use chemistry and hydrology the relationship between each variable and the mean total travel time is visualized using a partial dependence plot pdp which summarizes the model s overall response to a change in the variable fig 5 more specifically a pdp shows the average estimated values among all samples given a range of values for the variable of interest while all other variables are held at their observed value greenwell 2017 fig 5 shows pdps for the top 12 most important variables in the model older groundwater was associated with increasing depth to bottom of well open interval sample depth and fluoride concentration and decreasing nitrate and chloride concentrations relationships between the predictor variables and mean total travel time are discussed in more detail below note that the thickness of each pdp trend line indicates the frequency of data values in the training data e g with a relatively high frequency of wells with depth 20 m which is also reflected in the spacing of the blue tick marks for data deciles on the x axis thin portions of the pdp trend lines and widely spaced deciles indicate relatively scarce data values and reduced relevance of data in those ranges to the prediction model 4 3 1 landscape position factors related to the vertical position of the sample and the position of the well on the topographic landscape often relate to the length of flowpaths between recharge area and sample point fig 6 these factors tended to rank highly among predictor variables as mentioned above depth to bottom of well screen or open interval in bedrock was ranked as the most influential variable in the model this effect was observed predominantly at depths shallower than 30 m where mean total travel time tended to increase sharply with increased depth to the bottom of the open interval fig 5 consistent with standard conceptual models of age depth relationships böhlke 2002 fig 6 depth to bottom of open interval has a greater influence on mean total travel times than depth to top of open interval which was ranked as seventh but exhibited a similar pattern on the pdp fig 5 the sensitivity of groundwater age to the variable depth of the bottom of open interval in addition to depth to top of open interval reflects the influence of screen or open interval length on the sampled horizons the well water is a mixture of water ages entering the well along the length of the screen or open interval horn and harter 2009 green et al 2010 and henri and harter 2019 and at the same depth to bottom of screen longer screens shallower depth to top of screen will include shallower and younger water than shorter screens fig 6 topographic wetness index twi was the next most important landscape position variable after the well depth related variables and the eighth most important variable in the model fig 4 groundwater age tended to increase with increasing twi over the range of high frequency values thicker line weight on fig 5 increasing values of twi indicate increased tendency for an area to exfiltrate groundwater and therefore to have longer flowpaths with greater residence times twi is calculated for any point in a watershed with the equation ln a tan β where a is the upslope area per unit contour length from the location and tan β is the slope at the location wolock and mccabe 1995 greater values of twi indicate areas near a break in slope where a relatively large uphill area transitions to horizontal fig 6 when the water table follows the contours of the land surface such locations tend to correspond to areas of groundwater exfiltration and upward flow due to the change in pressure gradient freeze and witherspoon 1967 winter 1999 conversely low values of twi indicate locations with small contributing areas and steep slopes typical of recharge areas with predominantly downward gradients in groundwater fig 6 freeze and witherspoon 1967 nolan et al 2007 found estimated values of groundwater recharge at sites in the eastern united states were sensitive to the value of twi and twi was inversely related to groundwater recharge and positively related to subsurface contact time 4 3 2 chemistry groundwater chemistry variables were consistently linked to the tracer based ages of the 21 chemical variables tested 18 were retained as relevant variables in the final model see section 3 7 a greater proportion than any other category of variable except well depth table s3 nitrate fluoride ph chloride iron and temperature were in the top twelve most important variables and silica was ranked fifteenth based on the pdps fig 5 older groundwater was associated with lower nitrate and chloride concentrations and with greater temperature iron concentration ph and fluoride concentration older groundwater was also associated with greater silica concentration fig s1 in addition to the top 12 variables shown in fig 5 silica is discussed below for comparison with other studies using silica as an age tracer these findings indicate an opportunity to include a broad range of solutes in characterizing residence times in the great lakes basin chemical indicators of groundwater age show distinct trends depending on anthropogenic versus geogenic origins anthropogenic constituents tend to be associated with modern recharge fig 6 association of nitrate with younger mean ages in groundwater has been observed across a wide range of hydrogeological settings böhlke 2002 koh et al 2006 green et al 2008 gourcy et al 2009 kagabu et al 2017 as a result of increased fluxes from intensifying anthropogenic land uses as well as the tendency for denitrification to remove nitrate from water following reduction of o2 which is relatively uniform in recharge tesoriero and puckett 2011 the relationship is however affected by factors such as sample date denitrification rate and the presence of tile drains spalding and exner 1993 these findings are consistent with other machine learning studies ransom et al 2017 found in agricultural regions of california that groundwater nitrate concentration decreased with increasing groundwater age and increasing depth chloride has also been observed as an anthropogenic constituent the association between chloride and younger groundwater has been observed in local studies of agricultural areas modern agricultural sources of chloride include manure and potassium chloride fertilizers mullaney et al 2009 hamilton et al 1993 hamilton et al 1993 found a significant correlation between nitrate and chloride concentration for wells affected by agricultural activities in the delmarva peninsula usa liao et al 2012 used estimates of agricultural chloride loading as a conservative tracer along with atmospheric age tracers to characterize travel times in vertical profiles of recharging groundwater another major source of chloride in groundwater in the glacial region of the united states which contains the glb is deicing salts applied to roadways in winter months mullaney et al 2009 younger groundwater is more likely to be affected by runoff from deicing salts as well as agricultural practices which is consistent with the trend of decreasing ages associated with increasing chloride concentration figs 5 and 6 increasing groundwater ph iron and fluoride with increasing groundwater age are likely associated with dissolution and interaction with aquifer and bedrock materials along flow paths palmer and cherry 1984 stuyfzand 1999 fig 6 the pdp for ph exhibits a threshold or a steep increase in the predictions between ph of 7 and 8 indicating that younger groundwater age samples tended to be acidic while older samples tended to be alkaline likely due to buffering by carbonate mineral dissolution and other weathering reactions that consume acids stuyfzand 1999 older groundwater ages are associated with greater likelihood of anoxic and alkaline conditions and increased arsenic and iron concentrations in the surrounding glacial aquifer system warner and ayotte 2014 erickson et al 2021 stackelberg et al 2021 a study of groundwater age and oxidation reduction processes in a glacial outwash aquifer in west central minnesota found an increase of iron concentrations due to decreasing redox potential and increasing abundance of more soluble ferrous iron species with an increase in groundwater age puckett and cowdery 2002 as oxidation reduction processes proceed along flow paths oxidation of pyrite and reduction of ferric iron produces soluble ferrous iron groundwater samples from domestic wells in the central glacial deposits of the united states showed that concentration of iron increases with depth and the abundance of redox sensitive species reflected the succession of oxidation reduction reactions mcmahon and chapelle 2008 studies examining groundwater age and fluoride specifically in the glb region are lacking however analysis of fluoride concentrations have shown an increase in concentration with increased residence time and depth in assessment studies of u s aquifers mcmahon et al 2020 and elsewhere kim and jeong 2005 edmunds and smedley 2013 fluoride is influenced by water rock especially granite but also limestone or water sediment interaction edmunds and smedley 2013 fluoride in groundwater in western ohio is from dissolution of minerals containing fluoride within the limestone aquifer odh 2012 results of the current study indicate that an analogous process of weathering of fluoride minerals in bedrock or sediments likely contributes to increased fluoride concentrations with age in some wells in the glb the pdp for silica indicated increasing concentrations with age fig s1 consistent with existing studies that use silica as a proxy for age e g stewart et al 2007 it has long been known that silica tends to increase along flowpaths as silicate minerals are dissolved in a study of aquifer chemistry in the zone of a public supply well in the glacial aquifer system in woodbury connecticut silica saturation had a positive linear relationship with groundwater age and was greater in wells screened in glacial till and bedrock likely due to increased contact time between the groundwater and the quartz source material brown et al 2009 silica also tends to correlate inversely with modern anthropogenic agricultural contaminants severini et al 2020 other studies have used silica to quantify groundwater age locally marçais et al 2018 the current results demonstrate the potential to incorporate such information regionally like geogenic constituents temperature tends to increase with age and depth which is consistent with the pdp for temperature fig 6 classical type curves of temperature profiles predict greater temperatures at greater depth and with lower downward water velocity bredehoeft and papadopulos 1995 both of which correspond to increased mean age temperature profile studies have observed this relationship across a range of settings mansure and reiter 1979 taniguchi et al 1999 reiter 2001 and temperature can correlate with geogenic constituents such as fluoride mcmahon et al 2020 the regional data for this study show a statistically significant positive correlation of temperature with depth p value 0 001 temperature may therefore provide information about transport e g if a well is in a location of upwelling of deeper warmer groundwater or if greater rates of sustained recharge cause downward migration of the shallow groundwater temperature signature fig 6 in the current study the associations of chemical constituents with mean age highlight an opportunity for a paradigm shift in data driven modeling of the age of groundwater samples towards integration of locally variable chemical processes and features to improve regional predictions this advancement is facilitated by the machine learning gbm which is well suited to detecting and segregating the effects of local features in predictor variables into separate branches during the tree building process this is critical for geochemical data which vary depending on local conditions the connection between age and regional chemical variations has been captured in other recent machine learning studies in the glacial aquifer system that predicted ph stackelberg et al 2021 and redox indicators erickson et al 2021 using numerical model estimates of age in the current study the trends of the chemical constituents with respect to mean age fig 5 are relatively monotonic compared for example to twi relatively free of noise compared to percent pasture and are consistent with the prevailing conceptual models of the evolution of sources and of geochemistry along flowpaths these findings demonstrate the potential for incorporation of groundwater chemistry into quantitative estimates of age which has been achieved locally for example with individual constituents e g marçais et al 2018 but not at regional scales leveraging a broad range of constituents 4 3 3 land use the most influential land use variables were 1982 land use as pasture and 1982 land use as crops the pdps of fig 5 do not show a clearly defined relationship between groundwater age and either land use the range of sensitivity to these variables is limited e g 3 15 to 3 25 ln years for pasture though both exhibit local trends for some portions of the plot where observed values are the most common for example for land use as pasture groundwater age tended to increase from 0 to 10 pasture land use and then generally decreased from 10 to 40 pasture pasture land use above 40 represents a small portion of the observed data points indicated by the line thickness and vertical blue tics on fig 5 the land use as crops pdp generally shows older groundwater for samples with higher percentages of land use as crops this trend is consistent with reduction of downward velocities by tile drainage however given the noise in the pdp trends and the complexities of hydrological factors associated with agricultural land uses it is difficult to relate the pdp trends to definitive mechanisms tile drainage irrigation and geographic placement of agricultural lands all can differently affect the age of water at a given depth future studies of age relationships in these land use areas may help to clarify these effects 4 3 4 regional mean total travel time predictions the collection of predicted mean total travel times provides insight into the general characteristics of groundwater ages in wells in the u s portion of the great lakes basin figure s2 the distribution of travel times from ground surface to sample was approximately exponential for the 14 335 samples without a measured age tracer with a mean of 44 6 yr and median of 32 9 yr fig 7 the gbm predicted mean total travel times of samples were generally within the range of the tracer based travel times exponential distributions are consistent with the conceptual model of exponentially distributed residence times in a laterally continuous aquifer with uniform recharge małoszewski and zuber 1982 and have been observed in other broad scale studies of shallow aquifer samples green et al 2016 the high frequency of young ages fig 7 and shallow samples highlights the importance of the shallow groundwater resources for domestic consumption in the great lakes basin the mean and median of the exponential distribution indicate that while some shallow wells will show rapid responses to management actions current changes of solute fluxes near land surface will take decades to propagate to many downgradient wells for the regional predictions a correlation between well depth and age is expected based on rankings of variable importance fig 4 and partial dependencies fig 5 the predicted mean total travel times were categorized based on the quartiles of depth to bottom of open interval for the 12 255 wells with available depth measurements fig 8 the median predicted groundwater travel time for each quartile increased with increasing depth to bottom of open interval category the nonparametric kruskal wallis rank sum test for groundwater total travel time grouped by the quartiles of depth to bottom of open interval was highly significant p value 0 001 and results of the post hoc dunn s test indicated that the distribution of total travel times within each depth category not including the unknown depth category are significantly different from each of the other categories p values 0 001 for all two way comparisons the significance of the trend is not surprising given the large number of predictions and the observed relationships in the partial dependence plots fig 5 the strong influence of well depth as a predictor variable raises questions about the relevance of the additional variables to predictions of age the importance of variables other than well depth on predictions is however evident from the range of predicted ages at a given well depth for example the predicted mean total travel time ranged from 0 5 to 50 years in the first quartile of depths less than 6 1 m fig 8 and there was considerable overlap of the ranges of predicted ages among all depth quartiles such variations of age with depth arise as a result of hydrogeological variability e g gassiat et al 2013 and hydrologic position starn and belitz 2018 fig 6 and necessitate the use of the additional variables other than well depth for improved estimates of age heatmaps show the relevance of the secondary variables other than open interval bottom depth to the predictions of age meaningful patterns of variable interactions with the age predictions across a range of well depths are often consistent with conceptual models of age versus physical and chemical characteristics fig 6 in fig 9 each color panel is for one of the variables that ranked 2nd to 9th in relative importance fig 4 in each panel the color of a pixel shows the average value of the variable in that bin of well depth and mean total travel time consistent gradients of color indicate systematic relationships that pervade the complex decision tree of the gbm the overall gradients in the heatmaps are consistent with the partial dependence plots fig 5 and the prevailing conceptual models of spatial distribution of ages and temporal evolution of geochemistry fig 6 section 4 3 for example older samples at the top of each panel tend to associate with greater yellow and green sample depth fluoride ph and twi as well as lower values blue of no3 the heatmaps also show detailed patterns that indicate relevance of the lower ranked variables in certain ranges of well depths for example a substantial number of samples from wells less than 20 m deep fig 9a show no trend in depth related variables across the range of predicted ages uniform blue columns on left side of fig 9b and 9g but show distinct gradients of no3 f ph and twi across the range of predicted ages similarly wells with predicted ages less than 20 years bottom row show no gradient across well depths for the depth related variables but consistent gradients of no3 twi and to a lesser extent f the influence of chemical variables on predicted age is also evident in time series predictions from the gbm model of mean total travel time for single wells the gbm model can be used to estimate temporal as well as spatial variations of the age distribution which is an important component of vulnerability assessments and understanding groundwater transport processes fig 10 shows wells with more than 10 time series chemistry samples the chemical variables change depending on the date of sampling while the other predictor variables based on location and depth remain constant for each well the ages shown include only samples with the same variables for example if nitrate was sampled on most dates for a well any samples missing nitrate were excluded for that well the violin plots include the individual datapoints and curves showing the kernel smoothed estimate of the data distribution for each well example time series shown on the right of fig 10 indicate long term e g decadal variations the variation of travel times for a well tends to increase as the mean travel time increases with coefficients of variation standard deviation divided by mean ranging from 5 to 15 this predicted variability of mean age is in the range of observations of tracer based ages coefficients of variation from time series of tracer based ages in three wells in new hampshire were 5 9 and 27 levitt et al 2019 5 summary and conclusions we developed a machine learning model of groundwater mean total travel time over a large region encompassing the great lakes basin in the united states with the gradient boosting machine gbm method groundwater mean total travel time was calibrated for groundwater samples with at least one age tracer measurement mostly tritium 3h for 961 groundwater samples the gbm model was trained on the tracer based mean total travel times and a comprehensive dataset of 123 explanatory variables related to climate land use hydrogeology soil characteristics and hydrological position the ability of the model to predict groundwater age was confirmed by cross validation testing and hold out data as well as the consistency of predicted relationships between predictor variables and age with prevailing conceptual models the model estimated the training data well and the fit to hold out data was reasonable considering the relatively small dataset uncertainties of tracer based groundwater ages and simplifications inherent in estimated hydrogeochemical landscape variables it is important to note that age predictions will tend to be poorer for samples affected by processes that are not influential in the sampled locations in the training dataset future collection of tracer data to characterize a wide range of settings therefore remains a critical element in predicting regional ages the current study also highlights the need for methods development of tracer based estimates of groundwater age distributions across large regions with variable hydrogeochemistry future studies may explore combining this type of broad regional approach with mechanistic conceptual or numerical models of travel times based on detailed interpretations of hydrogeology and geochemistry the physical and chemical variables identified as important in this study may serve as ancillary age tracers that can be used in combination with atmospheric age tracers to improve quantitative estimates relevant well characteristics and gis based variables such as topographic wetness index and multi order hydrologic position are widely available groundwater chemistry variables were also consistently important eighteen of 21 chemical variables tested were retained for the final model and fluoride ph chloride iron and temperature ranked in the top 12 most important variables the relationships between age and chemistry in the gbm were consistent with prevailing conceptual models of geochemical evolution along flowpaths based on the influence of chemical variables their ability to provide information about temporal variations of age and their relatively low cost and availability as compared to atmospheric age tracers increased collection and use of chemical data to inform age estimates will be advantageous for future studies and applications of machine learning in this and other study areas predictions of groundwater mean total travel time to the 14 335 samples with no age tracer measurement illustrate the opportunity to use the gbm approach in support of regional water resources assessments the predicted ages indicate decadal time lags of water quality responses at wells to land use changes while depth is a key factor affecting predicted age variability of predicted ages for wells of similar depth was substantial as was variability of time series of ages in individual wells these variations indicate sensitivity of the model to regionally heterogeneous hydrogeochemistry and to temporal chemical signals respectively the ability to distinguish these spatially and temporally local effects across a large region will facilitate improved screening level tools for water resource management age predictions at wells will be useful in estimates of solute reaction rates historical inputs vulnerability assessments and scenario testing for future water quality conditions given the level of uncertainty in the age predictions more work will be needed to achieve accuracy suitable for using age estimates as targets in numerical model calibrations this study provides the first application to our knowledge of a machine learning application to predict the travel time distribution of groundwater samples based on calibrated distributions from age tracer data the proof of concept and identification of key variables relevant to age prediction provides a basis for applications to other study areas future work can build on these findings and fill in gaps in predictive capability an advantage of the current approach is the ability to quantitatively link hydrogeochemical variables to age to improve accuracy of age predictions and better understand the governing processes limitations include uncertainties stemming from errors in tracer based age estimates and input histories limited availability of multi tracer estimates of groundwater age to better characterize the mean and shape of age distributions and lack of detailed hydrogeological information at individual well locations the methods developed in the current study provide synergistic support for understanding local and regional factors affecting age of groundwater samples and can be combined with other numerical or empirical methods to support detailed hydrogeological assessments the current approach to estimate groundwater age can contribute to better understanding of regional flow rates and patterns analysis of reaction rates of solutes such as oxygen and nitrate and assessment of vulnerability of wells to non point source contaminants

hudson sewerage authority nhsa and from other available open sources the land use of the city is predominantly urban with some forest and barren lands the city is underlain by the stockton rock

six months are reported in table 1 of the supporting information si document records of meetings at the local sewerage authority nhsa 2018 which occurred between 2010 and 2018 provided the

state the approximate repair working areas pipes marked with a dashed red line in fig 4 table 2 of the si document summarizes the description of damage and replacement of each pipe shown in fig 4 this dataset was used to verify in a qualitative manner the model as severe groundwater flooding of a sewer network may lead to the erosion of the soil surrounding the pipe with consequent structural collapse it is important to notice that these records contain only the information of damaged pipes that have been renovated possibly a larger number of pipes required intervention but they are not contained within the available dataset 3 modeling 3 1 logistic regression model the probability of the degree of infiltration was determined using a statistical model based on logistic regression which has been previously applied for the prediction of infrastructure deterioration when accounting for several influence factors ariaratnam et al 2001 choi and koo 2015 liu et al 2011 davies et al 2001 koo and ariaratnam 2006 tran et al 2009 wright et al 2006 salman and salem 2011 the probability of the degree of infiltration p j into a j th pipe i e conduit within two manholes is 2 p j e logit

variables which is initially equal to 7 in this work and x 6 j the groundwater influence factor the sum in eq 3 was multiplied by x 6 j in order to account for the location of the aging pipe with respect to the water table on one hand the pipe might be submerged by the groundwater x 6 j 1 but if it is in good structural conditions negligible infiltration occurs on the other hand the pipe is in poor structural conditions large sum in eq 3 but if the pipe is above the water table x 6 j 1 negligible infiltration occurs all the selected model variables are listed in table 1 and they were chosen because corresponding to the most critical factors affecting sewer performance davies et al 2001 chughtai and zayed 2008 ana et al 2009 salman 2010 syachrani et al 2013 van riel et al 2014 shahata and zayed 2015 inanloo et al 2016 the detailed description of each variable is reported in section 3 of the si document the model given by eqs 2 and 3 was calibrated using infiltration measurements fig 3 provided by the local authority upon processing as explained in section data processing therefore the model coefficients i e c 0 through c 7 were estimated then the model was used to determine the probability p in eq 2 of the degree of infiltration into the sewer within the urban laboratory it is important to notice that the dataset used for calibration consists of degree of infiltration assigned to each catchment within the urban laboratory probability of degree of infiltration of unity was assigned to parts of the network where i exceeded a selected threshold while zero probability was assigned to parts of the network where i was below that selected threshold further details are provided in section 3 2 3 2 data processing data regarding the infiltration measurements were processed to convert them into a binary form of probability of degree of infiltration according to epa 1985 standard usepa 1985 the maximum acceptable dry weather flow is 0 45 m3 day per inhabitant 120 gallon day per capita the wastewater discharge in hoboken is approximately 0 28 m3 day per inhabitant suez 2016 therefore the maximum possible infiltration in hoboken is 0 17 m3 day per inhabitant which corresponds to 60 of dwf in order to convert the measurements into a binary form a value of 150 of dwf was selected as a threshold for prioritization of intervention a map reporting the area within hoboken where the infiltration exceeds this threshold is shown in part a of fig 5 the value is approximately twice the acceptable value according to the regulations by u s epa and the state of new jersey this selection was done for demonstration purposes of the model as clearly the infiltration in the site exceeds the epa standards and attention would be required on the whole system the authors would like to point out that this choice was inevitable due to the large recorded infiltration and it does not affect the development of the model which was the main scope of this work the information regarding the location of a conduit with infiltration larger 150 part a of fig 5 was combined with the knowledge of the relative position of a conduit with respect to the average water table part b of fig 5 therefore the probability of the degree of infiltration was determined p j calc part c of fig 5 as it is possible to see in this figure p j calc is equal to unity only for those conduits where i is larger than 150 of dwf and that reside below the water table in total there are 857 sewer pipes with p j calc 1 and 708 with p j calc 0 3 3 data randomization for model calibration and testing the sewer conduits to be used for calibration and testing were selected through random sampling in order to avoid over fitted model or bias caused by data selection kohavi 1995 following previous works sousa et al 2014 ariaratnam et al 2001 a ratio of 8 2 between conduits for calibration and testing was chosen this is a common ratio used for infrastructure risk assessment studies as it follows the pareto principal which maximizes representative sets of data for calibration and testing ripley and hjort 1996 russell and norvig 2016 therefore over a total number of conduits equal to 1 565 a number equal to 1 252 was selected for calibration and the remaining conduits used for testing fig 6 shows a schematic of the data partition for calibration cross validation and testing purpose fig 7 shows the results of the data partition for the sewer pipes 3 4 model calibration model calibration was carried out applying the cross validation method to this aim the function crossval in the machine learning toolbox of matlab mathworks 2018 was used the cross validation method consists on repeating training and validation of a model with a random selection of the data over multiple times the method named k fold also known as v fold was selected because of its low computational cost the number of times was selected equal to 10 arlot and celisse 2010 zhang 1993 therefore the dataset for calibration was divided in 10 groups each time nine sets were used for model calibration and one set for validation this operation was repeated ten times for each step of cross validation the model was calibrated using the matlab function fitglm which aims at minimizing the cook s distance d i of observation or conduit i defined as the sum of all the residuals in the regression model when observation i is removed from it i e 4 d i j 1 n logit j est logit j i calc 2 p σ 2 where logit j est is the logit calculated for selected values of the coefficients using eq 3 logit j i calc is the logit calculated from the observations as derived from eq 2 considering the probability of the degree of infiltration equal to p j calc and removing observation i n is the number of observations p is the number of coefficients in the model σ 2 is the mean squared error of the regression model i e 5 σ 2 j 1 n logit j est logit j calc 2 n p 4 results and discussion in this section the results of model calibration and testing are presented and discussed together with the comparison of the calibrated model to the dataset of sewer repair moreover the results of the uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis are reported 4 1 calibration and testing of the model the model parameters were estimated as explained in section 3 4 their mean values c j together with the standard deviation σ j and p values are listed in table 2 the efron s pseudo r 2 was equal to 0 67 and the correct prediction during calibration was up to 81 55 the correct prediction in logistic regression refers to a predicted probability in our case the probability of the degree of infiltration with a value larger than 0 5 for cases with probability equal to 1 or otherwise as it is possible to see in table 2 some of the coefficients are positive whereas two of them i e that of the bias term and the gradient influence factor c 3 are negative positive coefficients confirm the relevance of the corresponding influence factors to groundwater infiltration contrarily a negative coefficient indicates a poor significance of the influence factor in this case the pipe gradient while a negative bias term is due to zero probability of the degree of infiltration which occurs in some parts of the sewer network furthermore only coefficients c 1 c 2 c 6 c 7 have good identificability as their p values and standard deviation are small i e less than 0 05 and one order of magnitude smaller than the mean value respectively in previous studies chughtai and zayed 2008 salman 2010 sousa et al 2014 koo and ariaratnam 2006 tran et al 2009 it has been observed that the gradient of a pipe or the maximum velocity of the flow within the pipe has very limited influence on the sewer structural deterioration and therefore groundwater infiltration whereas the number of joints have received contradictory remarks earlier works show that if on one hand several joints can favor infiltration or leakage at the joint davies et al 2001 sousa et al 2014 on the other hand the presence of joints may reduce the risk of pipe bending and therefore formation of crack along the walls mitigating the occurrence of either infiltration or leakage chughtai and zayed 2008 regarding the effect of traffic it is sometimes considered a moderate critical factor inducing pipe deterioration davies et al 2001 salman 2010 however in this work the role of traffic load on pipe aging is uncertain due to the peculiarity of the investigated site where the geology soil type surroundings the pipes and the ductility material of the pipe are more instead important factors on the basis of these considerations a reduced number of influence factors namely ductility soil water table and size and shape was selected and then the reduced model calibrated again the list of the estimated parameter values is reported in table 3 the efron s pseudo r 2 was equal to 0 67 and the correct prediction during calibration was up to 81 71 the cross validation shows a mean square error of 0 1377 between the estimated coefficient in different folds as it possible to see in this table the coefficients are all positive and the p values lower than 1 10 3 indicating significance and good identificability of all selected influence factors in order to determine the spatial correlation of the selected influence factors correlation coefficients using the matlab function fitglm were calculated their values are reported in table 3 of the si document it is possible to notice a correlation coefficient of 0 47 between influence factors x 1 and x 7 this is because the ductility and size and shape are both related to the pipe material therefore one of the two coefficient may be eliminated from the model moreover a negative correlation coefficient of 0 35 was determined for x 6 and x 7 this is not a causal relationship as it is instead associated to the development of the city it may not exist in other urban areas in the east part of the area the sewer is made of flexible pipes which are submerged by the shallow aquifer whereas along the west side the pipes are rigid because of bigger diameter and above the water table here the sewer collects all the water discharged in hoboken which in the past was conveyed untreated to the river while now it is deliver to the wastewater treatment plant and partially discharged into the hudson river estuary as overflows moreover the correlation coefficient of 0 5 between x 6 and x 2 was calculated this is due to the nature of the urban laboratory which was in the past covered by water in the eastern side where the soil is softer this correlation is not expected in other urban areas but is a peculiarity of hoboken the calibrated reduced model was finally tested on randomly chosen sewer pipes within the entire network as explained in section 3 3 and the results are shown in fig 8 the efron s pseudo r 2 only dropped of 0 01 from 0 67 to 0 66 and the correct prediction increased up to 82 11 indicating a very good agreement of the formulated model with the measurements of infiltration these results suggest that the proposed model is a valuable tool to identify sewer pipes affected by groundwater flooding and requiring renovation upon calibration the model was used to create an overall probability map of the degree of infiltration the results were then compared with the historical dataset of sewer repair section 2 2 to understand if structural damage was associated to groundwater flooding of the infrastructure the simulation results are shown in fig 9 comparing them with the data in fig 4 it is possible to notice that the largest amount of sewer pipes undergone repair reside in a area with the largest probability of the degree of infiltration which is in the south eastern part of the city it is important to point out that the model is calibrated with measurements of infiltration accounting for the position of the sewer network with respect to the water table structural damage of the sewer above the water may occur but it cannot be predicted with the calibrated model measurements of wastewater leakage from the sewer pipes towards the shallow aquifer could be integrated within the training dataset complementing the current one future work will consider this and extend the model to include sewer leakage 4 2 uncertainty quantification in this section the results from the uncertainty quantification accounting for no infiltration threshold and neglecting pipes with unknown conditions are reported and discussed 4 2 1 no infiltration threshold initially we considered the uncertainty in the model prediction due to the setting of an infiltration threshold in section 3 2 we set 150 of dwf as the threshold to divide the measured infiltration as binary format briefly we assigned p j calc 1 for sewer pipes were below average groundwater table located in catchments with infiltration above 150 of dwf and we assigned p j calc 0 for sewer pipes that were above average groundwater table or located in catchment with infiltration below 150 of dwf to quantify the uncertainty in the model prediction due to the selection of this threshold we removed the threshold and we normalized the degree of infiltration between 0 and 1 scale p j norm in detail we assigned p j norm 1 to pipes below groundwater and located in the catchment with the largest infiltration i e h7 where i 632 of dwf as shown in fig 4 then we assigned of p j norm 0 to pipes above groundwater for the remaining parts of the network we assigned a value of p j norm as 6 p j norm i j i h 7 where i j is the infiltration into the j th pipe and i h 7 is the infiltration of catchment h7 upon the calculation of the new probability of the degree of infiltration p j norm we calibrated the model again the resulting estimates of the model coefficients are listed in table 4 of the si document similarly to the results in the previous approach with threshold coefficients c 3 c 4 c 7 are characterized by large p values therefore we have removed them from the model formulate and re performed the calibration the final results of the reduced model without threshold are listed in table 5 of the si document and shown in fig 10 together with the values of the other two calibrations approaches i e considering the infiltration threshold and all pipes section 4 1 and eliminating the pipes with unknown conditions section 4 2 2 for comparison the efron s pseudo r 2 was equal to 0 64 for the calibration dataset and equal to 0 63 for the test dataset which are close to those determined for the calibration approach with threshold namely 0 67 and 0 66 correspondingly this suggests even without setting a threshold the model is able to provide a good prediction regarding the p values they increase for all coefficients except for that related to water table c 6 because the relative position of the pipe with respect of the groundwater table is critical in this new approach moreover the p value of coefficient related to the soil type c 2 increases significantly this is because in the new approach the variability of the soil composition is much smaller then the resolution of the modelling approach 4 2 2 elimination of the pipes with unknown conditions here sewer pipes with unknown conditions were excluded from the modeling approach considering the infiltration threshold of 150 of dfw among a total of 1 565 pipes 48 sewer pipes were eliminated from the model table 6 in the si document lists the coefficient values and similar to the previous cases coefficients c 3 c 4 c 7 are characterized by large p values therefore the model was reduced and re calibrated table 7 in the si document and fig 10 report the final coefficient values as we can see in this figure there is no significant difference between the model with and without the sewer with unknown conditions in the presence of a infiltration threshold this is because of the negligible amount of this type pf pipes as a matter of fact the efron s pseudo r 2 for the train dataset was equal to 0 67 and that for the test dataset was equal to 0 66 4 3 sensitivity analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis on the reduced model with infiltration threshold of 150 of dfw to understand the effect of influence factors that can assumed values of 0 0 5 and 1 table 1 namely c 2 c 6 and c 7 to this aim the values of a factor were modified from 0 5 to 1 by keeping the values of the others unchanged tables 8 through 10 in the si document list the results for the sensitivity analysis if on one hand the coefficients values as well as the p values in the sensitivity analysis of c 2 and c 7 are not significantly different from those calculated in the reference reduced model table 3 on the other hand the coefficients values and the p values upon the sensitivity analysis of c 6 tables 9 in the si document show a major difference with the corresponding values in the reduced model table 3 as expected because the model is not linear with respect to the influence factor c 6 associated to the groundwater table 5 conclusion this paper reports a statistical model based on influence factors of material size and shape of the sewer pipes soil type and water table level which aids to determine the probability of the degree of groundwater infiltration into a sewer system a coastal urban area was selected for the proof of concept of this approach and field measurements of infiltration were used to calibrate and test the model through a machine learning process simulations show a very good agreement between the model and the infiltration measurements with an accuracy of approximately 82 sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out and results show that the most important parameter is the water table of the shallow aquifer as expected comparing the simulations with historical data of sewer repair it is possible to see that the replaced pipes fall in a part of the network affected by severe groundwater infiltration confirming that infiltration and significant structural damage are indeed strongly related overall the model leads to a map to plan strategic intervention and mitigate two major negative consequences of sewer deterioration i e combined sewer overflows csos because of groundwater infiltration and structural failure it has the advantage to rely on low resolution infiltration measurements at the catchment scale which are much more cost effective characterizations of a sewer condition than traditional cctv surveys and improve their resolution by accounting for local properties of the networks here identified as influence factors credit authorship contribution statement ting liu data curation conceptualization

poor structural conditions large sum in eq 3 but if the pipe is above the water table x 6 j 1 negligible infiltration occurs all the selected model variables are listed in table 1 and they were chosen because corresponding to the most critical factors affecting sewer performance davies et al 2001 chughtai and zayed 2008 ana et al 2009 salman 2010 syachrani et al 2013 van riel et al 2014 shahata and zayed 2015 inanloo et al 2016 the detailed description of each variable is reported in section 3 of the si document the model given by eqs 2 and 3 was calibrated using infiltration measurements fig 3 provided by the local authority upon processing as explained in section data processing therefore the model coefficients i e c 0 through c 7 were estimated then the model was used to determine the probability p in eq 2 of the degree of infiltration into the sewer within the urban laboratory it is important to notice that the dataset used for calibration consists of degree of infiltration assigned to each catchment within the urban laboratory probability of degree of infiltration of unity was assigned to parts of the network where i exceeded a selected threshold while zero probability was assigned to parts of the network where i was below that selected threshold further details are provided in section 3 2 3 2 data processing data regarding the infiltration measurements were processed to convert them into a binary form of probability of degree of infiltration according to epa 1985 standard usepa 1985 the maximum acceptable dry weather flow is 0 45 m3 day per inhabitant 120 gallon day per capita the wastewater discharge in hoboken is approximately 0 28 m3 day per inhabitant suez 2016 therefore the maximum possible infiltration in hoboken is 0 17 m3 day per inhabitant which corresponds to 60 of dwf in order to convert the measurements into a binary form a value of 150 of dwf was selected as a threshold for prioritization of intervention a map reporting the area within hoboken where the infiltration exceeds this threshold is shown in part a of fig 5 the value is approximately twice the acceptable value according to the regulations by u s epa and the state of new jersey this selection was done for demonstration purposes of the model as clearly the infiltration in the site exceeds the epa standards and attention would be required on the whole system the authors would like to point out that this choice was inevitable due to the large recorded infiltration and it does not affect the development of the model which was the main scope of this work the information regarding the location of a conduit with infiltration larger 150 part a of fig 5 was combined with the knowledge of the relative position of a conduit with respect to the average water table part b of fig 5 therefore the probability of the degree of infiltration was determined p j calc part c of fig 5 as it is possible to see in this figure p j calc is equal to unity only for those conduits where i is larger than 150 of dwf and that reside below the water table in total there are 857 sewer pipes with p j calc 1 and 708 with p j calc 0 3 3 data randomization for model calibration and testing the sewer conduits to be used for calibration and testing were selected through random sampling in order to avoid over fitted model or bias caused by data selection kohavi 1995 following previous works sousa et al 2014 ariaratnam et al 2001 a ratio of 8 2 between conduits for calibration and testing was chosen this is a common ratio used for infrastructure risk assessment studies as it follows the pareto principal which maximizes representative sets of data for calibration and testing ripley and hjort 1996 russell and norvig 2016 therefore over a total number of conduits equal to 1 565 a number equal to 1 252 was selected for calibration and the remaining conduits used for testing fig 6 shows a schematic of the data partition for calibration cross validation and testing purpose fig 7 shows the results of the data partition for the sewer pipes 3 4 model calibration model calibration was carried out applying the cross validation method to this aim the function crossval in the machine learning toolbox of matlab mathworks 2018 was used the cross validation method consists on repeating training and validation of a model with a random selection of the data over multiple times the method named k fold also known as v fold was selected because of its low computational cost the number of times was selected equal to 10 arlot and celisse 2010 zhang 1993 therefore the dataset for calibration was divided in 10 groups each time nine sets were used for model calibration and one set for validation this operation was repeated ten times for each step of cross validation the model was calibrated using the matlab function fitglm which aims at minimizing the cook s distance d i of observation or conduit i defined as the sum of all the residuals in the regression model when observation i is removed from it i e 4 d i j 1 n logit j est logit j i calc 2 p σ 2 where logit j est is the logit calculated for selected values of the coefficients using eq 3 logit j i calc is the logit calculated from the observations as derived from eq 2 considering the probability of the degree of infiltration equal to p j calc and removing observation i n is the number of observations p is the number of coefficients in the model σ 2 is the mean squared error of the regression model i e 5 σ 2 j 1 n logit j est logit j calc 2 n p 4 results and discussion in this section the results of model calibration and testing are presented and discussed together with the comparison of the calibrated model to the dataset of sewer repair moreover the results of the uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis are reported 4 1 calibration and testing of the model the model parameters were estimated as explained in section 3 4 their mean values c j together with the standard deviation σ j and p values are listed in table 2 the efron s pseudo r 2 was equal to 0 67 and the correct prediction during calibration was up to 81 55 the correct prediction in logistic regression refers to a predicted probability in our case the probability of the degree of infiltration with a value larger than 0 5 for cases with probability equal to 1 or otherwise as it is possible to see in table 2 some of the coefficients are positive whereas two of them i e that of the bias term and the gradient influence factor c 3 are negative positive coefficients confirm the relevance of the corresponding influence factors to groundwater infiltration contrarily a negative coefficient indicates a poor significance of the influence factor in this case the pipe gradient while a negative bias term is due to zero probability of the degree of infiltration which occurs in some parts of the sewer network furthermore only coefficients c 1 c 2 c 6 c 7 have good identificability as their p values and standard deviation are small i e less than 0 05 and one order of magnitude smaller than the mean value respectively in previous studies chughtai and zayed 2008 salman 2010 sousa et al 2014 koo and ariaratnam 2006 tran et al 2009 it has been observed that the gradient of a pipe or the maximum velocity of the flow within the pipe has very limited influence on the sewer structural deterioration and therefore groundwater infiltration whereas the number of joints have received contradictory remarks earlier works show that if on one hand several joints can favor infiltration or leakage at the joint davies et al 2001 sousa et al 2014 on the other hand the presence of joints may reduce the risk of pipe bending and therefore formation of crack along the walls mitigating the occurrence of either infiltration or leakage chughtai and zayed 2008 regarding the effect of traffic it is sometimes considered a moderate critical factor inducing pipe deterioration davies et al 2001 salman 2010 however in this work the role of traffic load on pipe aging is uncertain due to the peculiarity of the investigated site where the geology soil type surroundings the pipes and the ductility material of the pipe are more instead important factors on the basis of these considerations a reduced number of influence factors namely ductility soil water table and size and shape was selected and then the reduced model calibrated again the list of the estimated parameter values is reported in table 3 the efron s pseudo r 2 was equal to 0 67 and the correct prediction during calibration was up to 81 71 the cross validation shows a mean square error of 0 1377 between the estimated coefficient in different folds as it possible to see in this table the coefficients are all positive and the p values lower than 1 10 3 indicating significance and good identificability of all selected influence factors in order to determine the spatial correlation of the selected influence factors correlation coefficients using the matlab function fitglm were calculated their values are reported in table 3 of the si document it is possible to notice a correlation coefficient of 0 47 between influence factors x 1 and x 7 this is because the ductility and size and shape are both related to the pipe material therefore one of the two coefficient may be eliminated from the model moreover a negative correlation coefficient of 0 35 was determined for x 6 and x 7 this is not a causal relationship as it is instead associated to the development of the city it may not exist in other urban areas in the east part of the area the sewer is made of flexible pipes which are submerged by the shallow aquifer whereas along the west side the pipes are rigid because of bigger diameter and above the water table here the sewer collects all the water discharged in hoboken which in the past was conveyed untreated to the river while now it is deliver to the wastewater treatment plant and partially discharged into the hudson river estuary as overflows moreover the correlation coefficient of 0 5 between x 6 and x 2 was calculated this is due to the nature of the urban laboratory which was in the past covered by water in the eastern side where the soil is softer this correlation is not expected in other urban areas but is a peculiarity of hoboken the calibrated reduced model was finally tested on randomly chosen sewer pipes within the entire network as explained in section 3 3 and the results are shown in fig 8 the efron s pseudo r 2 only dropped of 0 01 from 0 67 to 0 66 and the correct prediction increased up to 82 11 indicating a very good agreement of the formulated model with the measurements of infiltration these results suggest that the proposed model is a valuable tool to identify sewer pipes affected by groundwater flooding and requiring renovation upon calibration the model was used to create an overall probability map of the degree of infiltration the results were then compared with the historical dataset of sewer repair section 2 2 to understand if structural damage was associated to groundwater flooding of the infrastructure the simulation results are shown in fig 9 comparing them with the data in fig 4 it is possible to notice that the largest amount of sewer pipes undergone repair reside in a area with the largest probability of the degree of infiltration which is in the south eastern part of the city it is important to point out that the model is calibrated with measurements of infiltration accounting for the position of the sewer network with respect to the water table structural damage of the sewer above the water may occur but it cannot be predicted with the calibrated model measurements of wastewater leakage from the sewer pipes towards the shallow aquifer could be integrated within the training dataset complementing the current one future work will consider this and extend the model to include sewer leakage 4 2 uncertainty quantification in this section the results from the uncertainty quantification accounting for no infiltration threshold and neglecting pipes with unknown conditions are reported and discussed 4 2 1 no infiltration threshold initially we considered the uncertainty in the model prediction due to the setting of an infiltration threshold in section 3 2 we set 150 of dwf as the threshold to divide the measured infiltration as binary format briefly we assigned p j calc 1 for sewer pipes were below average groundwater table located in catchments with infiltration above 150 of dwf and we assigned p j calc 0 for sewer pipes that were above average groundwater table or located in catchment with infiltration below 150 of dwf to quantify the uncertainty in the model prediction due to the selection of this threshold we removed the threshold and we normalized the degree of infiltration between 0 and 1 scale p j norm in detail we assigned p j norm 1 to pipes below groundwater and located in the catchment with the largest infiltration i e h7 where i 632 of dwf as shown in fig 4 then we assigned of p j norm 0 to pipes above groundwater for the remaining parts of the network we assigned a value of p j norm as 6 p j norm i j i h 7 where i j is the infiltration into the j th pipe and i h 7 is the infiltration of catchment h7 upon the calculation of the new probability of the degree of infiltration p j norm we calibrated the model again the resulting estimates of the model coefficients are listed in table 4 of the si document similarly to the results in the previous approach with threshold coefficients c 3 c 4 c 7 are characterized by large p values therefore we have removed them from the model formulate and re performed the calibration the final results of the reduced model without threshold are listed in table 5 of the si document and shown in fig 10 together with the values of the other two calibrations approaches i e considering the infiltration threshold and all pipes section 4 1 and eliminating the pipes with unknown conditions section 4 2 2 for comparison the efron s pseudo r 2 was equal to 0 64 for the calibration dataset and equal to 0 63 for the test dataset which are close to those determined for the calibration approach with threshold namely 0 67 and 0 66 correspondingly this suggests even without setting a threshold the model is able to provide a good prediction regarding the p values they increase for all coefficients except for that related to water table c 6 because the relative position of the pipe with respect of the groundwater table is critical in this new approach moreover the p value of coefficient related to the soil type c 2 increases significantly this is because in the new approach the variability of the soil composition is much smaller then the resolution of the modelling approach 4 2 2 elimination of the pipes with unknown conditions here sewer pipes with unknown conditions were excluded from the modeling approach considering the infiltration threshold of 150 of dfw among a total of 1 565 pipes 48 sewer pipes were eliminated from the model table 6 in the si document lists the coefficient values and similar to the previous cases coefficients c 3 c 4 c 7 are characterized by large p values therefore the model was reduced and re calibrated table 7 in the si document and fig 10 report the final coefficient values as we can see in this figure there is no significant difference between the model with and without the sewer with unknown conditions in the presence of a infiltration threshold this is because of the negligible amount of this type pf pipes as a matter of fact the efron s pseudo r 2 for the train dataset was equal to 0 67 and that for the test dataset was equal to 0 66 4 3 sensitivity analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis on the reduced model with infiltration threshold of 150 of dfw to understand the effect of influence factors that can assumed values of 0 0 5 and 1 table 1 namely c 2 c 6 and c 7 to this aim the values of a factor were modified from 0 5 to 1 by keeping the values of the others unchanged tables 8 through 10 in the si document list the results for the sensitivity analysis if on one hand the coefficients values as well as the p values in the sensitivity analysis of c 2 and c 7 are not significantly different from those calculated in the reference reduced model table 3 on the other hand the coefficients values and the p values upon the sensitivity analysis of c 6 tables 9 in the si document show a major difference with the corresponding values in the reduced model table 3 as expected because the model is not linear with respect to the influence factor c 6 associated to the groundwater table 5 conclusion this paper reports a statistical model based on influence factors of material size and shape of the sewer pipes soil type and water table level which aids to determine the probability of the degree of groundwater infiltration into a sewer system a coastal urban area was selected for the proof of concept of this approach and field measurements of infiltration were used to calibrate and test the model through a machine learning process simulations show a very good agreement between the model and the infiltration measurements with an accuracy of approximately 82 sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out and results show that the most important parameter is the water table of the shallow aquifer as expected comparing the simulations with historical data of sewer repair it is possible to see that the replaced pipes fall in a part of the network affected by severe groundwater infiltration confirming that infiltration and significant structural damage are indeed strongly related overall the model leads to a map to plan strategic intervention and mitigate two major negative consequences of sewer deterioration i e combined sewer overflows csos because of groundwater infiltration and structural failure it has the advantage to rely on low resolution infiltration measurements at the catchment scale which are much more cost effective characterizations of a sewer condition than traditional cctv surveys and improve their resolution by accounting for local properties of the networks here identified as influence factors credit authorship contribution statement ting liu data curation conceptualization
