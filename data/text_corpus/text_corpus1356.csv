addition examples with three consumers are provided similarly keywords water resource management differential game model discretized solution nash equilibrium pareto optimality cooperation 1 introduction the peril of the decreasing water resources which are usable for the human society is well known the problem has reached a critical level which must be handled locally and globally as well budapest water summit 2016 chen et al 2018 the crisis is caused by the increasing consumption of the inhabitants industry and agriculture besides the pollution of the environment yang et al 2018 and within that increasing pollution of water chen et al 2017b in the field of agriculture which is likely the largest water consumer irrigation stands for a very significant amount that grows increasingly partly because of accelerating global warming lauffenburger et al 2018 consequently in addition to the development of environmental protection and economical water use it is indispensable for the sustainable water supply of our human society to distribute the available water resources with maximal efficiency among the different consumers while assuring the needed time for natural recharge of the water ziolkowska and peterson 2017 the theoretically established effective tool for the solution of this allocation problem is mathematical modelling with special regard to the methods of game theory for a general overview of the different fields of application of game theory in water resource management we refer the reader to the early work of bogárdi and szidarovszky 1976 and the recent works of madani 2010 and podimata and yannopoulos 2015 a business simulation game is applied for irrigation water policy impact at farmers level in bucholz et al 2016 the results show that a water quota is able to reduce the irrigation applications while a water pricing scheme has no effect leader follower stackelberg games are applied for water resource management problems in chen et al 2017a kicsiny et al 2014 and kicsiny 2017 where some players leaders have priority with respect to time before other players followers a two level game including one main game and four sub games is given in wei et al 2010 to describe a water allocation problem in china in zanjanian et al 2018 a water allocation problem among organizational stakeholders is solved with game theoretical tools more particularly with the so called gmcr graph model for conflict resolution method the paper madani and hooshyar 2014 presents a game theoretical reinforcement learning method for social planners to optimize their policies in multi operator multi reservoir systems differential games are special games governed by differential equations accordingly the players move continuously in time from an initial time point to a final one in such games negri 1989 models common property aquifers by means of a differential game negri deals with both open loop solutions where the players commit themselves at the beginning of the game to their strategies pumping rates in all future periods and feedback solutions where they can adapt their strategies during the game similarly xin and sun 2018 analyse open loop feedback and so called closed loop equilibria in a differential oligopoly game for a dual decision problem involving optimal production planning and water savings in closed loop approaches the players are aware of all former states of the game up to the current time point the work xin and li 2013 serves with a price game model for irrigation water use the proposed differential game exhibits bifurcation and chaos corresponding to the price changes of the players firms over time in yi et al 2017 the cooperation of two asymmetric nations is modelled with a stochastic differential game for reducing trans boundary pollution of water or air the governments of the nations can cooperate while the government and the polluting industrial firms play a stackelberg game in each nation it is shown that the governments being cooperative make a higher pollution abatement effort than when they are non cooperative it can be stated generally that the cooperative solution of a game provides at least the same high payoff for each player as the non cooperative one otherwise one or more players would upset the cooperation so the solution would not be actually cooperative accordingly the cooperative solution leads to at least the same high system payoff sum of players payoffs as the case when the players prefer conflicting non cooperative interests besides cooperative and non cooperative solutions of a game another key issue to be studied is the so called pareto optimality pareto optimality of solutions is a widely investigated aspect both in cooperative and non cooperative games and more generally in multi objective problems gatti and sandholm 2014 since pareto optimality means no other solution is better on at least one criteria while not worse on all criteria the monograph by dombrovsky 2007 presents pareto optimal and cooperative solutions which are often the same for many games in connection with water resource management similarly salazar et al 2007 obtain a both pareto optimal and cooperative solution when balancing the economic benefits from agricultural production with associated negative environmental impacts in the present paper a differential game is proposed for limited water resources we propose to simplify the problem and solution of differential games through strategy sets discretization after discretization the water allocation problem is solved by means of game theoretical tools aiming at maximizing the players yields non cooperative and pareto optimal cooperative solutions are also given the contributions of the paper in more details are the following 1 a differential game of several players consumers is proposed to describe the change in the volume of a limited water resource and the change of the payoffs of the consumers as a function of time taking into account the natural recharge of the resource in a general setting open loop strategy sets are considered where the strategies can be continuous or piece wise continuous functions describing required water consumption on a time interval 2 first we discretize the strategy sets in the following sense we fix certain step functions as pure strategies for each player and then we take the corresponding mixed extension which applies the convex combinations of the pure strategies the general course of the solution of the water allocation problem is provided for obtaining maximal yields for the consumers in case of two consumers the solution is given in details along with several practical examples the pareto optimality of the non cooperative solution nash equilibrium is checked and the pareto optimal strategy pair which provides maximal sum payoff for the players is suggested for cooperation after a possible re distribution of the payoffs in addition two examples with three consumers are provided similarly it is worth mentioning in advance that the practical examples on tomato growing and social consumption rest on real and detailed background data and are in accordance with the recently published work kicsiny et al 2014 which relates to the topic of water resource management as well the organization of the paper is the following section 2 recalls preliminary basic concepts and a theorem as they are used in the later sections the proposed differential game describing the studied water resource management problem is given in section 3 the game is discretized and solved in section 4 both in cooperative and non cooperative approach several practical examples illustrate the details of the solution process section 5 emphasizes the main applicability of the results and its limitation section 6 serves with final conclusions and a future research proposal 2 preliminaries for the reader s convenience some preliminary basic concepts forgó et al 1999 and a theorem geoffrion 1967 from the field of game theory are recalled in this section as they are used later definition 2 1 consider a game with n n players let us denote the sets of admissible strategies of player 1 n with z 1 z n respectively and an admissible strategy of player 1 n with z 1 z n respectively where z 1 z 1 z n z n let us call the n dimensional vectors z z 1 z n strategy vectors the coordinates of which are admissible strategies of player 1 n respectively let the functions f 1 f n z 1 z n r be the payoffs of player 1 n respectively then the strategy vector z z 1 z n is called a nash equilibrium of the game if it maximizes the payoff for each player provided that the other players also select their own equilibrium strategies f k z 1 z k z n f k z 1 z k z n for any z k z k k 1 n generally the nash equilibrium is considered as the non cooperative solution of a game definition 2 2 the strategy vector z z 1 z n is called pareto optimal if no strategy vector z 1 z n exists that provides a strictly better payoff for at least one player while provides not worse payoff for all players f k z 1 z n f k z 1 z n for any k 1 n and for at least one k 0 1 n f k 0 z 1 z n f k 0 z 1 z n the n dimensional vector f 1 z 1 z n f n z 1 z n r n is called a pareto optimal point the set of the pareto optimal points is called the pareto frontier remark 2 1 for pareto optimal points there are no other strategies for the players with which at least one of their payoffs would increase while the other payoffs would not decrease either accordingly if a given point strategy vector is not pareto optimal then at least one player s payoff can be improved without deteriorating the others ones consequently it is natural to expect that the players assign some pareto optimal strategy vector for cooperation it is common to examine whether or not a nash equilibrium is also pareto optimal theorem 2 1 let us consider the following optimization problem with a single objective function where the weighted sum of the payoffs is maximized z z 1 z n k 1 n d k f k z m a x d k 0 1 k 1 n k 1 n d k 1 then it can be derived from the properties of the pareto optimality that any z z 1 z n solution of this optimization problem is also a pareto optimal strategy vector of the game specified in definition 2 1 definition 2 3 let us consider an n player finite game the strategy sets z 1 z n are finite sets with equal cardinalities z 1 z n m n such that the elements of the strategy sets are denoted by z 1 z n 1 m if the cardinalities are not equal originally they can be equalized by means of introducing suitable fictive strategies for some players the players payoffs are f 1 f n in accordance with definition 2 1 the mixed extension of this basic game is defined as the following n player continuum strategy game with the below strategy sets z k and payoff functions g k k 1 n the interpretation of the mixed strategies is further explained in the remark below let us define the n dimensional c k matrices with the c k i 1 i n entries which are possible payoff values of player k c k i 1 i n f k i 1 i n where i l 1 m the elements of the strategy sets l 1 n and k 1 n then the definition of the c k matrices is the following c k c k i 1 i n i 1 i n 1 m furthermore let the strategy sets of the mixed extension be the standard m simplexes i e the following sets composed of m dimensional vectors z k z k z k 1 z k m z k 1 z k m 0 z k 1 z k m 1 k 1 n then the payoffs of the mixed extension are defined as follows g k z 1 z n i 1 1 m i n 1 m c k i 1 i n z 1 i 1 z n i n k 1 n the z k strategy of player k is called a pure strategy of player k if one of the coordinates of z k is 1 and the others are 0 otherwise z k is called a mixed strategy remark 2 2 1 the pure strategies correspond directly to the finitely many strategies of the basic game more particularly player k s 1 0 0 pure strategy in the mixed extension corresponds to player k s strategy 1 in the basic game 0 1 0 in the mixed extension corresponds to strategy 2 in the basic game 0 0 1 in the mixed extension corresponds to strategy m in the basic game this means that if only pure strategies are selected by the players in the mixed extension then they get the same payoffs as if they played the basic game with selecting the corresponding basic strategies 2 the introduction of the mixed strategies can be interpreted as follows assume that the basic game is played in such a way that player k k 1 n selects one of the strategies from 1 m with probabilities z k 1 z k m respectively in other words player k k 1 n selects a basic strategy according to the probability distribution vector z k z k 1 z k m then the corresponding payoffs of the players are expected payoffs according to the probability distributions z k which are the same as the payoffs g k of the mixed extension according to the mixed strategies z k z k 1 z k m defined in definition 2 3 consequently if the basic game is played so many practically infinitely many times according to the same fixed probability distributions mixed strategies then the average payoff of player k is g k k 1 n belonging to the selected fixed mixed strategies 3 differential game the studied water consumption problem for any n n consumers players can be seen in fig 1 the corresponding proposed differential game is described with the system of ordinary differential eqs 1 1 0 t t v 0 v 0 v 0 0 f 1 0 f n 0 0 v t 0 if v t v 0 a n d v t v 1 t v n t 0 v t v 1 t v n t if v t v 0 o r v t v 0 a n d v t v 1 t v n t 0 v 1 t v 1 r t if v t 0 o r v t v 1 r t v n r t 0 v t v 1 r t v 1 r t v n r t if v t 0 a n d v t v 1 r t v n r t 0 v n t v n r t if v t 0 o r v t v 1 r t v n r t 0 v t v n r t v 1 r t v n r t if v t 0 a n d v t v 1 r t v n r t 0 f 1 t v 1 t s 1 t c 1 t δ t 1 t v 1 τ s 1 τ d τ c 1 0 f n t v n t s n t c n t δ t n t v n τ s n τ d τ c n 0 the interpretation of the above system of eqs 1 is the following the volume of the commonly used water resource is v which can change between 0 m3 and a maximal value v 0 see the first line of 1 and the relation for v t above the flow rate of the natural recharge of the resource is v the strategies of the players are the flow rates of their required consumptions v 1 r v n r thus the strategy sets can be composed e g of continuous or piece wise continuous functions the game evolves from time 0 to the last time t see the first line of 1 when the payoffs of the players are realized in the form of the values f 1 t f n t the relations of the differential game assure that the minimal value of the available volume v is 0 m3 negative values cannot occur which is a natural requirement representing either the evident physical limit or a prescribed minimal level below which the water cannot fall in order to assure the expert and secure use of the resource well this minimal level is guaranteed by means of that in case of v t 0 for any 0 t t the sum flow rate of the realized consumptions v 1 t v n t cannot be higher than the flow rate of the recharge v t for any 0 t t since if v t 0 and the sum of the required flow rates v 1 r t v n r t is higher than v t then the total consumption is set v t which is distributed among the consumers through their realized flow rates v 1 t v n t according to the proportions of their required flow rates v 1 r t v n r t see the second lines in the relations for v 1 t v n t in 1 that is the values of the required and the realized flow rates are different in such cases otherwise they are the same technically this distribution can be put into practice with proper operation of pumps and or valves a maximal saturation value v 0 is also assured in accordance with the real experiences as well by means of that in case of v t v 0 for any 0 t t the derivative v t must be 0 if v t v 1 t v n t 0 see the first line of the relation for v t in 1 this maximal one that is v 0 is also the initial value of the volume in the game the initial values of the payoff functions f 1 f n are 0 see the first line of 1 this assumption is also realistic considering that there must exist terms automatically or by way of assuring in every water consuming situation when the resource is able to be recharged for the sake of sustainability in the last line of the system of eqs 1 the relations on the derivatives of the payoff functions f 1 f n express through the weighting functions s 1 s n that the yields of the consumptions at different times are basically not the same it is not always the same important or profitable for a player to consume a unit of water furthermore the integrals in the denominators express that the players yields at any time also depend on the amount of water consumed in the preceding time period δ t 1 δ t n the more the water consumed by a player in the preceding time period is the less the necessity or the yield that a currently consumed unit of water has for that player c 1 1 c n 1 are measureless constants while the measure of the constants c 1 2 c n 2 is 1 eur based on the last line of the system of eqs 1 player k s payoff function f k is increasing more intensively as well as its share from the available water resource if the function v k r more directly v k takes higher values so it can be said that the higher relative power of a player can be represented with higher values of its required flow rate technically this can be realized with a higher pumping power intensity 4 discretization and solution the discretization of the problem is realized by specifying only finitely many prescribed functions to be admissible for the required consumptions strategies of the players that is for v 1 r v n r without loss of generality assume that these finitely many in particular m n prescribed functions are the same for all players let us denote them with ω 1 ω m we solve numerically the system of differential eqs 1 in case of all possible variations of substituting ω 1 ω m for v 1 r v n r the solution at the last time t more precisely f 1 t f n t gives the realized payoffs for the players a distinct n tuple of payoffs for each variation in this way m n f 1 t f n t payoff vectors are produced for example in case of two players n 2 and 4 admissible functions ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 for the required consumptions v 1 r v 2 r it means 42 16 possible payoff vectors f 1 t f 2 t in this manner a finite game of n players is obtained where each player has m pure strategies accordingly this discrete time even static game has only one turn time step where the players move simultaneously instead of the initial differential game where the players move continuously in time from time point 0 to t but also simultaneously in open loop conditions in our approach the cooperative or non cooperative solution of this game is considered as the cooperative or non cooperative solution of the basic water allocation problem if only the above pure strategies are admitted the game can be easily solved by systematically comparing the payoff vectors resulted from the finitely many substituted variations of ω 1 ω m however the existence of a nash equilibrium regarded as the non cooperative solution is not guaranteed if mixed strategies are also admitted as in the present study more complex solution methods are needed but a nash equilibrium surely exists forgó et al 1999 thus the non cooperative solution is guaranteed in our solution process which is an important issue in the examples in section 4 2 the matlab etter et al 2004 and the gambit mckelvey et al 2014 computer programs are used in generating the numerical solution of the system of differential eqs 1 and the nash equilibrium of the static game resulted from the discretization respectively 4 1 case of two consumers let us take two consumers n 2 both with the same m strategies described by required consumption functions flow rate functions ω 1 ω m let a 1 1 denote the payoff of player 1 f 1 t and b 1 1 denote the payoff of player 2 f 2 t if both players select the first possible strategy ω 1 similarly a 1 2 and b 1 2 denote the payoffs if player 1 selects ω 1 and player 2 selects ω 2 generally a i j denotes player 1 s and b i j denotes player 2 s payoff if player 1 selects ω i and player 2 selects ω j i j 1 m define matrices a and b as follows a a 1 1 a 1 m a m 1 a m m b b 1 1 b 1 m b m 1 b m m in this way the two person bimatrix game where mixed strategies are also admitted defined with matrices a and b is obtained which can be solved using easily usable standard methods also built in different computer programs for example in the gambit software different solution methods can be selected like linear complementarity programming method global newton tracing method etc 4 2 practical examples in this section the solution of the water resource problem is presented through several practical examples corresponding to two and three consumers players the players are agricultural and social consumers two types of farmers and a works canteen for the inhabitants the parameter values used in the examples rest on real and detailed background data and are in accordance with the recently published work kicsiny et al 2014 related to the topic of water resource management as well the farmers applied in the examples are tomato growers in hungary each with a land of 10 000 m2 as it is known depending on the used irrigation technique tomato has a relatively high water demand sun et al 2018 the farmers use the same well for irrigation with a maximal saturated volume of 20 m3 which can be fully discharged only once a day hungary has a sub humid climate madarász et al 2016 with a mean daily temperature between 15 and 25 c regarding the normal yearly period of tomato growing that is the whole relevant period in view of irrigation hungarian meteorological service 2018a this term can be considered 150 day long from the middle of april to the middle of september with a total water demand of 600 mm which means 4 mm day brouwer and heibloem 1986 it can be supposed that the maximal yield requires this volume of water the plants cannot utilize more water even they may be damaged by that during this 150 day long period the mean rainfall is 2 mm day hungarian meteorological service 2018b so the irrigation water need is also 2 mm day assuming linearity the yield is directly proportional to the amount of the supplied water as long as the soil plants are not saturated that is if for example there were no irrigation at all half of the maximal amount of tomato would be expected in accordance with the 2 mm day mean rainfall since the saturation happens in case of irrigating at least 2 mm day 2 l m2 day water which is equivalent to the daily discharge of the whole 20 m3 volume of the well by one of the players the assumption of linearity can be held for any course of the game it can be estimated that the maximal amount of tomato is 75 000 kg year on the 10 000 m2 area hungarian central statistical office 1921 2016 in case of optimal 2 mm day irrigation which can be sold for 1 5 eur kg average market price hungarian central statistical office 1946 2017 so the maximal profit is 75 000 1 5 112 500 eur year one half of which results from irrigation the other half is from natural rainfall this means 112 500 2 150 375 eur day profit and 375 20 19 eur m3 specific profit if the given player can use up the maximal 20 m3 day irrigation water without restriction it can be assumed with good reason that this maximal value is realized for the given farmer only if the irrigation is carried out in the optimal time period regarding the conditions of the plants or the farmer itself that is when the irrigation involves the minimal extra costs for the farmer in particular we suppose that the irrigation can be carried out from 5 a m to 9 a m before 5 a m it would not be economic because it were too far from the normal working time after 9 a m it would be risky for the plants because of the possibly too intensive evaporation effect we assume that the irrigation is a one hour long process which is not worth interrupted because of the timing of the subsequent works and cannot be accelerated for the sake of protecting the well and or the soil irrigation can therefore be executed during either of the following 4 time intervals 5 6 a m 6 7 a m 7 8 a m or 8 9 a m logically the given player requires the whole 20 m3 volume of the resource in the selected hour for irrigation since only this amount provides maximal yield accordingly the game is discretized in such a way that the players have 4 pure strategies ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 as the possible required consumption flow rates v 1 r v 2 r and v 3 r described using piece wise constant functions presented in fig 2 let us suppose that the plants can utilize every unit of water with the same efficiency up to the saturation level which cannot be exceeded anyway independently of the previously consumed amount that is δ t 1 δ t 2 δ t 3 0 in the differential game 1 thus we get f 1 t v 1 t s 1 t f 2 t v 2 t s 2 t and f 3 t v 3 t s 3 t for any 0 t t assuming also that c 1 1 c 1 2 c 1 3 1 and solve numerically the system of eqs 1 in particular in case of two consumers the 4 4 payoff matrices a and b are obtained as in section 4 1 for players 1 and 2 respectively finally the mixed extension of the resulted static game bimatrix game with matrices a and b in case of two consumers is solved that is mixed and pure strategies are admitted in the solution which is also considered as the solution of the basic water allocation problem in the examples below v 0 20 m3 and 0 t t where t 4 h as 5 a m corresponds to the initial time t 0 h 9 a m corresponds to the last time t 4 h in addition let a mixed or pure strategy of player 1 be denoted with x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 a strategy of player 2 be denoted with y y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 and a strategy of player 3 be denoted with w w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 in particular in case of two consumers the daily payoffs of players 1 and 2 are the following if they select strategy x and y in accordance with definition 2 3 f 1 t x t a y f 2 t x t b y where x t and y t means the transpose of vectors x and y it should be still mentioned for the sake of completeness that the effects of the daily payoffs are accumulated and materialized in financial form only when the produced tomato is sold in the below examples for a relatively comprehensive overview two kinds of farmers and a works canteen characterized with different weighting functions are studied with a lower 1 m3 h and a higher 2 m3 h natural recharge of the water resource furthermore there are symmetric where the players are identical and asymmetric where the players are not identical cases with two and more than two three consumers in particular in the asymmetric example with three consumers example 8 all three kinds of players both types of farmers and the works canteen are considered reasonably finally these combinations result in eight different practical examples examples 1 6 relate to two consumers examples 7 and 8 relate to three consumers fig 3 presents the weighting functions of the different consumers in particular s f 1 corresponds to the firs type of farmers farmer type 1 s f 2 corresponds to the second type of farmers farmer type 2 and s c corresponds to the canteen fig 4 presents the obtained results nash equilibrium n pareto frontier and pareto optimal point with maximal sum payoff p in the examples with two players examples 1 6 example 1 farmer type 1 farmer type 1 ν 1 m3 h let the flow rate function of the natural recharge of the water resource be constant v 1 m3 h in this way the 20 m3 volume of the well can be surely renewed until the beginning of the irrigation on the subsequent day the two farmers are defined to be identical with the irrigation most profitable in the fourth hour of the game during 8 9 a m at the beginning of the normal working time that is they would assign v 1 r v 2 r ω 4 if the required water amount were available for them without limitation the irrigation is less and less profitable for them in the third second and first hour of the game because of the incidentals related to the anticipated working time as for example the increased payments in accordance with that let the identical temporal weighting functions s 1 s 2 s f 1 in fig 3 solving numerically the system of differential eqs 1 with the substitutions of the above parameters and all possible variations of ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 as v 1 r and v 2 r for the payoff matrices a and b for player 1 and 2 respectively we obtain the following a 20 0 38 0 38 0 38 0 15 2 79 8 152 0 152 0 40 0 26 6 139 7 266 0 76 1 57 1 38 0 199 5 b 20 0 15 2 40 0 76 1 38 0 79 8 26 6 57 1 38 0 152 0 139 7 38 0 38 0 152 0 266 0 199 5 solving the mixed extension of the bimatrix game for the nash equilibrium as the non cooperative solution both players select a pure equilibrium strategy both irrigating in the second hour 6 7 a m x y 0 1 0 0 for player 1 and 2 respectively this can be also seen in matrices a and b as from that a 2 2 79 8 is the maximal value in its column and b 2 2 79 8 is the maximal value in its row this means a 79 8 eur daily payoff for both of them see point n in fig 4 for example 1 now the objective function of the optimization problem of theorem 2 1 has the form d x t a y 1 d x t b y 0 d 1 which must be maximized on the sets of the x and y strategies solving this optimization problem for each value of d increasing from 0 to 1 by a step of 0 001 altogether 3 different payoff pairs are resulted nevertheless they seem enough to outline the whole pareto frontier rather precisely if they are connected which are denoted with in fig 4 for example 1 these points are connected with a dashed line to represent the estimated pareto frontier in addition to provide an empirical check payoff pairs are calculated for all x and y strategies of the players the 4 coordinates of which are integer multiples of 0 25 between 0 and 1 these payoff pairs points of the plane are shown with in fig 4 for example 1 on the face of the figure it can be stated that some of the points are rather close to the frontier but all of them are below or at most on the dashed line so the pareto frontier can be empirically accepted according to the position of the pareto frontier and the point n which is below the frontier the nash equilibrium is not pareto optimal so the payoff of at least one player can be increased in such a way that the other s payoff does not decrease either among the pareto optimal points p denotes the one corresponding to the maximal value of the sum of the payoffs f 1 t f 2 t corresponding also to d 0 5 in the optimization problem since f 1 t and f 2 t are with the same coefficient both are multiplied by 1 in the expression f 1 t f 2 t p 199 5 199 5 is obtained with the strategies x 0 0 0 1 and y 0 0 0 1 thus it can be recommended for the players to cooperate with irrigating identically in the fourth hour 8 9 a m since both of them would gain a higher payoff in this case than with the strategies of the nash equilibrium and as a further special advantage their sum payoff the payoff of the whole system would be maximal as well example 2 farmer type 1 farmer type 1 ν 2 m3 h here only the constant flow rate of the natural recharge is changed to v 2 m3 h in comparison with example 1 it is interesting to see the effect of only that the water is supplemented faster on the payoffs or on the type of the equilibrium strategies then the payoff matrices are as follows a 20 9 38 0 38 0 38 0 30 4 83 6 152 0 152 0 79 9 53 2 146 3 266 0 152 1 113 9 76 0 209 0 b 20 9 30 4

equilibrium there is no pure nash equilibrium the interpretation of which is the following among the 4 4 pure strategies both players select the first one irrigation in the first hour during 5 6 a m with 0 probability they select the second one irrigation in the second hour with a probability of 0 52 the third one irrigation in the third hour with a probability of 0 33 and the fourth one irrigation in the fourth hour with a probability of 0 15 each farmer maximizes their own expected payoff in case of these selected strategies probability distributions provided that the other farmer also plays according to its own equilibrium strategy probability distribution this means 116 4 eur daily expected payoff for both of them see point n in fig 4 for example 2 applying the optimization of theorem 2 1 in the same way as in example 1 altogether 3 different payoff pairs are obtained denoted with in fig 4 for example 2 which are connected with a dashed line to represent the estimated pareto frontier based on the figure the nash equilibrium is again not pareto optimal the strategies x 0 0 0 1 and y 0 0 0 1 belonging to the pareto optimal point p 209 0 209 0 which corresponds to the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t can be recommended for cooperation since both players would gain a higher payoff in this case than with the strategies of the nash equilibrium even their sum payoff the system payoff would be maximal as well example 3 farmer type 1 farmer type 2 ν 1 m3 h in examples 3 and 4 the farmers are asymmetric that is the weighting functions s 1 s f 1 and s 2 s f 2 are different according to fig 3 s 2 can be interpreted as follows player 2 s normal working hours begin two hours earlier at 6 a m than player 1 s working hours so it is the most profitable for it to irrigate in the second hour during 6 7 a m in example 3 v 1 m3 h constant then the payoff matrices are as follows a 20 0 38 0 38 0 38 0 15 2 79 8 152 0 152 0 40 0 26 6 139 7 266 0 76 1 57 1 38 0 199 5

nash equilibrium which involves 62 3 eur and 265 7 eur expected payoffs for player 1 and 2 respectively see point n in fig 4 for example 3 the nash point n does not fit in the estimated pareto frontier gained from the optimization process so it is not pareto optimal the strategies x 0 0 0 1 and y 0 1 0 0 belong to the pareto optimal point p 57 1 380 0 with the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t since it means lower payoff for player 1 than in the case of the nash equilibrium these pure strategies when player 1 irrigates in the fourth hour and player 2 irrigates in the second hour can be recommended for cooperation only if the players re distribute their sum payoff 57 1 380 0 eur in such a way that player 1 gets no less payoff than with playing the strategies of the nash equilibrium example 4 farmer type 1 farmer type 2 ν 2 m3 h here only the constant flow rate of the natural recharge is changed to v 2 m3 h in comparison with example 3 therefore this can be regarded as an asymmetric equivalent to example 2 then the payoff matrices are the following a 20 9 38 0 38 0 38 0 30 4 83 6 152 0 152 0 79 9 53 2 146 3 266 0 152 1 113 9 76 0 209 0 b 146 3 75 9 79 9 60 9 266 0 209

0 eur payoffs for player 1 and 2 respectively see point n in fig 4 for example 4 the nash point fits in the estimated pareto frontier even this is also the pareto optimal point p corresponding to the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t so the cooperation would not be more beneficial only the same beneficial for the farmers than the non cooperative behaviour this must be caused by that the consumers are asymmetric and the water recharge is relatively high 2 m3 h in this way after player 2 consumes all its water need in the second hour when it is optimal for it the water resource has enough time to be recharged before player 1 consumes all its water need in the fourth hour when it is optimal for it that is why the cooperation has no significance now example 5 canteen farmer type 1 ν 1 m3 h in examples 5 and 6 player 1 is a social consumer more precisely a works canteen for the inhabitants and player 2 is a farmer the same as in the previous examples assume that the predominant part of the water need of the canteen falls on the beginning of the day as well because of the preparatory and cooking tasks related to the beginning of the working processes also let the optimal water consumption of the canteen be 20 m3 day which is to be realized during a one hour long process optimally in the fourth hour of the game during 8 9 a m at the beginning of the normal working time but it can be also anticipated to earlier time intervals as the third 7 8 a m second 6 7 a m or first 5 6 a m hour when the specific profit is less and less in particular s 1 s c and s 2 s f 1 see fig 3 that is player 1 has the same 4 pure strategies as player 2 corresponding to the functions ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 presented in fig 2 the maximal specific profit is 3 5 eur m3 for the canteen in accordance with the examples in kicsiny et al 2014 assuming linearity below the optimal maximal consumption of 20 m3 the profit is directly proportional to the amount of the used up water in example 5 v 1 m3 h constant then the payoff matrices are as follows a 3 7 7 0 7 0 7 0 2 1 11 0 21 0 21 0 8 4 5 6 29 4 56 0 14 0 10 5 7 0 36 7 b 20 0 15 2 40 0 76 1 38 0 79 8 26 6 57 1 38 0 152 0 139 7 38 0 38 0 152 0

see point n in fig 4 for example 5 the nash point n does not fit in the estimated pareto frontier so it is not pareto optimal the strategies x 0 0 0 1 and y 0 0 1 0 belong to the pareto optimal point p 7 0 266 0 with the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t in this case the canteen consumes the water in the fourth hour and the farmer irrigates in the third hour since it means lower payoff for player 1

payoff than with playing the strategies of the nash equilibrium example 6 canteen farmer type 1 ν 2 m3 h here only the constant flow rate of the natural recharge is changed to v 2 m3 h in comparison

two player examples above the players conflicting goals are expressed in their payoff functions f 1 and f 2 the characters of which appear in the shape of the pareto frontier for example in case of two players if the payoff functions are symmetric f 1 x y f 2 y x the pareto frontier is symmetric with respect to the 45 line passing through the origin of the coordinate system see e g example 1 and fig 4 for example 1 if the payoff functions are not symmetric the pareto frontier is not symmetric either see e g example 3 and fig 4 for example 3 example 7 farmer type 1 farmer type 1 farmer type 1 ν 1 m3 h in examples 7 and 8 there are three players and v 1 m3 h constant in example 7 each of them is a farmer with the same weighting function as in examples 1 and 2 that is s 1 s 2 s 3 s f 1 so the problem is symmetric in accordance with fig 2 each player has 4 pure strategies ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 in the discretized static game with the payoff values in eur listed in the appendix the pure strategies x 0 1 0 0 y 0 1 0 0 and w 0 1 0 0 are obtained with respect to the non cooperative nash equilibrium strategies for player 1 2 and 3 respectively which involves 53 2 eur payoff for each player the strategies x 0 0 0 1 y 0 0 0 1 and w 0 0 0 1 belonging to the pareto optimal point 133 0 133 0 133 0 which corresponds to the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t f 3 t can be recommended for cooperation since all players would gain a higher payoff in this case than with the strategies of the nash equilibrium even their sum payoff the system payoff would be maximal as well however these strategies do not form a nash equilibrium example 8 farmer type 1 farmer type 2 canteen ν 1 m3 h in this example player 1 is a farmer with weighting function s 1 s f 1 player 2 is a farmer with weighting function s 2 s f 2 and player 3 is a works canteen with weighting function s 3 s c so the problem is asymmetric for the players payoff values with respect to the discretized static game in eur see the appendix the mixed strategies x 0 0 63 0 0 37 y 0 68 0 32 0 0 and w 0 0 0 1 are resulted with respect to the non cooperative nash equilibrium which involves 35 7 eur 266 0 eur and 5 7 eur expected payoffs for player 1 2 and 3 respectively the strategies x 0 0 0 1 y 0 1 0 0 and w 0 0 0 1 belong to the pareto optimal point 28 5 380 0 5 3 with the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t f 3 t since it means lower payoff for player 1 and 3 than in case of the nash equilibrium these pure strategies when player 1 irrigates in the fourth hour player 2 irrigates in the second hour and the canteen consumes in the fourth hour can be recommended for cooperation only if the players re distribute their sum payoff 28 5 380 0 5 3 eur in such a way that player 1 and 3 get not less payoff than with playing the strategies of the nash equilibrium 5 applicability and limitation since the proposed differential game 1 is rather general the worked out discretization and solution method can be used essentially for any water resource water storage used by more consumers nevertheless if the considered time period t is divided into more sub periods more than four as in the above examples or if there are more players more than three as in the above examples the computational demand grows significantly which may cause the needed calculations impossible to carry out above a certain number of sub periods and players 6 conclusion a differential game with arbitrary number of players has been proposed in the present study for describing the players water consumptions from a limited water resource as well as the natural recharge of the resource the general solution method of allocating the available water among the players has been worked out to maximize the players yields by means of discretizing their general strategy sets the solution has been detailed more for the case of two consumers completed with several practical examples first the non cooperative solution nash equilibrium of the conflict game has been provided then its pareto optimality has been checked finally the pareto optimal strategy pair which has the maximal sum payoff for the players has been recommended as the possible cooperative solution after eventually re distributing the payoffs on the basis of the results it can be concluded that this solution as the cooperative one generally provides higher payoff for all players than if they consumed the water according to their conflicting non cooperative behaviour in addition two examples with three consumers have been provided similarly the practical examples have been related to different agricultural and social consumers so it can be seen that the worked out solution process can be adopted to a wide range of real situations furthermore the examples have been rested on real and detailed background data which represents the direct applicability of the results there exist several stability concepts in the field φ stability ψ stability k stability m stability in connection with the possible cooperation among the players in case of more than two consumers it may be reasonable to assess them to evaluate the stability robustness of the possible coalitions among the players with respect to the here proposed game in future researches such studies may further contribute to understand the players water consuming behaviour and to work out an overall water saving strategy acknowledgements the first author thanks the contribution of his colleagues at the department of mathematics institute of environmental systems faculty of

6780,it is indispensable for the sustainable water supply of the human society to distribute the available water resources with maximal efficiency among the different consumers while assuring the

introduction the peril of the decreasing water resources which are usable for the human society is well known the problem has reached a critical level which must be handled locally and globally as well budapest water summit 2016 chen et al 2018 the crisis is caused by the increasing consumption of the inhabitants industry and agriculture besides the pollution of the environment yang et al 2018 and within that increasing pollution of water chen et al 2017b in the field of agriculture which is likely the largest water consumer irrigation stands for a very significant amount that grows increasingly partly because of accelerating global warming lauffenburger et al 2018 consequently in addition to the development of environmental protection and economical water use it is indispensable for the sustainable water supply of our human society to distribute the available water resources with maximal efficiency among the different consumers while assuring the needed time for natural recharge of the water ziolkowska and peterson 2017 the theoretically established effective tool for the solution of this allocation problem is mathematical modelling with special regard to the methods of game theory for a general overview of the different fields of application of game theory in water resource management we refer the reader to the early work of bogárdi and szidarovszky 1976 and the recent works of madani 2010 and podimata and yannopoulos 2015 a business simulation game is applied for irrigation water policy impact at farmers level in bucholz et al 2016 the results show that a water quota is able to reduce the irrigation applications while a water pricing scheme has no effect leader follower stackelberg games are applied for water resource management problems in chen et al 2017a kicsiny et al 2014 and kicsiny 2017 where some players leaders have priority with respect to time before other players followers a two level game including one main game and four sub games is given in wei et al 2010 to describe a water allocation problem in china in zanjanian et al 2018 a water allocation problem among organizational stakeholders is solved with game theoretical tools more particularly with the so called gmcr graph model for conflict resolution method the paper madani and hooshyar 2014 presents a game theoretical reinforcement learning method for social planners to optimize their policies in multi operator multi reservoir systems differential games are special games governed by differential equations accordingly the players move continuously in time from an initial time point to a final one in such games negri 1989 models common property aquifers by means of a differential game negri deals with both open loop solutions where the players commit themselves at the beginning of the game to their strategies pumping rates in all future periods and feedback solutions where they can adapt their strategies during the game similarly xin and sun 2018 analyse open loop feedback and so called closed loop equilibria in a differential oligopoly game for a dual decision problem involving optimal production planning and water savings in closed loop approaches the players are aware of all former states of the game up to the current time point the work xin and li 2013 serves with a price game model for irrigation water use the proposed differential game exhibits bifurcation and chaos corresponding to the price changes of the players firms over time in yi et al 2017 the cooperation of two asymmetric nations is modelled with a stochastic differential game for reducing trans boundary pollution of water or air the governments of the nations can cooperate while the government and the polluting industrial firms play a stackelberg game in each nation it is shown that the governments being cooperative make a higher pollution abatement effort than when they are non cooperative it can be stated generally that the cooperative solution of a game provides at least the same high payoff for each player as the non cooperative one otherwise one or more players would upset the cooperation so the solution would not be actually cooperative accordingly the cooperative solution leads to at least the same high system payoff sum of players payoffs as the case when the players prefer conflicting non cooperative interests besides cooperative and non cooperative solutions of a game another key issue to be studied is the so called pareto optimality pareto optimality of solutions is a widely investigated aspect both in cooperative and non cooperative games and more generally in multi objective problems gatti and sandholm 2014 since pareto optimality means no other solution is better on at least one criteria while not worse on all criteria the monograph by dombrovsky 2007 presents pareto optimal and cooperative solutions which are often the same for many games in connection with water resource management similarly salazar et al 2007 obtain a both pareto optimal and cooperative solution when balancing the economic benefits from agricultural production with associated negative environmental impacts in the present paper a differential game is proposed for limited water resources we propose to simplify the problem and solution of differential games through strategy sets discretization after discretization the water allocation problem is solved by means of game theoretical tools aiming at maximizing the players yields non cooperative and pareto optimal cooperative solutions are also given the contributions of the paper in more details are the following 1 a differential game of several players consumers is proposed to describe the change in the volume of a limited water resource and the change of the payoffs of the consumers as a function of time taking into account the natural recharge of the resource in a general setting open loop strategy sets are considered where the strategies can be continuous or piece wise continuous functions describing required water consumption on a time interval 2 first we discretize the strategy sets in the following sense we fix certain step functions as pure strategies for each player and then we take the corresponding mixed extension which applies the convex combinations of the pure strategies the general course of the solution of the water allocation problem is provided for obtaining maximal yields for the consumers in case of two consumers the solution is given in details along with several practical examples the pareto optimality of the non cooperative solution nash equilibrium is checked and the pareto optimal strategy pair which provides maximal sum payoff for the players is suggested for cooperation after a possible re distribution of the payoffs in addition two examples with three consumers are provided similarly it is worth mentioning in advance that the practical examples on tomato growing and social consumption rest on real and detailed background data and are in accordance with the recently published work kicsiny et al 2014 which relates to the topic of water resource management as well the organization of the paper is the following section 2 recalls preliminary basic concepts and a theorem as they are used in the later sections the proposed differential game describing the studied water resource management problem is given in section 3 the game is discretized and solved in section 4 both in cooperative and non cooperative approach several practical examples illustrate the details of the solution process section 5 emphasizes the main applicability of the results and its limitation section 6 serves with final conclusions and a future research proposal 2 preliminaries for the reader s convenience some preliminary basic concepts forgó et al 1999 and a theorem geoffrion 1967 from the field of game theory are recalled in this section as they are used later definition 2 1 consider a game with n n players let us denote the sets of admissible strategies of player 1 n with z 1 z n respectively and an admissible strategy of player 1 n with z 1 z n respectively where z 1 z 1 z n z n let us call the n dimensional vectors z z 1 z n strategy vectors the coordinates of which are admissible strategies of player 1 n respectively let the functions f 1 f n z 1 z n r be the payoffs of player 1 n respectively then the strategy vector z z 1 z n is called a nash equilibrium of the game if it maximizes the payoff for each player provided that the other players also select their own equilibrium strategies f k z 1 z k z n f k z 1 z k z n for any z k z k k 1 n generally the nash equilibrium is considered as the non cooperative solution of a game definition 2 2 the strategy vector z z 1 z n is called pareto optimal if no strategy vector z 1 z n exists that provides a strictly better payoff for at least one player while provides not worse payoff for all players f k z 1 z n f k z 1 z n for any k 1 n and for at least one k 0 1 n f k 0 z 1 z n f k 0 z 1 z n the n dimensional vector f 1 z 1 z n f n z 1 z n r n is called a pareto optimal point the set of the pareto optimal points is called the pareto frontier remark 2 1 for pareto optimal points there are no other strategies for the players with which at least one of their payoffs would increase while the other payoffs would not decrease either accordingly if a given point strategy vector is not pareto optimal then at least one player s payoff can be improved without deteriorating the others ones consequently it is natural to expect that the players assign some pareto optimal strategy vector for cooperation it is common to examine whether or not a nash equilibrium is also pareto optimal theorem 2 1 let us consider the following optimization problem with a single objective function where the weighted sum of the payoffs is maximized z z 1 z n k 1 n d k f k z m a x d k 0 1 k 1 n k 1 n d k 1 then it can be derived from the properties of the pareto optimality that any z z 1 z n solution of this optimization problem is also a pareto optimal strategy vector of the game specified in definition 2 1 definition 2 3 let us consider an n player finite game the strategy sets z 1 z n are finite sets with equal cardinalities z 1 z n m n such that the elements of the strategy sets are denoted by z 1 z n 1 m if the cardinalities are not equal originally they can be equalized by means of introducing suitable fictive strategies for some players the players payoffs are f 1 f n in accordance with definition 2 1 the mixed extension of this basic game is defined as the following n player continuum strategy game with the below strategy sets z k and payoff functions g k k 1 n the interpretation of the mixed strategies is further explained in the remark below let us define the n dimensional c k matrices with the c k i 1 i n entries which are possible payoff values of player k c k i 1 i n f k i 1 i n where i l 1 m the elements of the strategy sets l 1 n and k 1 n then the definition of the c k matrices is the following c k c k i 1 i n i 1 i n 1 m furthermore let the strategy sets of the mixed extension be the standard m simplexes i e the following sets composed of m dimensional vectors z k z k z k 1 z k m z k 1 z k m 0 z k 1 z k m 1 k 1 n then the payoffs of the mixed extension are defined as follows g k z 1 z n i 1 1 m i n 1 m c k i 1 i n z 1 i 1 z n i n k 1 n the z k strategy of player k is called a pure strategy of player k if one of the coordinates of z k is 1 and the others are 0 otherwise z k is called a mixed strategy remark 2 2 1 the pure strategies correspond directly to the finitely many strategies of the basic game more particularly player k s 1 0 0 pure strategy in the mixed extension corresponds to player k s strategy 1 in the basic game 0 1 0 in the mixed extension corresponds to strategy 2 in the basic game 0 0 1 in the mixed extension corresponds to strategy m in the basic game this means that if only pure strategies are selected by the players in the mixed extension then they get the same payoffs as if they played the basic game with selecting the corresponding basic strategies 2 the introduction of the mixed strategies can be interpreted as follows assume that the basic game is played in such a way that player k k 1 n selects one of the strategies from 1 m with probabilities z k 1 z k m respectively in other words player k k 1 n selects a basic strategy according to the probability distribution vector z k z k 1 z k m then the corresponding payoffs of the players are expected payoffs according to the probability distributions z k which are the same as the payoffs g k of the mixed extension according to the mixed strategies z k z k 1 z k m defined in definition 2 3 consequently if the basic game is played so many practically infinitely many times according to the same fixed probability distributions mixed strategies then the average payoff of player k is g k k 1 n belonging to the selected fixed mixed strategies 3 differential game the studied water consumption problem for any n n consumers players can be seen in fig 1 the corresponding proposed differential game is described with the system of ordinary differential eqs 1 1 0 t t v 0 v 0 v 0 0 f 1 0 f n 0 0 v t 0 if v t v 0 a n d v t v 1 t v n t 0 v t v 1 t v n t if v t v 0 o r v t v 0 a n d v t v 1 t v n t 0 v 1 t v 1 r t if v t 0 o r v t v 1 r t v n r t 0 v t v 1 r t v 1 r t v n r t if v t 0 a n d v t v 1 r t v n r t 0 v n t v n r t if v t 0 o r v t v 1 r t v n r t 0 v t v n r t v 1 r t v n r t if v t 0 a n d v t v 1 r t v n r t 0 f 1 t v 1 t s 1 t c 1 t δ t 1 t v 1 τ s 1 τ d τ c 1 0 f n t v n t s n t c n t δ t n t v n τ s n τ d τ c n 0 the interpretation of the above system of eqs 1 is the following the volume of the commonly used water resource is v which can change between 0 m3 and a maximal value v 0 see the first line of 1 and the relation for v t above the flow rate of the natural recharge of the resource is v the strategies of the players are the flow rates of their required consumptions v 1 r v n r thus the strategy sets can be composed e g of continuous or piece wise continuous functions the game evolves from time 0 to the last time t see the first line of 1 when the payoffs of the players are realized in the form of the values f 1 t f n t the relations of the differential game assure that the minimal value of the available volume v is 0 m3 negative values cannot occur which is a natural requirement representing either the evident physical limit or a prescribed minimal level below which the water cannot fall in order to assure the expert and secure use of the resource well this minimal level is guaranteed by means of that in case of v t 0 for any 0 t t the sum flow rate of the realized consumptions v 1 t v n t cannot be higher than the flow rate of the recharge v t for any 0 t t since if v t 0 and the sum of the required flow rates v 1 r t v n r t is higher than v t then the total consumption is set v t which is distributed among the consumers through their realized flow rates v 1 t v n t according to the proportions of their required flow rates v 1 r t v n r t see the second lines in the relations for v 1 t v n t in 1 that is the values of the required and the realized flow rates are different in such cases otherwise they are the same technically this distribution can be put into practice with proper operation of pumps and or valves a maximal saturation value v 0 is also assured in accordance with the real experiences as well by means of that in case of v t v 0 for any 0 t t the derivative v t must be 0 if v t v 1 t v n t 0 see the first line of the relation for v t in 1 this maximal one that is v 0 is also the initial value of the volume in the game the initial values of the payoff functions f 1 f n are 0 see the first line of 1 this assumption is also realistic considering that there must exist terms automatically or by way of assuring in every water consuming situation when the resource is able to be recharged for the sake of sustainability in the last line of the system of eqs 1 the relations on the derivatives of the payoff functions f 1 f n express through the weighting functions s 1 s n that the yields of the consumptions at different times are basically not the same it is not always the same important or profitable for a player to consume a unit of water furthermore the integrals in the denominators express that the players yields at any time also depend on the amount of water consumed in the preceding time period δ t 1 δ t n the more the water consumed by a player in the preceding time period is the less the necessity or the yield that a currently consumed unit of water has for that player c 1 1 c n 1 are measureless constants while the measure of the constants c 1 2 c n 2 is 1 eur based on the last line of the system of eqs 1 player k s payoff function f k is increasing more intensively as well as its share from the available water resource if the function v k r more directly v k takes higher values so it can be said that the higher relative power of a player can be represented with higher values of its required flow rate technically this can be realized with a higher pumping power intensity 4 discretization and solution the discretization of the problem is realized by specifying only finitely many prescribed functions to be admissible for the required consumptions strategies of the players that is for v 1 r v n r without loss of generality assume that these finitely many in particular m n prescribed functions are the same for all players let us denote them with ω 1 ω m we solve numerically the system of differential eqs 1 in case of all possible variations of substituting ω 1 ω m for v 1 r v n r the solution at the last time t more precisely f 1 t f n t gives the realized payoffs for the players a distinct n tuple of payoffs for each variation in this way m n f 1 t f n t payoff vectors are produced for example in case of two players n 2 and 4 admissible functions ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 for the required consumptions v 1 r v 2 r it means 42 16 possible payoff vectors f 1 t f 2 t in this manner a finite game of n players is obtained where each player has m pure strategies accordingly this discrete time even static game has only one turn time step where the players move simultaneously instead of the initial differential game where the players move continuously in time from time point 0 to t but also simultaneously in open loop conditions in our approach the cooperative or non cooperative solution of this game is considered as the cooperative or non cooperative solution of the basic water allocation problem if only the above pure strategies are admitted the game can be easily solved by systematically comparing the payoff vectors resulted from the finitely many substituted variations of ω 1 ω m however the existence of a nash equilibrium regarded as the non cooperative solution is not guaranteed if mixed strategies are also admitted as in the present study more complex solution methods are needed but a nash equilibrium surely exists forgó et al 1999 thus the non cooperative solution is guaranteed in our solution process which is an important issue in the examples in section 4 2 the matlab etter et al 2004 and the gambit mckelvey et al 2014 computer programs are used in generating the numerical solution of the system of differential eqs 1 and the nash equilibrium of the static game resulted from the discretization respectively 4 1 case of two consumers let us take two consumers n 2 both with the same m strategies described by required consumption functions flow rate functions ω 1 ω m let a 1 1 denote the payoff of player 1 f 1 t and b 1 1 denote the payoff of player 2 f 2 t if both players select the first possible strategy ω 1 similarly a 1 2 and b 1 2 denote the payoffs if player 1 selects ω 1 and player 2 selects ω 2 generally a i j denotes player 1 s and b i j denotes player 2 s payoff if player 1 selects ω i and player 2 selects ω j i j 1 m define matrices a and b as follows a a 1 1 a 1 m a m 1 a m m b b 1 1 b 1 m b m 1 b m m in this way the two person bimatrix game where mixed strategies are also admitted defined with matrices a and b is obtained which can be solved using easily usable standard methods also built in different computer programs for example in the gambit software different solution methods can be selected like linear complementarity programming method global newton tracing method etc 4 2 practical examples in this section the solution of the water resource problem is presented through several practical examples corresponding to two and three consumers players the players are agricultural and social consumers two types of farmers and a works canteen for the inhabitants the parameter values used in the examples rest on real and detailed background data and are in accordance with the recently published work kicsiny et al 2014 related to the topic of water resource management as well the farmers applied in the examples are tomato growers in hungary each with a land of 10 000 m2 as it is known depending on the used irrigation technique tomato has a relatively high water demand sun et al 2018 the farmers use the same well for irrigation with a maximal saturated volume of 20 m3 which can be fully discharged only once a day hungary has a sub humid climate madarász et al 2016 with a mean daily temperature between 15 and 25 c regarding the normal yearly period of tomato growing that is the whole relevant period in view of irrigation hungarian meteorological service 2018a this term can be considered 150 day long from the middle of april to the middle of september with a total water demand of 600 mm which means 4 mm day brouwer and heibloem 1986 it can be supposed that the maximal yield requires this volume of water the plants cannot utilize more water even they may be damaged by that during this 150 day long period the mean rainfall is 2 mm day hungarian meteorological service 2018b so the irrigation water need is also 2 mm day assuming linearity the yield is directly proportional to the amount of the supplied water as long as the soil plants are not saturated that is if for example there were no irrigation at all half of the maximal amount of tomato would be expected in accordance with the 2 mm day mean rainfall since the saturation happens in case of irrigating at least 2 mm day 2 l m2 day water which is equivalent to the daily discharge of the whole 20 m3 volume of the well by one of the players the assumption of linearity can be held for any course of the game it can be estimated that the maximal amount of tomato is 75 000 kg year on the 10 000 m2 area hungarian central statistical office 1921 2016 in case of optimal 2 mm day irrigation which can be sold for 1 5 eur kg average market price hungarian central statistical office 1946 2017 so the maximal profit is 75 000 1 5 112 500 eur year one half of which results from irrigation the other half is from natural rainfall this means 112 500 2 150 375 eur day profit and 375 20 19 eur m3 specific profit if the given player can use up the maximal 20 m3 day irrigation water without restriction it can be assumed with good reason that this maximal value is realized for the given farmer only if the irrigation is carried out in the optimal time period regarding the conditions of the plants or the farmer itself that is when the irrigation involves the minimal extra costs for the farmer in particular we suppose that the irrigation can be carried out from 5 a m to 9 a m before 5 a m it would not be economic because it were too far from the normal working time after 9 a m it would be risky for the plants because of the possibly too intensive evaporation effect we assume that the irrigation is a one hour long process which is not worth interrupted because of the timing of the subsequent works and cannot be accelerated for the sake of protecting the well and or the soil irrigation can therefore be executed during either of the following 4 time intervals 5 6 a m 6 7 a m 7 8 a m or 8 9 a m logically the given player requires the whole 20 m3 volume of the resource in the selected hour for irrigation since only this amount provides maximal yield accordingly the game is discretized in such a way that the players have 4 pure strategies ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 as the possible required consumption flow rates v 1 r v 2 r and v 3 r described using piece wise constant functions presented in fig 2 let us suppose that the plants can utilize every unit of water with the same efficiency up to the saturation level which cannot be exceeded anyway independently of the previously consumed amount that is δ t 1 δ t 2 δ t 3 0 in the differential game 1 thus we get f 1 t v 1 t s 1 t f 2 t v 2 t s 2 t and f 3 t v 3 t s 3 t for any 0 t t assuming also that c 1 1 c 1 2 c 1 3 1 and solve numerically the system of eqs 1 in particular in case of two consumers the 4 4 payoff matrices a and b are obtained as in section 4 1 for players 1 and 2 respectively finally the mixed extension of the resulted static game bimatrix game with matrices a and b in case of two consumers is solved that is mixed and pure strategies are admitted in the solution which is also considered as the solution of the basic water allocation problem in the examples below v 0 20 m3 and 0 t t where t 4 h as 5 a m corresponds to the initial time t 0 h 9 a m corresponds to the last time t 4 h in addition let a mixed or pure strategy of player 1 be denoted with x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 a strategy of player 2 be denoted with y y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 and a strategy of player 3 be denoted with w w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 in particular in case of two consumers the daily payoffs of players 1 and 2 are the following if they select strategy x and y in accordance with definition 2 3 f 1 t x t a y f 2 t x t b y where x t and y t means the transpose of vectors x and y it should be still mentioned for the sake of completeness that the effects of the daily payoffs are accumulated and materialized in financial form only when the produced tomato is sold in the below examples for a relatively comprehensive overview two kinds of farmers and a works canteen characterized with different weighting functions are studied with a lower 1 m3 h and a higher 2 m3 h natural recharge of the water resource furthermore there are symmetric where the players are identical and asymmetric where the players are not identical cases with two and more than two three consumers in particular in the asymmetric example with three consumers example 8 all three kinds of players both types of farmers and the works canteen are considered reasonably finally these combinations result in eight different practical examples examples 1 6 relate to two consumers examples 7 and 8 relate to three consumers fig 3 presents the weighting functions of the different consumers in particular s f 1 corresponds to the firs type of farmers farmer type 1 s f 2 corresponds to the second type of farmers farmer type 2 and s c corresponds to the canteen fig 4 presents the obtained results nash equilibrium n pareto frontier and pareto optimal point with maximal sum payoff p in the examples with two players examples 1 6 example 1 farmer type 1 farmer type 1 ν 1 m3 h let the flow rate function of the natural recharge of the water resource be constant v 1 m3 h in this way the 20 m3 volume of the well can be surely renewed until the beginning of the irrigation on the subsequent day the two farmers are defined to be identical with the irrigation most profitable in the fourth hour of the game during 8 9 a m at the beginning of the normal working time that is they would assign v 1 r v 2 r ω 4 if the required water amount were available for them without limitation the irrigation is less and less profitable for them in the third second and first hour of the game because of the incidentals related to the anticipated working time as for example the increased payments in accordance with that let the identical temporal weighting functions s 1 s 2 s f 1 in fig 3 solving numerically the system of differential eqs 1 with the substitutions of the above parameters and all possible variations of ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 as v 1 r and v 2 r for the payoff matrices a and b for player 1 and 2 respectively we obtain the following a 20 0 38 0 38 0 38 0 15 2 79 8 152 0 152 0 40 0 26 6 139 7 266 0 76 1 57 1 38 0 199 5 b 20 0 15 2 40 0 76 1 38 0 79 8 26 6 57 1 38 0 152 0 139 7 38 0 38 0 152 0 266 0 199 5 solving the mixed extension of the bimatrix game for the nash equilibrium as the non cooperative solution both players select a pure equilibrium strategy both irrigating in the second hour 6 7 a m x y 0 1 0 0 for player 1 and 2 respectively this can be also seen in matrices a and b as from that a 2 2 79 8 is the maximal value in its column and b 2 2 79 8 is the maximal value in its row this means a 79 8 eur daily payoff for both of them see point n in fig 4 for example 1 now the objective function of the optimization problem of theorem 2 1 has the form d x t a y 1 d x t b y 0 d 1 which must be maximized on the sets of the x and y strategies solving this optimization problem for each value of d increasing from 0 to 1 by a step of 0 001 altogether 3 different payoff pairs are resulted nevertheless they seem enough to outline the whole pareto frontier rather precisely if they are connected which are denoted with in fig 4 for example 1 these points are connected with a dashed line to represent the estimated pareto frontier in addition to provide an empirical check payoff pairs are calculated for all x and y strategies of the players the 4 coordinates of which are integer multiples of 0 25 between 0 and 1 these payoff pairs points of the plane are shown with in fig 4 for example 1 on the face of the figure it can be stated that some of the points are rather close to the frontier but all of them are below or at most on the dashed line so the pareto frontier can be empirically accepted according to the position of the pareto frontier and the point n which is below the frontier the nash equilibrium is not pareto optimal so the payoff of at least one player can be increased in such a way that the other s payoff does not decrease either among the pareto optimal points p denotes the one corresponding to the maximal value of the sum of the payoffs f 1 t f 2 t corresponding also to d 0 5 in the optimization problem since f 1 t and f 2 t are with the same coefficient both are multiplied by 1 in the expression f 1 t f 2 t p 199 5 199 5 is obtained with the strategies x 0 0 0 1 and y 0 0 0 1 thus it can be recommended for the players to cooperate with irrigating identically in the fourth hour 8 9 a m since both of them would gain a higher payoff in this case than with the strategies of the nash equilibrium and as a further special advantage their sum payoff the payoff of the whole system would be maximal as well example 2 farmer type 1 farmer type 1 ν 2 m3 h here only the constant flow rate of the natural recharge is changed to v 2 m3 h in comparison with example 1 it is interesting to see the effect of only that the water is supplemented faster on the payoffs or on the type of the equilibrium strategies then the payoff matrices are as follows a 20 9 38 0 38 0 38 0 30 4 83 6 152 0 152 0 79 9 53 2 146 3 266 0 152 1 113 9 76 0 209 0 b 20 9 30 4

equilibrium there is no pure nash equilibrium the interpretation of which is the following among the 4 4 pure strategies both players select the first one irrigation in the first hour during 5 6 a m with 0 probability they select the second one irrigation in the second hour with a probability of 0 52 the third one irrigation in the third hour with a probability of 0 33 and the fourth one irrigation in the fourth hour with a probability of 0 15 each farmer maximizes their own expected payoff in case of these selected strategies probability distributions provided that the other farmer also plays according to its own equilibrium strategy probability distribution this means 116 4 eur daily expected payoff for both of them see point n in fig 4 for example 2 applying the optimization of theorem 2 1 in the same way as in example 1 altogether 3 different payoff pairs are obtained denoted with in fig 4 for example 2 which are connected with a dashed line to represent the estimated pareto frontier based on the figure the nash equilibrium is again not pareto optimal the strategies x 0 0 0 1 and y 0 0 0 1 belonging to the pareto optimal point p 209 0 209 0 which corresponds to the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t can be recommended for cooperation since both players would gain a higher payoff in this case than with the strategies of the nash equilibrium even their sum payoff the system payoff would be maximal as well example 3 farmer type 1 farmer type 2 ν 1 m3 h in examples 3 and 4 the farmers are asymmetric that is the weighting functions s 1 s f 1 and s 2 s f 2 are different according to fig 3 s 2 can be interpreted as follows player 2 s normal working hours begin two hours earlier at 6 a m than player 1 s working hours so it is the most profitable for it to irrigate in the second hour during 6 7 a m in example 3 v 1 m3 h constant then the payoff matrices are as follows a 20 0 38 0 38 0 38 0 15 2 79 8 152 0 152 0 40 0 26 6 139 7 266 0 76 1 57 1 38 0 199 5

nash equilibrium which involves 62 3 eur and 265 7 eur expected payoffs for player 1 and 2 respectively see point n in fig 4 for example 3 the nash point n does not fit in the estimated pareto frontier gained from the optimization process so it is not pareto optimal the strategies x 0 0 0 1 and y 0 1 0 0 belong to the pareto optimal point p 57 1 380 0 with the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t since it means lower payoff for player 1 than in the case of the nash equilibrium these pure strategies when player 1 irrigates in the fourth hour and player 2 irrigates in the second hour can be recommended for cooperation only if the players re distribute their sum payoff 57 1 380 0 eur in such a way that player 1 gets no less payoff than with playing the strategies of the nash equilibrium example 4 farmer type 1 farmer type 2 ν 2 m3 h here only the constant flow rate of the natural recharge is changed to v 2 m3 h in comparison with example 3 therefore this can be regarded as an asymmetric equivalent to example 2 then the payoff matrices are the following a 20 9 38 0 38 0 38 0 30 4 83 6 152 0 152 0 79 9 53 2 146 3 266 0 152 1 113 9 76 0 209 0 b 146 3 75 9 79 9 60 9 266 0 209

0 eur payoffs for player 1 and 2 respectively see point n in fig 4 for example 4 the nash point fits in the estimated pareto frontier even this is also the pareto optimal point p corresponding to the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t so the cooperation would not be more beneficial only the same beneficial for the farmers than the non cooperative behaviour this must be caused by that the consumers are asymmetric and the water recharge is relatively high 2 m3 h in this way after player 2 consumes all its water need in the second hour when it is optimal for it the water resource has enough time to be recharged before player 1 consumes all its water need in the fourth hour when it is optimal for it that is why the cooperation has no significance now example 5 canteen farmer type 1 ν 1 m3 h in examples 5 and 6 player 1 is a social consumer more precisely a works canteen for the inhabitants and player 2 is a farmer the same as in the previous examples assume that the predominant part of the water need of the canteen falls on the beginning of the day as well because of the preparatory and cooking tasks related to the beginning of the working processes also let the optimal water consumption of the canteen be 20 m3 day which is to be realized during a one hour long process optimally in the fourth hour of the game during 8 9 a m at the beginning of the normal working time but it can be also anticipated to earlier time intervals as the third 7 8 a m second 6 7 a m or first 5 6 a m hour when the specific profit is less and less in particular s 1 s c and s 2 s f 1 see fig 3 that is player 1 has the same 4 pure strategies as player 2 corresponding to the functions ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 presented in fig 2 the maximal specific profit is 3 5 eur m3 for the canteen in accordance with the examples in kicsiny et al 2014 assuming linearity below the optimal maximal consumption of 20 m3 the profit is directly proportional to the amount of the used up water in example 5 v 1 m3 h

see point n in fig 4 for example 5 the nash point n does not fit in the estimated pareto frontier so it is not pareto optimal the strategies x 0 0 0 1 and y 0 0 1 0 belong to the pareto optimal point p 7 0 266 0 with the maximal value of f 1 t f 2 t in this case the canteen consumes the water in the fourth hour and the farmer irrigates in the third hour since it means lower payoff for player 1

two player examples above the players conflicting goals are expressed in their payoff functions f 1 and f 2 the characters of which appear in the shape of the pareto frontier for example in case of two players if the payoff functions are symmetric f 1 x y f 2 y x the pareto frontier is symmetric with respect to the 45 line passing through the origin of the coordinate system see e g example 1 and fig 4 for example 1 if the payoff functions are not symmetric the pareto frontier is not symmetric either see e g example 3 and fig 4 for example 3 example 7 farmer type 1 farmer type 1 farmer type 1 ν 1 m3 h in examples 7 and 8 there are three players and v 1 m3 h constant in example 7 each of them is a farmer with the same weighting function as in examples 1 and 2 that is s 1 s 2 s 3 s f 1 so the problem is symmetric in accordance with fig 2 each player has 4 pure strategies ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 in the discretized static game with the payoff values in eur listed in the appendix the pure strategies x 0 1 0 0 y 0 1 0 0 and w 0 1 0 0 are obtained with respect to the non cooperative nash equilibrium strategies for player 1 2 and 3 respectively which involves 53 2 eur payoff for each

cooperation since all players would gain a higher payoff in this case than with the strategies of the nash equilibrium even their sum payoff the system payoff would be maximal as well however these strategies do not form a nash equilibrium example 8 farmer type 1 farmer type 2 canteen ν 1 m3 h in this example player 1 is a farmer with weighting function s 1 s f 1 player 2 is a farmer with weighting function s 2 s f 2 and player 3 is a works canteen with weighting function s 3 s c so the problem is asymmetric for the players payoff values with respect to the discretized static game in

it means lower payoff for player 1 and 3 than in case of the nash equilibrium these pure strategies when player 1 irrigates in the fourth hour player 2 irrigates in the second hour and the canteen consumes in the fourth hour can be recommended for cooperation only if the players re distribute their sum payoff 28 5 380 0 5 3 eur in such a way that player 1 and 3 get not less payoff than with playing the strategies of the nash equilibrium 5 applicability and limitation since the proposed differential game 1 is rather general the worked out discretization and solution method can be used essentially for any water resource water storage used by more consumers nevertheless if the considered time period t is divided into more sub periods more than four as in the above examples or if there are more players more than three as in the above examples the computational demand grows significantly which may cause the needed calculations impossible to carry out above a certain number of sub periods and players 6 conclusion a differential game with arbitrary number of players has been proposed in the present study for describing the players water consumptions from a limited water resource as well as the natural recharge of the resource the general solution method of allocating the available water among the players has been worked out to maximize the players yields by means of discretizing their general strategy sets the solution has been detailed more for the case of two consumers completed with several practical examples first the non cooperative solution nash equilibrium of the conflict game has been provided then its pareto optimality has been checked finally the pareto optimal strategy pair which has the maximal sum payoff for the players has been recommended as the possible cooperative solution after eventually re distributing the payoffs on the basis of the results it can be concluded that this solution as the cooperative one generally provides higher payoff for all players than if they consumed the water according to their conflicting non cooperative behaviour in addition two examples with three consumers have been provided similarly the practical examples have been related to different agricultural and social consumers so it can be seen that the worked out solution process can be adopted to a wide range of real situations furthermore the examples have been rested on real and detailed background data which represents the direct applicability of the results there exist several stability concepts in the field φ stability ψ stability k stability m stability in connection with the possible cooperation among the players in case of more than two consumers it may be reasonable to assess them to evaluate the stability robustness of the possible coalitions among the players with respect to the here proposed game in future researches such studies may further contribute to understand the players water consuming behaviour and to work out an overall water saving strategy acknowledgements the first author thanks the contribution of his colleagues at the department of mathematics institute of environmental systems faculty of

6781,in coastal areas flood events can result from the interaction of several factors such as rainfall river flow and the classical tidal asymmetry to mention but a few therefore flood risk assessment in these areas involves not only the estimation of the extreme values of each variable but also their probability of occurring simultaneously this study investigates the combined effect and dependence between a heavy rainfall with a high tidal levels forcing on the occurrence and severity of floods in the urban neighborhood close to the estuary of the bouregreg river morocco the methodology used for this analysis is based on a bivariate copula model to evaluate the joint risk probability of flood events the estimated joint probability is used to define the boundary conditions for a hydraulic model to quantify the water levels and the extent of floods caused by the combination of both extreme rainfall and storm surge the considered variables reveal a not negligible correlation and the copula approach seems to be suitable and enough flexible for analyzing separately marginal distributions of the source variables and their structure of dependence results show that the joint probability of rainfall and tide both exceeding their critical thresholds remains low to moderate and the biggest threat to this area might be caused by heavy rainfall however high tide adds an extra risk by reducing the capacity of the urban drainage in absorbing storm water especially when rainfall intensity exceeds 100 years return period although rainfall and tide introduce a wide range of time scale meteorological forcing this won t prevent storm surge and extreme rainfall events resulting from climate change to take place in the future on the same day leading to some of the most critical flooding scenarios in this area keywords flood joint risk tide rainfall bivariate copula dependence 1 introduction estuarine hydrodynamic is controlled by the inflow of rivers tides the rainfall the wind and other oceanic events such as an upwelling an eddy and storms extreme or compound events related to all these factors happening simultaneously or in close succession can create a situation where severe flooding may occur this statement makes sense and is still valid even if the compound events are not all extreme per se but only their combination xu et al 2014 lian et al 2013 leonard et al 2014 petroliagkis et al 2016 pappadà et al 2017 therefore for more accurate assessment of flood risk in these areas it is necessary to evaluate the dependence between these factors there is however a lack of knowledge about the interaction between the hydrologic variables rainfall river flow astronomical tide storm surge and therefore the risk of flooding in estuarine environments is hardly quantifiable due to their dynamic nature and the complex interaction of tidal and catchment processes petroliagkis et al 2016 as such several joint probability theories have been recently incorporated into flood risk analysis including two or more hydrological variables one of the most applied joint probability models in hydrology is the copula model according to sklar s theorem 1959 any multivariate joint cumulative distribution function can be expressed in terms of univariate marginal distribution functions and a copula which describes the dependence structure between the variables the most important feature of a copula model is the way it makes it possible to model the dependence structure independently of the marginal distributions therefore many recent studies have used copula model to highlight the importance of studying the combined effect of rainfall and tide processes in estuaries and coastal areas lian et al 2013 and xu et al 2014 investigated the joint probability and effect of the tidal level and rainfall on flood risk in a coastal city using copula based model they confirmed that some positive dependence exists between rainfall and tidal level indicating that tidal level poses an additional risk of flooding the presence of this structural and statistical dependence between rainfall and high tides storm surge has already been studied by pugh 1987 coles et al 1999 and svensson and jones 2002 who tried to quantify the strength of this dependence all these studies confirmed the existence of a statistically significant dependence between extreme rainfall and extreme storm surge within the same spatial context white 2009 combined traditional flood risk modeling techniques with statistical dependence to assess the relationship between river flow tide and surge for lewes east sussex uk he used then a one dimensional hydraulic model to predict the joint probability of potential flood events occurring in lewes he concluded that a small amount of dependence between the extremes of river flow and sea level can have an important impact on the subsequent water levels in an estuary chen et al 2012 established the joint distribution and calculated the coincidence probabilities of flood magnitudes and flood occurrence dates to analyze the risk of flood in the upper yangtze river in china and the colorado river in the united states using copula function while wahl et al 2012 analyzed the statistical dependence between storm surges and wind waves in two tide stations in the german bight using copula based approach both studies confirmed that the copula concept represents a promising tool for studying multivariate problems in hydrology and coastal engineering similar conclusions were found by ganguli and reddy 2013 who used a copula based methodology for probabilistic flood risks assessment and explored the performance of trivariate copulas in modeling dependence structure of flood properties considering peak flow volume and duration of flood hydrograph zheng et al 2013 2014 studied the interaction between extreme rainfall and storm surge using bivariate logistic threshold excess model along the australian coastline they reported that a significant dependence was observed for most of the tide gauge locations daneshkhah et al 2016 analyzed the joint distribution of flood event properties and quantified the associated uncertainty using pair copulas they stated that copula is an efficient tool that can be used for probabilistic flood hazard assessment more recently sebastian et al 2017 estimated the joint exceedance probabilities for peak surge and cumulative precipitation using bayesian network based on gaussian copulas to model the hydraulic boundary conditions in a coastal watershed an issue to mention here within those studies and which has been discussed only by few authors concerns the data selected for estimating hydrological and meteorological factors dependence hawkes 2008 for example has discussed this issue and considered it as critical for dependence study indeed samuels and burt 2002 modeled the dependence between peak river flows on the taff at pontypridd and sea levels at cardiff in south wales uk concluding that there was no correlation between the peak flows and the high sea levels in contrast a dependence analysis by svensson and jones 2004 for the same area found statistically significant dependence between daily mean river flow at pontypridd and surge at avonmouth the contradictory conclusions may be due to the different datasets that were used with peak river flow and peak sea level being used in samuels and burt 2002 and daily mean river flow and surge being used in svensson and jones 2004 related to this zheng et al 2013 stated that this could be because the use of peak sea level which is in most cases dominated by astronomical tide may lead to lower dependence compared to when using storm surge estimates directly as it is only the latter quantity that is likely to be physically associated with extreme rainfall under the same meteorological conditions all these research studies have outlined the fact that univariate flood frequency analysis cannot provide a complete assessment of the occurrence probability of extremes if the underlying event is characterized by a set of interrelated random variables chebana and ouarda 2011 masina et al 2015 it becomes thus urgent and pressing to recognize that the risk posed by these events is likely to become more important in the future as existing coastal communities become threatened by rising sea levels and changing tidal regimes archetti et al 2011 zhang and singh 2007 towns close to tidal rivers and estuaries like the ones we are dealing with in this study rabat and salé morocco are at risk from the combination of extreme rainfall fluvial and tidal flooding egis bceom international iau idf brgm 2011 rmsi 2012 that can almost ruin their entire assets in the near future and set back their urban development by years or even decades the costs of protecting these cities from rising sea levels and storms are also likely to rise with increased precipitation resulting from climate change furthermore the pressure for increased urbanization of low lying areas is expected to create major flood risk problems for many coastal and estuarine towns zellou and rahali 2017 petroliagkis et al 2016 bevacqua et al 2017 a storm on thursday the 23rd of february 2017 has dumped over 120 mm of rain in just a few hours causing flooding in the coastal neighboring cities of rabat and salé the most plausible way to explain this extreme event is to account for the variability of rainfall and storm tide the large amounts of precipitation that fell in the surrounding area which are normally collected by urban drainage systems and headed toward the sea or the tidal river were partially obstructed from spilling out into the sea by the storm surge have then contributed to major flooding along the coastal area ignoring therefore the storm tide s impact to flooding may necessarily lead to underestimation of the risk of flooding this event emphasizes the importance of studying joint probabilities of extreme events and the fact that conventional univariate statistical analysis is not accurate to bring enough information regarding the multivariate nature of these events therefore the present research focuses on bivariate flood frequency analysis including data preparation parameter selection and methodology application the source variable pair presented here is the maximum annual 24 h rainfall and corresponding tide data we present the application of the copula based joint probability method to generate a combination of critical rainfall amounts and critical high tides exceeding both certain threshold values according to different return periods those values were applied as input to caesar lisflood cl model coulthard et al 2002 2013 zellou and rahali 2017 to predict patterns of maximum water depth which may derive from different flood sources cl model focus on the nearshore processes to replicate the tidewater hydrodynamics therefore the model grid needs to be setup to include river channel floodplain topography and nearshore bathymetry this study demonstrates that by putting emphasis on statistical dependence between seemingly independent variables it is possible to investigate their multivariate extreme value distributions which are suitable for modelling the tails of multidimensional phenomena and the associated risk when these variables are above a certain critical threshold a parametric copula is initially fitted to the whole dataset to characterize the overall dependence structure and the tail behavior of that particular copula is extracted later we estimate non parametrically schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 the lower and upper tail copulas and show that the joint distribution of the rainfall and high tide level are rather upper tail dependent a fact which cannot be detected by fitting a copula to the whole dataset huser et al 2017 stated that without firm knowledge about the tail properties of the data it is safer i e more conservative in terms of risk of joint extremes to assume asymptotic dependence we have proceeded therefore with the tails estimation and characterization by giving a strong attention to appropriately capturing the tail extreme behavior before any joint probability evaluation and since it is common for many environmental processes to exhibit weakening spatial dependence as events become more extreme huser and wadsworth 2018 very extreme joint risks tend to be strongly overestimated if the data exhibit decreasing dependence strength at more extreme levels ledford and tawn 1997 davison et al 2013 therefore the increase of upper tail dependence strength should be enough to explain why a copula is able to connect extreme rainfall to high tide level the strong asymptotic dependence justification of extreme events should give evidence that concomitant extreme events are observed and both are at the same scale and that copula provides a robust modeling framework especially when few extreme data are available here due to limited data availability the focus of rainfall using copula is much on extreme event itself when the rainfall amount changes and implicitly not on its temporal and spatial characteristics müller and kaspar 2010 xiao et al 2013 in order to estimate the dependence with tide levels since it is widely accepted that extreme precipitation changes are one type of significant perspectives to scientifically assess the behaviors and changes of climatic systems allan and soden 2008 kysely et al 2011 fan et al 2012 li et al 2013 rouge et al 2013 xu et al 2014 this paper takes thus into account only the precipitation change when we analyze its associated risk the paper is organized as follows the case study area bouregreg estuary is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the methods and the data requirements including a brief description of copula concept and their mathematical formulation the results of the joint risk probability of extreme rainfall and tidal levels and the consequent inundation patterns are reported and discussed in section 4 finally conclusions are given in section 5 2 study area bouregreg estuary is located in northwestern part of morocco fig 1 it belongs to an area characterized by semiarid climate with average annual rainfall of 440 mm and average annual temperature of 18 c the river of bouregreg flows downstream into the atlantic ocean between two cities raba and salé with populations of about 577 827 and 982 163 respectively the close urban neighborhoods on the coastal area of rabat and sale have recently experienced several flood events from multiple sources sea and rainfall on the night of 6 to 7 january 2014 a strong storm surge came tumbling down on the moroccan atlantic coast affecting mainly the coastal zones this phenomenon is mainly due to an atmospheric depression of the atlantic ocean coupled with high winds ranging from 60 to 100 km h northwesterly causing giant waves of between 6 and 7 m these extreme values can also be explained by the coincidence of high swell with a high tide up to 3 3 5 m height more recently on the 23rd of february 2017 a storm dumped over 120 mm of rain in just a few hours causing flooding in the neighboring cities of rabat and salé fig 2 the river which normally absorbs rainwater through the sewers urban drainage was partially obstructed from draining into the sea by the storm surge which then contributed to major flooding along the coast the combined effects of high sea level and high intensity rainfall may seem to have contributed to tide locking of drains the low lying areas along these two cities coast are susceptible to marine inundation from severe storm surge events the major recent storm event that affected rabat and sale coasts occurred on february the second 2017 just 3 weeks before the flooding mentioned here above during which a water level of 3 30 m over tide gauge zero approximately 2 13 m above current mean sea level was reached the exceptional character of this storm derived from the extremely severe meteorological contribution to the observed sea level peak since exceptional water level continued to be recorded during the coming three weeks 3 59 m recorded the 12th of february at 03 55 am and 3 39 at 3 20 pm 3 52 m the 13th at 3 40am and must have led to the flooding of the 23rd of february 2017 according to jiang and tatano 2015 focusing on urban areas spatial flood risk assessment should reflect all risk information derived from multiple flood sources including rainfall rivers drainage coast etc and their joint effects which may affect coastal urban areas therefore an understanding of the dependence between the variables causing flood would allow a more accurate estimation of their combined probability of occurrence thus greater confidence in the assessment and preparedness to face any associated risk 3 methods and data 3 1 bivariate flood frequency analysis joint modelling using copula functions 3 1 1 copula concept copulas are a kind of distribution functions and have emerged as a powerful approach in simplifying multivariate stochastic analysis xu et al 2014 this method has become popular and flexible way to measure nonlinear correlation and dependencies among variables and to construct multivariate distributions the copulas functions join multivariate distribution functions to their one dimensional marginal distribution functions nelsen 2006 jiang and tatano 2015 the use of copula based models in hydrology has gained popularity only in recent years where they were employed to estimate multivariate distribution in the calculation of conditional probabilities and their use in bivariate simulation or in the calculation of the return periods of bivariate events salvadori et al 2007 bardossy and pegram 2009 balistrocchi and bacchi 2011 van den berg et al 2011 in this section we will present the concepts of copula theory and more precisely the archimedean copulas archimedean copulas are very simple to implement thanks to the explicit relationships that link the parameter of the copula to a measure of dependence which is kendall s tau τ let f be a 2 dimensional distribution function with univariate margins f 1 and f 2 for random variables x and y respectively according to sklar s theorem 1959 there exists a copula c such that 1 f x y c f 1 x f 2 y x y r with c unique when f 1 x a n d f 2 y are continuous marginal distributions so that c 0 1 2 0 1 that satisfies the boundary conditions c x 0 c 0 x 0 and c x 1 c 1 x x uniform margins for any x 0 1 and the so called 2 increasing property papaioannou et al 2016 this method separates the joint distribution into a copula function and marginal distributions and has the advantage that the selection of an appropriate model for the dependence between varieties represented by the copula can then proceed independently from the choice of marginal distributions as for the basic theory and concepts of copula readers may refer to the monographs by joe 1997 and nelsen 2006 for additional details for construction of high dimensional copulas such as nested archimedean construction nac and pair copula construction pcc readers may refer to aas and berg 2009 savu and trede 2010 and czado 2010 the archimedean copulas are considered to be one of the well known classes of copulas they can capture different lower and upper tail dependencies between variables with small number of parameters because they are not restricted to radial symmetry hofert 2010 a 2 dimensional copula c is called archimedean if it admits the representation nelsen 2006 2 c u 1 u 2 ψ 1 ψ u 1 ψ u 2 for some archimedean generator ψ with its inverse function ψ 1 fig 3 displays the two grouped rainfall and tide data in a plot matrix this is useful for canonical correlation analysis using pearson s correlation coefficient top right panel and regression analysis bivariate relation bottom left the top left and bottom right panels represent density plot for every variable that helps identify skewness kurtosis and distribution information of each variable the aim of understanding this relationship is to predict change of one variable r for a unit change in the other variable t though the correlation coefficient is not the only measure to conclude that 2 numeric variables are correlated even though they change with time since it is about two time series although the dependence between extreme rainfall and storm surge is typically weak fig 3 such weak dependence remains constant or even increases when their exceedance probabilities decrease zheng et al 2014 this is referred to as asymptotic dependence and has been observed by many previous hydrological studies such as svensson and jones 2002 hawkes 2008 and white 2009 to more recent analysis carried out by zheng et al 2013 and lian et al 2013 accordingly in this paper we focus on the class of copulas that offer greater flexibility and allowed the modelling of complex dependence patterns and specifically for extremal dependence to able a correct estimate of the flood risk in this coastal area while the class of elliptical copulas fang et al 2002 frahm et al 2003 has been considered unsuitable for tail dependence analysis the class of archimedean copulas including gumbel clayton frank joe ali mikhail haq were considered the most flexible modeling tools when assessing the joint tail behavior of imperceptibly dependent random vectors such as rainfall and tide levels in this context the five copulas from the archimedean class table 1 are tested to select the best copula the one that best fits our hydrologic data the highest tidal level t during the annual maximum 24 h rainfall r observations for these two random variables from 1987 to 2017 were collected as samples to estimate their joint distribution function depending on the joint distribution function the joint probability of any combinations of rainfall and tidal level over some values may be assessed including the extremes that rainfall and tidal level both exceed certain threshold values 3 1 2 copula selection an important issue in using copula approach is to choose the best copula family and estimate its parameters to select the best copula model for the pair of variables r t we used the akaike aic and bayesian information criteria bic akaike 1973 schwarz 1978 these criteria offer interesting advantages over frequently used statistical tests because they consider parameter dependence and they can be applied to any copula family as long as the copula density can be calculated silva and lopes 2008 that said the aic test is however known to have a tendency of selecting models that are too large e g claeskens and hjort 2008 the bic on the other hand is able to consistently select the true model but only when the number of possible parameters grows sufficiently slowly with the sample size n nagler et al 2018 for observations u i j i 1 n j 1 2 the aic and bic of a bivariate copula family c with parameter s θ are defined as 3 aic 2 i 1 n l n c u i 1 u i 2 θ 2 n p 4 bic 2 i 1 n l n c u i 1 u i 2 θ l n n n p where n p i s t h e n u m b e r o f p a r a m e t e r s i n t h e c o p u l a m o d e l n p 1 2 the five copulas including gumbel clayton frank joe and ali mikhail haq are fitted using maximum likelihood estimation then the two criteria are computed for these archimedean copulas and the family with the minimum values is selected 3 1 3 about the joint probability and dependence strength estimation the notion of tail dependence is more interesting in risk analysis according to kumar 2010 tail dependence describes the limiting proportion that one margin exceeds a certain threshold given that the other margin has already exceeded that threshold however like any scalar measure of dependence tail dependence measure suffers from a certain loss of information concerning the joint behavior in the tails of the distribution in the context of tail dependence the immediate analogues of copulas which describe the entire dependence structure is given by tail copulas refer to schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 and frahm et al 2005 for further details on tail copulas joe 1997 defines the tail dependence if a bivariate copula c u1 u2 is such that 5 lim u 1 1 2 u c u u 1 u λ u exists then c u1 u2 has upper tail dependence for λu 0 1 and no upper tail dependence for λu 0 this measure is extensively used in extreme value theory it is the probability that one variable is extreme given that the other is extreme i e λ u p r u 1 u u 2 u thus λu can be viewed as a quantile dependent measure of dependence coles et al 1999 owing to sklar s theorem there exists a unique copula c for which identity eq 1 holds genest and favre 2007 therefore just as f1 x and f2 y give an exhaustive description of x and y taken separately the joint dependence between these variables is fully and uniquely characterized by c nevertheless the assessment of the dependence between variables is necessary before a copula model for a pair of variables x y is sought and before estimating joint probability of extremes sometimes when dependence exists it is more marked amongst the higher observed values stormy conditions than amongst the lower values therefore as with single variable extremes analysis it can be important to choose the appropriate threshold above which to determine a dependence representative of extreme events dependence checking could be done either by visualizing dependence or by the performance of statistical tests the scatter plot of ranks chi plot fisher and switzer 1985 2001 and k plot genest and boies 2003 are the most common graphical tools for detecting dependence for the very reason that they are invariant with respect to monotone transformations of the variables and are thus scale free li et al 2011 3 1 4 joint flood risk probability analysis flood frequency analysis of hydrologic data consists of obtaining relationship between the magnitude of extreme events and their frequency of occurrence through the use of probability distributions chow 1988 delignette muller and duttang 2015 ganguli and reddy 2013 daneshkhah et al 2016 in case of bivariate flood frequency analysis the joint return period is computed using inclusive probability and and or salvadori 2004 the first probability in which both of the two hydrologic variables r and t exceed simultaneously their thresholds return period would define the boundary conditions for the hydraulic modeling of extreme joint flood events this is the appropriate method when both variables play a role in the genesis of the risk eq 6 while the second probability or assumes that only one of the parameters r or t exceeds some extreme values eq 7 this method is often used in design and safety assessment of estuary flood defenses since each of the hydrologic variable source rainfall or tide could cause flooding e g biondi and de luca 2017 the two joint exceedance probabilities are given by the following formulas 6 p r r t t 1 f r r f t t f c r t 7 p r r t t 1 f c r t where f r and f t are the distribution functions of the marginal distributions 3 2 hydraulic simulation of extreme joint flood event 3 2 1 hydraulic model cl is a geomorphological and landscape evolution model that combines the caesar geomorphic model and the last version of the lisflood fp 2 d hydrodynamic flow model bates et al 2010 to simulate erosion and depositional changes in river catchments and reaches over a range of time from one hour to 1000 s of years and space from 1 to 100 km scales coulthard et al 2000 2002 cl can be run in three modes a catchment mode with rainfall input a reach mode with points where inflow discharges are inputted to the system and a stage tidal input mode with four coordinates delineating an area within which the tidewater levels inputs will be added to the dem there are four main functions of cl the hydrological model slope processes fluvial erosion and deposition and the flow model only the last function will be investigated in this paper to replicate the tidewater hydrodynamics of bouregreg estuary in stage tidal mode and rainfall input in catchment mode for more detailed information about cl model equations refer to coulthard et al 2000 2002 2013 van de wiel et al 2007 and coulthard 2011 3 2 2 data preparation to simulate rainfall and tide flooding cl requires a digital elevation model dem that should be set up to include not only river channel and floodplain but also nearshore bathymetry necessary to replicate the tidewater hydrodynamics we used the global multi resolution topography gmrt version 3 3 dem 50 m pixel resolution which brings together a variety of elevation sources delivered as multi resolution gridded that includes land topography and ocean bathymetry ryan et al 2009 to represent spatial surface roughness the model needs land use cover grid file having the same format header and extents as the dem each land use cover class bare ground beach discontinuous residential fabric industrial area river road or railway space urban green space agricultural land forest sports fields stream and urban area is identified in the grid cell and a corresponding manning s n value is assigned to that class based on values proposed by chow 1964 bed roughness controls the development of the flood wave within the cl model lewis et al 2013 many studies confirmed that flood extent water depth and velocity are also sensitive to roughness parameter bates and de roo 2000 gallegos et al 2009 the manning n value that represents channel roughness can be determined based on standards proposed by chow 1959 1964 1988 barnes 1967 or ree 1954 but due to dredging activities man made and the variability of sediments rates in estuaries this value should be well adjusted during calibration process the calibration was realized using tide forcing for a year long period 2014th see fig a 1 four channel roughness values were tested 0 005 0 01 0 015 and 0 02 these values were selected by examining the difference between simulated and observed tidewater level four statistical parameters were calculated to assess model performance in predicting water level including the coefficient of determination r2 r squared value rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error and spearman correlation 3 2 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions include the rainfall hyetograph in urban areas synthetic storm hyetographs and tidal input were therefore estimated based on r t pairs generated from the fitted bivariate copula based distribution in order to be routed through the study area first the design rainfall for different return periods 5 10 20 and 50 years based on rainfall data from local intensity duration frequency idf curves chow 1964 were created a set of observed rainfall hyetograph and stage hydrograph was used as a sample to ascribe each of synthetic data shape to the chosen synthetic r t pair via randomization achieved by coupling a stochastic rainfall generator and the hydrological model both calibrated in the basin then the resulted synthetic hyetograph for the 50 year return period was used as input to the hydraulic model cl fig 4 tidewater level data for the bouregreg estuary was obtained from a gauge station located at coordinates 034 04 00 0 n 006 46 00 0 w and using the hydrographic zero as a height reference a 31 years of hourly tidewater level from 1987 to 2017 optionally when tidal station data are not available or of poor quality cl can be driven with modelled storm surge heights applied to coastal segments with similar surge characteristics lewis et al 2013 ramirez et al 2016 a typical tidewater level hydrograph with one hour time step was designed based on the results of the joint probability analysis of extreme events to run cl in tidal stage mode fig 4 this tidewater level hydrograph will be added to the nearshore location of bouregreg river over a period of a week by comparing the results of simulations with and without tide the impact of atlantic ocean tide on the surface water dynamics in the bouregreg estuary can be identified 4 results and discussion 4 1 joint flood frequency analysis 4 1 1 marginal probabilities as stated above one of the strong points of the copula approach is the way it makes it possible to model the dependence structure independently on the choice of the marginal laws therefore the marginal distributions of the two hydrological variables e g 31 year annual maximum 24 h rainfall r recorded at aguibat ezziar gauging station for the period of 1987 2017 and the highest tidal level during the annual maximum 24 h rainfall t are estimated separately several distributions including burr lognormal log logistic gamma and weibull were used to fit the marginal distributions of rainfall and tide data fig 5 three goodness of fit tests the kolmogorov smirnov test chakravarti et al 1967 chowdhury et al 1991 cramer von mises and anderson darling test statistics were performed to find the probabilities distribution functions that best fit r and t these tests were then backed up with classical penalized criteria based on the loglikelihood aic bic to ensure that there has been no overfitting the purpose of these tests is to measure the distance between the fitted parametric distribution and the empirical distribution e g the distance between the fitted cumulative distribution function and the empirical distribution function table 2 gives the definition and the empirical estimate of the three considered goodness of fit statistics d agostino and stephens 1986 since we are interested in giving more weight to distribution s tails the anderson darling statistic is of special interest when it matters to equally emphasize the tails as well as the main body of a distribution which is often the case in risk assessment cullen and frey 1999 vose 2010 however this statistic computed for several distributions fitted on the same data set are theoretically difficult to compare because the weighting of each cdf quadratic difference depends on the parametric distribution in its definition and should be moderated by looking at the result of classical penalized criteria based on the loglikelihood aic bic to detect eventual overfitting delignette muller and duttang 2015 table 3 shows that for tide data all the goodness of fit statistics based on the cdf distance are in favor of the gamma distribution it is the only one characterized by three parameters and confirmed by aic and bic values giving the preference to the gamma distribution to be used for forecasting tides for different return periods while the weibull distribution adjusted using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method was the most appropriate distribution for the corresponding rainfall data series the parameters used to fit the marginal probability distributions gamma and weibull are shown in the appendix table a 1 fitting a parametric distribution to data sometimes results in a model that agrees well with the data in high density regions compared to areas of low density known as the tails of the distribution one of the reasons why a model might fit poorly in the tails is that by definition there are fewer data in the tails on which to base a choice of model and so models are often chosen based on their ability to fit data near the mode add to that the fact that the distribution of real data is often more complicated than the usual parametric models as we are primarily concerned with the identification of variables extremal behavior fitting the data in the tail is our main concern the generalized pareto distribution gp has been developed as a distribution that can model tails of a wide variety of distributions based on theoretical arguments gp is a right skewed distribution which is suitable for analyzing upper tail data and can be defined by construction in terms of exceedances starting with a probability distribution whose right tail falls to zero like normal we sampled 2000 random values independently of this distribution we then fixed a threshold values for both tide and rainfall which allows to throw out all the values that are below the threshold and to subtract the threshold off of the values that are not thrown out the result is known as exceedances fig 6 fig 6 shows the return levels with the return periods estimated on 2000 simulated sample for both rainfall and tide variables confidence intervals have been added to these plots as the empirical mean can be supposed to be normally distributed central limit theorem however normality doesn t hold anymore for high threshold as there are less and less excesses table 4 gives examples of extreme quantiles estimated for four return periods 4 1 2 best fit copula selection this study applied the archimedean class including clayton frank gumbel joe and ali mikhail haq amh copulas which were tested to select the best fit copula the parameters of each family were calculated using the maximum likelihood method table 5 fig 7 shows the scatter plots of simulated bivariate random variables based on the fitted copulas the two criteria aic and bic are calculated for these copulas and the family with the smallest values is then selected for these criteria only the log likelihood itself can be used to assess how well a copula model fits the data and the higher log likelihood leads to a smaller relative aic or bic representing a better model fit killiches and kraus 2017 even though both aic and bic penalize the negative maximum log likelihood of the estimated model by the number of parameters in the model kumar 2010 negative values of aic and bic table 5 can be interpreted as penalized log likelihood functions joe 2015 as to the specific form of the dependence no definite conclusion can be drawn except for clayton none of the other copula candidates is to be really rejected even the gumbel copula could be an applicable alternative based on these results the joe copula having the upper value of log likelihood and lower values of aic and bic is the best fit amongst the five copulas considered in this study to describe the dependence between rainfall and tide after copula selection the joint bivariate distribution function was constructed taking in consideration the selected marginal distributions fig 8 a illustrates the density of the generated bivariate distribution and fig 8 b their corresponding contours and marginal distributions according to model selection results the estimated joint distribution function f c r t for r and t can then be presented as follows 8 f c r t 1 1 f r 1 54 1 f t 1 54 1 f r 1 54 1 f t 1 54 1 1 54 where f r and f t are gamma and weibull marginal distributions for maximum 24 h rainfall and tide respectively fig 8 b shows the joint probability contours for the maximum annual rainfall and the corresponding tide levels blue lines to calculate the joint probability the variables were fit to their marginal distributions and iso probability contours were plotted in the probability density space for comparison an approximate density contour based on the empirical bivariate data 24 h maximum rainfall and the corresponding tide has been drawn and added to the contour plot with colors indicating the probability density at each point red is low density and white is high density the contours in the high density area white are an approximately asymmetrical ellipsis which is what we can expect from gamma and weibull distributions the density changes comparatively slowly along both rainfall and tide axes in practice the interpretation of joint probabilities requires the attribution of a probability to exceed a certain threshold th1 th2 for the two variables rainfall and tide level taken simultaneously it considers thus that both variables play a role in the genesis of risk copula s contours blue lines illustrate the joint probabilities of not exceeding for both variables from these iso probability curves we estimate the joint probabilities for different return periods as given in table 6 4 2 joint flood risk probability analysis 4 2 1 upper tail dependence analysis in the context of extrapolation in multivariate frequency analysis it is important to properly model the dependence of extremes or tail dependence salvadori et al 2007 poulin et al 2007 frahm et al 2005 so before we start analyzing the joint probability we need first to address the question whether the joint distribution of rainfall r and tide t tends to generate extreme values simultaneously and constitutes in this sense a dangerous combination to consider in the flood risk forecast to evaluate whether a copula model should be applied for the above mentioned purpose kendall correlation coefficient was calculated to identify the dependence structure the kendall correlation coefficient was found to be 0 2325458 to visualize this dependence we used chi plot and kendall plot fig 9 which represent graphically the dependence of the pair of variables r t the chi plot called also rank based graphical tool is usually used in conjunction with a traditional scatterplot of the raw data it can help detect the presence of association in a random sample from some continuous bivariate distributions the other alternative display is the kendall plot k plot for short which adapts the concept of probability plot to the detection of dependence fisher and switzer 2001 genest and boies 2003 according to genest and boies 2003 k plots are easier to interpret than chi plots however because the curvature that they display in cases of association is related in a definite way to the copula characterizing the underlying dependence structure in addition k plots have the advantage of being readily extendible to the multivariate context fig 9 illustrates graphically the dependence of the pair of r and t variables as we can see these variables are dependent however their dependence may be qualified as low but is still significant according to the chi plot fig 9 a the two variables seem to be independent as most of the events are found in the area between the confidence intervals fisher and switzer 1985 2001 whereas independency on the k plot is assumed when the events are located on the line x y this latter fig 9 b provided as a complement suggests the presence of mild positive association in the data a positive dependence is identified if the events are located above the line a negative dependence is indicated when the points are under the line the conclusions obtained by the diagrams are consistent with the estimated correlation coefficients and are not so obvious from the only scatterplot fig 9 c but in line with the empirical values of spearman s rho ρ 0 2581686 and kendall s tau τ 0 23 the k plot highlights also the presence of a cluster in the upper right corner of the rank scatter plot underlying the positive association between rainfall and tide it should be noted here that any scalar measure of dependence such as ρ and τ cannot describe the whole dependence structure of the joint distribution therefore having concluded that r and t are positively dependent we now address the problem of estimating their copula in order to assess the risk of joint extreme events we apply the concept of tail copulas as the focus of this paper is to characterize and measure extremal dependence the large part of this section is devoted to the concept of tail dependence which concentrates on the upper and lower quadrant tails of the joint distribution in the bivariate copula case the standard way to determine whether r and t are tail dependent is to look at the so called upper and lower tail dependence coefficients denoted by λu and λl respectively joe 1997 9 λ u lim u 1 p r f r 1 u t f t 1 u 10 λ l lim u 0 p r f r 1 u t f t 1 u where f r 1 and f t 1 are the pseudo inverses of f r and f t respectively f r and f t are the distribution functions of the marginal distributions of r and t nelsen 2006 showed that tail dependence coefficients are nonparametric and depend only on the copula c and can be estimated provided that the above limits exist eqs 9 and 10 by 11 lim u 1 c 1 u 1 u 1 u lim u 1 1 2 u c u u 1 u λ u 12 lim u 0 c u u u λ l where c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 1 c 1 u 1 1 u 2 is a survival copula λu eq 9 is the limit of the conditional probability that r is greater than or equal to the u th quantile of f r 1 u given that t is greater than or equal to the u th quantile of f t 1 u and then consider the limit as u goes to 1 provided it exists similarly λl is the limit if it exists of the conditional probability that r is less than or equal to the u th quantile of f r 1 u given that t is less than or equal to the u th quantile of f t 1 u as u approaches 0 if λl 0 1 then c has lower tail dependence but if λl 0 then c has no lower tail dependence likewise if λu 0 then c has no upper tail dependence and if λu 0 1 then c has upper tail dependence for our dataset we found λl 0 and λu 0 4315379 which implies that r and t variables exhibit upper tail dependence and said to be asymptotically dependent therefore large values of λu imply that joint extremes are more likely than for low values of λl r and t might have thus a relatively strong tendency to generate extreme values simultaneously however the returned tail dependency values are numerically of little importance and might in strict terms be misleading what should be of interest is the trajectory of the lower and upper lines when plotted notes in fig 10 how the upper tail quavers but seems to show stability towards near λu 0 45 and the lower tail line varies considerably in pitch downward towards λl 0 to better visualize the limiting behavior of λu in which we are interested in this study we plotted the tail dependence concentration function on the right tail according to durante and sempi 2015 the idea sought here is to plot on the right the empirical upper tail concentration function r n and compare it to our joe copula tail fitting having a kendall s tau of 0 23 and θ 1 54 fig 11 13 r n u i 1 n 1 x i f x 1 u y i f y 1 u i 1 n 1 x i f x 1 u the trend seen in fig 10 seems to be confirmed in fig 11 it seems also that λu does not exhibit the same invariance property as does copula under strictly increasing transformations of the random variables there is however like for any scalar measure of dependence a slight loss of information concerning the joint behavior in the extreme end of the distribution schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 emphasized with larger confidence interval the statistical convergence is quite obvious underlying clearly that joe copula has upper tail dependence 4 2 2 joint probability analysis risk analyses of natural hazards are commonly expressed as annual return periods t r in years which are defined for a non exceedance probability q as t r 1 1 q return period gives the estimated time interval between events of a similar size or magnitude however this definition does not state that an event of that size occurs just once inside the specified time interval but instead it is a mean of quantifying the probability that this event will occur in any given year regardless of when the last similar event has occurred while in the univariate case the return period is uniquely defined chow 1988 in bivariate analysis using the best fit copula we can estimate probabilities of the joint behavior of r and t with some extreme values based on the joint cdf of r t in this study the bivariate joint return periods called or operator and and operator were used salvadori et al 2007 sheng et al 2002 there may be several combinations of r and t of which the joint probability of occurrence should be considered in flood design and mitigation these combinations are important as extreme flood events with extreme high rainfall and high tidewater level may cause catastrophic floods the two inclusive risk probability events and and or are given in eqs 6 and 7 these events can be calculated based on the values of f r f t and f c r t for different combinations of return periods tables 7 and 8 the joint return periods corresponding to these events are then defined as 14 t and 1 p r r t t 15 t or 1 p r r t t fig 12 shows that as the two hazards extreme rainfall and storm surge can cooperate to cause failure for let s say 500 year event relative to the complement of non exceedance joint or inclusive condition the marginal probabilities must be considerably higher up to 0 9 the green curves represent the non exceedance joint or condition we have chosen to put the values of each variable rainfall and tide in their respective ranges instead of the probability scale within the interval 0 1 each of the lines refers to a specific return period and the values on the two axes top and right sides are equivalent to the probabilities of occurrence of the random variables x rainfall and y tide respectively with the probability scale transformed into a gumbel reduced variate ln lnp ln ln 1 1 rp rp is the return period these are actually a form of level curves equivalent to an even step interval of probability such as 10 percent level curves the complement of non exceedance joint or is the probability level that either or both random variables rainfall or tide causes flood at the respective return period on the other hand the blue curves represent the non exceedance joint and inclusive condition the complement of non exceedance joint or inclusive is the probability level that both random variables r t must simultaneously or dually occur to trigger a flooding at the respective return period we can notice that there is obvious symmetry in the joint or and and curves table 7 shows the probabilities of simultaneously exceeding thresholds of the two hydrological variables r and t for four marginal return periods 5 10 20 and 50 years according to this table the simultaneous occurrence probabilities of both extreme rainfall and extreme tidal level are very low it should also be noted that this type of event is very exceptional as rainfall and tides are not governed by the same drivers tides are mainly generated by astronomical movements of the earth moon and sun whereas the rainfall is principally generated by meteorological events dependence is more likely to exist between rainfall and the meteorological component of the tide which may both be produced by the same low pressure weather system zheng et al 2013 so the period of thirty one years of historical data considered in this study is relatively short and may not contain the rarest coincidence of extreme tide levels and rainfall resulting in an underestimation of the intensity and occurrence of these events for example the value 0 0086554 in table 7 shows that we have 0 86 of chance per year to have an extreme rainfall exceeding 123 83 mm and tidewater level exceeding 3 86 m in the bouregreg estuary thus the joint return period associated to this event calculated using eq 14 is t and 116 y e a r s while the return period associated to these quantiles in marginal distributions is 50 years fig 12 this example clearly shows that neglecting a positive dependency between the maximum rainfall and the corresponding tidewater level in the studied estuary may cause an underestimation of the probability of concurrent extreme events the outcomes of the joint flood risk probability assessment are then used in the hydraulic modeling to determine which combination gives the highest water level at a particular location in the study area 4 3 flood mapping of the joint risk of extreme rainfall and tide level 4 3 1 river bed roughness calibration river bed roughness was calibrated by comparing the predicted river and tidewater levels at different locations along the estuary with the observed data for tidal simulation the calibration was realized using tide forcing for a year long period 2014th fig a 1 four channel roughness values were tested 0 005 0 01 0 015 and 0 02 the results of the calibration process are described in table 9 the closest agreement was obtained using manning s n value equal to 0 01 for low and high tide periods fig 13 the tidewater levels were correctly replicated by cl model and the results obtained agree well with the tide gauge dataset the mean squared correlation and the mean spearman correlation coefficients were very close to 1 0 98 and 0 99 respectively the rmse values vary between 0 06 and 0 11 whereas the mae values span from 0 05 and 0 09 lewis et al 2013 states that the choice of manning roughness coefficient influences tide wave propagation more than the bathymetry s uncertainty ramirez et al 2016 who also used cl to simulate storm tide concluded that the bathymetry has no effect on the storm tide and inland flooding if the storm tide has been initiated across the nearshore area our result also confirms this because despite using a dem with a low resolution 50 m the results of the tidal simulation appear to be good therefore a good calibration process should be applied to estimate the effect of uncertainties lewis et al 2013 aronica et al 2002 skinner et al 2015 4 3 2 flood maps fig 14 a shows maximum inundation extent and depths predicted by cl for the 116 year joint exceedance return period event using the design hyetograph and the tidal curve presented in fig 4 while fig 14 b presents the results of the simulation using the same input design hyetograph but without tide inputs the 116 year joint return period flood which is a combination of high rainfall 123 83 mm and high tidewater level 3 87 m generated an inundation extent similar to what has been witnessed in the coastal area and the close neighborhood during the storm of 23rd of february 2017 it is worth mentioning here that the urban network wasn t included in the simulation and that a great deal of the 23rd of february 2017 flood is to be related to the fact that rainwater which is drained through the sewers was partially or totally obstructed from pouring into the sea the combined effects of high sea level and high intensity rainfall seem to have contributed to tide locking of urban drains and the rise of water level in the river channel and its floodplain in the estuarine area the accumulation of runoff water from the two cities which is supposed to be absorbed by the river and released into the ocean has been blocked by tidal currents producing an increase in the water level around the river mouth and then the propagation of flood to the inland region the spread of the ocean tide to the inland area is thus highly regulated by the spatiotemporal distributions of the absolute water surface elevations yamazaki et al 2012 there is no other plausible way than the multivariate analysis using the concept of copula to explain this rare event which caused the interruption of road and rail traffic between the north and south of the country for several hours furthermore the rapid growth of urbanization combined with the impacts of climate change along with the sea level rise and the frequency and severity of rainfall can only worsen the risk of flooding in view of this the univariate flood frequency analysis seems to be insufficient to design flood risk plan and mitigation despite the fact that the joint probability method is still considered a research topic and is not widely used in flood risk management plans hawkes 2005 it would be highly recommended in the case in point especially that the site is undergoing a big urban structuring project the area will undergo profound changes with a high density of habitats by 2030 this significant urban extension will increase the stakes related to flood management on a site highly exposed to the risks of flooding and marine submersion if all flood s inducing factors are not considered 5 conclusion in this paper the joint impact of extreme rainfall and extreme tide level on flood risk is assessed in bouregreg estuary including the joint flood risk probability analysis using bivariate copula model the joint probability method consists basically on the choice of the marginal law of each hydrological variable separately the weibull and the gamma distributions adjusted using the maximum likelihood method were the most appropriate distributions for the rainfall and the corresponding tidewater level series respectively the second step involves the selection of the copula that best fit our hydrologic data five archimedean copulas including gumbel clayton joe frank and ali mikhael haq are compared using the two criteria aic and bic the joe copula is chosen as the best fit copula and it is then used to model the joint cumulative distribution function of the flood variables in this study the bivariate dependence structure was then checked using many rank based graphical tools like the scatter plot of ranks chi plot and kendall plot the results of these dependence measures and the analysis of tail dependence coefficients confirmed that a significant dependence exists between these two hydrological variables even in cases where the dependence was low the correlation between rainfall and tide was still not negligible finally the joint return periods of flood using this copula are computed analyzed and then used to define the boundary conditions for the hydraulic modeling of extreme joint flood events based on the joint flood risk probability analysis the simultaneous occurrence probabilities of both extreme rainfall and extreme tidal level are very low this can be explained by the short duration of the hydrologic input series which may not contain these rare events however hydraulic simulations of these low frequency flood events which consist of rainfall input combined with high water levels from an exceptional tide in the bouregreg estuary show that ignoring the dependence between these hydrologic variables may lead to considerable underestimation of both the maximum flood water levels and extension flooding can occur whenever a significant amount of precipitation falls in only few hours the risk increases if this rainfall coincides with high tide or if the ground is already saturated by consecutive days of precipitation the comparison of simulated and recorded tide height showed that the tidal fluctuations were accurately simulated by the hydraulic model which has proved to be a valuable tool for simulating both tidal and fluvial hydrodynamics in data poor regions the analysis of the compound flood event rainfall tide show that during high tides water from the atlantic ocean pushes inland into inlets causing water levels throughout the region to rise the runoff water accumulated from the two cities which is supposed to be absorbed by the river and released into the ocean is then blocked and backflow into the inland area this study allowed understanding the spatial evolution of flooding caused by the combination of high rainfall and high tide level and hence identifying flood prone areas for these low frequency and high risk flood events it could also provide a significant support for flooding preparedness in the bouregreg estuary taking into account that design measures adequate for more than 10 years

6781,in coastal areas flood events can result from the interaction of several factors such as rainfall river flow and the classical tidal asymmetry to mention but a few therefore flood risk assessment in these areas involves not only the estimation of the extreme values of each variable but also their probability of occurring simultaneously this study investigates the combined effect and dependence between a heavy rainfall with a high tidal levels forcing on the occurrence and severity of floods in the urban neighborhood close to the estuary of the bouregreg river morocco the methodology used for this analysis is based on a bivariate copula model to evaluate the joint risk probability of flood events the estimated joint probability is used to define the boundary conditions for a hydraulic model to quantify the water levels and the extent of floods caused by the combination of both extreme rainfall and storm surge the considered variables reveal a not negligible correlation and the copula approach seems to be suitable and enough flexible for analyzing separately marginal distributions of the source variables and their structure of dependence results show that the joint probability of rainfall and tide both exceeding their critical thresholds remains low to moderate and the biggest threat to this area might be caused by heavy rainfall however high tide adds an extra risk by reducing the capacity of the urban drainage in absorbing storm water especially when rainfall intensity exceeds 100 years return period although rainfall and tide introduce a wide range of time scale meteorological forcing this won t prevent storm surge and extreme rainfall events resulting from climate change to take place in the future on the same day leading to some of the most critical flooding scenarios in this area keywords flood joint risk tide rainfall bivariate copula dependence 1 introduction estuarine hydrodynamic is controlled by the inflow of rivers tides the rainfall the wind and other oceanic events such as an upwelling an eddy and storms extreme or compound events related to all these factors happening simultaneously or in close succession can create a situation where severe flooding may occur this statement makes sense and is still valid even if the compound events are not all extreme per se but only their combination xu et al 2014 lian et al 2013 leonard et al 2014 petroliagkis et al 2016 pappadà et al 2017 therefore for more accurate assessment of flood risk in these areas it is necessary to evaluate the dependence between these factors there is however a lack of knowledge about the interaction between the hydrologic variables rainfall river flow astronomical tide storm surge and therefore the risk of flooding in estuarine environments is hardly quantifiable due to their dynamic nature and the complex interaction of tidal and catchment processes petroliagkis et al 2016 as such several joint probability theories have been recently incorporated into flood risk analysis including two or more hydrological variables one of the most applied joint probability models in hydrology is the copula model according to sklar s theorem 1959 any multivariate joint cumulative distribution function can be expressed in terms of univariate marginal distribution functions and a copula which describes the dependence structure between the variables the most important feature of a copula model is the way it makes it possible to model the dependence structure independently of the marginal distributions therefore many recent studies have used copula model to highlight the importance of studying the combined effect of rainfall and tide processes in estuaries and coastal areas lian et al 2013 and xu et al 2014 investigated the joint probability and effect of the tidal level and rainfall on flood risk in a coastal city using copula based model they confirmed that some positive dependence exists between rainfall and tidal level indicating that tidal level poses an additional risk of flooding the presence of this structural and statistical dependence between rainfall and high tides storm surge has already been studied by pugh 1987 coles et al 1999 and svensson and jones 2002 who tried to quantify the strength of this dependence all these studies confirmed the existence of a statistically significant dependence between extreme rainfall and extreme storm surge within the same spatial context white 2009 combined traditional flood risk modeling techniques with statistical dependence to assess the relationship between river flow tide and surge for lewes east sussex uk he used then a one dimensional hydraulic model to predict the joint probability of potential flood events occurring in lewes he concluded that a small amount of dependence between the extremes of river flow and sea level can have an important impact on the subsequent water levels in an estuary chen et al 2012 established the joint distribution and calculated the coincidence probabilities of flood magnitudes and flood occurrence dates to analyze the risk of flood in the upper yangtze river in china and the colorado river in the united states using copula function while wahl et al 2012 analyzed the statistical dependence between storm surges and wind waves in two tide stations in the german bight using copula based approach both studies confirmed that the copula concept represents a promising tool for studying multivariate problems in hydrology and coastal engineering similar conclusions were found by ganguli and reddy 2013 who used a copula based methodology for probabilistic flood risks assessment and explored the performance of trivariate copulas in modeling dependence structure of flood properties considering peak flow volume and duration of flood hydrograph zheng et al 2013 2014 studied the interaction between extreme rainfall and storm surge using bivariate logistic threshold excess model along the australian coastline they reported that a significant dependence was observed for most of the tide gauge locations daneshkhah et al 2016 analyzed the joint distribution of flood event properties and quantified the associated uncertainty using pair copulas they stated that copula is an efficient tool that can be used for probabilistic flood hazard assessment more recently sebastian et al 2017 estimated the joint exceedance probabilities for peak surge and cumulative precipitation using bayesian network based on gaussian copulas to model the hydraulic boundary conditions in a coastal watershed an issue to mention here within those studies and which has been discussed only by few authors concerns the data selected for estimating hydrological and meteorological factors dependence hawkes 2008 for example has discussed this issue and considered it as critical for dependence study indeed samuels and burt 2002 modeled the dependence between peak river flows on the taff at pontypridd and sea levels at cardiff in south wales uk concluding that there was no correlation between the peak flows and the high sea levels in contrast a dependence analysis by svensson and jones 2004 for the same area found statistically significant dependence between daily mean river flow at pontypridd and surge at avonmouth the contradictory conclusions may be due to the different datasets that were used with peak river flow and peak sea level being used in samuels and burt 2002 and daily mean river flow and surge being used in svensson and jones 2004 related to this zheng et al 2013 stated that this could be because the use of peak sea level which is in most cases dominated by astronomical tide may lead to lower dependence compared to when using storm surge estimates directly as it is only the latter quantity that is likely to be physically associated with extreme rainfall under the same meteorological conditions all these research studies have outlined the fact that univariate flood frequency analysis cannot provide a complete assessment of the occurrence probability of extremes if the underlying event is characterized by a set of interrelated random variables chebana and ouarda 2011 masina et al 2015 it becomes thus urgent and pressing to recognize that the risk posed by these events is likely to become more important in the future as existing coastal communities become threatened by rising sea levels and changing tidal regimes archetti et al 2011 zhang and singh 2007 towns close to tidal rivers and estuaries like the ones we are dealing with in this study rabat and salé morocco are at risk from the combination of extreme rainfall fluvial and tidal flooding egis bceom international iau idf brgm 2011 rmsi 2012 that can almost ruin their entire assets in the near future and set back their urban development by years or even decades the costs of protecting these cities from rising sea levels and storms are also likely to rise with increased precipitation resulting from climate change furthermore the pressure for increased urbanization of low lying areas is expected to create major flood risk problems for many coastal and estuarine towns zellou and rahali 2017 petroliagkis et al 2016 bevacqua et al 2017 a storm on thursday the 23rd of february 2017 has dumped over 120 mm of rain in just a few hours causing flooding in the coastal neighboring cities of rabat and salé the most plausible way to explain this extreme event is to account for the variability of rainfall and storm tide the large amounts of precipitation that fell in the surrounding area which are normally collected by urban drainage systems and headed toward the sea or the tidal river were partially obstructed from spilling out into the sea by the storm surge have then contributed to major flooding along the coastal area ignoring therefore the storm tide s impact to flooding may necessarily lead to underestimation of the risk of flooding this event emphasizes the importance of studying joint probabilities of extreme events and the fact that conventional univariate statistical analysis is not accurate to bring enough information regarding the multivariate nature of these events therefore the present research focuses on bivariate flood frequency analysis including data preparation parameter selection and methodology application the source variable pair presented here is the maximum annual 24 h rainfall and corresponding tide data we present the application of the copula based joint probability method to generate a combination of critical rainfall amounts and critical high tides exceeding both certain threshold values according to different return periods those values were applied as input to caesar lisflood cl model coulthard et al 2002 2013 zellou and rahali 2017 to predict patterns of maximum water depth which may derive from different flood sources cl model focus on the nearshore processes to replicate the tidewater hydrodynamics therefore the model grid needs to be setup to include river channel floodplain topography and nearshore bathymetry this study demonstrates that by putting emphasis on statistical dependence between seemingly independent variables it is possible to investigate their multivariate extreme value distributions which are suitable for modelling the tails of multidimensional phenomena and the associated risk when these variables are above a certain critical threshold a parametric copula is initially fitted to the whole dataset to characterize the overall dependence structure and the tail behavior of that particular copula is extracted later we estimate non parametrically schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 the lower and upper tail copulas and show that the joint distribution of the rainfall and high tide level are rather upper tail dependent a fact which cannot be detected by fitting a copula to the whole dataset huser et al 2017 stated that without firm knowledge about the tail properties of the data it is safer i e more conservative in terms of risk of joint extremes to assume asymptotic dependence we have proceeded therefore with the tails estimation and characterization by giving a strong attention to appropriately capturing the tail extreme behavior before any joint probability evaluation and since it is common for many environmental processes to exhibit weakening spatial dependence as events become more extreme huser and wadsworth 2018 very extreme joint risks tend to be strongly overestimated if the data exhibit decreasing dependence strength at more extreme levels ledford and tawn 1997 davison et al 2013 therefore the increase of upper tail dependence strength should be enough to explain why a copula is able to connect extreme rainfall to high tide level the strong asymptotic dependence justification of extreme events should give evidence that concomitant extreme events are observed and both are at the same scale and that copula provides a robust modeling framework especially when few extreme data are available here due to limited data availability the focus of rainfall using copula is much on extreme event itself when the rainfall amount changes and implicitly not on its temporal and spatial characteristics müller and kaspar 2010 xiao et al 2013 in order to estimate the dependence with tide levels since it is widely accepted that extreme precipitation changes are one type of significant perspectives to scientifically assess the behaviors and changes of climatic systems allan and soden 2008 kysely et al 2011 fan et al 2012 li et al 2013 rouge et al 2013 xu et al 2014 this paper takes thus into account only the precipitation change when we analyze its associated risk the paper is organized as follows the case study area bouregreg estuary is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the methods and the data requirements including a brief description of copula concept and their mathematical formulation the results of the joint risk probability of extreme rainfall and tidal levels and the consequent inundation patterns are reported and discussed in section 4 finally conclusions are given in section 5 2 study area bouregreg estuary is located in northwestern part of morocco fig 1 it belongs to an area characterized by semiarid climate with average annual rainfall of 440 mm and average annual temperature of 18 c the river of bouregreg flows downstream into the atlantic ocean between two cities raba and salé with populations of about 577 827 and 982 163 respectively the close urban neighborhoods on the coastal area of rabat and sale have recently experienced several flood events from multiple sources sea and rainfall on the night of 6 to 7 january 2014 a strong storm surge came tumbling down on the moroccan atlantic coast affecting mainly the coastal zones this phenomenon is mainly due to an atmospheric depression of the atlantic ocean coupled with high winds ranging from 60 to 100 km h northwesterly causing giant waves of between 6 and 7 m these extreme values can also be explained by the coincidence of high swell with a high tide up to 3 3 5 m height more recently on the 23rd of february 2017 a storm dumped over 120 mm of rain in just a few hours causing flooding in the neighboring cities of rabat and salé fig 2 the river which normally absorbs rainwater through the sewers urban drainage was partially obstructed from draining into the sea by the storm surge which then contributed to major flooding along the coast the combined effects of high sea level and high intensity rainfall may seem to have contributed to tide locking of drains the low lying areas along these two cities coast are susceptible to marine inundation from severe storm surge events the major recent storm event that affected rabat and sale coasts occurred on february the second 2017 just 3 weeks before the flooding mentioned here above during which a water level of 3 30 m over tide gauge zero approximately 2 13 m above current mean sea level was reached the exceptional character of this storm derived from the extremely severe meteorological contribution to the observed sea level peak since exceptional water level continued to be recorded during the coming three weeks 3 59 m recorded the 12th of february at 03 55 am and 3 39 at 3 20 pm 3 52 m the 13th at 3 40am and must have led to the flooding of the 23rd of february 2017 according to jiang and tatano 2015 focusing on urban areas spatial flood risk assessment should reflect all risk information derived from multiple flood sources including rainfall rivers drainage coast etc and their joint effects which may affect coastal urban areas therefore an understanding of the dependence between the variables causing flood would allow a more accurate estimation of their combined probability of occurrence thus greater confidence in the assessment and preparedness to face any associated risk 3 methods and data 3 1 bivariate flood frequency analysis joint modelling using copula functions 3 1 1 copula concept copulas are a kind of distribution functions and have emerged as a powerful approach in simplifying multivariate stochastic analysis xu et al 2014 this method has become popular and flexible way to measure nonlinear correlation and dependencies among variables and to construct multivariate distributions the copulas functions join multivariate distribution functions to their one dimensional marginal distribution functions nelsen 2006 jiang and tatano 2015 the use of copula based models in hydrology has gained popularity only in recent years where they were employed to estimate multivariate distribution in the calculation of conditional probabilities and their use in bivariate simulation or in the calculation of the return periods of bivariate events salvadori et al 2007 bardossy and pegram 2009 balistrocchi and bacchi 2011 van den berg et al 2011 in this section we will present the concepts of copula theory and more precisely the archimedean copulas archimedean copulas are very simple to implement thanks to the explicit relationships that link the parameter of the copula to a measure of dependence which is kendall s tau τ let f be a 2 dimensional distribution function with univariate margins f 1 and f 2 for random variables x and y respectively according to sklar s theorem 1959 there exists a copula c such that 1 f x y c f 1 x f 2 y x y r with c unique when f 1 x a n d f 2 y are continuous marginal distributions so that c 0 1 2 0 1 that satisfies the boundary conditions c x 0 c 0 x 0 and c x 1 c 1 x x uniform margins for any x 0 1 and the so called 2 increasing property papaioannou et al 2016 this method separates the joint distribution into a copula function and marginal distributions and has the advantage that the selection of an appropriate model for the dependence between varieties represented by the copula can then proceed independently from the choice of marginal distributions as for the basic theory and concepts of copula readers may refer to the monographs by joe 1997 and nelsen 2006 for additional details for construction of high dimensional copulas such as nested archimedean construction nac and pair copula construction pcc readers may refer to aas and berg 2009 savu and trede 2010 and czado 2010 the archimedean copulas are considered to be one of the well known classes of copulas they can capture different lower and upper tail dependencies between variables with small number of parameters because they are not restricted to radial symmetry hofert 2010 a 2 dimensional copula c is called archimedean if it admits the representation nelsen 2006 2 c u 1 u 2 ψ 1 ψ u 1 ψ u 2 for some archimedean generator ψ with its inverse function ψ 1 fig 3 displays the two grouped rainfall and tide data in a plot matrix this is useful for canonical correlation analysis using pearson s correlation coefficient top right panel and regression analysis bivariate relation bottom left the top left and bottom right panels represent density plot for every variable that helps identify skewness kurtosis and distribution information of each variable the aim of understanding this relationship is to predict change of one variable r for a unit change in the other variable t though the correlation coefficient is not the only measure to conclude that 2 numeric variables are correlated even though they change with time since it is about two time series although the dependence between extreme rainfall and storm surge is typically weak fig 3 such weak dependence remains constant or even increases when their exceedance probabilities decrease zheng et al 2014 this is referred to as asymptotic dependence and has been observed by many previous hydrological studies such as svensson and jones 2002 hawkes 2008 and white 2009 to more recent analysis carried out by zheng et al 2013 and lian et al 2013 accordingly in this paper we focus on the class of copulas that offer greater flexibility and allowed the modelling of complex dependence patterns and specifically for extremal dependence to able a correct estimate of the flood risk in this coastal area while the class of elliptical copulas fang et al 2002 frahm et al 2003 has been considered unsuitable for tail dependence analysis the class of archimedean copulas including gumbel clayton frank joe ali mikhail haq were considered the most flexible modeling tools when assessing the joint tail behavior of imperceptibly dependent random vectors such as rainfall and tide levels in this context the five copulas from the archimedean class table 1 are tested to select the best copula the one that best fits our hydrologic data the highest tidal level t during the annual maximum 24 h rainfall r observations for these two random variables from 1987 to 2017 were collected as samples to estimate their joint distribution function depending on the joint distribution function the joint probability of any combinations of rainfall and tidal level over some values may be assessed including the extremes that rainfall and tidal level both exceed certain threshold values 3 1 2 copula selection an important issue in using copula approach is to choose the best copula family and estimate its parameters to select the best copula model for the pair of variables r t we used the akaike aic and bayesian information criteria bic akaike 1973 schwarz 1978 these criteria offer interesting advantages over frequently used statistical tests because they consider parameter dependence and they can be applied to any copula family as long as the copula density can be calculated silva and lopes 2008 that said the aic test is however known to have a tendency of selecting models that are too large e g claeskens and hjort 2008 the bic on the other hand is able to consistently select the true model but only when the number of possible parameters grows sufficiently slowly with the sample size n nagler et al 2018 for observations u i j i 1 n j 1 2 the aic and bic of a bivariate copula family c with parameter s θ are defined as 3 aic 2 i 1 n l n c u i 1 u i 2 θ 2 n p 4 bic 2 i 1 n l n c u i 1 u i 2 θ l n n n p where n p i s t h e n u m b e r o f p a r a m e t e r s i n t h e c o p u l a m o d e l n p 1 2 the five copulas including gumbel clayton frank joe and ali mikhail haq are fitted using maximum likelihood estimation then the two criteria are computed for these archimedean copulas and the family with the minimum values is selected 3 1 3 about the joint probability and dependence strength estimation the notion of tail dependence is more interesting in risk analysis according to kumar 2010 tail dependence describes the limiting proportion that one margin exceeds a certain threshold given that the other margin has already exceeded that threshold however like any scalar measure of dependence tail dependence measure suffers from a certain loss of information concerning the joint behavior in the tails of the distribution in the context of tail dependence the immediate analogues of copulas which describe the entire dependence structure is given by tail copulas refer to schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 and frahm et al 2005 for further details on tail copulas joe 1997 defines the tail dependence if a bivariate copula c u1 u2 is such that 5 lim u 1 1 2 u c u u 1 u λ u exists then c u1 u2 has upper tail dependence for λu 0 1 and no upper tail dependence for λu 0 this measure is extensively used in extreme value theory it is the probability that one variable is extreme given that the other is extreme i e λ u p r u 1 u u 2 u thus λu can be viewed as a quantile dependent measure of dependence coles et al 1999 owing to sklar s theorem there exists a unique copula c for which identity eq 1 holds genest and favre 2007 therefore just as f1 x and f2 y give an exhaustive description of x and y taken separately the joint dependence between these variables is fully and uniquely characterized by c nevertheless the assessment of the dependence between variables is necessary before a copula model for a pair of variables x y is sought and before estimating joint probability of extremes sometimes when dependence exists it is more marked amongst the higher observed values stormy conditions than amongst the lower values therefore as with single variable extremes analysis it can be important to choose the appropriate threshold above which to determine a dependence representative of extreme events dependence checking could be done either by visualizing dependence or by the performance of statistical tests the scatter plot of ranks chi plot fisher and switzer 1985 2001 and k plot genest and boies 2003 are the most common graphical tools for detecting dependence for the very reason that they are invariant with respect to monotone transformations of the variables and are thus scale free li et al 2011 3 1 4 joint flood risk probability analysis flood frequency analysis of hydrologic data consists of obtaining relationship between the magnitude of extreme events and their frequency of occurrence through the use of probability distributions chow 1988 delignette muller and duttang 2015 ganguli and reddy 2013 daneshkhah et al 2016 in case of bivariate flood frequency analysis the joint return period is computed using inclusive probability and and or salvadori 2004 the first probability in which both of the two hydrologic variables r and t exceed simultaneously their thresholds return period would define the boundary conditions for the hydraulic modeling of extreme joint flood events this is the appropriate method when both variables play a role in the genesis of the risk eq 6 while the second probability or assumes that only one of the parameters r or t exceeds some extreme values eq 7 this method is often used in design and safety assessment of estuary flood defenses since each of the hydrologic variable source rainfall or tide could cause flooding e g biondi and de luca 2017 the two joint exceedance probabilities are given by the following formulas 6 p r r t t 1 f r r f t t f c r t 7 p r r t t 1 f c r t where f r and f t are the distribution functions of the marginal distributions 3 2 hydraulic simulation of extreme joint flood event 3 2 1 hydraulic model cl is a geomorphological and landscape evolution model that combines the caesar geomorphic model and the last version of the lisflood fp 2 d hydrodynamic flow model bates et al 2010 to simulate erosion and depositional changes in river catchments and reaches over a range of time from one hour to 1000 s of years and space from 1 to 100 km scales coulthard et al 2000 2002 cl can be run in three modes a catchment mode with rainfall input a reach mode with points where inflow discharges are inputted to the system and a stage tidal input mode with four coordinates delineating an area within which the tidewater levels inputs will be added to the dem there are four main functions of cl the hydrological model slope processes fluvial erosion and deposition and the flow model only the last function will be investigated in this paper to replicate the tidewater hydrodynamics of bouregreg estuary in stage tidal mode and rainfall input in catchment mode for more detailed information about cl model equations refer to coulthard et al 2000 2002 2013 van de wiel et al 2007 and coulthard 2011 3 2 2 data preparation to simulate rainfall and tide flooding cl requires a digital elevation model dem that should be set up to include not only river channel and floodplain but also nearshore bathymetry necessary to replicate the tidewater hydrodynamics we used the global multi resolution topography gmrt version 3 3 dem 50 m pixel resolution which brings together a variety of elevation sources delivered as multi resolution gridded that includes land topography and ocean bathymetry ryan et al 2009 to represent spatial surface roughness the model needs land use cover grid file having the same format header and extents as the dem each land use cover class bare ground beach discontinuous residential fabric industrial area river road or railway space urban green space agricultural land forest sports fields stream and urban area is identified in the grid cell and a corresponding manning s n value is assigned to that class based on values proposed by chow 1964 bed roughness controls the development of the flood wave within the cl model lewis et al 2013 many studies confirmed that flood extent water depth and velocity are also sensitive to roughness parameter bates and de roo 2000 gallegos et al 2009 the manning n value that represents channel roughness can be determined based on standards proposed by chow 1959 1964 1988 barnes 1967 or ree 1954 but due to dredging activities man made and the variability of sediments rates in estuaries this value should be well adjusted during calibration process the calibration was realized using tide forcing for a year long period 2014th see fig a 1 four channel roughness values were tested 0 005 0 01 0 015 and 0 02 these values were selected by examining the difference between simulated and observed tidewater level four statistical parameters were calculated to assess model performance in predicting water level including the coefficient of determination r2 r squared value rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error and spearman correlation 3 2 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions include the rainfall hyetograph in urban areas synthetic storm hyetographs and tidal input were therefore estimated based on r t pairs generated from the fitted bivariate copula based distribution in order to be routed through the study area first the design rainfall for different return periods 5 10 20 and 50 years based on rainfall data from local intensity duration frequency idf curves chow 1964 were created a set of observed rainfall hyetograph and stage hydrograph was used as a sample to ascribe each of synthetic data shape to the chosen synthetic r t pair via randomization achieved by coupling a stochastic rainfall generator and the hydrological model both calibrated in the basin then the resulted synthetic hyetograph for the 50 year return period was used as input to the hydraulic model cl fig 4 tidewater level data for the bouregreg estuary was obtained from a gauge station located at coordinates 034 04 00 0 n 006 46 00 0 w and using the hydrographic zero as a height reference a 31 years of hourly tidewater level from 1987 to 2017 optionally when tidal station data are not available or of poor quality cl can be driven with modelled storm surge heights applied to coastal segments with similar surge characteristics lewis et al 2013 ramirez et al 2016 a typical tidewater level hydrograph with one hour time step was designed based on the results of the joint probability analysis of extreme events to run cl in tidal stage mode fig 4 this tidewater level hydrograph will be added to the nearshore location of bouregreg river over a period of a week by comparing the results of simulations with and without tide the impact of atlantic ocean tide on the surface water dynamics in the bouregreg estuary can be identified 4 results and discussion 4 1 joint flood frequency analysis 4 1 1 marginal probabilities as stated above one of the strong points of the copula approach is the way it makes it possible to model the dependence structure independently on the choice of the marginal laws therefore the marginal distributions of the two hydrological variables e g 31 year annual maximum 24 h rainfall r recorded at aguibat ezziar gauging station for the period of 1987 2017 and the highest tidal level during the annual maximum 24 h rainfall t are estimated separately several distributions including burr lognormal log logistic gamma and weibull were used to fit the marginal distributions of rainfall and tide data fig 5 three goodness of fit tests the kolmogorov smirnov test chakravarti et al 1967 chowdhury et al 1991 cramer von mises and anderson darling test statistics were performed to find the probabilities distribution functions that best fit r and t these tests were then backed up with classical penalized criteria based on the loglikelihood aic bic to ensure that there has been no overfitting the purpose of these tests is to measure the distance between the fitted parametric distribution and the empirical distribution e g the distance between the fitted cumulative distribution function and the empirical distribution function table 2 gives the definition and the empirical estimate of the three considered goodness of fit statistics d agostino and stephens 1986 since we are interested in giving more weight to distribution s tails the anderson darling statistic is of special interest when it matters to equally emphasize the tails as well as the main body of a distribution which is often the case in risk assessment cullen and frey 1999 vose 2010 however this statistic computed for several distributions fitted on the same data set are theoretically difficult to compare because the weighting of each cdf quadratic difference depends on the parametric distribution in its definition and should be moderated by looking at the result of classical penalized criteria based on the loglikelihood aic bic to detect eventual overfitting delignette muller and duttang 2015 table 3 shows that for tide data all the goodness of fit statistics based on the cdf distance are in favor of the gamma distribution it is the only one characterized by three parameters and confirmed by aic and bic values giving the preference to the gamma distribution to be used for forecasting tides for different return periods while the weibull distribution adjusted using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method was the most appropriate distribution for the corresponding rainfall data series the parameters used to fit the marginal probability distributions gamma and weibull are shown in the appendix table a 1 fitting a parametric distribution to data sometimes results in a model that agrees well with the data in high density regions compared to areas of low density known as the tails of the distribution one of the reasons why a model might fit poorly in the tails is that by definition there are fewer data in the tails on which to base a choice of model and so models are often chosen based on their ability to fit data near the mode add to that the fact that the distribution of real data is often more complicated than the usual parametric models as we are primarily concerned with the identification of variables extremal behavior fitting the data in the tail is our main concern the generalized pareto distribution gp has been developed as a distribution that can model tails of a wide variety of distributions based on theoretical arguments gp is a right skewed distribution which is suitable for analyzing upper tail data and can be defined by construction in terms of exceedances starting with a probability distribution whose right tail falls to zero like normal we sampled 2000 random values independently of this distribution we then fixed a threshold values for both tide and rainfall which allows to throw out all the values that are below the threshold and to subtract the threshold off of the values that are not thrown out the result is known as exceedances fig 6 fig 6 shows the return levels with the return periods estimated on 2000 simulated sample for both rainfall and tide variables confidence intervals have been added to these plots as the empirical mean can be supposed to be normally distributed central limit theorem however normality doesn t hold anymore for high threshold as there are less and less excesses table 4 gives examples of extreme quantiles estimated for four return periods 4 1 2 best fit copula selection this study applied the archimedean class including clayton frank gumbel joe and ali mikhail haq amh copulas which were tested to select the best fit copula the parameters of each family were calculated using the maximum likelihood method table 5 fig 7 shows the scatter plots of simulated bivariate random variables based on the fitted copulas the two criteria aic and bic are calculated for these copulas and the family with the smallest values is then selected for these criteria only the log likelihood itself can be used to assess how well a copula model fits the data and the higher log likelihood leads to a smaller relative aic or bic representing a better model fit killiches and kraus 2017 even though both aic and bic penalize the negative maximum log likelihood of the estimated model by the number of parameters in the model kumar 2010 negative values of aic and bic table 5 can be interpreted as penalized log likelihood functions joe 2015 as to the specific form of the dependence no definite conclusion can be drawn except for clayton none of the other copula candidates is to be really rejected even the gumbel copula could be an applicable alternative based on these results the joe copula having the upper value of log likelihood and lower values of aic and bic is the best fit amongst the five copulas considered in this study to describe the dependence between rainfall and tide after copula selection the joint bivariate distribution function was constructed taking in consideration the selected marginal distributions fig 8 a illustrates the density of the generated bivariate distribution and fig 8 b their corresponding contours and marginal distributions according to model selection results the estimated joint distribution function f c r t for r and t can then be presented as follows 8 f c r t 1 1 f r 1 54 1 f t 1 54 1 f r 1 54 1 f t 1 54 1 1 54 where f r and f t are gamma and weibull marginal distributions for maximum 24 h rainfall and tide respectively fig 8 b shows the joint probability contours for the maximum annual rainfall and the corresponding tide levels blue lines to calculate the joint probability the variables were fit to their marginal distributions and iso probability contours were plotted in the probability density space for comparison an approximate density contour based on the empirical bivariate data 24 h maximum rainfall and the corresponding tide has been drawn and added to the contour plot with colors indicating the probability density at each point red is low density and white is high density the contours in the high density area white are an approximately asymmetrical ellipsis which is what we can expect from gamma and weibull distributions the density changes comparatively slowly along both rainfall and tide axes in practice the interpretation of joint probabilities requires the attribution of a probability to exceed a certain threshold th1 th2 for the two variables rainfall and tide level taken simultaneously it considers thus that both variables play a role in the genesis of risk copula s contours blue lines illustrate the joint probabilities of not exceeding for both variables from these iso probability curves we estimate the joint probabilities for different return periods as given in table 6 4 2 joint flood risk probability analysis 4 2 1 upper tail dependence analysis in the context of extrapolation in multivariate frequency analysis it is important to properly model the dependence of extremes or tail dependence salvadori et al 2007 poulin et al 2007 frahm et al 2005 so before we start analyzing the joint probability we need first to address the question whether the joint distribution of rainfall r and tide t tends to generate extreme values simultaneously and constitutes in this sense a dangerous combination to consider in the flood risk forecast to evaluate whether a copula model should be applied for the above mentioned purpose kendall correlation coefficient was calculated to identify the dependence structure the kendall correlation coefficient was found to be 0 2325458 to visualize this dependence we used chi plot and kendall plot fig 9 which represent graphically the dependence of the pair of variables r t the chi plot called also rank based graphical tool is usually used in conjunction with a traditional scatterplot of the raw data it can help detect the presence of association in a random sample from some continuous bivariate distributions the other alternative display is the kendall plot k plot for short which adapts the concept of probability plot to the detection of dependence fisher and switzer 2001 genest and boies 2003 according to genest and boies 2003 k plots are easier to interpret than chi plots however because the curvature that they display in cases of association is related in a definite way to the copula characterizing the underlying dependence structure in addition k plots have the advantage of being readily extendible to the multivariate context fig 9 illustrates graphically the dependence of the pair of r and t variables as we can see these variables are dependent however their dependence may be qualified as low but is still significant according to the chi plot fig 9 a the two variables seem to be independent as most of the events are found in the area between the confidence intervals fisher and switzer 1985 2001 whereas independency on the k plot is assumed when the events are located on the line x y this latter fig 9 b provided as a complement suggests the presence of mild positive association in the data a positive dependence is identified if the events are located above the line a negative dependence is indicated when the points are under the line the conclusions obtained by the diagrams are consistent with the estimated correlation coefficients and are not so obvious from the only scatterplot fig 9 c but in line with the empirical values of spearman s rho ρ 0 2581686 and kendall s tau τ 0 23 the k plot highlights also the presence of a cluster in the upper right corner of the rank scatter plot underlying the positive association between rainfall and tide it should be noted here that any scalar measure of dependence such as ρ and τ cannot describe the whole dependence structure of the joint distribution therefore having concluded that r and t are positively dependent we now address the problem of estimating their copula in order to assess the risk of joint extreme events we apply the concept of tail copulas as the focus of this paper is to characterize and measure extremal dependence the large part of this section is devoted to the concept of tail dependence which concentrates on the upper and lower quadrant tails of the joint distribution in the bivariate copula case the standard way to determine whether r and t are tail dependent is to look at the so called upper and lower tail dependence coefficients denoted by λu and λl respectively joe 1997 9 λ u lim u 1 p r f r 1 u t f t 1 u 10 λ l lim u 0 p r f r 1 u t f t 1 u where f r 1 and f t 1 are the pseudo inverses of f r and f t respectively f r and f t are the distribution functions of the marginal distributions of r and t nelsen 2006 showed that tail dependence coefficients are nonparametric and depend only on the copula c and can be estimated provided that the above limits exist eqs 9 and 10 by 11 lim u 1 c 1 u 1 u 1 u lim u 1 1 2 u c u u 1 u λ u 12 lim u 0 c u u u λ l where c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 1 c 1 u 1 1 u 2 is a survival copula λu eq 9 is the limit of the conditional probability that r is greater than or equal to the u th quantile of f r 1 u given that t is greater than or equal to the u th quantile of f t 1 u and then consider the limit as u goes to 1 provided it exists similarly λl is the limit if it exists of the conditional probability that r is less than or equal to the u th quantile of f r 1 u given that t is less than or equal to the u th quantile of f t 1 u as u approaches 0 if λl 0 1 then c has lower tail dependence but if λl 0 then c has no lower tail dependence likewise if λu 0 then c has no upper tail dependence and if λu 0 1 then c has upper tail dependence for our dataset we found λl 0 and λu 0 4315379 which implies that r and t variables exhibit upper tail dependence and said to be asymptotically dependent therefore large values of λu imply that joint extremes are more likely than for low values of λl r and t might have thus a relatively strong tendency to generate extreme values simultaneously however the returned tail dependency values are numerically of little importance and might in strict terms be misleading what should be of interest is the trajectory of the lower and upper lines when plotted notes in fig 10 how the upper tail quavers but seems to show stability towards near λu 0 45 and the lower tail line varies considerably in pitch downward towards λl 0 to better visualize the limiting behavior of λu in which we are interested in this study we plotted the tail dependence concentration function on the right tail according to durante and sempi 2015 the idea sought here is to plot on the right the empirical upper tail concentration function r n and compare it to our joe copula tail fitting having a kendall s tau of 0 23 and θ 1 54 fig 11 13 r n u i 1 n 1 x i f x 1 u y i f y 1 u i 1 n 1 x i f x 1 u the trend seen in fig 10 seems to be confirmed in fig 11 it seems also that λu does not exhibit the same invariance property as does copula under strictly increasing transformations of the random variables there is however like for any scalar measure of dependence a slight loss of information concerning the joint behavior in the extreme end of the distribution schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 emphasized with larger confidence interval the statistical convergence is quite obvious underlying clearly that joe copula has upper tail dependence 4 2 2 joint probability analysis risk analyses of natural hazards are commonly expressed as annual return periods t r in years which are defined for a non exceedance probability q as t r 1 1 q return period gives the estimated time interval between events of a similar size or magnitude however this definition does not state that an event of that size occurs just once inside the specified time interval but instead it is a mean of quantifying the probability that this event will occur in any given year regardless of when the last similar event has occurred while in the univariate case the return period is uniquely defined chow 1988 in bivariate analysis using the best fit copula we can estimate probabilities of the joint behavior of r and t with some extreme values based on the joint cdf of r t in this study the bivariate joint return periods called or operator and and operator were used salvadori et al 2007 sheng et al 2002 there may be several combinations of r and t of which the joint probability of occurrence should be considered in flood design and mitigation these combinations are important as extreme flood events with extreme high rainfall and high tidewater level may cause catastrophic floods the two inclusive risk probability events and and or are given in eqs 6 and 7 these events can be calculated based on the values of f r f t and f c r t for different combinations of return periods tables 7 and 8 the joint return periods corresponding to these events are then defined as 14 t and 1 p r r t t 15 t or 1 p r r t t fig 12 shows that as the two hazards extreme rainfall and storm surge can cooperate to cause failure for let s say 500 year event relative to the complement of non exceedance joint or inclusive condition the marginal probabilities must be considerably higher up to 0 9 the green curves represent the non exceedance joint or condition we have chosen to put the values of each variable rainfall and tide in their respective ranges instead of the probability scale within the interval 0 1 each of the lines refers to a specific return period and the values on the two axes top and right sides are equivalent to the probabilities of occurrence of the random variables x rainfall and y tide respectively with the probability scale transformed into a gumbel reduced variate ln lnp ln ln 1 1 rp rp is the return period these are actually a form of level curves equivalent to an even step interval of probability such as 10 percent level curves the complement of non exceedance joint or is the probability level that either or both random variables rainfall or tide causes flood at the respective return period on the other hand the blue curves represent the non exceedance joint and inclusive condition the complement of non exceedance joint or inclusive is the probability level that both random variables r t must simultaneously or dually occur to trigger a flooding at the respective return period we can notice that there is obvious symmetry in the joint or and and curves table 7 shows the probabilities of simultaneously exceeding thresholds of the two hydrological variables r and t for four marginal return periods 5 10 20 and 50 years according to this table the simultaneous occurrence probabilities of both extreme rainfall and extreme tidal level are very low it should also be noted that this type of event is very exceptional as rainfall and tides are not governed by the same drivers tides are mainly generated by astronomical movements of the earth moon and sun whereas the rainfall is principally generated by meteorological events dependence is more likely to exist between rainfall and the meteorological component of the tide which may both be produced by the same low pressure weather system zheng et al 2013 so the period of thirty one years of historical data considered in this study is relatively short and may not contain the rarest coincidence of extreme tide levels and rainfall resulting in an underestimation of the intensity and occurrence of these events for example the value 0 0086554 in table 7 shows that we have 0 86 of chance per year to have an extreme rainfall exceeding 123 83 mm and tidewater level exceeding 3 86 m in the bouregreg estuary thus the joint return period associated to this event calculated using eq 14 is t and 116 y e a r s while the return period associated to these quantiles in marginal distributions is 50 years fig 12 this example clearly shows that neglecting a positive dependency between the maximum rainfall and the corresponding tidewater level in the studied estuary may cause an underestimation of the probability of concurrent extreme events the outcomes of the joint flood risk probability assessment are then used in the hydraulic modeling to determine which combination gives the highest water level at a particular location in the study area 4 3 flood mapping of the joint risk of extreme rainfall and tide level 4 3 1 river bed roughness calibration river bed roughness was calibrated by comparing the predicted river and tidewater levels at different locations along the estuary with the observed data for tidal simulation the calibration was realized using tide forcing for a year long period 2014th fig a 1 four channel roughness values were tested 0 005 0 01 0 015 and 0 02 the results of the calibration process are described in table 9 the closest agreement was obtained using manning s n value equal to 0 01 for low and high tide periods fig 13 the tidewater levels were correctly replicated by cl model and the results obtained agree well with the tide gauge dataset the mean squared correlation and the mean spearman correlation coefficients were very close to 1 0 98 and 0 99 respectively the rmse values vary between 0 06 and 0 11 whereas the mae values span from 0 05 and 0 09 lewis et al 2013 states that the choice of manning roughness coefficient influences tide wave propagation more than the bathymetry s uncertainty ramirez et al 2016 who also used cl to simulate storm tide concluded that the bathymetry has no effect on the storm tide and inland flooding if the storm tide has been initiated across the nearshore area our result also confirms this because despite using a dem with a low resolution 50 m the results of the tidal simulation appear to be good therefore a good calibration process should be applied to estimate the effect of uncertainties lewis et al 2013 aronica et al 2002 skinner et al 2015 4 3 2 flood maps fig 14 a shows maximum inundation extent and depths predicted by cl for the 116 year joint exceedance return period event using the design hyetograph and the tidal curve presented in fig 4 while fig 14 b presents the results of the simulation using the same input design hyetograph but without tide inputs the 116 year joint return period flood which is a combination of high rainfall 123 83 mm and high tidewater level 3 87 m generated an inundation extent similar to what has been witnessed in the coastal area and the close neighborhood during the storm of 23rd of february 2017 it is worth mentioning here that the urban network wasn t included in the simulation and that a great deal of the 23rd of february 2017 flood is to be related to the fact that rainwater which is drained through the sewers was partially or totally obstructed from pouring into the sea the combined effects of high sea level and high intensity rainfall seem to have contributed to tide locking of urban drains and the rise of water level in the river channel and its floodplain in the estuarine area the accumulation of runoff water from the two cities which is supposed to be absorbed by the river and released into the ocean has been blocked by tidal currents producing an increase in the water level around the river mouth and then the propagation of flood to the inland region the spread of the ocean tide to the inland area is thus highly regulated by the spatiotemporal distributions of the absolute water surface elevations yamazaki et al 2012 there is no other plausible way than the multivariate analysis using the concept of copula to explain this rare event which caused the interruption of road and rail traffic between the north and south of the country for several hours furthermore the rapid growth of urbanization combined with the impacts of climate change along with the sea level rise and the frequency and severity of rainfall can only worsen the risk of flooding in view of this the univariate flood frequency analysis seems to be insufficient to design flood risk plan and mitigation despite the fact that the joint probability method is still considered a research topic and is not widely used in flood risk management plans hawkes 2005 it would be highly recommended in the case in point especially that the site is undergoing a big urban structuring project the area will undergo profound changes with a high density of habitats by 2030 this significant urban extension will increase the stakes related to flood management on a site highly exposed to the risks of flooding and marine submersion if all flood s inducing factors are not considered 5 conclusion in this paper the joint impact of extreme rainfall and extreme tide level on flood risk is assessed in bouregreg estuary including the joint flood risk probability analysis using bivariate copula model the joint probability method consists basically on the choice of the marginal law of each hydrological variable separately the weibull and the gamma distributions adjusted using the maximum likelihood method were the most appropriate distributions for the rainfall and the corresponding tidewater level series respectively the second step involves the selection of the copula that best fit our hydrologic data five archimedean copulas including gumbel clayton joe frank and ali mikhael haq are compared using the two criteria aic and bic the joe copula is chosen as the best fit copula and it is then used to model the joint cumulative distribution function of the flood variables in this study the bivariate dependence structure was then checked using many rank based graphical tools like the scatter plot of ranks chi plot and kendall plot the results of these dependence measures and the analysis of tail dependence coefficients confirmed that a significant dependence exists between these two hydrological variables even in cases where the dependence was low the correlation between rainfall and tide was still not negligible finally the joint return periods of flood using this copula are computed analyzed and then used to define the boundary conditions for the hydraulic modeling of extreme joint flood events based on the joint flood risk probability analysis the simultaneous occurrence probabilities of both extreme rainfall and extreme tidal level are very low this can be explained by the short duration of the hydrologic input series which may not contain these rare events however hydraulic simulations of these low frequency flood events which consist of rainfall input combined with high water levels from an exceptional tide in the bouregreg estuary show that ignoring the dependence between these hydrologic variables may lead to considerable underestimation of both the maximum flood water levels and extension flooding can occur whenever a significant amount of precipitation falls in only few hours the risk increases if this rainfall coincides with high tide or if the ground is already saturated by consecutive days of precipitation the comparison of simulated and recorded tide height showed that the tidal fluctuations were accurately simulated by the hydraulic model which has proved to be a valuable tool for simulating both tidal and fluvial hydrodynamics in data poor regions the analysis of the compound flood event rainfall tide show that during high tides water from the atlantic ocean pushes inland into inlets causing water levels throughout the region to rise the runoff water accumulated from the two cities which is supposed to be absorbed by the river and released into the ocean is then blocked and backflow into the inland area this study allowed understanding the spatial evolution of flooding caused by the combination of high rainfall and high tide level and hence identifying flood prone areas for these low frequency and high risk flood events it could also provide a significant support for flooding preparedness in the bouregreg estuary taking into account that design measures adequate for more than 10 years

6782,catchment scale hydrological and hydrogeological investigations commonly conclude by finding that particular stream reaches are either gaining or losing they also often assume that the influence of bedrock aquifers on catchment water balances and water quality is insignificant however in many cases such broad findings are likely to oversimplify the spatial and temporal complexity of the connections between the different hydrological system components particularly in regions dominated by cycles of droughts and flooding from a modelling perspective such oversimplifications can have serious implications on the process of identifying the magnitude and direction of the exchange fluxes between the surface and groundwater systems in this study we use 3d geological modelling and historic water chemistry and hydraulic records to identify the origins of groundwater at different locations in the alluvium and along the course of streams in the lockyer valley queensland australia a catchment impacted by a severe drought millennium drought from 1998 to 2009 followed by extensive flooding in 2011 we also demonstrate how discharge from the sub alluvial regional scale volcanic and sedimentary bedrock influences the water balance and water quality of the alluvium and streams the investigation of aquifer geometry via development of a three dimensional geological model combined with an assessment of hydraulic data provided important insights on groundwater flow paths and helped to identify areas where bedrock aquifers interact with shallow alluvial aquifers and streams multivariate statistical techniques were then applied as an additional line of evidence to groundwater and surface water hydrochemical data from large historical datasets this confirmed that most sub catchments within the lockyer valley have distinct water chemistry patterns which result from mixing of different water sources including discharge from the sub alluvial bedrock importantly in addition to the observed spatial variability time series hydrochemical groundwater and surface water data further demonstrated that the hydraulic connection between alluvial aquifers streams and sub alluvial bedrock aquifers is temporally dynamic with very significant changes occurring at the transition from normal to drought conditions and following flooding affecting both catchment water quality and water balances keywords aquifer interaction groundwater surface water interaction lockyer valley 3d geological modelling hydrochemistry bedrock 1 introduction hydrogeological investigations aim to address critical natural resource management issues such as the over exploitation or contamination of ground and surface water systems understanding connectivity between aquifers and their interactions with the surface water system is a critical component of such investigations e g guggenmos et al 2011 duvert et al 2015a b king et al 2015 barthel and banzhaf 2016 alluvial aquifers are in close vicinity of the land surface and often form significant aquifers in mid reaches of worldwide rivers where most agricultural activity occurs they are therefore susceptible to over exploitation cross aquifer mixing through interaction with underlying bedrock aquifers and anthropogenic inputs e g through the application of fertilizers e g famiglietti 2014 cheng et al 2017 alluvial aquifers are also more readily influenced by climatic variability due to the greater level of dynamic interaction with surface water helena et al 2000 ahmed et al 2004 liu et al 2014 filippini et al 2015 izbicki et al 2015 meng et al 2015 atkins et al 2016 king et al 2017 the move towards conjunctive river aquifer management has led to the development of large scale integrated models that simulate surface groundwater interactions at various levels of complexity identifying the spatial and temporal complexity of the connections between the different system components is an essential step towards identifying the active interaction processes within a particular surface groundwater system rassam 2011 rassam et al 2013 however integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshms developed to simulate catchment scale groundwater surface water interactions usually represent catchments as simplified and relatively shallow groundwater systems that are typically not affected by the bedrock e g barthel 2014 paniconi and putti 2015 barthel and banzhaf 2016 fatichi et al 2016 kollet et al 2017 although model structural or conceptual model error is often identified as a main source of model predictions uncertainty e g marty et al 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 rojas et al 2009 holman et al 2012 the uncertainties associated with oversimplifications of the connections between bedrock alluvium and streams in catchment hydrological investigations are not typically considered however from a modelling perspective over simplification of connectivity may have serious implications on predictions as for example in studies where the impacts of resource development e g coal seam gas coal bed methane from sedimentary bedrock systems on alluvial aquifers streams and groundwater dependant ecosystems are investigated cui et al 2016 janardhanan et al in preparation cui et al under revision this study uses the lockyer valley in south east queensland australia to demonstrate how the integration of multiple independent lines of geoscientific evidence including groundwater and surface water hydrochemistry and a 3d geological model can enhance the understanding of connections between connectivity between surface water alluvial aquifers and the underlying shallow and deep bedrock although many local hydrogeological studies have been conducted e g dixon and chiswell 1992 durick and bleakley 2000 wilson 2005 pearce et al 2007 galletly 2007 cox et al 2013 wolf 2013 cui et al 2018 wetlandinfo 2018 no comprehensive integrated geological and hydrogeological conceptual model of catchment wide recharge and connectivity mechanisms exists for the lockyer valley the lockyer valley is an ideal catchment to examine the significance of the connection between alluvial and sub alluvial bedrock aquifers and with surface water including its temporal and spatial variability several key points support this a it has a diverse geology consisting of several compositionally different aquifer types quaternary alluvia neogene volcanics and triassic to jurassic sedimentary bedrock aquifers b there is an extensive groundwater monitoring bore network with several hundred groundwater bores screened in different aquifers importantly in contrast to most other catchments in south east queensland such as the adjacent condamine river catchment fig 1 and many catchments elsewhere in australia a large number of groundwater monitoring bores were installed in the sedimentary bedrock in the early 2000s as part of a national salinity monitoring programme pearce et al 2007 providing invaluable baseline data to support hydrochemical and recharge assessments c there are important regional economic drivers for groundwater extraction for agricultural purposes in the lockyer valley in 2014 15 aus 374 million of agricultural output trade and investment queensland 2018 was generated in the lockyer valley and d time series data cover a drought flood cycle that extended from 1998 to 2009 millennium drought this study aims to 1 highlight the significance of the bedrock contribution on both water fluxes and quality and illustrate to what extent aquifer geometry influences connectivity between the different system components 2 identify aquifers that discharge to streams and areas where this discharge occurs and conversely areas where streams recharge underlying aquifers 3 define mechanisms and areas of recharge for different aquifers and assess the temporal variability of these processes during droughts and following flooding 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the lockyer valley is an approximately 2300 km2 catchment in the north east of the clarence moreton basin which is infilled with a variety of sedimentary rocks of fluvial lacustrine origin fig 1 a comprehensive description of the aquifer systems of the clarence moreton basin is provided by rassam et al 2014 and raiber et al 2017b in recent decades the clarence moreton basin has been extensively explored for conventional and unconventional gas with a primary focus on coal seam gas csg resources in the walloon coal measures wcm in the lockyer valley the clarence moreton basin consists of four major stratigraphic units of late triassic to jurassic age namely the woogaroo subgroup the gatton sandstone the koukandowie formation and the walloon coal measures figs 1 and 2 these sedimentary bedrocks are overlain by extensive extrusive volcanic rocks main range volcanics mrv and quaternary alluvial aquifer systems the late triassic woogaroo subgroup forms an aquifer consisting mostly of conglomerate beds and thin beds of sandstone composed mainly of quartz rich sand o brien and wells 1994 it is overlain by the gatton sandstone lower member of marburg subgroup a partial aquifer which is dominated by thick bedded medium to coarse grained quartz lithic and feldspathic sandstone ingram and robinson 1996 the koukandowie formation upper unit of the marburg subgroup consists of sheets of interbedded quartzose feldspathic lithic sandstone siltstone claystone and minor coal willis 1994 and is considered as a partial aquifer raiber et al 2017b the wcm is composed of volcaniclastic lithic and silty sandstone with interbedded mudstone coal and siltstone wells and o brien 1994 ash fall tuff and basalts also occur in the sequence doig and stanmore 2012 as commonly observed in lithological logs in the lockyer valley the wcm is limited to the southern and south western part of the catchment where it outcrops or is overlain by fractured basalts of the mrv fig 1 it has a thickness of typically less than 100 m in the lockyer valley which makes it an unlikely target for csg exploration in this area raiber et al 2017a the cenozoic mrv are widespread in the lockyer valley and cover large areas in the southern and western part of the catchment where they cap the peaks of the great dividing range fig 1 they unconformably overlie the gatton sandstone the koukandowie formation and the wcm with a thickness of typically less than 200 m but can be considerably thicker close to peaks and volcanic eruptive centres importantly the mrv do not consist of a single homogeneous basalt flow or correspond to a single aquifer but are composed of many overlapping volcanic flows with a maximum thickness of approximately 10 m each which are commonly separated by lower permeability layers including clay rich weathering profiles developed during volcanic hiatuses well developed fracture networks secondary porosity connect vesicular zones of different basalt flows within the mrv raiber et al 2017a there are several major geological structures in the lockyer valley namely the gatton arch and the helidon ridge fig 1 as well as many local scale fracture and fault zones extensive alluvial sediment sequences have infilled the alluvial valleys of the lockyer creek and its tributary systems the geometry and composition of the alluvial sediments is discussed in more detail in section 5 1 3 climate vegetation and surface water flow south east queensland has a subtropical climate dominated by hot and humid summers and dry mild winters abares 2016 in the headwaters of the lockyer valley at mount mistake fig 1 the mean annual rainfall is 863 mm yr although total annual rainfall can be highly variable ranging from about 450 1500 mm yr station number 040205 bom 2017 the low rainfall during the millennium drought resulted in very low creek flow with flow in most creeks ceasing completely especially from mid 2006 until early 2008 this period of drought was followed by several wet years and flooding in january 2011 flows in the lockyer creek and catchments in south east queensland in general are characterised by high flood variability croke et al 2016 at rifle range road fig 1 near the outflow of the catchment the median flow is approximately 57 l s whereas the peak flow recorded during flooding in january 2011 was more than 690 000 l s dnrm 2017 the dominant land uses are pasture 47 and woody vegetation 41 with 11 of the area used for cropping apan et al 2002 extensive forests and woodlands cover most of the mrv and woogaroo subgroup outcrop areas alluvial groundwater is used extensively for irrigated seasonal horticulture with some irrigated cropping dryland agriculture also occurs in the areas away from the alluvium on outcrops of the gatton sandstone and other sedimentary bedrock hydrostratigraphic abares 2016 4 methods and data sources 4 1 hydraulic and geological data and 3d geological model development 4 1 1 groundwater bore data and potentiometric surface map development historical groundwater levels and bore construction details as well as lithologic and stratigraphic data were compiled from over 5000 registered groundwater bores including bores at the periphery of the lockyer valley in adjacent catchments to avoid modelling artefacts near the margins sourced from the queensland department of natural resources and mines dnrm groundwater database dnrm 2014 2015 in addition data from a smaller number of deeper stratigraphic or petroleum wells within the catchment were used obtained from the dnrm queensland digital exploration reports dnrm 2014 and from wells and o brien 1994 the potentiometric surface of the shallow sedimentary bedrock was created using ordinary kriging with a fitted linear semi variogram model in arcgis based on the available groundwater level data from 2000 to 2012 dnrm 2014 4 1 2 development of 3d geological model the three dimensional 3d geological model of the lockyer valley was assembled using skua gocad software paradigm geophysical pty ltd in combination with mira gocad mining utilities the 3d geological model of the lockyer valley consists of the seven major model units as listed in the stratigraphic table fig 2 input data included a 1 degree digital elevation model srtm geoscience australia and csiro land and water 2010 and a variety of geological data such as 1 100 000 geological maps dnrm 2002 as well as stratigraphic and lithologic data from the queensland dnrm groundwater database dnrm 2013 stratigraphic data close to the boundaries with adjacent river catchments i e condamine catchment bremer catchment and mid brisbane river basin see fig 1 were also included to avoid modelling artefacts near the margins lithological logs were first simplified and standardised outside the 3d geological model environment and then imported into the 3d geological model framework using regular sets of perpendicular cross sections 100 in total the data were manually checked and corrected where required this included checks for geological inconsistencies and obvious terminology errors as exemplified by the presence of the lithological log description basalt in areas where basalts are absent raiber et al 2017a as part of this procedure lithological logs were initially converted into simple stratigraphic logs that differentiate alluvium main range volcanics and sedimentary bedrock following the iterative procedure described by raiber et al 2017a these were then used to create surfaces that represents the interface between the alluvium and the underlying sedimentary or volcanic bedrock using the data from a smaller number of deep stratigraphic or exploration wells or deep groundwater bores with reliable stratigraphic data the binding surfaces that separate the bedrock formations were developed 4 2 hydrochemical data and multivariate statistics 4 2 1 groundwater surface water and rainfall chemistry data groundwater chemistry data from the queensland dnrm groundwater database dnrm 2015 for the period january 1976 to may 2015 were included in the multivariate statistical analysis prior to 1976 potassium a major ion was typically not measured the 3d geological model section 4 1 2 was used to independently verify the source aquifer for each bore by determining the hydrostratigraphic unit at the screened interval this meant that substantially more bores with known aquifer membership were included in the hydrochemical hydrogeological and recharge assessment bores where the aquifer membership was ambiguous or where the screens were unknown or extended over multiple formations were excluded from the assessment in addition to groundwater samples surface water samples from the dnrm surface water database dnrm 2017 and from a 2012 survey of surface water quality at 28 sampling locations within 15 different creeks throughout the lockyer valley were also included in the assessment rainfall time series chemistry data were sourced from crosbie et al 2012 there are two rainfall chemistry monitoring stations near the lockyer valley toowoomba and brisbane fig 1 and major ion data from these stations were used for comparison with groundwater and surface water data 4 2 2 multi variate statistical analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is commonly adopted in groundwater hydrochemical studies it allows detection of spatial patterns in large datasets and enhances the understanding of physical and chemical catchment processes e g stetzenbach et al 1999 güler et al 2002 menció and mas pla 2008 daughney et al 2012 raiber et al 2012 where available a large number of variables should be used in hca to accurately characterise groundwater chemistry and the processes that control it the selection of the parameters to be included requires a balance between selecting a wide range of variables but also aiming for a large number of complete cases to ensure a good spatial coverage as hca considers only cases where a value exists for each variable raiber et al 2012 in this study ten variables were selected ca mg na k hco3 cl f so4 ph and electrical conductivity as they were measured across most sites an extended description of the methodology is provided in appendix 1 many of these groundwater bores were only sampled once although some bores were sampled multiple times the largest number of time series hydrochemical records for a single groundwater bore included in the cluster analysis is 16 in contrast to other studies where the median was used as a representative of time series data from particular groundwater bores e g guggenmos et al 2011 all sampling records that met the data quality checks appendix 1 were included in this study to evaluate temporal patterns surface water data were not integrated into the hca as there are a very large number of measurements available at some sites up to 170 hydrochemical time series records at a single monitoring station using all of these data could potentially skew the dataset but there are different ways of dealing with such extensive time series data for example the median of all time series data can be included to represent surface water monitoring datasets martinez et al 2015 in this study however discriminant analysis da was used for this purpose this approach provides insights into the similarity between groundwaters and surface waters without skewing the groundwater chemistry dataset and it also allows assessment of temporal variabilities within the surface water time series data da predicts into which of two or more a priori defined categories an observation is most likely to fall based on a set of classification functions and a certain combination of input variables e g davis 1986 papatheodorou et al 2007 daughney et al 2010 raiber et al 2012 more detail on the methodology is provided in appendix 1 5 results 5 1 aquifer geometry and groundwater flow paths aquifer geometry and groundwater flow paths as inferred from the 3d geological model and the potentiometric surface map were used to develop an initial hydrogeological conceptual model the 3d geological model of the lockyer valley fig 3 represents the thicknesses and geometric architecture of the different aquifers an isopach map fig 4 shows the thickness and geometry of the central lockyer creek alluvium and its tributary systems two cross sections through the 3d geological model fig 5 a and b further highlight key elements of the catchment geology including geometry variations in thickness and areal extent between alluvial aquifers and the underlying sedimentary and volcanic bedrock the composition of alluvial sediments varies considerably throughout the catchment in the headwaters of the lockyer creek tributary systems the thin alluvial sequences less than 20 m are dominated by boulders gravel and sand deposited by braided streams during high energy flow events in steep v shaped valleys in contrast fining upwards sequences with gravels and coarse sands at the base and clay on top dominate the alluvial sequences in mid and lower reaches of tributaries and generally throughout the central lockyer creek alluvium here the valleys are wide and u shaped with total alluvial thicknesses of up to 40 m weathering profiles of several meters separate the alluvial sediments from the underlying sedimentary bedrock and bedrock outcrops or shallow bedrock highs occur sporadically within the extent of the alluvium influencing the course of streams and the deposition and thicknesses of alluvial sediments the potentiometric surface map of the shallow bedrock in the lockyer valley i e representing the gatton sandstone and the koukandowie formation fig 3 suggests that groundwater flows towards the northern margin of the clarence moreton basin in the gatton sandstone and koukandowie formation there are insufficient data points to determine the flow direction in the wcm the gatton sandstone which underlies most of the alluvium throughout the lower part of the lockyer valley thins towards the northern basin margin where it on laps the woogaroo subgroup and pinches out fig 5a this suggests that as the gatton sandstone pinches out and thins from several hundred meters to zero thickness groundwater will be pushed upwards into the lockyer creek alluvium and ultimately will discharge to streams this hypothesis will be tested independently using hydrochemistry section 6 the groundwater flow direction in the gatton sandstone contrasts with groundwater flow in the woogaroo subgroup which in some parts of the lockyer valley flows in the opposite direction this mainly occurs from the elevated northern outcrop areas towards the deeper parts of the basin in the south east furthermore the equipotential lines of the shallow sedimentary bedrock also suggest that the lower parts of the major tributaries e g laidley creek sandy creek and tenthill creek figs 3 and 5a and b and much of the course of minor tributaries such as tibbits creek wonga creek or stockyard creek fig 5a and b form likely discharge points from the sedimentary bedrock to the alluvial aquifers and their associated streams insufficient groundwater level monitoring data exist for direct assessment of flow directions in the mrv in the headwaters of the lockyer valley however studies in other sub catchments within the clarence moreton basin suggested that discharge from the mrv to the alluvium and streams occurs in upper reaches e g martinez et al 2015 duvert et al 2016 martinez et al 2017 predominantly via spring discharge brodie and green 2002 this is also indicated by the geometry of the aquifers in the lockyer valley figs 3 and 5 with the major streams and associated alluvia e g laidley creek and black duck creek deeply incised into the mrv consequently the natural flow paths within this extensive fractured rock aquifer are commonly intercepted by the surface water system and alluvium the interface between the mrv and the wcm interpreted as a low permeability boundary due to the clay rich weathering profile typical of the top of the wcm is close to the base of the alluvium and streams in these upper reaches fig 5a this suggests that the lateral hydraulic conductivity likely exceeds the vertical conductivity and that lateral discharge from the mrv to the alluvium and streams substantially outweighs downwards percolation from the mrv into the wcm although only limited groundwater level monitoring data are available for the sedimentary bedrock in the western part of the catchment from helidon to toowoomba the presence of a bedrock basement ridge indicates the likely existence of a groundwater divide for these aquifers fig 5b this coincides with a structural feature previously termed helidon ridge smerdon and ransley 2012 proposed as the hydrogeological boundary between the surat and clarence moreton basins although this boundary remains contentious and thus part of the eastern margin of the great artesian basin in this area furthermore in the area near helidon a shallow buried granite herein named helidon granite is intersected in stratigraphic bore gsq ipswich 9 at 304 m below ground surface wells and o brien 1994 fig 1 with the extent of this intrusive body inferred from gravity data dnrm 2002 fig 1 5 2 groundwater hydrochemistry groundwater salinity represented here by the electrical conductivity ec within the sedimentary and volcanic bedrock in the lockyer valley ranges from 100 µs cm to 39 000 µs cm and from 200 µs cm to 32 000 µs cm for the alluvial aquifers following the identification and removal of outliers seven major clusters were identified in the alluvial and bedrock units fig 6 a 5 2 1 aquifer cluster relationship a chi square test was conducted to test for independence between aquifers and clusters to determine whether the cluster attribution of hydrochemical records is linked to aquifers since the p value is less than 0 05 the hypothesis that the aquifer and cluster classifications are independent can be rejected at the 95 0 confidence level this is also demonstrated by the cross tabulation in fig 6a which shows the relationships between aquifers and clusters it demonstrates for example that cluster 1 groundwaters originate primarily from the alluvium gatton sandstone and woogaroo subgroup it also shows that groundwaters assigned to cluster 6 groundwaters with the highest salinities are almost exclusively sourced from the gatton sandstone and the alluvial aquifer the spatial distribution of cluster assignments for bedrock and alluvial aquifers fig 7 is discussed in section 6 5 2 2 major characteristics of clusters the median values for hydrochemical variables of the seven clusters are represented in a piper plot in fig 6b and in table 1 and the spatial distribution of clusters in alluvium and sub alluvial bedrock is presented in fig 7 the ratios of selected ions versus cl for all samples in the bedrock and the alluvium are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the major characteristics of each cluster are cluster 1 this group contains brackish samples median ec of 2600 µs cm table 1 mostly from a small area near helidon fig 7a groundwaters in this cluster are marked by very high hco3 cl ratios fig 6b fig 8e and 9e and they are mostly oversaturated with regards to calcite and dolomite and very low concentrations of ca and mg fig 8b c and 9b c with ratios clearly below the 1 2 m ca hco3 ratio and low but measurable concentrations of so4 and high concentrations of f cluster 2 this cluster contains brackish groundwaters with median ec of 2029 µs cm and a dominance of hco3 over cl fig 8e table 1 and elevated na and mg versus cl ratios relative to local rainfall fig 8c cluster 3 clusters 3 contains fresh groundwater with median ec of approximately 690 µs cm table 1 respectively and a dominance of hco3 over cl fig 8e and 9e na is the dominant cation in cluster 3 groundwaters and for many samples the na cl ratio is above the na cl ratio of local rainfall fig 8a potassium is also elevated relative to local rainfall in many samples fig 8d most cluster 3 groundwater samples follow a 1 2 trend for ca hco3 and mg hco3 ratios and most are under saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite cluster 4 cluster 4 contains fresh groundwater samples median ec of 1039 µs cm with a dominance of hco3 over cl fig 8e and elevated na and mg versus cl ratios relative to local rainfall fig 8c cluster 5 cluster 5 contains the freshest groundwaters median ec of 370 µs cm in the lockyer valley similar to cluster 3 most clusters 5 groundwater samples follow a 1 2 trend for ca hco3 and mg hco3 ratios and most are under saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite cluster 6 cluster 6 includes widespread groundwater samples containing saline groundwater with a median ec of 6800 µs cm table 1 and maxima of up to 35 000 µs cm na cl ratios of these saline groundwaters scatter around the ratios of local rainfall and with increasing salinity there is a progression towards the na cl ratios of local average weighted rainfall fig 8a as also observed for saline groundwaters in many other areas in australia e g edwards and webb 2009 raiber et al 2009 in addition this cluster is characterised by a dominance of cl over hco3 and low potassium concentrations which are strongly depleted relative to local rainfall fig 8d e and 9d e cluster 7 groundwater samples assigned to cluster 7 have similar characteristics as cluster 6 groundwaters however they have slightly lower ec median 4230 µs cm lower so4 and higher ca and mg concentrations 5 3 temporal variability of groundwater chemistry and water levels the hydraulic gradients between alluvial aquifers bedrock aquifers and streams can reverse during different climatic periods for example laidley creek in its deeply incised lower reaches changed from a disconnected creek at the climax of the millennium drought in 2007 to a losing stream recharging the underlying alluvial aquifer in 2009 and into a gaining stream in 2013 raiber et al 2017b cui et al 2018 hydrochemistry can be used as a tool to determine if water level changes represent an actual aquifer recharge event resulting in a change in aquifer storage or a pressure loading we highlight the hydrochemical changes that have occurred throughout the lockyer valley at four sites where long term water level and groundwater chemistry data are available to determine if there is a change in the relative contribution from different recharge sources monitoring site 14320101 distance from creek approximately 600 m eleven complete groundwater chemistry records exist at this site in the alluvium of the lower lockyer creek fig 7b the cluster analysis showed that the variability of groundwater chemistry at this site is overall relatively small as the cluster membership only changed once from cluster 4 to cluster 2 and back to cluster 4 even though there was a relatively large change in water level from 11 to 26 m below ground surface bgs fig 10 a this indicates that despite significant water level fluctuations the principal recharge source or relative contributions from different sources to the alluvium is unlikely to change at this site monitoring site 14320277 distance from creek approximately 200 m the groundwater level at this site in the lower laidley creek sub catchment has fluctuated considerably during the last 40 years varying from about 2 5 to 20 5 m bgs fig 10b during this period there were also considerable changes in groundwater chemistry when the groundwater table was relatively shallow 5 10 m bgs groundwater was generally assigned to clusters 2 or 4 either fresh or slightly brackish the freshest groundwater at this site had ec of 1100 µs cm after significant declines in groundwater levels in the mid to late 1990 s groundwater salinity increased 9000 µs cm with a change to cluster 7 in contrast the reverse occurred under wetter conditions monitoring site 14320313 distance from creek approximately 1000 m groundwater at this site in the sandy creek sub catchment fig 7b is brackish or saline clusters 6 or 7 however the overall range of ec is relatively small 5500 to 7600 µs cm suggesting that there is no major variation in the recharge source monitoring site 14320823 distance from creek approximately 150 m in the lower flagstone creek sub catchment fig 7b groundwater chemistry changed from 1998 to 2015 most groundwater chemistry records were assigned to cluster 6 median of 6870 µs cm during the period of drought a considerable freshening is marked by a change of cluster membership from cluster 6 to cluster 2 with a change in ec from 8000 µs cm to approximately 1400 µs cm fig 10d even though the groundwater level remained relatively shallow data from 2013 confirm an increase in salinity accompanied by a reversal to cluster 6 5 4 surface water chemistry surface water salinity in the lockyer valley measured at low flow conditions during a synoptic sampling survey in 2011 2012 all samples collected at flowing reaches rather than pools and sourced from the dnrm water monitoring portal dnrm 2017 is spatially highly variable and ranges from approximately 200 µs cm to more than 16 000 µs cm figs 11 and 12 the freshest surface waters occur in buaraba creek which drains the woogaroo subgroup fresh surface waters also occur in the headwaters of laidley creek tenthill creek and black duck creek approximately 300 µs cm within or near the footprint of the mrv the water in lockyer creek is relatively fresh throughout although salinity does increase notably where smaller tributaries such as plain creek enter the main creek line fig 11 the flow in lockyer creek is dominated by input from the larger tributaries laidley creek tenthill creek and murphy creek that all originate near the peaks of the great dividing range and source a considerable portion of discharge in their headwaters from the mrv the hydrochemical similarity between groundwaters and surface waters was assessed using discriminant analysis which was conducted to determine into which groundwater chemistry clusters each surface water hydrochemical record would likely be assigned ion ratios of surface waters in the lockyer valley cover a similar range as those of the alluvial fig 9 and bedrock aquifers fig 8 similar to groundwaters the freshest surface waters are characterised by elevated major ion cl ratios as stream salinity increases the ion cl ratios decline and evolve towards ratios similar to or below the ratios of local rainfall the discriminant analysis also suggests that the surface water hydrochemical records are most similar to groundwater chemistry clusters 2 15 of all surface water samples are assigned to this cluster 3 50 4 15 and 5 14 whereas only relatively few samples are assigned to clusters 1 6 and 7 surface water chemistry time series data at three stream gauging station locations reveal considerable variability over time highlighting the complexity of the interactions spatially and temporally at laidley creek in mulgowie figs 11 and 12 located close to the upper part of the catchment and the outcropping mrv the relatively fresh cluster 4 dominates at tenthill creek at tenthill fig 12 which is more representative of the mid catchment there is a more pronounced change of surface water chemistry when compared to upstream with the lower flows having slightly higher salinity cluster 2 with fresher surface waters cluster 4 observed around many of the high flow hydrograph peaks lockyer creek in the lower section at rifles range rd figs 11 and 12 also shows variation in chemistry with many relatively fresh cluster 3 measurements as well as a few occasions where the stream salinity increases as low flow periods extend with some cluster 2 4 and 6 hydrochemical records the available surface water chemistry data highlight the variability in stream chemistry between the different tributaries in trying to use this information to better understand the relationship between streams and underlying aquifers it is important to note that the current dnrm surface water gauging sites primarily monitor flows and surface water quality of lockyer creek and its largest and highest yielding tributaries e g laidley creek tenthill creek and ma ma creek in contrast relatively few historic surface water chemistry records are available for smaller tributaries such as plain creek where the one off surface water quality survey for this study indicated highly saline surface water similar in composition to groundwaters of clusters 6 and 7 6 discussion 6 1 hydrogeological conceptual model of groundwater recharge and aquifer and surface water groundwater interactions 6 1 1 interactions between bedrock aquifers in order to use hydrochemistry to identify areas where bedrock aquifers interact with alluvial aquifers and streams it is important to understand the spatial variability of hydrochemistry and its controls within the bedrock hydrothermal groundwaters have been described near helidon and interpreted as originating from the great artesian basin dempster 1986 and as a possible discharge area for the precipice sandstone equivalent of the woogaroo subgroup from the linked surat basin fig 1 previous analyses of groundwater also revealed the presence of very high 222rn radium and lithium concentrations in the groundwaters at springs near helidon dempster 1986 characteristics commonly associated with groundwaters that have interacted with granites there are several notable geological and hydrogeological features in this area that may influence this distinctive water chemistry firstly as previously mentioned a subsurface granite is present in this area wells and o brien 1994 dnrm 2002 furthermore as suggested by smerdon and ransley 2012 and confirmed by the 3d geological model in the present study a major structural feature the helidon ridge traverses this area local faults and fractures in this area possibly associated with this ridge were also described and proposed as an influence on the spatial extent of the spa waters by dempster 1986 the similar water chemistry in the gatton sandstone and the woogaroo subgroup groundwaters from both aquifers in this area are assigned primarily to cluster 1 fig 7a here indicates that these two aquifers are likely connected locally this distinct water chemistry composition occurring in both the gatton sandstone and woogaroo subgroup here may be influenced by the geological structures in this area or by interaction with the subsurface granite although the mechanism of this proposed connection is not clear it appears that faults and fractures may form gas and water migration pathways possibly linking the subsurface granite the gatton sandstone the woogaroo subgroup and springs observed in this area whether there is a possible hydraulic connection to the surat basin remains an open research question in contrast to the proposed hydraulic connection between the gatton sandstone and the woogaroo subgroup in the helidon area they appear to be largely separated in other parts of the lockyer valley in the eastern part of the lockyer valley near morton vale figs 1 and 3 for instance opposing groundwater flow directions of the gatton sandstone flow towards the north fig 3 and woogaroo subgroup flow towards the south east fig 5a as well as hydrochemical differences suggest a limited connection between these formations fig 7a here groundwater in the woogaroo subgroup is very fresh with many samples assigned to clusters 3 and 5 median electrical conductivity of 690 and 370 µs cm respectively whereas many gatton sandstone groundwater samples are assigned to clusters 6 or 7 limited water rock interaction with the dominant coarse grained quartz rich sandstone and conglomerates explain low salinity values in the woogaroo subgroup these prevalent rock types favour rapid groundwater recharge with limited evapotranspiration the gatton sandstone is also dominated by sandstones but with higher clay and cement contents than the clean quartzose sandstones of the woogaroo subgroup rassam et al 2014 as a result of its more clay rich composition and commonly thick weathering profiles groundwater recharge to the gatton sandstone is likely to be slow favouring evapotranspiration during long retention times in the unsaturated zone in the southern part of the lockyer valley near the great dividing range the lack of nested groundwater monitoring sites in the mrv and the wcm as well as sparse hydrochemical data for the wcm prevent an assessment of the degree of connection between these two units however if there is a hydraulic connection between the mrv the wcm and underlying sedimentary bedrock units in this area then this is unlikely to result in any significant downwards percolation into the units underlying the wcm this is due to the strong contrast in hydrochemistry between the mrv and the koukandowie formation and the gatton sandstone which suggests that these units do not receive substantial recharge through the overlying volcanics instead these sedimentary bedrock units are recharged primarily through diffuse rainfall recharge in their outcrop areas where thick clay rich weathering profiles allow only slow recharge and facilitate high evapotranspiration and interaction with clays during or prior to recharge as observed in studies elsewhere e g bennetts et al 2006 edwards and webb 2009 raiber et al 2015 an exception to this exists at the great dividing range near toowoomba in the western part of the lockyer valley where there are greater similarities between groundwater chemical compositions of the different aquifers 6 1 2 interactions between main range volcanics alluvial aquifers and surface waters the outcrops of the mrv in the lockyer valley are characterised by steep terrains with thin soil profiles and areally extensive outcrops of fresh and unweathered basalt section 2 particularly near the peaks in the southern part of the catchment the high degree of fracturing of the basalts results in high recharge rates and low salinity groundwater in the mrv clusters 3 4 and 5 fig 6 there is a predominance of coarse grained components within the alluvial aquifers of the upper catchment allowing for groundwater to be stored and transmitted rapidly the unconfined nature of alluvial aquifers in the upper catchment of tributary systems such as laidley creek or tenthill creek is comparable to that of fractured basalt aquifer systems elsewhere in the clarence moreton basin e g duvert et al 2015b martinez et al 2015 2017 as well as other basaltic aquifers in australia e g bennetts et al 2006 raiber et al 2015 and overseas e g kebede et al 2005 demlie et al 2007 the fresh groundwaters typically less than 1000 µs cm in the alluvial and volcanic aquifers in the upper catchment are dominated by na hco3 figs 6 8 and 9 and high major ion cl ratios e g mg and ca figs 8 and 9 with excess ions relative to average weighted local precipitation in toowoomba supplied by the dissolution of primary silicate minerals e g plagioclase within the basalts or alluvial sediments composed of basaltic components the 3d geological model showed that laidley creek and tenthill creek including its tributary black duck creek are deeply incised into the mrv fig 5a and intercept the natural groundwater pathways of the volcanic aquifers thus forming groundwater discharge points section 4 1 surface waters here are very fresh figs 11 and 12 dominated by hco3 with high ca and mg concentrations fig 9 and with an overall composition similar to the composition of groundwater in clusters 3 4 and 5 fig 9 this suggests that a large proportion of the initial recharge to the basalts discharges into the alluvium or directly to surface water or springs where no alluvium is developed following short flow paths and with short lag times only a small proportion of this recharge percolates to deeper aquifers as highlighted by the absence of fresh groundwaters in sedimentary bedrock aquifers underneath the mrv in most areas section 5 1 however even after extended periods of no rainfall and thus no recharge groundwater continues to drain from the basalts providing continuous baseflow and sustaining streams notably the influence of the basalts on the hydrochemistry of the alluvial aquifers and surface waters extends beyond its footprint in the laidley creek sub catchment as also described in the neighbouring condamine river catchment by martinez et al 2017 fresh groundwaters with a similar hydrochemical composition as surface waters and basalt groundwaters occur along the entire course of laidley creek to its confluence with lockyer creek fig 7b and 11 these similar compositions highlight the significance of surface water recharge and the influence of the mrv in this catchment 6 1 3 interactions between sedimentary bedrock alluvial aquifers and surface water most of the smaller tributaries are generally not incised into the mrv e g plain creek woolshed creek sandy creek soda spring creek monkey water holes creek and deep gully fig 12 as a result unlike for the headwaters of larger tributaries such as laidley creek or tenthill creek there is little or no influence of the basalts on recharge and the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater and surface water in these smaller tributary systems instead the gatton sandstone and koukandowie formation commonly form the sub alluvial bedrock aquifers in these smaller tributary systems within the lockyer valley smaller tributaries form natural discharge areas for the gatton sandstone and koukandowie formation as indicated by the 3d geological model and potentiometric surface map figs 3 and 5 both gatton sandstone and koukandowie formation contain brackish to saline groundwater assigned to clusters 6 and 7 in these areas and groundwaters within alluvial aquifers of the lower parts of tributary sub catchments or smaller tributaries such as plain creek sandy creek and ma ma creek are also dominated by groundwaters assigned to clusters 6 and 7 fig 7b this hydrochemical similarity with the water chemistry of the alluvial aquifer systems confirms the significance of upwards leakage from the sub alluvial sedimentary bedrock both cluster 6 and cluster 7 have elevated na cl ratios and major ion cl ratios rapidly decrease to values close to or below those in local rainfall fig 9 this suggests that the weathering derived ions observed in groundwaters of other hydrochemical clusters are removed from solution by adsorption on clay mineral surfaces furthermore many of these groundwaters have saturation indices exceeding the threshold where calcite precipitation typically occurs si 0 5 this suggests that calcite or dolomite precipitation has removed some ca mg and hco3 from the groundwater although only represented by relatively few samples from the synoptic surface water quality survey fig 11 and from the dnrm surface water monitoring dnrm 2017 the salinity and hydrochemistry of surface waters here are similar to those of groundwaters confirming the close hydraulic connection between sedimentary bedrock alluvial systems and surface water in these small tributary systems the initial conceptual model based on aquifer geometry and the potentiometric surface of the shallow sedimentary bedrock suggested that flow paths within the sedimentary bedrock are intersected by the alluvial systems near the edge of the alluvial aquifers in the mid to lower reaches of major tributaries this is confirmed by the presence of brackish to saline alluvial groundwater samples of clusters 6 and 7 at the margins of the alluvium throughout different parts of the catchment including within the lockyer creek alluvium and its major tributary systems e g laidley creek fig 7b these patterns are likely to vary spatially and as demonstrated by the example of groundwater monitoring bore 14320277 located in the lower laidley creek sub catchment fig 7b and 10d the relative significance of this discharge component from the underlying sedimentary bedrock at the edge of the alluvium varies over time during prolonged drought periods the relative water level difference head gradient between the alluvial and sedimentary bedrock aquifers can be reversed due to more rapid and pronounced declines in alluvial water levels resulting from a lack of recharge and continuous pumping compared to those of the sedimentary bedrock aquifers raiber et al 2017b cui et al 2018 as a result of the increasing head gradient there is a higher potential for discharge from the sub alluvial bedrock to the alluvium during droughts and a considerable proportion of the alluvial groundwater in these zones may be sourced from the underlying bedrock during drought conditions in many studies it is assumed that there is no or insignificant connection between sedimentary bedrock and alluvial aquifers due to weathering profiles developed on the sedimentary bedrock however the contact between alluvium and sub alluvial bedrock is erosional and the weathering profiles are usually thin or absent near the edge of the alluvium it is therefore likely that the weathering profiles that may have originally developed on the sedimentary bedrock are likely to be compromised or absent in some areas allowing connection between the different aquifers in contrast to the influence of sedimentary bedrock discharge on water quality and balance of the alluvium during dry periods during normal non drought times the sedimentary bedrock discharge component is overwhelmed by other recharge sources e g surface water recharge diffuse rainfall recharge flood recharge or irrigation returns in lockyer creek and its larger tributary systems in the lower part of the plain creek and woolshed sub catchments in the eastern part of the lockyer valley fig 7 groundwater levels within the alluvial aquifer are typically relatively shallow some of the most saline alluvial groundwaters fig 7b and surface waters fig 11 assigned to clusters 6 and 7 occur in these areas this suggests that in addition to discharge from the sub alluvial sedimentary bedrock which here contains saline groundwater there is also likely to be some influence of dryland salinity i e evaporation from shallow water tables in these areas 7 conclusions in most studies where integrated catchment scale hydrological models are developed catchments are commonly represented as simplified and relatively shallow groundwater systems in these models the influence of sub alluvial bedrock on water balance and water quality of alluvial aquifers and streams is often neglected in this study we use the multi aquifer system volcanic sedimentary bedrock and alluvial aquifers of the lockyer valley an important agricultural catchment in the clarence moreton basin in south eastern queensland australia as an example to highlight the variable spatial and temporal significance of discharge from regional scale bedrock aquifers to alluvial aquifers and streams during cycles of drought and flooding for this purpose we have applied multivariate statistical techniques to groundwater and surface water data combined with development of a 3d geological model that represents the geometry of all major volcanic sedimentary bedrock and alluvial aquifer systems in the lockyer valley the study confirmed that the alluvial aquifers are recharged from multiple sources and that the relative contribution from different sources varies spatially the 3d geological model combined with hydraulic data was instrumental in identifying broad areas where alluvial aquifers and streams intercept the natural groundwater pathways of the volcanic and sedimentary bedrock aquifers thus forming groundwater discharge points the hydrochemical assessment confirmed that there is a high degree of variability associated with the geological complexity as most sub catchments within the lockyer valley are characterised by very distinct alluvial groundwater chemistry patterns resulting from mixing of different recharge sources and interactions with sub alluvial bedrock in the headwaters of the lockyer creek and its tributaries for instance the hydrochemistry indicated that there is a very strong influence of the main range volcanics an extensive fractured rock volcanic aquifer system on recharge of the alluvial aquifer and stream flow these systems have fresh alluvial groundwaters and fresh surface water with electrical conductivities typically less than 1000 µs cm and a hydrochemical composition similar to the basalt groundwater further down gradient there is an increasing influence of discharge from sub alluvial sedimentary bedrock aquifers of the clarence moreton basin on alluvial groundwater composition and surface water this influence is particularly evident in smaller tributary systems and at the edge of the alluvial aquifers in larger tributaries where alluvial groundwaters are brackish to saline and compositionally similar to groundwaters in the sub alluvial sedimentary bedrock importantly in addition to the distinct spatial patterns of hydrochemistry there is a strong temporal variability in recharge sources and connectivity as demonstrated at multiple sites where long term groundwater and surface water time series hydrochemical records exist in the larger tributary systems discharge from the sedimentary bedrock to the alluvium or streams is likely to be relatively insignificant during normal climatic periods or following flooding however the influence of discharge from bedrock on quantity and quality of water in shallow alluvial aquifers and streams can become significantly more important during extended dry periods and droughts this influence can have both positive and negative effects for example continuous discharge from the sub alluvial bedrock to streams observed in some areas contributes baseflow which helps to sustain flows and sustain groundwater dependant ecosystems during prolonged dry periods or droughts on the other hand where the water quality of the sedimentary bedrock is very poor e g due to high salinities observed in some of the sedimentary bedrock aquifers within the lockyer valley the relatively higher significance of sedimentary bedrock discharge to the alluvium during droughts can result in a significant deterioration of water quality in the alluvial aquifer systems in some areas making it unusable for most agricultural activities this is because other recharge sources such as surface water or rainfall recharge have ceased during these extended dry periods although all catchments have their own physical characteristics some general lessons and ideas can be transferred from this study to catchments elsewhere firstly the complex spatial and temporal patterns of connections between alluvium and streams likely to be similar in mid reaches of other catchments with dynamic climates dominated by droughts and flooding elsewhere highlights the challenge in defining where groundwater surface water interaction occur and thus whether river reaches are gaining losing or disconnected secondly this study also demonstrates that it should not be automatically assumed that there is no hydraulic connection between sedimentary bedrock and alluvial aquifers and streams as this relationship can be very complex and variable both spatially and temporarily monitoring networks generally sample the subsurface at a limited number of locations and in many catchments in australia and likely elsewhere they are often designed to assess the water quantity i e water levels of the uppermost often alluvial aquifers rather than the hydraulic connection between shallow and deep aquifers they may therefore not capture the hydraulic connection between bedrock and alluvial aquifers although it may sound trivial it is important to reinforce that approaches that integrate multiple lines of geoscientific evidence and honour all available hydrochemical hydraulic lithological and stratigraphic records help to reduce the likelihood of misconceptions or oversimplifications in catchment hydrological and hydrogeological investigations insights gained from such multi disciplinary approaches can support future water resource planning and management through an improved conceptual understanding of the hydrogeology and surface water groundwater interactions as

analysis hca is a multivariate statistical technique which is commonly adopted in groundwater hydrochemical studies to identify patterns within a dataset to enhance the understanding of physical and chemical processes that underpin groundwater evolution e g stetzenbach et al 1999 güler et al 2002 menció and mas pla 2008 daughney et al 2010 raiber et al 2012 ideally a large number of variables should be included in hca to capture spatial and temporal processes that control groundwater chemical evolution in the dnrm 2015 groundwater database hydrochemical data exist for a large number of variables including both major and minor ions however in this study only ten variables were selected ca mg na k hco3 cl f so4 ph and electrical conductivity as they were measured across most sites whereas variables such as fe mn and no3 were excluded to their relatively poor spatial coverage prior to the multi variate statistical analysis data quality checks were performed on all hydrochemical records sample records with charge balances outside 5 or where the aquifer at the screened interval was unknown were excluded from further analysis this resulted in a hydrochemical dataset with 3155 complete hydrochemical records i e where all ten selected parameters had a measured value from 1190 groundwater bores many of these groundwater bores were only sampled once although some bores were sampled multiple times the largest number of time series hydrochemical records for a single groundwater bore included in the cluster analysis is 16 in contrast to other studies where the median was used as a representative of time series data from particular groundwater bores e g guggenmos et al 2011 all sampling records that passed the data quality checks were included in this study to evaluate temporal patterns and understand the influence of droughts and flooding on groundwater chemistry all variables except ph were log transformed to approximate a normal distribution before the multivariate statistical analysis was conducted the hca presented in this work was carried out using the statgraphics centurion software manugistics inc usa prior to the clustering the variables were standardized by subtracting its sample mean and then dividing by its sample standard deviation two linkage rules were adopted 1 the nearest neighbour rule was applied to identify sites with significantly different hydrochemical signatures these were removed as outliers residuals from the data set and 2 the ward s rule which allowed the generation of distinct clusters based on analysis of variance this resulted in grouping of all non residuals into separate clusters dissimilarities across all variables were assessed using the square of the euclidean distance e the transformed input data together with linkage rules and the dissimilarity measure are described as the most appropriate techniques for identifying patterns in hydrochemical data sets güler et al 2002 daughney et al 2012 raiber et al 2012 the outcome of this process is a dendrogram cloutier et al 2008 fig a1 hca is considered a semi objective technique as it involves an element of judgment when determining the number of clusters that are representative of the sample population e g daughney et al 2012 in this study the dendrogram was visually inspected and centroid concentrations represented by the median for different input variables and clusters at different separation thresholds fig a1 and the spatial distribution of clusters were compared to decide on an appropriate separation threshold or phenon line which determines the number of clusters güler et al 2002 cloutier et al 2008 daughney et al 2012 raiber et al 2012 the median was used for the comparison as it is considered as a better indicator of central tendency than the mean as the median is less sensitive to extreme values helsel and hirsch 2012 surface water data were not integrated into the hca as there are a very large number of measurements available at some sites up to 170 hydrochemical time series records at a single monitoring station using all of these data could potentially skew the dataset but there are different ways of dealing with such extensive time series data for example the median of all time series data can be included to represent surface water monitoring datasets e g martinez et al 2015 in the present study however we have conducted a discriminant analysis da for this purpose this approach provides insights into the similarity between groundwaters and surface waters without skewing the groundwater chemistry dataset and it also allows assessment of temporal variabilities within the surface water time series data da is a multivariate statistical technique that predicts into which of two or more categories an observation is most likely to fall based on a set of classification functions and a certain combination of input variables e g daughney et al 2010 raiber et al 2012 the discriminant analysis is designed to develop a set of discriminating functions which can help predict the cluster membership of the surface water chemistry records based on the values of other quantitative variables all complete groundwater chemistry cases n 3155 were used to develop a model to discriminate among the seven clusters from the hca ten predictor variables the hydrochemical parameters listed above were entered and the derived six discriminating functions with p values less than 0 05 are statistically significant at the 95 0 confidence level amongst the 3155 observations the groundwater chemistry records used to fit the model 2643 84 were correctly classified surface water chemistry cluster memberships were then predicted as new observations to assess their similarity with groundwater chemistry records and predict to which groundwater chemistry cluster they would be most likely assigned 
6782,catchment scale hydrological and hydrogeological investigations commonly conclude by finding that particular stream reaches are either gaining or losing they also often assume that the influence of bedrock aquifers on catchment water balances and water quality is insignificant however in many cases such broad findings are likely to oversimplify the spatial and temporal complexity of the connections between the different hydrological system components particularly in regions dominated by cycles of droughts and flooding from a modelling perspective such oversimplifications can have serious implications on the process of identifying the magnitude and direction of the exchange fluxes between the surface and groundwater systems in this study we use 3d geological modelling and historic water chemistry and hydraulic records to identify the origins of groundwater at different locations in the alluvium and along the course of streams in the lockyer valley queensland australia a catchment impacted by a severe drought millennium drought from 1998 to 2009 followed by extensive flooding in 2011 we also demonstrate how discharge from the sub alluvial regional scale volcanic and sedimentary bedrock influences the water balance and water quality of the alluvium and streams the investigation of aquifer geometry via development of a three dimensional geological model combined with an assessment of hydraulic data provided important insights on groundwater flow paths and helped to identify areas where bedrock aquifers interact with shallow alluvial aquifers and streams multivariate statistical techniques were then applied as an additional line of evidence to groundwater and surface water hydrochemical data from large historical datasets this confirmed that most sub catchments within the lockyer valley have distinct water chemistry patterns which result from mixing of different water sources including discharge from the sub alluvial bedrock importantly in addition to the observed spatial variability time series hydrochemical groundwater and surface water data further demonstrated that the hydraulic connection between alluvial aquifers streams and sub alluvial bedrock aquifers is temporally dynamic with very significant changes occurring at the transition from normal to drought conditions and following flooding affecting both catchment water quality and water balances keywords aquifer interaction groundwater surface water interaction lockyer valley 3d geological modelling hydrochemistry bedrock 1 introduction hydrogeological investigations aim to address critical natural resource management issues such as the over exploitation or contamination of ground and surface water systems understanding connectivity between aquifers and their interactions with the surface water system is a critical component of such investigations e g guggenmos et al 2011 duvert et al 2015a b king et al 2015 barthel and banzhaf 2016 alluvial aquifers are in close vicinity of the land surface and often form significant aquifers in mid reaches of worldwide rivers where most agricultural activity occurs they are therefore susceptible to over exploitation cross aquifer mixing through interaction with underlying bedrock aquifers and anthropogenic inputs e g through the application of fertilizers e g famiglietti 2014 cheng et al 2017 alluvial aquifers are also more readily influenced by climatic variability due to the greater level of dynamic interaction with surface water helena et al 2000 ahmed et al 2004 liu et al 2014 filippini et al 2015 izbicki et al 2015 meng et al 2015 atkins et al 2016 king et al 2017 the move towards conjunctive river aquifer management has led to the development of large scale integrated models that simulate surface groundwater interactions at various levels of complexity identifying the spatial and temporal complexity of the connections between the different system components is an essential step towards identifying the active interaction processes within a particular surface groundwater system rassam 2011 rassam et al 2013 however integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshms developed to simulate catchment scale groundwater surface water interactions usually represent catchments as simplified and relatively shallow groundwater systems that are typically not affected by the bedrock e g barthel 2014 paniconi and putti 2015 barthel and banzhaf 2016 fatichi et al 2016 kollet et al 2017 although model structural or conceptual model error is often identified as a main source of model predictions uncertainty e g marty et al 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 rojas et al 2009 holman et al 2012 the uncertainties associated with oversimplifications of the connections between bedrock alluvium and streams in catchment hydrological investigations are not typically considered however from a modelling perspective over simplification of connectivity may have serious implications on predictions as for example in studies where the impacts of resource development e g coal seam gas coal bed methane from sedimentary bedrock systems on alluvial aquifers streams and groundwater dependant ecosystems are investigated cui et al 2016 janardhanan et al in preparation cui et al under revision this study uses the lockyer valley in south east queensland australia to demonstrate how the integration of multiple independent lines of geoscientific evidence including groundwater and surface water hydrochemistry and a 3d geological model can enhance the understanding of connections between connectivity between surface water alluvial aquifers and the underlying shallow and deep bedrock although many local hydrogeological studies have been conducted e g dixon and

conceptual model of catchment wide recharge and connectivity mechanisms exists for the lockyer valley the lockyer valley is an ideal catchment to examine the significance of the connection between alluvial and sub alluvial bedrock aquifers and with surface water including its temporal and spatial variability several key points support this a it has a diverse geology consisting of several compositionally different aquifer types quaternary alluvia neogene volcanics and triassic to jurassic sedimentary bedrock aquifers b there is an extensive groundwater monitoring bore network with several hundred groundwater bores screened in different aquifers importantly in contrast to most other catchments in south east queensland such as the adjacent condamine river catchment fig 1 and many catchments elsewhere in australia a large number of groundwater monitoring bores were installed in the sedimentary bedrock in the early 2000s as part of a national salinity monitoring programme pearce

extended from 1998 to 2009 millennium drought this study aims to 1 highlight the significance of the bedrock contribution on both water fluxes and quality and illustrate to what extent aquifer geometry influences connectivity between the different system components 2 identify aquifers that discharge to streams and areas where this discharge occurs and conversely areas where streams recharge underlying aquifers 3 define mechanisms and areas of recharge for different aquifers and assess the temporal variability of these processes during droughts and following flooding 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the lockyer valley is an approximately 2300 km2 catchment in the north east of the clarence moreton basin which is infilled with a variety of sedimentary rocks of fluvial lacustrine origin fig 1 a comprehensive description of the aquifer systems of the clarence moreton basin is provided by rassam et al 2014 and raiber et al 2017b in recent decades the clarence moreton basin has been extensively explored for conventional and unconventional gas with a primary focus on coal seam gas csg resources in the walloon coal measures wcm in the lockyer valley the clarence moreton basin consists of four major stratigraphic units of late triassic to jurassic age namely the woogaroo subgroup the gatton sandstone the koukandowie formation and the walloon coal measures figs 1 and 2 these sedimentary bedrocks are overlain by extensive extrusive volcanic rocks main range volcanics mrv and quaternary alluvial aquifer systems the late triassic woogaroo subgroup forms an aquifer consisting mostly of conglomerate beds and thin beds of sandstone composed mainly of quartz rich sand o brien and wells 1994 it is overlain by the gatton sandstone lower member of marburg subgroup a partial aquifer which is dominated by thick bedded medium to coarse grained quartz lithic and feldspathic sandstone ingram and robinson 1996 the koukandowie formation upper unit of the marburg subgroup consists of sheets of interbedded quartzose feldspathic lithic sandstone siltstone claystone and minor coal willis 1994 and is considered as a partial aquifer raiber et al 2017b the wcm is composed of volcaniclastic lithic and silty sandstone with interbedded mudstone coal and siltstone wells and o brien 1994 ash fall tuff and basalts also occur in the sequence doig and stanmore 2012 as commonly observed in lithological logs in the lockyer valley the wcm is limited to the southern and south western part of the catchment where it outcrops or is overlain by fractured basalts of the mrv fig 1 it has a thickness of typically less than 100 m in the lockyer valley which makes it an unlikely target for csg exploration in this area raiber et al 2017a the cenozoic mrv are widespread in the lockyer valley and cover large areas in the southern and western part of the catchment where they cap the peaks of the great dividing range fig 1 they unconformably overlie the gatton sandstone the koukandowie formation and the wcm with a thickness of typically less than 200 m but can be considerably thicker close to peaks and volcanic eruptive centres importantly the mrv do not consist of a single homogeneous basalt flow or correspond to a single aquifer but are composed of many overlapping volcanic flows with a maximum thickness of approximately 10 m each which are commonly separated by lower permeability layers including clay rich weathering profiles developed during volcanic hiatuses well developed fracture networks secondary porosity connect vesicular zones of different basalt flows within the mrv raiber et al 2017a there are several major geological structures in the lockyer valley namely the gatton arch and the helidon ridge fig 1 as well as many local scale fracture and fault zones extensive alluvial sediment sequences have infilled the alluvial valleys of the lockyer creek and its tributary systems the geometry and composition of the alluvial sediments is discussed in more detail in section 5 1 3 climate vegetation and surface water flow south east queensland has a subtropical climate dominated by hot and humid summers and dry mild winters

station number 040205 bom 2017 the low rainfall during the millennium drought resulted in very low creek flow with flow in most creeks ceasing completely especially from mid 2006 until early 2008 this period of drought was followed by several wet years and flooding in january 2011 flows in the lockyer creek and catchments in south east queensland in general are characterised by high flood variability croke et al 2016 at rifle range road fig 1 near the outflow of the catchment the median flow is approximately 57 l s whereas the peak flow recorded during flooding in january 2011 was more than 690 000 l s dnrm 2017 the dominant land uses are pasture 47 and woody vegetation 41 with 11 of the area used for cropping apan et al 2002 extensive forests and woodlands cover most of the mrv and woogaroo subgroup outcrop areas alluvial groundwater is used extensively for irrigated seasonal horticulture with some irrigated cropping dryland agriculture also occurs in the areas away from the alluvium on outcrops of the gatton sandstone and other sedimentary bedrock hydrostratigraphic abares 2016 4 methods and data sources 4 1 hydraulic and geological data and 3d geological model development 4 1 1 groundwater bore data and potentiometric surface map development historical groundwater levels and bore construction details as well as lithologic and stratigraphic data were compiled from over 5000 registered groundwater bores including bores at the periphery of the lockyer valley in adjacent catchments to avoid modelling artefacts near the margins sourced from the queensland department of natural resources and mines dnrm groundwater database dnrm 2014 2015 in addition data from a smaller number of deeper stratigraphic or petroleum wells within the catchment were used obtained from the dnrm queensland digital exploration reports dnrm 2014 and from wells and o brien 1994 the potentiometric surface of the shallow sedimentary bedrock was created using ordinary kriging with a fitted linear semi variogram model in arcgis based on the available groundwater level data from 2000 to 2012 dnrm 2014 4 1 2 development of 3d geological model the three dimensional 3d geological model of the lockyer valley was assembled using skua gocad software paradigm geophysical pty ltd in combination with mira gocad mining utilities the 3d geological model of the lockyer valley consists of the seven major model units as listed in the stratigraphic table fig 2 input data included a 1 degree digital elevation model srtm geoscience australia and csiro land and water 2010 and a variety of geological data such as 1 100 000 geological maps dnrm 2002 as well as stratigraphic and lithologic data from the queensland dnrm groundwater database dnrm 2013 stratigraphic data close to the boundaries with adjacent river catchments i e condamine catchment bremer catchment and mid brisbane river basin see fig 1 were also included to avoid modelling artefacts near the margins lithological logs were first simplified and standardised outside the 3d geological model environment and then imported into the 3d geological model framework using regular sets of perpendicular cross sections 100 in total the data were manually checked and corrected where required this included checks for geological inconsistencies and obvious terminology errors as exemplified by the presence of the lithological log description basalt in areas where basalts are absent raiber et al 2017a as part of this procedure lithological logs were initially converted into simple stratigraphic logs that differentiate alluvium main range volcanics and sedimentary bedrock following the iterative procedure described by raiber et al 2017a these were then used to create surfaces that represents the interface between the alluvium and the underlying sedimentary or volcanic bedrock using the data from a smaller number of deep stratigraphic or exploration wells or deep groundwater bores with reliable stratigraphic data the binding surfaces that separate the bedrock formations were developed 4 2 hydrochemical data and multivariate statistics 4 2 1 groundwater surface water and rainfall chemistry data groundwater chemistry data from the queensland dnrm groundwater database dnrm 2015 for the period january 1976 to may 2015 were included in the multivariate statistical analysis prior to 1976 potassium a major ion was typically not measured the 3d geological model section 4 1 2 was used to independently verify the source aquifer for each bore by determining the hydrostratigraphic unit at the screened interval this meant that substantially more bores with known aquifer membership were included in the hydrochemical hydrogeological and recharge assessment bores where the aquifer membership was ambiguous or where the screens were unknown or extended over multiple formations were excluded from the assessment in addition to groundwater samples surface water samples from the dnrm surface water database dnrm 2017 and from a 2012 survey of surface water quality at 28 sampling locations within 15 different creeks throughout the lockyer valley were also included in the assessment rainfall time series chemistry data were sourced from crosbie et al 2012 there are two rainfall chemistry monitoring stations near the lockyer valley toowoomba and brisbane fig 1 and major ion data from these stations were used for comparison with groundwater and surface water data 4 2 2 multi variate statistical analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is commonly adopted in groundwater hydrochemical studies it allows detection of spatial patterns in large datasets and enhances the understanding of physical and chemical catchment processes e g stetzenbach et al 1999 güler et al 2002 menció and mas pla 2008 daughney et al 2012 raiber et al 2012 where available a large number of variables should be used in hca to accurately characterise groundwater chemistry and the processes that control it the selection of the parameters to be included requires a balance between selecting a wide range of variables but also aiming for a large number of complete cases to ensure a good spatial coverage as hca considers only cases where a value exists for each variable raiber et al 2012 in this study ten variables were selected ca mg na k hco3 cl f so4 ph and electrical conductivity as they were measured across most sites an extended description of the methodology is provided in appendix 1 many of these groundwater bores were only sampled once although some bores were sampled multiple times the largest number of time series hydrochemical records for a single groundwater bore included in the cluster analysis is 16 in contrast to other studies where the median was used as a representative of time series data from particular groundwater bores e g guggenmos et al 2011 all sampling records that met the data quality checks appendix 1 were included in this study to evaluate temporal patterns surface water data were not integrated into the hca as there are a very large number of measurements available at some sites up to 170 hydrochemical time series records at a single monitoring station using all of these data could potentially skew the dataset but there are different ways of dealing with such extensive time series data for example the median of all time series data can be included to represent surface water monitoring datasets martinez et al 2015 in this study however discriminant analysis da was used for this purpose this approach provides insights into the similarity between groundwaters and surface waters without skewing the groundwater chemistry dataset and it also allows assessment of temporal variabilities within the surface water time series data da predicts into which of two or more a priori defined categories an observation is most likely to fall based on a set of classification functions and a certain combination of input variables e g davis 1986 papatheodorou et al 2007 daughney et al 2010 raiber et al 2012 more detail on the methodology is provided in appendix 1 5 results 5 1 aquifer geometry and groundwater flow paths aquifer geometry and groundwater flow paths as inferred from the 3d geological model and the potentiometric surface map were used to develop an initial hydrogeological conceptual model the 3d geological model of the lockyer valley fig 3 represents the thicknesses and geometric architecture of the different aquifers an isopach map fig 4 shows the thickness and geometry of the central lockyer creek alluvium and its tributary systems two cross sections through the 3d geological model fig 5 a and b further highlight key elements of the catchment geology including geometry variations in thickness and areal extent between alluvial aquifers and the underlying sedimentary and volcanic bedrock the composition of alluvial sediments varies considerably throughout the catchment in the headwaters of the lockyer creek tributary systems the thin alluvial sequences less than 20 m are dominated by boulders gravel and sand deposited by braided streams during high energy flow events in steep v shaped valleys in contrast fining upwards sequences with gravels and coarse sands at the base and clay on top dominate the alluvial sequences in mid and lower reaches of tributaries and generally throughout the central lockyer creek alluvium here the valleys are wide and u shaped with total alluvial thicknesses of up to 40 m weathering profiles of several meters separate the alluvial sediments from the underlying sedimentary bedrock and bedrock outcrops or shallow bedrock highs occur sporadically within the extent of the alluvium influencing the course of streams and the deposition and thicknesses of alluvial sediments the potentiometric surface map of the shallow bedrock in the lockyer valley i e representing the gatton sandstone and the koukandowie formation fig 3 suggests that groundwater flows towards the northern margin of the clarence moreton basin in the gatton sandstone and koukandowie formation there are insufficient data points to determine the flow direction in the wcm the gatton sandstone which underlies most of the alluvium throughout the lower part of the lockyer valley thins towards the northern basin margin where it on laps the woogaroo subgroup and pinches out fig 5a this suggests that as the gatton sandstone pinches out and thins from several hundred meters to zero thickness groundwater will be pushed upwards into the lockyer creek alluvium and ultimately will discharge to streams this hypothesis will be tested independently using hydrochemistry section 6 the groundwater flow direction in the gatton sandstone contrasts with groundwater flow in the woogaroo subgroup which in some parts of the lockyer valley flows in the opposite direction this mainly occurs from the elevated northern outcrop areas towards the deeper parts of the basin in the south east furthermore the equipotential lines of the shallow sedimentary bedrock also suggest that the lower parts of the major tributaries e g laidley creek sandy creek and tenthill creek figs 3 and 5a and b and much of the course of minor tributaries such as tibbits creek wonga creek or stockyard creek fig 5a and b form likely discharge points from the sedimentary bedrock to the alluvial aquifers and their associated streams insufficient groundwater level monitoring data exist for direct assessment of flow directions in the mrv in the headwaters of the lockyer valley however studies in other sub catchments within the clarence moreton basin suggested that discharge from the mrv to the alluvium and streams occurs in upper reaches e g martinez et al 2015 duvert et al 2016 martinez et al 2017 predominantly via spring discharge brodie and green 2002 this is also indicated by the geometry of the aquifers in the lockyer valley figs 3 and 5 with the major streams and associated alluvia e g laidley creek and black duck creek deeply incised into the mrv consequently the natural flow paths within this extensive fractured rock aquifer are commonly intercepted by the surface water system and alluvium the interface between the mrv and the wcm interpreted as a low permeability boundary due to the clay rich weathering profile typical of the top of the wcm is close to the base of the alluvium and streams in these upper reaches fig 5a this suggests that the lateral hydraulic conductivity likely exceeds the vertical conductivity and that lateral discharge from the mrv to the alluvium and streams substantially outweighs downwards percolation from the mrv into the wcm although only limited groundwater level monitoring data are available for the sedimentary bedrock in the western part of the catchment from helidon to toowoomba the presence of a bedrock basement ridge indicates the likely existence of a groundwater divide for these aquifers fig 5b this coincides with a structural feature previously termed helidon ridge smerdon and ransley 2012 proposed as the hydrogeological boundary between the surat and clarence moreton basins although this boundary remains contentious and thus part of the eastern margin of the great artesian basin in this area furthermore in the area near helidon a shallow buried granite herein named helidon granite is intersected in stratigraphic bore gsq ipswich 9 at 304 m below ground surface wells and o brien 1994 fig 1 with the extent of this intrusive body inferred from gravity data dnrm 2002 fig 1 5 2 groundwater hydrochemistry groundwater salinity represented here by the electrical conductivity ec within the sedimentary and volcanic bedrock in the lockyer valley ranges from 100 µs cm to 39 000 µs cm and from 200 µs cm to 32 000 µs cm for the alluvial aquifers following the identification and removal of outliers seven major clusters were identified in the alluvial and bedrock units fig 6 a 5 2 1 aquifer cluster relationship a chi square test was conducted to test for independence between aquifers and clusters to determine whether the cluster attribution of hydrochemical records is linked to aquifers since the p value is less than 0 05 the hypothesis that the aquifer and cluster classifications are independent can be rejected at the 95 0 confidence level this is also demonstrated by the cross tabulation in fig 6a which shows the relationships between aquifers and clusters it demonstrates for example that cluster 1 groundwaters originate primarily from the alluvium gatton sandstone and woogaroo subgroup it also shows that groundwaters assigned to cluster 6 groundwaters with the highest salinities are almost exclusively sourced from the gatton sandstone and the alluvial aquifer the spatial distribution of cluster assignments for bedrock and alluvial aquifers fig 7 is discussed in section 6 5 2 2 major characteristics of clusters the median values for hydrochemical variables of the seven clusters are represented in a piper plot in fig 6b and in table 1 and the spatial distribution of clusters in alluvium and sub alluvial bedrock is presented in fig 7 the ratios of selected ions versus cl for all samples in the bedrock and the alluvium are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the major characteristics of each cluster are cluster 1 this group contains brackish samples median ec of 2600 µs cm table 1 mostly from a small area near helidon fig 7a groundwaters in this cluster are marked by very high hco3 cl ratios fig 6b fig 8e and 9e and they are mostly oversaturated with regards to calcite and dolomite and very low concentrations of ca and mg fig 8b c and 9b c with ratios clearly below the 1 2 m ca hco3 ratio and low but measurable concentrations of so4 and high concentrations of f cluster 2 this cluster contains brackish groundwaters with median ec of 2029 µs cm and a dominance of hco3 over cl fig 8e table 1 and elevated na and mg versus cl ratios relative to local rainfall fig 8c cluster 3 clusters 3 contains fresh groundwater with median ec of approximately 690 µs cm table 1 respectively and a dominance of hco3 over cl fig 8e and 9e na is the dominant cation in cluster 3 groundwaters and for many samples the na cl ratio is above the na cl ratio of local rainfall fig 8a potassium is also elevated relative to local rainfall in many samples fig 8d most cluster 3 groundwater samples follow a 1 2 trend for ca hco3 and mg hco3 ratios and most are under saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite cluster 4 cluster 4 contains fresh groundwater samples median ec of 1039 µs cm with a dominance of hco3 over cl fig 8e and elevated na and mg versus cl ratios relative to local rainfall fig 8c cluster 5 cluster 5 contains the freshest groundwaters median ec of 370 µs cm in the lockyer valley similar to cluster 3 most clusters 5 groundwater samples follow a 1 2 trend for ca hco3 and mg hco3 ratios and most are under saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite cluster 6 cluster 6 includes widespread groundwater samples containing saline groundwater with a median ec of 6800 µs cm table 1 and maxima of up to 35 000 µs cm na cl ratios of these saline groundwaters scatter around the ratios of local rainfall and with increasing salinity there is a progression towards the na cl ratios of local average weighted rainfall fig 8a as also observed for saline groundwaters in many other areas in australia e g edwards and webb 2009 raiber et al 2009 in addition this cluster is characterised by a dominance of cl over hco3 and low potassium concentrations which are strongly depleted relative to local rainfall fig 8d e and 9d e cluster 7 groundwater samples assigned to cluster 7 have similar characteristics as cluster 6 groundwaters however they have slightly lower ec median 4230 µs cm lower so4 and higher ca and mg concentrations 5 3 temporal variability of groundwater chemistry and water levels the hydraulic gradients between alluvial aquifers bedrock aquifers and streams can reverse during different climatic periods for example laidley creek in its deeply incised lower reaches changed from a disconnected creek at the climax of the millennium drought in 2007 to a losing stream recharging the underlying alluvial aquifer in 2009 and into a gaining stream in 2013 raiber et al 2017b cui et al 2018 hydrochemistry can be used as a tool to determine if water level changes represent an actual aquifer recharge event resulting in a change in aquifer storage or a pressure loading we highlight the hydrochemical changes that have occurred throughout the lockyer valley at four sites where long term water level and groundwater chemistry data are available to determine if there is a change in the relative contribution from different recharge sources monitoring site 14320101 distance from creek approximately 600 m eleven complete groundwater chemistry records exist at this site in the alluvium of the lower lockyer creek fig 7b the cluster analysis showed that the variability of groundwater chemistry at this site is overall relatively small as the cluster membership only changed once from cluster 4 to cluster 2 and back to cluster 4 even though there was a relatively large change in water level from 11 to 26 m below ground surface bgs fig 10 a this indicates that despite significant water level fluctuations the principal recharge source or relative contributions from different sources to the alluvium is unlikely to change at this site monitoring site 14320277 distance from creek approximately 200 m the groundwater level at this site in the lower laidley creek sub catchment has fluctuated considerably during the last 40 years varying from about 2 5 to 20 5 m bgs fig 10b during this period there were also considerable changes in groundwater chemistry when the groundwater table was relatively shallow 5 10 m bgs groundwater was generally assigned to clusters 2 or 4 either fresh or slightly brackish the freshest groundwater at this site had ec of 1100 µs cm after significant declines in groundwater levels in the mid to late 1990 s groundwater salinity increased 9000 µs cm with a change to cluster 7 in contrast the reverse occurred under wetter conditions monitoring site 14320313 distance from creek approximately 1000 m groundwater at this site in the sandy creek sub catchment fig 7b is brackish or saline clusters 6 or 7 however the overall range of ec is relatively small 5500 to 7600 µs cm suggesting that there is no major variation in the recharge source monitoring site 14320823 distance from creek approximately 150 m in the lower flagstone creek sub catchment fig 7b groundwater chemistry changed from 1998 to 2015 most groundwater chemistry records were assigned to cluster 6 median of 6870 µs cm during the period of drought a considerable freshening is marked by a change of cluster membership from cluster 6 to cluster 2 with a change in ec from 8000 µs cm to approximately 1400 µs cm fig 10d even though the groundwater level remained relatively shallow data from 2013 confirm an increase in salinity accompanied by a reversal to cluster 6 5 4 surface water chemistry surface water salinity in the lockyer valley measured at low flow conditions during a synoptic sampling survey in 2011 2012 all samples collected at flowing reaches rather than pools and sourced from the dnrm water monitoring portal dnrm 2017 is spatially highly variable and ranges from approximately 200 µs cm to more than 16 000 µs cm figs 11 and 12 the freshest surface waters occur in buaraba creek which drains the woogaroo subgroup fresh surface waters also occur in the headwaters of laidley creek tenthill creek and black duck creek approximately 300 µs cm within or near the footprint of the mrv the water in lockyer creek is relatively fresh throughout although salinity does increase notably where smaller tributaries such as plain creek enter the main creek line fig 11 the flow in lockyer creek is dominated by input from the larger tributaries laidley creek tenthill creek and murphy creek that all originate near the peaks of the great dividing range and source a considerable portion of discharge in their headwaters from the mrv the hydrochemical similarity between groundwaters and surface waters was assessed using discriminant analysis which was conducted to determine into which groundwater chemistry clusters each surface water hydrochemical record would likely be assigned ion ratios of surface waters in the lockyer valley cover a similar range as those of the alluvial fig 9 and bedrock aquifers fig 8 similar to groundwaters the freshest surface waters are characterised by elevated major ion cl ratios as stream salinity increases the ion cl ratios decline and evolve towards ratios similar to or below the ratios of local rainfall the discriminant analysis also suggests that the surface water hydrochemical records are most similar to groundwater chemistry clusters 2 15 of all surface water samples are assigned to this cluster 3 50 4 15 and 5 14 whereas only relatively few samples are assigned to clusters 1 6 and 7 surface water chemistry time series data at three stream gauging station locations reveal considerable variability over time highlighting the complexity of the interactions spatially and temporally at laidley creek in mulgowie figs 11 and 12 located close to the upper part of the catchment and the outcropping mrv the relatively fresh cluster 4 dominates at tenthill creek at tenthill fig 12 which is more representative of the mid catchment there is a more pronounced change of surface water chemistry when compared to upstream with the lower flows having slightly higher salinity cluster 2 with fresher surface waters cluster 4 observed around many of the high flow hydrograph peaks lockyer creek in the lower section at rifles range rd figs 11 and 12 also shows variation in chemistry with many relatively fresh cluster 3 measurements as well as a few occasions where the stream salinity increases as low flow periods extend with some cluster 2 4 and 6 hydrochemical records the available surface water chemistry data highlight the variability in stream chemistry between the different tributaries in trying to use this information to better understand the relationship between streams and underlying aquifers it is important to note that the current dnrm surface water gauging sites primarily monitor flows and surface water quality of lockyer creek and its largest and highest yielding tributaries e g laidley creek tenthill creek and ma ma creek in contrast relatively few historic surface water chemistry records are available for smaller tributaries such as plain creek where the one off surface water quality survey for this study indicated highly saline surface water similar in composition to groundwaters of clusters 6 and 7 6 discussion 6 1 hydrogeological conceptual model of groundwater recharge and aquifer and surface water groundwater interactions 6 1 1 interactions between bedrock aquifers in order to use hydrochemistry to identify areas where bedrock aquifers interact with alluvial aquifers and streams it is important to understand the spatial variability of hydrochemistry and its controls within the bedrock hydrothermal groundwaters have been described near helidon and interpreted as originating from the great artesian basin dempster 1986 and as a possible discharge area for the precipice sandstone equivalent of the woogaroo subgroup from the linked surat basin fig 1 previous analyses of groundwater also revealed the presence of very high 222rn radium and lithium concentrations in the groundwaters at springs near helidon dempster 1986 characteristics commonly associated with groundwaters that have interacted with granites there are several notable geological and hydrogeological features in this area that may influence this distinctive water chemistry firstly as previously mentioned a subsurface granite is present in this area wells and o brien 1994 dnrm 2002 furthermore as suggested by smerdon and ransley 2012 and confirmed by the 3d geological model in the present study a major structural feature the helidon ridge traverses this area local faults and fractures in this area possibly associated with this ridge were also described and proposed as an influence on the spatial extent of the spa waters by dempster 1986 the similar water chemistry in the gatton sandstone and the woogaroo subgroup groundwaters from both aquifers in this area are assigned primarily to cluster 1 fig 7a here indicates that these two aquifers are likely connected locally this distinct water chemistry composition occurring in both the gatton sandstone and woogaroo subgroup here may be influenced by the geological structures in this area or by interaction with the subsurface granite although the mechanism of this proposed connection is not clear it appears that faults and fractures may form gas and water migration pathways possibly linking the subsurface granite the gatton sandstone the woogaroo subgroup and springs observed in this area whether there is a possible hydraulic connection to the surat basin remains an open research question in contrast to the proposed hydraulic connection between the gatton sandstone and the woogaroo subgroup in the helidon area they appear to be largely separated in other parts of the lockyer valley in the eastern part of the lockyer valley near morton vale figs 1 and 3 for instance opposing groundwater flow directions of the gatton sandstone flow towards the north fig 3 and woogaroo subgroup flow towards the south east fig 5a as well as hydrochemical differences suggest a limited connection between these formations fig 7a here groundwater in the woogaroo subgroup is very fresh with many samples assigned to clusters 3 and 5 median electrical conductivity of 690 and 370 µs cm respectively whereas many gatton sandstone groundwater samples are assigned to clusters 6 or 7 limited water rock interaction with the dominant coarse grained quartz rich sandstone and conglomerates explain low salinity values in the woogaroo subgroup these prevalent rock types favour rapid groundwater recharge with limited evapotranspiration the gatton sandstone is also dominated by sandstones but with higher clay and cement contents than the clean quartzose sandstones of the woogaroo subgroup rassam et al 2014 as a result of its more clay rich composition and commonly thick weathering profiles groundwater recharge to the gatton sandstone is likely to be slow favouring evapotranspiration during long retention times in the unsaturated zone in the southern part of the lockyer valley near the great dividing range the lack of nested groundwater monitoring sites in the mrv and the wcm as well as sparse hydrochemical data for the wcm prevent an assessment of the degree of connection between these two units however if there is a hydraulic connection between the mrv the wcm and underlying sedimentary bedrock units in this area then this is unlikely to result in any significant downwards percolation into the units underlying the wcm this is due to the strong contrast in hydrochemistry between the mrv and the koukandowie formation and the gatton sandstone which suggests that these units do not receive substantial recharge through the overlying volcanics instead these sedimentary bedrock units are recharged primarily through diffuse rainfall recharge in their outcrop areas where thick clay rich weathering profiles allow only slow recharge and facilitate high evapotranspiration and interaction with clays during or prior to recharge as observed in studies elsewhere e g bennetts et al 2006 edwards and webb 2009 raiber et al 2015 an exception to this exists at the great dividing range near toowoomba in the western part of the lockyer valley where there are greater similarities between groundwater chemical compositions of the different aquifers 6 1 2 interactions between main range volcanics alluvial aquifers and surface waters the outcrops of the mrv in the lockyer valley are characterised by steep terrains with thin soil profiles and areally extensive outcrops of fresh and unweathered basalt section 2 particularly near the peaks in the southern part of the catchment the high degree of fracturing of the basalts results in high recharge rates and low salinity groundwater in the mrv clusters 3 4 and 5 fig 6 there is a predominance of coarse grained components within the alluvial aquifers of the upper catchment allowing for groundwater to be stored and transmitted rapidly the unconfined nature of alluvial aquifers in the upper catchment of tributary systems such as laidley creek or tenthill creek is comparable to that of fractured basalt aquifer systems elsewhere in the clarence moreton basin e g duvert et al 2015b martinez et al 2015 2017 as well as other basaltic aquifers in australia e g bennetts et al 2006 raiber et al 2015 and overseas e g kebede et al 2005 demlie et al 2007 the fresh groundwaters typically less than 1000 µs cm in the alluvial and volcanic aquifers in the upper catchment are dominated by na hco3 figs 6 8 and 9 and high major ion cl ratios e g mg and ca figs 8 and 9 with excess ions relative to average weighted local precipitation in toowoomba supplied by the dissolution of primary silicate minerals e g plagioclase within the basalts or alluvial sediments composed of basaltic components the 3d geological model showed that laidley creek and tenthill creek including its tributary black duck creek are deeply incised into the mrv fig 5a and intercept the natural groundwater pathways of the volcanic aquifers thus forming groundwater discharge points section 4 1 surface waters here are very fresh figs 11 and 12 dominated by hco3 with high ca and mg concentrations fig 9 and with an overall composition similar to the composition of groundwater in clusters 3 4 and 5 fig 9 this suggests that a large proportion of the initial recharge to the basalts discharges into the alluvium or directly to surface water or springs where no alluvium is developed following short flow paths and with short lag times only a small proportion of this recharge percolates to deeper aquifers as highlighted by the absence of fresh groundwaters in sedimentary bedrock aquifers underneath the mrv in most areas section 5 1 however even after extended periods of no rainfall and thus no recharge groundwater continues to drain from the basalts providing continuous baseflow and sustaining streams notably the influence of the basalts on the hydrochemistry of the alluvial aquifers and surface waters extends beyond its footprint in the laidley creek sub catchment as also described in the neighbouring condamine river catchment by martinez et al 2017 fresh groundwaters with a similar hydrochemical composition as surface waters and basalt groundwaters occur along the entire course of laidley creek to its confluence with lockyer creek fig 7b and 11 these similar compositions highlight the significance of surface water recharge and the influence of the mrv in this catchment 6 1 3 interactions between sedimentary bedrock alluvial aquifers and surface water most of the smaller tributaries are generally not incised into the mrv e g plain creek woolshed creek sandy creek soda spring creek monkey water holes creek and deep gully fig 12 as a result unlike for the headwaters of larger tributaries such as laidley creek or tenthill creek there is little or no influence of the basalts on recharge and the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater and surface water in these smaller tributary systems instead the gatton sandstone and koukandowie formation commonly form the sub alluvial bedrock aquifers in these smaller tributary systems within the lockyer valley smaller tributaries form natural discharge areas for the gatton sandstone and koukandowie formation as indicated by the 3d geological model and potentiometric surface map figs 3 and 5 both gatton sandstone and koukandowie formation contain brackish to saline groundwater assigned to clusters 6 and 7 in these areas and groundwaters within alluvial aquifers of the lower parts of tributary sub catchments or smaller tributaries such as plain creek sandy creek and ma ma creek are also dominated by groundwaters assigned to clusters 6 and 7 fig 7b this hydrochemical similarity with the water chemistry of the alluvial aquifer systems confirms the significance of upwards leakage from the sub alluvial sedimentary bedrock both cluster 6 and cluster 7 have elevated na cl ratios and major ion cl ratios rapidly decrease to values close to or below those in local rainfall fig 9 this suggests that the weathering derived ions observed in groundwaters of other hydrochemical clusters are removed from solution by adsorption on clay mineral surfaces furthermore many of these groundwaters have saturation indices exceeding the threshold where calcite precipitation typically occurs si 0 5 this suggests that calcite or dolomite precipitation has removed some ca mg and hco3 from the groundwater although only represented by relatively few samples from the synoptic surface water quality survey fig 11 and from the dnrm surface water monitoring dnrm 2017 the salinity and hydrochemistry of surface waters here are similar to those of groundwaters confirming the close hydraulic connection between sedimentary bedrock alluvial systems and surface water in these small tributary systems the initial conceptual model based on aquifer geometry and the potentiometric surface of the shallow sedimentary bedrock suggested that flow paths within the sedimentary bedrock are intersected by the alluvial systems near the edge of the alluvial aquifers in the mid to lower reaches of major tributaries this is confirmed by the presence of brackish to saline alluvial groundwater samples of clusters 6 and 7 at the margins of the alluvium throughout different parts of the catchment including within the lockyer creek alluvium and its major tributary systems e g laidley creek fig 7b these patterns are likely to vary spatially and as demonstrated by the example of groundwater monitoring bore 14320277 located in the lower laidley creek sub catchment fig 7b and 10d the relative significance of this discharge component from the underlying sedimentary bedrock at the edge of the alluvium varies over time during prolonged drought periods the relative water level difference head gradient between the alluvial and sedimentary bedrock aquifers can be reversed due to more rapid and pronounced declines in alluvial water levels resulting from a lack of recharge and continuous pumping compared to those of the sedimentary bedrock aquifers raiber et al 2017b cui et al 2018 as a result of the increasing head gradient there is a higher potential for discharge from the sub alluvial bedrock to the alluvium during droughts and a considerable proportion of the alluvial groundwater in these zones may be sourced from the underlying bedrock during drought conditions in many studies it is assumed that there is no or insignificant connection between sedimentary bedrock and alluvial aquifers due to weathering profiles developed on the sedimentary bedrock however the contact between alluvium and sub alluvial bedrock is erosional and the weathering profiles are usually thin or absent near the edge of the alluvium it is therefore likely that the weathering profiles that may have originally developed on the sedimentary bedrock are likely to be compromised or absent in some areas allowing connection between the different aquifers in contrast to the influence of sedimentary bedrock discharge on water quality and balance of the alluvium during dry periods during normal non drought times the sedimentary bedrock discharge component is overwhelmed by other recharge sources e g surface water recharge diffuse rainfall recharge flood recharge or irrigation returns in lockyer creek and its larger tributary systems in the lower part of the plain creek and woolshed sub catchments in the eastern part of the lockyer valley fig 7 groundwater levels within the alluvial aquifer are typically relatively shallow some of the most saline alluvial groundwaters fig 7b and surface waters fig 11 assigned to clusters 6 and 7 occur in these areas this suggests that in addition to discharge from the sub alluvial sedimentary bedrock which here contains saline groundwater there is also likely to be some influence of dryland salinity i e evaporation from shallow water tables in these areas 7 conclusions in most studies where integrated catchment scale hydrological models are developed catchments are commonly represented as simplified and relatively shallow groundwater systems in these models the influence of sub alluvial bedrock on water balance and water quality of alluvial aquifers and streams is often neglected in this study we use the multi aquifer system volcanic sedimentary bedrock and alluvial aquifers of the lockyer valley an important agricultural catchment in the clarence moreton basin in south eastern queensland australia as an example to highlight the variable spatial and temporal significance of discharge from regional scale bedrock aquifers to alluvial aquifers and streams during cycles of drought and flooding for this purpose we have applied multivariate statistical techniques to groundwater and surface water data combined with development of a 3d geological model that represents the geometry of all major volcanic sedimentary bedrock and alluvial aquifer systems in the lockyer valley the study confirmed that the alluvial aquifers are recharged from multiple sources and that the relative contribution from different sources varies spatially the 3d geological model combined with hydraulic data was instrumental in identifying broad areas where alluvial aquifers and streams intercept the natural groundwater pathways of the volcanic and sedimentary bedrock aquifers thus forming groundwater discharge points the hydrochemical assessment confirmed that there is a high degree of variability associated with the geological complexity as most sub catchments within the lockyer valley are characterised by very distinct alluvial groundwater chemistry patterns resulting from mixing of different recharge sources and interactions with sub alluvial bedrock in the headwaters of the lockyer creek and its tributaries for instance the hydrochemistry indicated that there is a very strong influence of the main range volcanics an extensive fractured rock volcanic aquifer system on recharge of the alluvial aquifer and stream flow these systems have fresh alluvial groundwaters and fresh surface water with electrical conductivities typically less than 1000 µs cm and a hydrochemical composition similar to the basalt groundwater further down gradient there is an increasing influence of discharge from sub alluvial sedimentary bedrock aquifers of the clarence moreton basin on alluvial groundwater composition and surface water this influence is particularly evident in smaller tributary systems and at the edge of the alluvial aquifers in larger tributaries where alluvial groundwaters are brackish to saline and compositionally similar to groundwaters in the sub alluvial sedimentary bedrock importantly in addition to the distinct spatial patterns of hydrochemistry there is a strong temporal variability in recharge sources and connectivity as demonstrated at multiple sites where long term groundwater and surface water time series hydrochemical records exist in the larger tributary systems discharge from the sedimentary bedrock to the alluvium or streams is likely to be relatively insignificant during normal climatic periods or following flooding however the influence of discharge from bedrock on quantity and quality of water in shallow alluvial aquifers and streams can become significantly more important during extended dry periods and droughts this influence can have both positive and negative effects for example continuous discharge from the sub alluvial bedrock to streams observed in some areas contributes baseflow which helps to sustain flows and sustain groundwater dependant ecosystems during prolonged dry periods or droughts on the other hand where the water quality of the sedimentary bedrock is very poor e g due to high salinities observed in some of the sedimentary bedrock aquifers within the lockyer valley the relatively higher significance of sedimentary bedrock discharge to the alluvium during droughts can result in a significant deterioration of water quality in the alluvial aquifer systems in some areas making it unusable for most agricultural activities this is because other recharge sources such as surface water or rainfall recharge have ceased during these extended dry periods although all catchments have their own physical characteristics some general lessons and ideas can be transferred from this study to catchments elsewhere firstly the complex spatial and temporal patterns of connections between alluvium and streams likely to be similar in mid reaches of other catchments with dynamic climates dominated by droughts and flooding elsewhere highlights the challenge in defining where groundwater surface water interaction occur and thus whether river reaches are gaining losing or disconnected secondly this study also demonstrates that it should not be automatically assumed that there is no hydraulic connection between sedimentary bedrock and alluvial aquifers and streams as this relationship can be very complex and variable both spatially and temporarily monitoring networks generally sample the subsurface at a limited number of locations and in many catchments in australia and likely elsewhere they are often designed to assess the water quantity i e water levels of the uppermost often alluvial aquifers rather than the hydraulic connection between shallow and deep aquifers they may therefore not capture the hydraulic connection between bedrock and alluvial aquifers although it may sound trivial it is important to reinforce that approaches that integrate multiple lines of geoscientific evidence and honour all available hydrochemical hydraulic lithological and stratigraphic records help to reduce the likelihood of misconceptions or oversimplifications in catchment hydrological and hydrogeological investigations insights gained from such multi disciplinary approaches can support future water resource planning and management through an improved conceptual understanding of the hydrogeology and surface water groundwater interactions as well as through a more robust model structure and framework to apply in groundwater flow and catchment hydrological simulations declaration of interests none acknowledgments this research builds up on

analysis hca is a multivariate statistical technique which is commonly adopted in groundwater hydrochemical studies to identify patterns within a dataset to enhance the understanding of physical and chemical processes that underpin groundwater evolution e g stetzenbach et al 1999 güler et al 2002 menció and mas pla 2008 daughney et al 2010 raiber et al 2012 ideally a large number of variables should be included in hca to capture spatial and temporal processes that control groundwater chemical evolution in the dnrm 2015 groundwater database hydrochemical data exist for a large number of variables including both major and minor ions however in this study only ten variables were selected ca mg na k hco3 cl f so4 ph and electrical conductivity as they were measured across most sites whereas variables such as fe mn and no3 were excluded to their relatively poor spatial coverage prior to the multi variate statistical analysis data quality checks were performed on all hydrochemical records sample records with charge balances outside 5 or where the aquifer at the screened interval was unknown were excluded from further analysis this resulted in a hydrochemical dataset with 3155 complete hydrochemical records i e where all ten selected parameters had a measured value from 1190 groundwater bores many of these groundwater bores were only sampled once although some bores were sampled multiple times the largest number of time series hydrochemical records for a single groundwater bore included in the cluster analysis is 16 in contrast to other studies where the median was used as a representative of time series data from particular groundwater bores e g guggenmos et al 2011 all sampling records that passed the data quality checks were included in this study to evaluate temporal patterns and understand the influence of droughts and flooding on groundwater chemistry all variables except ph were log transformed to approximate a normal distribution before the multivariate statistical analysis was conducted the hca presented in this work was carried out using the statgraphics centurion software manugistics inc usa prior to the clustering the variables were standardized by subtracting its sample mean and then dividing by its sample standard deviation two linkage rules were adopted 1 the nearest neighbour rule was applied to identify sites with significantly different hydrochemical signatures these were removed as outliers residuals from the data set and 2 the ward s rule which allowed the generation of distinct clusters based on analysis of variance this resulted in grouping of all non residuals into separate clusters dissimilarities across all variables were assessed using the square of the euclidean distance e the transformed input data together with linkage rules and the dissimilarity measure are described as the most appropriate techniques for identifying patterns in hydrochemical data sets güler et al 2002 daughney et al 2012 raiber et al 2012 the outcome of this process is a dendrogram cloutier et al 2008 fig a1 hca is considered a semi objective technique as it involves an element of judgment when determining the number of clusters that are representative of the sample population e g daughney et al 2012 in this study the dendrogram was visually inspected and centroid concentrations represented by the median for different input variables and clusters at different separation thresholds fig a1 and the spatial distribution of clusters were compared to decide on an appropriate separation threshold or phenon line which determines the number of clusters güler et al 2002 cloutier et al 2008 daughney et al 2012 raiber et al 2012 the median was used for the comparison as it is considered as a better indicator of central tendency than the mean as the median is less sensitive to extreme values helsel and hirsch 2012 surface water data were not integrated into the hca as there are a very large number of measurements available at some sites up to 170 hydrochemical time series records at a single monitoring station using all of these data could potentially skew the dataset but there are different ways of dealing with such extensive time series data for example the median of all time series data can be included to represent surface water monitoring datasets e g martinez et al 2015 in the present study however we have conducted a discriminant analysis da for this purpose this approach provides insights into the similarity between groundwaters and surface waters without skewing the groundwater chemistry dataset and it also allows assessment of temporal variabilities within the surface water time series data da is a multivariate statistical technique that predicts into which of two or more categories an observation is most likely to fall based on a set of classification functions and a certain combination of input variables e g daughney et al 2010 raiber et al 2012 the discriminant analysis is designed to develop a set of discriminating functions which can help predict the cluster membership of the surface water chemistry records based on the values of other quantitative variables all complete groundwater chemistry cases n 3155 were used to develop a model to discriminate among the seven clusters from the hca ten predictor variables the hydrochemical parameters listed above were entered and the derived six discriminating functions with p values less than 0 05 are statistically significant at the 95 0 confidence level amongst the 3155 observations the groundwater chemistry records used to fit the model 2643 84 were correctly classified surface water chemistry cluster memberships were then predicted as new observations to assess their similarity with groundwater chemistry records and predict to which groundwater chemistry cluster they would be most likely assigned 
6783,to make an overall assessment of the groundwater quality in seoul city we used the self organizing map som technique in combination with fuzzy c means fcm clustering som visualizes complicate and multidimensional data structures on a 2d surface while the fcm algorithm creates overlapping cluster boundaries among samples that are continuously distributed over a data space the combination of som and fcm clustering was expected to help characterize highly complicated urban groundwater quality as a result the som characterized 343 groundwater samples using 91 neurons which were further classified by fcm clustering into three water groups group 1 addressed the least polluted groundwater 17 of the samples n 58 average tds 194 5 mg l and no3 6 9 mg l and occurred in the peripheral areas whose land cover is mainly occupied by forests increasing ph with increasing sodium and bicarbonate concentrations indicated that the hydrogeochemistry of group 1 was largely controlled by water rock interactions group 2 included the highly polluted groundwater 24 of the samples n 82 average tds 326 2 mg l and no3 42 6 mg l and sporadically occurred in seoul with no distinct spatial control this group seemed to be affected by sewage from broken sewer pipes which are a primary pollution source of seoul groundwater and are ubiquitously distributed beneath the city group 3 water also represented the highly contaminated groundwater 30 of the samples n 103 average tds 527 1 mg l but contained low nitrate concentrations average no3 13 1 mg l based on their spatial locations intensive groundwater pumping from subway tunnels and other underground spaces at the city center seemed to drive the induced flow of organic contaminants resulting in local reducing conditions sufficient for denitrification the remaining 100 samples 29 of the samples shared the hydrogeochemical properties of two or three groups this study successfully characterized the spatial pattern of urban groundwater quality that is complicated by various contamination sources and hydrogeochemical processes the combined use of som and fcm clustering was proven as a powerful tool to interpret nonlinear and highly heterogeneous environmental data for which it is difficult to define cluster boundaries taken together our results contribute to a better management of urban groundwater in metropolitan cities under high risks of anthropogenic contamination keywords urban groundwater hydrogeochemistry and quality self organizing map som fuzzy c means fcm clustering urban water management 1 introduction surface water is highly vulnerable to environmental disturbances in the anthropocene such as urbanization and climate change delpla et al 2009 and references therein pires et al 2015 wang et al 2008 whitehead et al 2009 and references therein thus national state and metropolitan governments e g seoul have recognized the importance of groundwater as a supplementary and or alternative water resource and have made efforts to properly manage aquifers lee et al 2018 mcgrane 2016 morris et al 2001 takizawa 2008 and references therein in order to establish suitable management plans for groundwater resources regional investigation of aquifer conditions should be performed loaiciga et al 1992 a detailed examination of groundwater chemistry and its spatial variation can provide comprehensive information on the aquifer heterogeneity and connectivity as well as on the principal mechanisms controlling groundwater flow and water quality güler et al 2002 singh et al 2017 besides such knowledges about the groundwater quality and its spatial variation is vital in terms of developing a conceptual model that would adequately describe the groundwater system the model would also make it possible to properly design a groundwater quality monitoring network loaiciga et al 1992 and to establish water quality management strategies with considering regional characteristics jang et al 2016 liang et al 2016 liang et al 2018 meanwhile a representative and reliable estimation of regional groundwater chemistry requires multiple samplings from sufficient sites which naturally yields large datasets therefore multivariate analysis techniques e g dimensionality reduction clustering and supervised unsupervised learning are frequently used to facilitate the interpretation of complicated water chemistry data among the various multivariate analysis techniques factor analysis fa liu et al 2003 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 and principal component analysis pca cloutier et al 2008 helena et al 2000 hildenbrand et al 2016 mcneil et al 2005 monjerezi et al 2011 are the most widely used dimensionality reduction techniques in water quality studies these methods extract a small number of factors capturing major patterns of complicated multivariate data with minimizing the loss of information and visualize the result into a low dimensional mainly 2d or 3d space for instance hu et al 2013 identified the major factors affecting high fluorine concentrations in groundwater in shanxi and inner mongolia using pca and found that fluorine in inner mongolia showed less correlations with other geochemical factors than that in shanxi because multiple factors such as agricultural industrial activities and mineral dissolution influenced the groundwater chemistry in inner mongolia however fa and pca are linear approaches that can lead to an erroneous interpretation when dealing with environmental data with nonlinear relationships between variables astel et al 2007 giraudel and lek 2001 lischeid 2009 besides fa and pca can only show whether the correlations between variables are positive or negative and whether the degrees of correlations are strong or weak in a 2d space in the present study seeking to overcome the weakness of the linear dimensionality reduction techniques we applied self organizing map som on our water quality dataset som is a powerful nonlinear projection tool that visualizes complex high dimensional data structures onto a 2d surface and at the same time organizes input data into a smaller number of neurons kohonen 1982 furthermore som can reveal local relationships among variables while fa and pca only show global and linear relationships between variables hong and rosen 2001 choi et al 2014 assessed the korean groundwater monitoring network data using som and compared with pca results and concluded that pca is unsuitable to classify the widely dispersed data however in most som cases the number of output neurons is more than the expected number of groups kiang 2001 therefore to derive an appropriate number of groups and to facilitate quantitative analysis of the map previous researches added clustering steps on the som results such as hierarchical clustering analysis hca choi et al 2014 dopazo 2002 herrero and dopazo 2002 sánchez martos et al 2002 k means clustering analysis garcı a and gonzález 2004 nguyen et al 2015 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 wu and chow 2004 and contiguity constrained clustering kiang 2001 murtagh 1995 for instance nguyen et al 2015 identified the spatio seasonal variations of the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in red river delta rrd in vietnam using som in combination with hca similarly choi et al 2014 used som with hca to assess the groundwater chemistry in south korea on a national scale and found the best cluster number of six to explain the bedrock groundwater chemistry of the southern korean peninsula these clustering methods however assume well defined group boundaries although environmental data show rather gradual changes between groups these changes almost never belong exclusively to one of the groups equihua 1990 güler et al 2012 güler and thyne 2004 vriend et al 1988 in the present study the som neurons were grouped by the fuzzy c means fcm clustering algorithm the fcm algorithm can cope with the uncertainty derived from the heterogeneous nature of environmental data by assuming that each sample belongs to all groups with some degrees of membership u bezdek et al 1984 frapporti et al 1993 applied the fcm clustering on the dutch national groundwater quality monitoring network data and obtained several overlapping clusters which showed spatially distinguishable patterns güler and thyne 2004 used the fcm clustering to identify the physicochemical processes controlling the water quality variations in southeastern california groundwater and gained spatial distributions of different water chemistry groups by mapping fuzzy membership values u of water groups using the kriging method as we have seen in the aforementioned references either the som or fcm algorithm was successfully applied for interpreting large and complex water quality data however the combination of the two methods has not been conducted the combined use of these two methods is expected to provide a straightforward way to characterize highly complicated water quality data with complementing each other s disadvantages the fcm algorithm is soft clustering that can deal with the gradual nature of environmental data while it requires additional interpretation to characterize each group on the other hand som helps to grasp the nonlinear relationship between variables through visualization but is unsuitable for clustering purposes the present study combined the som with the fcm algorithm to identify the water quality groups of seoul groundwater and to explain governing hydrogeochemical processes of each group these purposes were achieved by 1 assigning the groundwater quality data n 343 of seoul to neurons using som section 3 2 1 2 grouping the neurons using the fcm clustering algorithm section 3 2 2 and 3 examining the physicochemical properties of each group to verify the groups identified by som and fcm section 4 the spatial distribution of groundwater quality groups was also examined by displaying spatial patterns of membership values u of each group on the map to provide a useful insight into the hydrogeochemical and quality characteristics of groundwater section 3 2 3 the chemical properties of groundwater samples which did not exclusively belong to groups were also briefly described in section 4 4 the results of the present study are expected to contribute to establishing a better management policy of urban groundwater and to constructing a reasonable and efficient groundwater quality monitoring network 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area seoul metropolitan city seoul the capital of south korea is one of the most heavily populated cities in the world with the population of 10 4 million about 20 of the total population of the country inhabiting the area of 605 3 km2 about 0 6 of the country s total land area smg seoul metropolitan government 2016 and is located at the mid western part of the korean peninsula fig 1 a the average annual temperature is about 12 5 c and the annual average precipitation is 1450 mm kma korea meteorogical administration 2011 the geology of seoul consists of precambrian gneisses as basement rocks jurassic granitoid intrusions and an overlying thin alluvium or soil 3 16 m of the quaternary age near the han river fig 1b kim and lee 2003 yun et al 2007 the bedrock generally dips to the southeast and the two main joint sets dip 10 sw and 30 ne with a northwest strike kim et al 2001 seoul is located in a gently undulating terrain surrounded by mountains approximately 340 840 m a s l see fig 1c the area is hydrologically divided into two parts by the ew trending han river the biotope map published by seoul development institute sdi seoul development institute 2010 classified the land use of seoul into residential commercial and business areas 38 2 forest and open space 30 9 transportation facilities 10 9 river stream or wetland 8 1 public facilities 5 4 and factories 1 0 fig 1d about a half of the land surface 48 is covered with impermeable pavement which significantly reduces the infiltration of rainfall sdi seoul development institute 2010 according to kim et al 2001 only about 3 of annual groundwater recharge originates from rainfall infiltration while leakages from broken municipal water supply networks contribute over 90 of annual total recharge aquifers of seoul consist of two main types shallow alluvial aquifers and deep fractured rock aquifers alluvium 20 m thick is distributed along the han river and its tributaries and is mainly composed of sand and silt fractured bedrock aquifers consisting of granite gneiss and schist have the hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1 0 10 5 to 7 4 10 3 cm s smg seoul metropolitan government 1996 groundwater levels generally follow the topography thus groundwater largely flows from mountainous areas towards the han river fig 1e the average depth to groundwater table is about 1 2 m from the land surface for alluvium aquifers near the han river and its tributaries and 15 16 m for fractured bedrock aquifers gims national groundwater information center 2016 a significant drawdown in groundwater depth is observed locally in the central part of the city where heavy pumping of groundwater occurs in subway tunnels fig 1f joo et al 2009 kim et al 2001 2 2 sampling and analytical procedures groundwater level measurements and groundwater sampling campaigns were performed during the unique comprehensive hydrochemical survey between october 2003 and february 2004 in seoul using 506 preexisting wells the in situ measurements of ph eh do ec and alkalinity were performed by portable meters and electrodes alkalinity as hco3 was measured by acid titration with 0 05 n hno3 for the chemical analysis groundwater samples were filtered using 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate filters and collected in 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles groundwater samples for the analysis of major cations and minor metals especially fe and mn were acidified to ph 2 with several drops of ultrapure nitric acid apha et al 2001 all samples were stored in ice boxes at 4 c until laboratory analysis the chemical analysis was performed at the center for mineral resources research cmr of korea university within a few days after the sample collection concentrations of major cations na k ca mg minor metals fe mn and sio2 were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy model 3000xl perkin elmer anions cl no3 and so4 concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography model 120 dionex in order to verify the accuracy and precision of measurements qa qc quality assurance quality control procedures were made by analyzing blanks and duplicate samples the detection limits for every major ion were summarized in table s1 in supplementary information 2 3 self organizing map and fuzzy c means clustering algorithms 2 3 1 data preparation a total of 343 groundwater samples which were analyzed for all 13 physicochemical variables ph eh do ec na k ca mg cl no3 so4 hco3 and sio2 and whose charge balance error was below 10 were used for the som and fcm clustering interpretations the data of fe and mn concentrations were excluded from som and fcm clustering as only a few observations n 169 and n 168 respectively were available but used for interpreting water groups in section 4 all parameters with the exception of ph were log transformed to reduce the effects of outliers to equalize the importance of all variables the log transformed data were then standardized to zero mean and unit variance these procedures are indispensable because som is strongly affected by variables having a larger scale which may result in a significant misleading of water quality data kiang 2001 2 3 2 self organizing map som som is an artificial neural network model designed for the two main purposes kohonen 1982 nonlinear dimensionality reduction and unsupervised classification the som projects high dimensional input data onto low dimensional usually 2d output surfaces composed of an array of ordered units called neurons the proper number of neurons can be selected using a heuristic rule e g 5 n suggested by vesanto et al 2000 where n is the number of samples each neuron i is fully connected with all input samples and these linkages are represented by p dimensional weight vectors w i wi 1 wi 2 wip t where p is the dimensionality of the input space p 13 in this study including ph and ec neurons are also interconnected with the adjacent ones by a neighborhood relation the som algorithm performs an iterative procedure called learning that organizes neurons according to their similarities with preserving the inherent topological characteristics of the dataset thus som is a powerful visualization technique that provides an intuitive grasp of the data structure especially for large and complex data kalteh et al 2008 the learning algorithm of som consists of the following steps 1 initializing weight vectors with small random values 2 calculating and comparing the euclidean distances between each input sample x i e 343 groundwater samples in this study and all neurons 3 finding the best matching unit bmu b that is the neuron closest to the input sample x 1 x w b min i x w i and 4 updating the bmu and its neighbor neurons towards the input sample the weight vector w i at each time step t 1 are calculated as follows 2 w i t 1 w i t α t h bi t x w i t where α t is a learning rate and hbi t is a neighborhood kernel function of the neuron i for its bmu b and indicates the radius that the bmu can influence α t hbi t called gain term varies between 0 and 1 and monotonically decreases with time so the weight vector approaches the nearest sample value as the learning progresses in particular as the time step t increases hbi t gradually decreases so that the nearer neurons of the bmu are updated to have stronger connections with it as a result the neighboring neurons of the bmu are pulled closer to the bmu than to other neurons and show greater similarities with the bmu in the output space see a conceptual diagram in fig s1 of supplementary information following the completion of learning each input sample x is assigned to its closest output neuron or bmu b samples with similar properties are assigned to the same bmu b which is regarded as a center for clustering in som günter and bunke 2002 the detailed mathematical explanation of som is well documented elsewhere garcı a and gonzález 2004 hong and rosen 2001 kiang 2001 kohonen 1982 in this study the som toolbox in matlab version 2 0 vesanto et al 2000 was applied to calculate and visualize the som 2 3 3 fuzzy c means clustering fcm the fcm clustering is one of the most widely used soft clustering algorithms that partition a dataset x x 1 x 2 x n into c 2 3 n 1 fuzzy groups that are identified by their cluster centers v j j 1 2 c where n is the number of samples n 343 in this study bezdek et al 1984 unlike hard clustering methods such as hca and k means cluster analysis the fcm clustering creates overlapping cluster boundaries and makes samples be allocated to all groups with the degree of memberships u ranging between 0 and 1 the fcm algorithm may be the most suitable clustering technique for groundwater quality data since the physicochemical properties of groundwater show a gradual change in time and space due to mixing diffusion dispersion and other physicochemical reactions rather than a distinct change frapporti et al 1993 güler et al 2002 the fcm clustering uses an iterative optimization process to minimize the following objective function j which is the weighted sum of errors within groups 3 j m c j 1 c k 1 n u jk m x k v j 2 under the following constraint 4 j 1 c u jk 1 where m is the membership matrix c is the cluster center matrix c is the number of clusters m is a fuzzy exponent and ujk is the membership degree of data point k in cluster j if a sample x k becomes far from the cluster center v j the membership degree ujk approaches 0 to minimize j on the other hand if the sample x k becomes close to the cluster center v j the membership degree ujk approaches 1 höppner 2002 the fuzzy exponent m 1 controls the degree of fuzziness or the amount of clusters overlap as m converges to 1 the partitions get crisper while the partitions get fuzzier as m converges to infinity in the fcm algorithm the number of clusters c has to be determined before running the partitioning regardless of whether or not the dataset is actually divided into c classes several researchers established criteria called validity indexes which help to find an optimal number of clusters bezdek and pal 1998 kothari and pitts 1999 trauwaert et al 1991 in the present study we used two validity functions roubens 1982 fuzziness performance index fpi and normalized classification entropy nce each validation function is expressed by the following equations 5 fpi 1 cf 1 c 1 where f 1 n j 1 c k 1 n u jk 2 6 nce h log c where h 1 n j 1 c k 1 n u jk log u jk fpi and nce measure the degree of fuzziness and the amount of disorganization in a specific number of clusters respectively both indices range between 0 and 1 and are minimized in the optimum number of clusters in this study the fcm algorithm was performed using fuzme version 3 0 in matlab minasny and mcbratney 2002 after grouping som neurons instead of input samples into clusters section 3 2 2 the membership values of each neuron in each cluster were assigned to the corresponding sample coordinates to illustrate the spatial distribution of the clusters of groundwater in seoul note that groundwater samples in the same neuron shared a same membership value the ordinary kriging was conducted with surfer 12 golden software inc 2014 to display the spatial pattern of the membership values on the map besides to verify the group to group differences in physicochemical parameters the mann whitney u test was conducted for the weight vector values of the som neurons if the calculated p value was below the significance level of 0 05 the tested two groups were assumed to be significantly different from each other 3 results 3 1 general hydrochemistry table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of 16 physicochemical variables of urban groundwater n 343 in seoul electrical conductivity ec a useful in situ indicator of total dissolved solids tds hem 1985 widely ranged from 96 to 1638 μs cm indicating that the quality of seoul groundwater was influenced by various hydrogeochemical processes such as mineral dissolution and or anthropogenic pollution tds values showed a good linear correlation with ec values slope 0 72 and r2 0 89 data not shown suggesting that the measurements were reliable and the solute concentrations of groundwater were mainly controlled by major ions hounslow 1995 major ion compositions of seoul groundwater were dominated by calcium mean 59 3 mg l and standard deviation sd 32 4 mg l among cations and bicarbonate mean 143 6 mg l and sd 86 4 mg l among anions table 1 therefore the ca hco3 type characterized the general hydrogeochemical composition of seoul groundwater the piper diagram displayed two evolutionary trends towards either na hco3 or ca so4 cl no3 type from ca hco3 type fig 2 the redox potential eh and dissolved oxygen do levels ranged from 94 6 to 894 1 mv and from 0 87 to 16 71 mg l respectively the high mean values of eh and do 438 7 mv and 4 86 mg l respectively with the small standard deviations 127 8 mv and 2 47 mg l respectively suggest that the aquifer of seoul was generally under aerobic conditions however it should be noted that the eh measurements are impractical for an adequate description of the redox equilibrium of groundwater linberg and runnels 1984 stumm and morgan 1996 actual redox conditions can be deduced by examining the concentrations of redox sensitive species chapelle et al 1995 including fe mn no3 and so4 dissolved fe and mn ranged from 0 005 to 29 501 mg l median 0 008 mg l and from 0 005 to 4 025 mg l median 0 003 mg l respectively showing very large variances coefficient of variation cv 494 27 and 276 85 six 1 75 and three 0 87 samples exceeded the korean drinking water standards both 0 30 mg l for dissolved fe and mn respectively in addition other redox indicators such as no3 and so4 also showed large cv values 112 56 and 94 72 respectively this confirms that seoul groundwater was under varying degrees of redox conditions nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 128 1 mg l and had the average of 24 1 mg l with a large standard deviation sd 27 1 mg l table 1 about 18 1 n 62 of the total samples exceeded the korean drinking water standard 44 3 mg l the large variance of nitrate concentrations in seoul groundwater indicates the ubiquitous occurrence of various sources and sinks of nitrate in fact diverse sources of high nitrate concentrations have been reported in the urban groundwater such as leakages from sewers septic tanks landfills storm water and industrial spillages ford and tellam 1994 navarro and carbonell 2007 nolan et al 1997 wakida and lerner 2005 zhang et al 2015 significant correlations p 0 05 appeared between nitrate and other redox sensitive constituents do 0 26 so4 0 15 fe 0 26 and mn 0 37 here numbers in parenthesis denote the spearman s rho these relationships indicate that redox processes were to some degree involved in controlling nitrate concentrations in seoul groundwater 3 2 som and fcm clustering results 3 2 1 som results by applying the som technique to the log transformed and standardized groundwater quality dataset n 343 91 output neurons were obtained here 91 was selected based on the heuristic equation of vesanto et al 2000 the neurons are displayed on a 13 7 rectangular grid with 91 hexagons in fig 3 following vesanto 1999 the som results can be represented by two kinds of maps component planes fig 3a and median distance matrix d matrix fig 3b the component planes show the weight vector values of each neuron using color codes blue and red correspond to low and high values respectively thus the comparison of the patterns of component planes allows for an instant recognition of the mutual dependencies among variables for example parallel gradients between variables in component planes indicate that there is a positive correlation between them on the other hand the median d matrix presents the median euclidean distance between neighboring neurons in the color scale therefore we can see the relative distances between neurons on the entire map neurons with low distances i e high similarities shown in blue can be regarded as a cluster while neurons with high distances i e low similarities shown in red can be regarded as cluster boundaries in the component planes fig 3a four features are noticeable first na k ca mg cl and so4 showed similar patterns to ec their weight vector values increased towards the bottom of the component planes second unlike other major constituents no3 and hco3 showed the horizontal increased from the left to the right and diagonal gradient increased from the upper left to the lower right in colors respectively indicating that the amounts of these ions are controlled by different hydrogeochemical processes e g the redox reaction from those controlling the major constituents third eh and do values showed more complicated color distributions than the other components while their patterns were similar to each other with decreasing from the upper left to the lower right this was probably because the redox potential of groundwater was strongly dependent on do and the heterogenous redox environment caused a local variability heterogeneity of eh and do in the aquifer fourth the concentration of sio2 showed a reverse gradient with ph concomitantly with the ph decrease the weight vector values of sio2 increased from the upper right to the lower left part this was possibly because a lowered ph enhanced the weathering of silicate minerals in the aquifer these features appeared in som were discussed in detail in section 4 after dividing neurons by fcm clustering on the other hand in the present study cluster structures of the data were difficult to be recognized on the d matrix fig 3b in particular the neurons in the upper part showed a great dissimilarity to each other and therefore the boundaries between clusters were indistinguishable by visual inspection this may suggest that as compared to the neurons in the lower part the water quality of the neurons in the upper part was affected by diverse factors besides it should be noted that the data of groundwater samples were continuously distributed on the piper diagram rather than forming discrete clusters fig 2 this continuity means that groundwater quality of seoul was largely affected by mixing processes therefore we applied the fcm algorithm on the som neurons to reveal the underlying cluster structures with taking into account the complexity of the urban groundwater quality data 3 2 2 fcm clustering results in order to find the optimal number of clusters c and the fuzzy exponent value m two validation indices i e fpi and nce were calculated roubens 1982 table 2 the number of clusters was tested from 2 to 10 while the fuzzy exponent varied from 1 1 to 2 0 theoretically the optimal number of clusters is determined with minimizing both fpi eq 5 and nce eq 6 however these two indices did not suggest a clear criterion for choosing the number of groups they showed the lowest values when c 2 and the highest values when c 3 and then decreased with the increase of c table 2 when c 2 neurons were divided into the upper and lower parts and the weight vector values of neurons in each group showed a large variation see fig s2a in supplementary information which indicates that the hydrochemical properties of neurons belonging in a same group were heterogeneous and should be further divided on the other hand decreases in fpi and nce values with the increase of c when c 3 were probably because the neurons in the upper part were distant from each other fig 3b and thus each neuron was identified as an individual cluster for instance when the neurons were divided into four clusters the result was not meaningful because only the neurons in the upper part of the map group 1 in this study were divided into two sub clusters see fig s2b in supplementary information therefore we classified the neurons into three groups although both fpi and nce showed the highest values when c 3 table 2 besides the results of hca data not shown supported that the neurons were composed of three groups the three groups were verified in section 4 the fuzzy exponent value was fixed to 1 5 which resulted in an appropriate degree of fuzziness fpi 0 336 and nce 0 336 when c 3 neither too fuzzy nor too hard to clearly separate clusters and achieve high intra cluster similarity only the neurons having the membership values u above 0 75 were regarded as belonging to a certain cluster see fig 3c the neurons with the membership values below 0 75 for any of three clusters n 25 were assumed to have overlapping hydrogeochemical properties of two or three groups the cluster boundaries found in fig 3c were applied to all figures in fig 3 the three fcm derived clusters showed significant differences from each other in most of the variables except for do and hco3 between groups 1 and 2 sio2 between groups 2 and 3 and eh and do between groups 1 and 3 table 3 3 2 3 three groups the application of the fcm clustering to the som neurons n 91 yielded three hydrogeochemical groups one non contaminated group 1 and two contaminated groups groups 2 and 3 the statistical summary of physicochemical variables for the three groundwater groups is shown in table s2 see supplementary information it should be noted that only the neurons with u 0 75 for a certain cluster n 66 243 samples were classified see fig 3c the number of such neurons was 19 at the upper part of som 58 samples 17 20 at the bottom left part of som 82 samples 24 and 27 at the bottom right part of som 103 samples 30 for groups 1 2 and 3 respectively the spatial distribution of these three groups in seoul was shown in fig 4 the remaining 25 neurons 100 samples did not belong to any group and were considered to be mixtures of two or three groups the hydrogeochemical features and the governing processes of the three fcm determined clusters were discussed in the following section to verify the three groups identified by som and fcm 4 discussion the evolutionary trends in the piper diagram fig 2 indicate two major factors affecting the quality of groundwater in seoul first the na hco3 type represents the natural groundwater quality that is mainly affected by water rock interactions such as silicate weathering mainly plagioclase hydrolysis and cation exchange chae et al 2006 edmunds and shand 2008 gascoyne and kamineni 1994 toran and saunders 1999 on the other hand the compositional change from the ca hco3 to the ca so4 cl no3 type indicates the influence of anthropogenic pollution given that chloride sulfate and nitrate are typical inorganic pollutants mostly derived from human activities such as industrial or municipal sewages in cities barrett et al 1999 dragon 2008 mcgrane 2016 venkatesan and swaminathan 2009 zahn and grimm 1993 however the cooperative use of som and fcm clustering revealed three groups it was probably because the piper diagram considered the composition ratios of major ions only while som and fcm clustering included ph redox parameters i e eh and do and ec indicating the absolute content of major ion concentrations three groundwater groups were identified in seoul as follows 1 group 1 groundwater largely controlled by natural processes i e water rock interaction 2 group 2 nitrate contaminated groundwater and 3 group 3 highly contaminated groundwater with low nitrate concentrations fig 5 schematically summaries the hydrogeochemical characteristics and the relevant processes of each group 4 1 group 1 non or least contaminated groundwater group 1 was characterized by the highest average ph mean 7 37 and the lowest average ec and tds values mean ec 217 1 μs cm and mean tds 194 5 mg l among the three groundwater groups see table s2 the nitrate levels were low mean no3 6 87 mg l spatially groundwater of group 1 mainly occurred in the northern and southern parts that remote from the city center fig 4a and forest dominates the land cover therefore as reflected by the low concentrations of most dissolved constituents group 1 groundwater was devoid of anthropogenic contamination ec ph and the concentrations of na and hco3 in group 1 showed significant positive correlations p 0 05 with each other see table s3 in supplementary information these relationships were also observed in the component planes fig 3a where the weight vector values of ec ph na and hco3 increased from the left to the right within the group 1 field the enrichments of na and hco3 with the increases of ec and ph indicate that the hydrochemistry of group 1 water was mainly controlled by water rock interactions including dissolution of na silicates e g plagioclase and cation exchange banks and frengstad 2006 chae et al 2006 edmunds and shand 2008 gascoyne and kamineni 1994 do showed the opposite trend against ph ec and the concentrations of na and hco3 in the component planes fig 3a yielding significant negative correlations p 0 05 with them see table s3 in supplementary information in general the longer residence time of groundwater in aquifer the lower the redox levels due to the oxygen consuming bacterial reactions and the greater the extent of water rock interactions drever 1988 therefore the low do levels with the high ph ec na and hco3 concentrations were possibly due to the prolonged hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater via the water rock interaction however dissolved silica sio2 which is also used to indicate the degree of silicate dissolution and the length of residence time showed a complicated pattern in fig 3a in the component planes the no3 concentration of group 1 groundwater showed the reverse gradients with ph na and hco3 but the parallel gradient with the do level this means that several group 1 groundwater samples with relatively shorter residence times i e higher do and lower ph ec na sio2 and hco3 concentrations may have been slightly affected by anthropogenic pollutants such as no3 in summary as compared to other groups groundwater of group 1 showed a good water quality and thus represented the non or less influenced groundwater by anthropogenic activities thus the observed concentration levels of major ions in group 1 can be effectively used as natural backgrounds for groundwater management in seoul 4 2 group 2 no3 contaminated groundwater group 2 showed the lowest mean ph 6 57 and the highest mean no3 concentration 42 6 mg l see table s2 in supplementary information the concentrations of dissolved constituents were relatively high mean tds 326 2 mg l and ec 403 4 μs cm the average concentrations of major ions fell between those of groups 1 and 3 except for nitrate the mean no3 concentration of group 2 42 6 mg l was very high approaching the korean drinking water standard 44 3 mg l previous studies also addressed the nitrate contamination of groundwater in seoul choi et al 2005 hosono et al 2009 lee et al 2003 urban aquifers are exposed to various nitrogen sources such as leakage from sewer pipes or septic tanks landfill leachates industrial effluents and storm water eiswirth and hötzl 1997 lerner 2003 lerner et al 1999 wakida and lerner 2005 in particular sewage infiltrations through leaking sewers and septic tanks are likely to result in great nitrogen loads on urban groundwater lerner 2003 lerner et al 1999 tellam et al 2006 won et al 2004 the ministry of environment of korea me ministry of environment 2014 reported that about half of the sewer pipes were constructed 30 years ago in seoul thus high nitrate concentrations in group 2 groundwater possibly originated from wastewater leaked through damaged or misconnected sewer pipes in the component plane the concentration of no3 increased from the right to the left while the ph and hco3 decreased within the group boundary fig 3a indeed the ph and hco3 concentrations showed significant negative correlations p 0 05 with no3 see table s3 in supplementary information probably because hco3 was consumed in buffering reactions with acid produced during nitrification belser 1984 groundwater of group 2 was sporadically distributed on the map fig 4b it appears that there was no clear spatial pattern similarly lee et al 2003 found a weak spatial relationship between the land use and the nitrate concentration in groundwater of seoul this suggests that diverse sources of nitrate were sporadically and heterogeneously distributed in seoul in summary group 2 represented nitrate contaminated groundwater that typically occurs beneath the urban city eiswirth and hötzl 1997 foster 1990 lerner and barrett 1996 lerner et al 1999 mcgrane 2016 wakida and lerner 2002 2006 4 3 group 3 highly contaminated groundwater with low no3 levels group 3 represented the most severely contaminated groundwater in seoul as indicated by both the highest mean tds and ec values mean tds 527 1 mg l and mean ec 644 9 μs cm and the high concentrations of major ions about 1 5 2 times higher than those of group 2 except for nitrate see table s2 in supplementary information in addition group 3 showed the lowest mean eh and do values mean eh 411 4 mv and do 4 15 mg l with the highest mean concentrations of dissolved fe and mn mean fe 1 14 mg l and mn 0 45 mg l the most obvious difference between the two contaminated groups 2 and 3 was the concentration of no3 the nitrate in groundwater of group 3 showed the low mean concentration 13 1 mg l with the large cv of 126 5 while the nitrate concentration of group 2 had the high mean 42 6 mg l with the small cv of 62 4 the high cv reflects that the concentration of nitrate was controlled by various sources and or sink processes kim et al 2014 as mentioned in section 3 1 despite the absence of direct denitrification evidence e g n and o isotopic data we consider that denitrification likely occurred in group 3 groundwater based on the following three reasons first in the component planes the concentration of no3 decreased with the increases of ph and hco3 within the group 3 field fig 3a the no3 concentration of group 3 groundwater showed a significant negative correlation p 0 05 with the concentration of hco3 see table s3 in supplementary information denitrification using organic carbon as the electron donor accompanies the production of co2 that increases the concentration of hco3 and ph in groundwater rivett et al 2008 trudell et al 1986 a strong candidate for organic carbon sources in urban groundwater can be the septic sewage water released from broken sewer pipes macquarrie and sudicky 2001 mcgrane 2016 robertson et al 1991 wilhelm et al 1994 the high sd of no3 and hco3 concentrations in group 3 see table s1 implied that the magnitude of denitrification varied across group 3 second the cl concentration levels of group 3 groundwater were high mean 62 8 mg l and had a significant positive correlation p 0 05 with the no3 concentration see table s3 in supplementary information as mentioned above nitrate in urban groundwater mostly originates from sewer leakage that also contains high levels of chloride eiswirth and hötzl 1997 in addition due to geological characteristics chloride in groundwater cannot be derived from natural origins via the water rock interaction e g halite dissolution in case of seoul thus we consider that no3 in groundwater of group 3 originated from septic sewage and was further locally influenced by varying degrees of denitrification third group 3 groundwater had the highest concentrations of dissolved fe and mn which are also redox sensitive compounds group 3 groundwater was mostly found in the center of seoul and around the tributaries of the han river where the groundwater table was significantly lowered due to excessive groundwater pumping see figs 1e and 4c the decline of groundwater levels was also remarkable along the subway lines as a large amount of groundwater was continuously pumped out to keep the water levels below the subway tunnels chae et al 2008 kim and lee 2003 lee et al 2007 shen and xu 2011 the heavy abstraction of groundwater accelerates the substantial vertical inflow of organic contaminants cronin et al 2003 lawrence et al 2000 lerner 2002 powell et al 2003 which induces the reducing environment in an aquifer in addition the increase of n loading enhances the denitrification rate to some extents seitzinger et al 2006 wall et al 2005 namely an excessive pumping of groundwater accelerates the accumulation of organic contaminants and nitrate in a local area and creates the reducing environment which makes a preferential condition for denitrification and further reduction of mn and fe bearing solids contained in the aquifer matrix or tunnel constructing materials chae et al 2008 lawrence et al 2000 the spatial distribution of group 3 was probably due to harsh groundwater extraction near the han river and its tributaries where subway tunnels were densely located in the natural hydrologic context the han river and its tributaries control groundwater discharge however heavy pumping disrupts the natural groundwater flow regime joo et al 2009 and excessive pumping in underground facilities such as subway tunnels causes serious local disturbance in groundwater flow as well as groundwater contamination through groundwater drawdown kim et al 2016 compared the distributions of ec of seoul groundwater for 2000 2005 and 2010 2014 and revealed that the most contaminated groundwater occurred in highly urbanized areas which were spatially consistent with the group 3 groundwater of this study fig 4c in summary group 3 groundwater in seoul represented the highly contaminated groundwater that alongside with fe and mn reduction was also affected by denitrification here it is noteworthy that denitrification can fuel n2o emissions at the surface via various ways e g diffusion through the unsaturated zone and discharge to wells or streams because n2o is an intermediate product of denitrification such n2o can contribute to the atmospheric temperature rise because it is one of the greenhouse gases hiscock et al 2003 well et al 2005 4 4 groundwater samples not belonging to any group groundwater samples that did not belong to a group showed transitional properties as compared to three groups see table s2 in supplementary information the median ec and tds levels of these samples were 497 5 μs cm and 407 2 mg l respectively that were higher than those of group 1 and fell between those of group 2 and group 3 the median values of the most major ion concentrations except k and no3 also lied between group 2 and group 3 the p values from mann whitney u test also revealed that the samples not belonging to any group had overlapping hydrogeochemical properties of two or three groups mostly of group 2 and group 3 see table s4 in supplementary information these groundwater samples had similar levels of eh ec na k mg cl and of sio2 to group 2 and ph eh do no3 and sio2 to group 3 thus water quality of these samples ranged within those of group 2 and group 3 the high median values of nitrate 23 8 mg l ec and tds indicate that many of the samples were polluted these groundwater samples distributed over the map data not shown and showed no spatial patterns this is probably because pollution sources were widely distributed and mixed all over seoul through the complicated local groundwater flows 5 conclusions this study clustered water chemistry quality data of urban groundwater in seoul to three groups using both som and fcm based on the hydrogeochemical properties of three groundwater groups and their spatial distributions the three groups well represented the regional groundwater properties in seoul in addition 100 samples that did not exclusively belong to any group were identified our results demonstrate that the cooperative use of som and the fcm clustering provides a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogeochemical processes of urban groundwater which experiences a highly heterogeneous mixture of diverse water types and whose chemistry is affected by a range of natural and anthropogenic factors som makes it easy to examine the groundwater quality by simplifying complex high dimensioned input data into an intuitive 2d output surface the fcm clustering copes with the ambiguity of water group boundaries and provides a helpful interpretation about highly heterogeneous urban groundwater quality altogether the combined use of som and fcm clustering helps us quantitatively characterize the complex urban groundwater quality the results of this study may contribute to the development of a sustainable scheme for urban groundwater management in seoul and other metropolitan cities all over the world for instance understanding the water quality distribution with respect to land use underground structures e g sewage pipes subway tunnels and groundwater extraction can help to establish a locally customized groundwater management plan furthermore the combined use of som and fcm we suggested in this study can be applied to other complex environmental data e g surface water chemistry data through this work we could reach that leakage of sewage wastewater was a major cause of groundwater contamination in seoul except for mountainous areas at the northern and southern parts of seoul therefore an urgent need for repairing the underground sewer pipe networks of seoul is suggested the biggest problem of sewer leakage is the nitrate pollution the influence of leaking sewer pipes in urban groundwater quality however is not limited to the nitrate pollution and is associated with other water quality constituents e g fe and mn besides sewage wastewater contains various pathogenic microbes including coliform bacteria which can cause serious health problems additionally local denitrification is supposed to occur around subway lines where heavy groundwater pumping takes place the intense pumping of groundwater may induce a substantial downward flow of surface or near surface contaminants containing high organic carbon contaminants facilitating denitrifying conditions therefore the complex urban settings may produce spatial variability in redox conditions which can regulate the concentration of nitrate via denitrification conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

6783,to make an overall assessment of the groundwater quality in seoul city we used the self organizing map som technique in combination with fuzzy c means fcm clustering som visualizes complicate and multidimensional data structures on a 2d surface while the fcm algorithm creates overlapping cluster boundaries among samples that are continuously distributed over a data space the combination of som and fcm clustering was expected to help characterize highly complicated urban groundwater quality as a result the som characterized 343 groundwater samples using 91 neurons which were further classified by fcm clustering into three water groups group 1 addressed the least polluted groundwater 17 of the samples n 58 average tds 194 5 mg l and no3 6 9 mg l and occurred in the peripheral areas whose land cover is mainly occupied by forests increasing ph with increasing sodium and bicarbonate concentrations indicated that the hydrogeochemistry of group 1 was largely controlled by water rock interactions group 2 included the highly polluted groundwater 24 of the samples n 82 average tds 326 2 mg l and no3 42 6 mg l and sporadically occurred in seoul with no distinct spatial control this group seemed to be affected by sewage from broken sewer pipes which are a primary pollution source of seoul groundwater and are ubiquitously distributed beneath the city group 3 water also represented the highly contaminated groundwater 30 of the samples n 103 average tds 527 1 mg l but contained low nitrate concentrations average no3 13 1 mg l based on their spatial locations intensive groundwater pumping from subway tunnels and other underground spaces at the city center seemed to drive the induced flow of organic contaminants resulting in local reducing conditions sufficient for denitrification the remaining 100 samples 29 of the samples shared the hydrogeochemical properties of two or three groups this study successfully characterized the spatial pattern of urban groundwater quality that is complicated by various contamination sources and hydrogeochemical processes the combined use of som and fcm clustering was proven as a powerful tool to interpret nonlinear and highly heterogeneous environmental data for which it is difficult to define cluster boundaries taken together our results contribute to a better management of urban groundwater in metropolitan cities under high risks of anthropogenic contamination keywords urban groundwater hydrogeochemistry and quality self organizing map som fuzzy c means fcm clustering urban water management 1 introduction surface water is highly vulnerable to environmental disturbances in the anthropocene such as urbanization and climate change delpla et al 2009 and references therein pires et al 2015 wang et al 2008 whitehead et al 2009 and references therein thus national state and metropolitan governments e g seoul have recognized the importance of groundwater as a supplementary and or alternative water resource and have made efforts to properly manage aquifers lee et al 2018 mcgrane 2016 morris et al 2001 takizawa 2008 and references therein in order to establish suitable management plans for groundwater resources regional investigation of aquifer conditions should be performed loaiciga et al 1992 a detailed examination of groundwater chemistry and its spatial variation can provide comprehensive information on the aquifer heterogeneity and connectivity as well as on the principal mechanisms controlling groundwater flow and water quality güler et al 2002 singh et al 2017 besides such knowledges about the groundwater quality and its spatial variation is vital in terms of developing a conceptual model that would adequately describe the groundwater system the model would also make it possible to properly design a groundwater quality monitoring network loaiciga et al 1992 and to establish water quality management strategies with considering regional characteristics jang et al 2016 liang et al 2016 liang et al 2018 meanwhile a representative and reliable estimation of regional groundwater chemistry requires multiple samplings from sufficient sites which naturally yields large datasets therefore multivariate analysis techniques e g dimensionality reduction clustering and supervised unsupervised learning are frequently used to facilitate the interpretation of complicated water chemistry data among the various multivariate analysis techniques factor analysis fa liu et al 2003 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 and principal component analysis pca cloutier et al 2008 helena et al 2000 hildenbrand et al 2016 mcneil et al 2005 monjerezi et al 2011 are the most widely used dimensionality reduction techniques in water quality studies these methods extract a small number of factors capturing major patterns of complicated multivariate data with minimizing the loss of information and visualize the result into a low dimensional mainly 2d or 3d space for instance hu et al 2013 identified the major factors affecting high fluorine concentrations in groundwater in shanxi and inner mongolia using pca and found that fluorine in inner mongolia showed less correlations with other geochemical factors than that in shanxi because multiple factors such as agricultural industrial activities and mineral dissolution influenced the groundwater chemistry in inner mongolia however fa and pca are linear approaches that can lead to an erroneous interpretation when dealing with environmental data with nonlinear relationships between variables astel et al 2007 giraudel and lek 2001 lischeid 2009 besides fa and pca can only show whether the correlations between variables are positive or negative and whether the degrees of correlations are strong or weak in a 2d space in the present study seeking to overcome the weakness of the linear dimensionality reduction techniques we applied self organizing map som on our water quality dataset som is a powerful nonlinear projection tool that visualizes complex high dimensional data structures onto a 2d surface and at the same time organizes input data into a smaller number of neurons kohonen 1982 furthermore som can reveal local relationships among variables while fa and pca only show global and linear relationships between variables hong and rosen 2001 choi et al 2014 assessed the korean groundwater monitoring network data using som and compared with pca results and concluded that pca is unsuitable to classify the widely dispersed data however in most som cases the number of output neurons is more than the expected number of groups kiang 2001 therefore to derive an appropriate number of groups and to facilitate quantitative analysis of the map previous researches added clustering steps on the som results such as hierarchical clustering analysis hca choi et al 2014 dopazo 2002 herrero and dopazo 2002 sánchez martos et al 2002 k means clustering analysis garcı a and gonzález 2004 nguyen et al 2015 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 wu and chow 2004 and contiguity constrained clustering kiang 2001 murtagh 1995 for instance nguyen et al 2015 identified the spatio seasonal variations of the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in red river delta rrd in vietnam using som in combination with hca similarly choi et al 2014 used som with hca to assess the groundwater chemistry in south korea on a national scale and found the best cluster number of six to explain the bedrock groundwater chemistry of the southern korean peninsula these clustering methods however assume well defined group boundaries although environmental data show rather gradual changes between groups these changes almost never belong exclusively to one of the groups equihua 1990 güler et al 2012 güler and thyne 2004 vriend et al 1988 in the present study the som neurons were grouped by the fuzzy c means fcm clustering algorithm the fcm algorithm can cope with the uncertainty derived from the heterogeneous nature of environmental data by assuming that each sample belongs to all groups with some degrees of membership u bezdek et al 1984 frapporti et al 1993 applied the fcm clustering on the dutch national groundwater quality monitoring network data and obtained several overlapping clusters which showed spatially distinguishable patterns güler and thyne 2004 used the fcm clustering to identify the physicochemical processes controlling the water quality variations in southeastern california groundwater and gained spatial distributions of different water chemistry groups by mapping fuzzy membership values u of water groups using the kriging method as we have seen in the aforementioned references either the som or fcm algorithm was successfully applied for interpreting large and complex water quality data however the combination of the two methods has not been conducted the combined use of these two methods is expected to provide a straightforward way to characterize highly complicated water quality data with complementing each other s disadvantages the fcm algorithm is soft clustering that can deal with the gradual nature of environmental data while it requires additional interpretation to characterize each group on the other hand som helps to grasp the nonlinear relationship between variables through visualization but is unsuitable for clustering purposes the present study combined the som with the fcm algorithm to identify the water quality groups of seoul groundwater and to explain governing hydrogeochemical processes of each group these purposes were achieved by 1 assigning the groundwater quality data n 343 of seoul to neurons using som section 3 2 1 2 grouping the neurons using the fcm clustering algorithm section 3 2 2 and 3 examining the physicochemical properties of each group to verify the groups identified by som and fcm section 4 the spatial distribution of groundwater quality groups was also examined by displaying spatial patterns of membership values u of each group on the map to provide a useful insight into the hydrogeochemical and quality characteristics of groundwater section 3 2 3 the chemical properties of groundwater samples which did not exclusively belong to groups were also briefly described in section 4 4 the results of the present study are expected to contribute to establishing a better management policy of urban groundwater and to constructing a reasonable and efficient groundwater quality monitoring network 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area seoul metropolitan city seoul the capital of south korea is one of the most heavily populated cities in the world with the population of 10 4 million about 20 of the total population of the country inhabiting the area of 605 3 km2 about 0 6 of the country s total land area smg seoul metropolitan government 2016 and is located at the mid western part of the korean peninsula fig 1 a the average annual temperature is about 12 5 c and the annual average precipitation is 1450 mm kma korea meteorogical administration 2011 the geology of seoul consists of precambrian gneisses as basement rocks jurassic granitoid intrusions and an overlying thin alluvium or soil 3 16 m of the quaternary age near the han river fig 1b kim and lee 2003 yun et al 2007 the bedrock generally dips to the southeast and the two main joint sets dip 10 sw and 30 ne with a northwest strike kim et al 2001 seoul is located in a gently undulating terrain surrounded by mountains approximately 340 840 m a s l see fig 1c the area is hydrologically divided into two parts by the ew trending han river the biotope map published by seoul development institute sdi seoul development institute 2010 classified the land use of seoul into residential commercial and business areas 38 2 forest and open space 30

reduces the infiltration of rainfall sdi seoul development institute 2010 according to kim et al 2001 only about 3 of annual groundwater recharge originates from rainfall infiltration while leakages from broken municipal water supply networks contribute over 90 of annual total recharge aquifers of seoul consist of two main types shallow alluvial aquifers and deep fractured rock aquifers alluvium 20 m thick is distributed along the han river and its tributaries and is mainly composed of sand and silt fractured bedrock aquifers consisting of granite gneiss and schist have the hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1 0 10 5 to 7 4 10 3 cm s smg seoul metropolitan government 1996 groundwater levels generally follow the topography thus groundwater largely flows from mountainous areas towards the han river fig 1e the average depth to groundwater table is about 1 2 m from the land surface for alluvium aquifers near the han river and its tributaries and 15 16 m for fractured bedrock aquifers gims national groundwater information center 2016 a significant drawdown in groundwater depth is observed locally in the central part of the city where heavy pumping of groundwater occurs in subway tunnels fig 1f joo et al 2009 kim et al 2001 2 2 sampling and analytical procedures groundwater level measurements and groundwater sampling campaigns were performed during the unique comprehensive hydrochemical survey between october 2003 and february 2004 in seoul using 506 preexisting wells the in situ measurements of ph eh do ec and alkalinity were performed by portable meters and electrodes alkalinity as hco3 was measured by acid titration with 0 05 n hno3 for the chemical analysis groundwater samples were filtered using 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate filters and collected in 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles groundwater samples for the analysis of major cations and minor metals especially fe and mn were acidified to ph 2 with several drops of ultrapure nitric acid apha et al 2001 all samples were stored in ice boxes at 4 c until laboratory analysis the chemical analysis was performed at the center for mineral resources research cmr of korea university within a few days after the sample collection concentrations of major cations na k ca mg minor metals fe mn and sio2 were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy model 3000xl perkin elmer anions cl no3 and so4 concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography model 120 dionex in order to verify the accuracy and precision of measurements qa qc quality assurance quality control procedures were made by analyzing blanks and duplicate samples the detection limits for every major ion were summarized in table s1 in supplementary information 2 3 self organizing map and fuzzy c means clustering algorithms 2 3 1 data preparation a total of 343 groundwater samples which were analyzed for all 13 physicochemical variables ph eh do ec na k ca mg cl no3 so4 hco3 and sio2 and whose charge balance error was below 10 were used for the som and fcm clustering interpretations the data of fe and mn concentrations were excluded from som and fcm clustering as only a few observations n 169 and n 168 respectively were available but used for interpreting water groups in section 4 all parameters with the exception of ph were log transformed to reduce the effects of outliers to equalize the importance of all variables the log transformed data were then standardized to zero mean and unit variance these procedures are indispensable because som is strongly affected by variables having a larger scale which may result in a significant misleading of water quality data kiang 2001 2 3 2 self organizing map som som is an artificial neural network model designed for the two main purposes kohonen 1982 nonlinear dimensionality reduction and unsupervised classification the som projects high dimensional input data onto low dimensional usually 2d output surfaces composed of an array of ordered units called neurons the proper number of neurons can be selected using a heuristic rule e g 5 n suggested by vesanto et al 2000 where n is the number of samples each neuron i is fully connected with all input samples and these linkages are represented by p dimensional weight vectors w i wi 1 wi 2 wip t where p is the dimensionality of the input space p 13 in this study including ph and ec neurons are also interconnected with the adjacent ones by a neighborhood relation the som algorithm performs an iterative procedure called learning that organizes neurons according to their similarities with preserving the inherent topological characteristics of the dataset thus som is a powerful visualization technique that provides an intuitive grasp of the data structure especially for large and complex data kalteh et al 2008 the learning algorithm of som consists of the following steps 1 initializing weight vectors with small random values 2 calculating and comparing the euclidean distances between each input sample x i e 343 groundwater samples in this study and all neurons 3 finding the best matching unit bmu b that is the neuron closest to the input sample x 1 x w b min i x w i and 4 updating the bmu and its neighbor neurons towards the input sample the weight vector w i at each time step t 1 are calculated as follows 2 w i t 1 w i t α t h bi t x w i t where α t is a learning rate and hbi t is a neighborhood kernel function of the neuron i for its bmu b and indicates the radius that the bmu can influence α t hbi t called gain term varies between 0 and 1 and monotonically decreases with time so the weight vector approaches the nearest sample value as the learning progresses in particular as the time step t increases hbi t gradually decreases so that the nearer neurons of the bmu are updated to have stronger connections with it as a result the neighboring neurons of the bmu are pulled closer to the bmu than to other neurons and show greater similarities with the bmu in the output space see a conceptual diagram in fig s1 of supplementary information following the completion of learning each input sample x is assigned to its closest output neuron or bmu b samples with similar properties are assigned to the same bmu b which is regarded as a center for clustering in som günter and bunke 2002 the detailed mathematical explanation of som is well documented elsewhere garcı a and gonzález 2004 hong and rosen 2001 kiang 2001 kohonen 1982 in this study the som toolbox in matlab version 2 0 vesanto et al 2000 was applied to calculate and visualize the som 2 3 3 fuzzy c means clustering fcm the fcm clustering is one of the most widely used soft clustering algorithms that partition a dataset x x 1 x 2 x n into c 2 3 n 1 fuzzy groups that are identified by their cluster centers v j j 1 2 c where n is the number of samples n 343 in this study bezdek et al 1984 unlike hard clustering methods such as hca and k means cluster analysis the fcm clustering creates overlapping cluster boundaries and makes samples be allocated to all groups with the degree of memberships u ranging between 0 and 1 the fcm algorithm may be the most suitable clustering technique for groundwater quality data since the physicochemical properties of groundwater show a gradual change in time and space due to mixing diffusion dispersion and other physicochemical reactions rather than a distinct change frapporti et al 1993 güler et al 2002 the fcm clustering uses an iterative optimization process to minimize the following objective function j which is the weighted sum of errors within groups 3 j m c j 1 c k 1 n u jk m x k v j 2 under the following constraint 4 j 1 c u jk 1 where m is the membership matrix c is the cluster center matrix c is the number of clusters m is a fuzzy exponent and ujk is the membership degree of data point k in cluster j if a sample x k becomes far from the cluster center v j the membership degree ujk approaches 0 to minimize j on the other hand if the sample x k becomes close to the cluster center v j the membership degree ujk approaches 1 höppner 2002 the fuzzy exponent m 1 controls the degree of fuzziness or the amount of clusters overlap as m converges to 1 the partitions get crisper while the partitions get fuzzier as m converges to infinity in the fcm algorithm the number of clusters c has to be determined before running the partitioning regardless of whether or not the dataset is actually divided into c classes several researchers established criteria called validity indexes which help to find an optimal number of clusters bezdek and pal 1998 kothari and pitts 1999 trauwaert et al 1991 in the present study we used two validity functions roubens 1982 fuzziness performance index fpi and normalized classification entropy nce each validation function is expressed by the following equations 5 fpi 1 cf 1 c 1 where f 1 n j 1 c k 1 n u jk 2 6 nce h log c where h 1 n j 1 c k 1 n u jk log u jk fpi and nce measure the degree of fuzziness and the amount of disorganization in a specific number of clusters respectively both indices range between 0 and 1 and are minimized in the optimum number of clusters in this study the fcm algorithm was performed using fuzme version 3 0 in matlab minasny and mcbratney 2002 after grouping som neurons instead of input samples into clusters section 3 2 2 the membership values of each neuron in each cluster were assigned to the corresponding sample coordinates to illustrate the spatial distribution of the clusters of groundwater in seoul note that groundwater samples in the same neuron shared a same membership value the ordinary kriging was conducted with surfer 12 golden software inc 2014 to display the spatial pattern of the membership values on the map besides to verify the group to group differences in physicochemical parameters the mann whitney u test was conducted for the weight vector values of the som neurons if the calculated p value was below the significance level of 0 05 the tested two groups were assumed to be significantly different from each other 3 results 3 1 general hydrochemistry table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of 16 physicochemical variables of urban groundwater n 343 in seoul electrical conductivity ec a useful in situ indicator of total dissolved solids tds hem 1985 widely ranged from 96 to 1638 μs cm indicating that the quality of seoul groundwater was influenced by various hydrogeochemical processes such as mineral dissolution and or anthropogenic pollution tds values showed a good linear correlation with ec values slope 0 72 and r2 0 89 data not shown suggesting that the measurements were reliable and the solute concentrations of groundwater were mainly controlled by major ions hounslow 1995 major ion compositions of seoul groundwater were dominated by calcium mean 59 3 mg l and standard deviation sd 32 4 mg l among cations and bicarbonate mean 143 6 mg l and sd 86 4 mg l among anions table 1 therefore the ca hco3 type characterized the general hydrogeochemical composition of seoul groundwater the piper diagram displayed two evolutionary trends towards either na hco3 or ca so4 cl no3 type from ca hco3 type fig 2 the redox potential eh and dissolved oxygen do levels ranged from 94 6 to 894 1 mv and from 0 87 to 16 71 mg l respectively the high mean values of eh and do 438 7 mv and 4 86 mg l respectively with the small standard deviations 127 8 mv and 2 47 mg l respectively suggest that the aquifer of seoul was generally under aerobic conditions however it should be noted that the eh measurements are impractical for an adequate description of the redox equilibrium of groundwater linberg and runnels 1984 stumm and morgan 1996 actual redox conditions can be deduced by examining the concentrations of redox sensitive species chapelle et al 1995 including fe mn no3 and so4 dissolved fe and mn ranged from 0 005 to 29 501 mg l median 0 008 mg l and from 0 005 to 4 025 mg l median 0 003 mg l respectively showing very large variances coefficient of variation cv 494 27 and 276 85 six 1 75 and three 0 87 samples exceeded the korean drinking water standards both 0 30 mg l for dissolved fe and mn respectively in addition other redox indicators such as no3 and so4 also showed large cv values 112 56 and 94 72 respectively this confirms that seoul groundwater was under varying degrees of redox conditions nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 128 1 mg l and had the average of 24 1 mg l with a large standard deviation sd 27 1 mg l table 1 about 18 1 n 62 of the total samples exceeded the korean drinking water standard 44 3 mg l the large variance of nitrate concentrations in seoul groundwater indicates the ubiquitous occurrence of various sources and sinks of nitrate in fact diverse sources of high nitrate concentrations have been reported in the urban groundwater such as leakages from sewers septic tanks landfills storm water and industrial spillages ford and tellam 1994 navarro and carbonell 2007 nolan et al 1997 wakida and lerner 2005 zhang et al 2015 significant correlations p 0 05 appeared between nitrate and other redox sensitive constituents do 0 26 so4 0 15 fe 0 26 and mn 0 37 here numbers in parenthesis denote the spearman s rho these relationships indicate that redox processes were to some degree involved in controlling nitrate concentrations in seoul groundwater 3 2 som and fcm clustering results 3 2 1 som results by applying the som technique to the log transformed and standardized groundwater quality dataset n 343 91 output neurons were obtained here 91 was selected based on the heuristic equation of vesanto et al 2000 the neurons are displayed on a 13 7 rectangular grid with 91 hexagons in fig 3 following vesanto 1999 the som results can be represented by two kinds of maps component planes fig 3a and median distance matrix d matrix fig 3b the component planes show the weight vector values of each neuron using color codes blue and red correspond to low and high values respectively thus the comparison of the patterns of component planes allows for an instant recognition of the mutual dependencies among variables for example parallel gradients between variables in component planes indicate that there is a positive correlation between them on the other hand the median d matrix presents the median euclidean distance between neighboring neurons in the color scale therefore we can see the relative distances between neurons on the entire map neurons with low distances i e high similarities shown in blue can be regarded as a cluster while neurons with high distances i e low similarities shown in red can be regarded as cluster boundaries in the component planes fig 3a four features are noticeable first na k ca mg cl and so4 showed similar patterns to ec their weight vector values increased towards the bottom of the component planes second unlike other major constituents no3 and hco3 showed the horizontal increased from the left to the right and diagonal gradient increased from the upper left to the lower right in colors respectively indicating that the amounts of these ions are controlled by different hydrogeochemical processes e g the redox reaction from those controlling the major constituents third eh and do values showed more complicated color distributions than the other components while their patterns were similar to each other with decreasing from the upper left to the lower right this was probably because the redox potential of groundwater was strongly dependent on do and the heterogenous redox environment caused a local variability heterogeneity of eh and do in the aquifer fourth the concentration of sio2 showed a reverse gradient with ph concomitantly with the ph decrease the weight vector values of sio2 increased from the upper right to the lower left part this was possibly because a lowered ph enhanced the weathering of silicate minerals in the aquifer these features appeared in som were discussed in detail in section 4 after dividing neurons by fcm clustering on the other hand in the present study cluster structures of the data were difficult to be recognized on the d matrix fig 3b in particular the neurons in the upper part showed a great dissimilarity to each other and therefore the boundaries between clusters were indistinguishable by visual inspection this may suggest that as compared to the neurons in the lower part the water quality of the neurons in the upper part was affected by diverse factors besides it should be noted that the data of groundwater samples were continuously distributed on the piper diagram rather than forming discrete clusters fig 2 this continuity means that groundwater quality of seoul was largely affected by mixing processes therefore we applied the fcm algorithm on the som neurons to reveal the underlying cluster structures with taking into account the complexity of the urban groundwater quality data 3 2 2 fcm clustering results in order to find the optimal number of clusters c and the fuzzy exponent value m two validation indices i e fpi and nce were calculated roubens 1982 table 2 the number of clusters was tested from 2 to 10 while the fuzzy exponent varied from 1 1 to 2 0 theoretically the optimal number of clusters is determined with minimizing both fpi eq 5 and nce eq 6 however these two indices did not suggest a clear criterion for choosing the number of groups they showed the lowest values when c 2 and the highest values when c 3 and then decreased with the increase of c table 2 when c 2 neurons were divided into the upper and lower parts and the weight vector values of neurons in each group showed a large variation see fig s2a in supplementary information which indicates that the hydrochemical properties of neurons belonging in a same group were heterogeneous and should be further divided on the other hand decreases in fpi and nce values with the increase of c when c 3 were probably because the neurons in the upper part were distant from each other fig 3b and thus each neuron was identified as an individual cluster for instance when the neurons were divided into four clusters the result was not meaningful because only the neurons in the upper part of the map group 1 in this study were divided into two sub clusters see fig s2b in supplementary information therefore we classified the neurons into three groups although both fpi and nce showed the highest values when c 3 table 2 besides the results of hca data not shown supported that the neurons were composed of three groups the three groups were verified in section 4 the fuzzy exponent value was fixed to 1 5 which resulted in an appropriate degree of fuzziness fpi 0 336 and nce 0 336 when c 3 neither too fuzzy nor too hard to clearly separate clusters and achieve high intra cluster similarity only the neurons having the membership values u above 0 75 were regarded as belonging to a certain cluster see fig 3c the neurons with the membership values below 0 75 for any of three clusters n 25 were assumed to have overlapping hydrogeochemical properties of two or three groups the cluster boundaries found in fig 3c were applied to all figures in fig 3 the three fcm derived clusters showed significant differences from each other in most of the variables except for do and hco3 between groups 1 and 2 sio2 between groups 2 and 3 and eh and do between groups 1 and 3 table 3 3 2 3 three groups the application of the fcm clustering to the som neurons n 91 yielded three hydrogeochemical groups one non contaminated group 1 and two contaminated groups groups 2 and 3 the statistical summary of physicochemical variables for the three groundwater groups is shown in table s2 see supplementary information it should be noted that only the neurons with u 0 75 for a certain cluster n 66 243 samples were classified see fig 3c the number of such neurons was 19 at the upper part of som 58 samples 17 20 at the bottom left part of som 82 samples 24 and 27 at the bottom right part of som 103 samples 30 for groups 1 2 and 3 respectively the spatial distribution of these three groups in seoul was shown in fig 4 the remaining 25 neurons 100 samples did not belong to any group and were considered to be mixtures of two or three groups the hydrogeochemical features and the governing processes of the three fcm determined clusters were discussed in the following section to verify the three groups identified by som and fcm 4 discussion the evolutionary trends in the piper diagram fig 2 indicate two major factors affecting the quality of groundwater in seoul first the na hco3 type represents the natural groundwater quality that is mainly affected by water rock interactions such as silicate weathering mainly plagioclase hydrolysis and cation exchange chae et al 2006 edmunds and shand 2008 gascoyne and kamineni 1994 toran and saunders 1999 on the other hand the compositional change from the ca hco3 to the ca so4 cl no3 type indicates the influence of anthropogenic pollution given that chloride sulfate and nitrate are typical inorganic pollutants mostly derived from human activities such as industrial or municipal sewages in cities barrett et al 1999 dragon 2008 mcgrane 2016 venkatesan and swaminathan 2009 zahn and grimm 1993 however the cooperative use of som and fcm clustering revealed three groups it was probably because the piper diagram considered the composition ratios of major ions only while som and fcm clustering included ph redox parameters i e eh and do and ec indicating the absolute content of major ion concentrations three groundwater groups were identified in seoul as follows 1 group 1 groundwater largely controlled by natural processes i e water rock interaction 2 group 2 nitrate contaminated groundwater and 3 group 3 highly contaminated groundwater with low nitrate concentrations fig 5 schematically summaries the hydrogeochemical characteristics and the relevant processes of each group 4 1 group 1 non or least contaminated groundwater group 1 was characterized by the highest average ph mean 7 37 and the lowest average ec and tds values mean ec 217 1 μs cm and mean tds 194 5 mg l among the three groundwater groups see table s2 the nitrate levels were low mean no3 6 87 mg l spatially groundwater of group 1 mainly occurred in the northern and southern parts that remote from the city center fig 4a and forest dominates the land cover therefore as reflected by the low concentrations of most dissolved constituents group 1 groundwater was devoid of anthropogenic contamination ec ph and the concentrations of na and hco3 in group 1 showed significant positive correlations p 0 05 with each other see table s3 in supplementary information these relationships were also observed in the component planes fig 3a where the weight vector values of ec ph na and hco3 increased from the left to the right within the group 1 field the enrichments of na and hco3 with the increases of ec and ph indicate that the hydrochemistry of group 1 water was mainly controlled by water rock interactions including dissolution of na silicates e g plagioclase and cation exchange banks and frengstad 2006 chae et al 2006 edmunds and shand 2008 gascoyne and kamineni 1994 do showed the opposite trend against ph ec and the concentrations of na and hco3 in the component planes fig 3a yielding significant negative correlations p 0 05 with them see table s3 in supplementary information in general the longer residence time of groundwater in aquifer the lower the redox levels due to the oxygen consuming bacterial reactions and the greater the extent of water rock interactions drever 1988 therefore the low do levels with the high ph ec na and hco3 concentrations were possibly due to the prolonged hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater via the water rock interaction however dissolved silica sio2 which is also used to indicate the degree of silicate dissolution and the length of residence time showed a complicated pattern in fig 3a in the component planes the no3 concentration of group 1 groundwater showed the reverse gradients with ph na and hco3 but the parallel gradient with the do level this means that several group 1 groundwater samples with relatively shorter residence times i e higher do and lower ph ec na sio2 and hco3 concentrations may have been slightly affected by anthropogenic pollutants such as no3 in summary as compared to other groups groundwater of group 1 showed a good water quality and thus represented the non or less influenced groundwater by anthropogenic activities thus the observed concentration levels of major ions in group 1 can be effectively used as natural backgrounds for groundwater management in seoul 4 2 group 2 no3 contaminated groundwater group 2 showed the lowest mean ph 6 57 and the highest mean no3 concentration 42 6 mg l see table s2 in supplementary information the concentrations of dissolved constituents were relatively high mean tds 326 2 mg l and ec 403 4 μs cm the average concentrations of major ions fell between those of groups 1 and 3 except for nitrate the mean no3 concentration of group 2 42 6 mg l was very high approaching the korean drinking water standard 44 3 mg l previous studies also addressed the nitrate contamination of groundwater in seoul choi et al 2005 hosono et al 2009 lee et al 2003 urban aquifers are exposed to various nitrogen sources such as leakage from sewer pipes or septic tanks landfill leachates industrial effluents and storm water eiswirth and hötzl 1997 lerner 2003 lerner et al 1999 wakida and lerner 2005 in particular sewage infiltrations through leaking sewers and septic tanks are likely to result in great nitrogen loads on urban groundwater lerner 2003 lerner et al 1999 tellam et al 2006 won et al 2004 the ministry of environment of korea me ministry of environment 2014 reported that about half of the sewer pipes were constructed 30 years ago in seoul thus high nitrate concentrations in group 2 groundwater possibly originated from wastewater leaked through damaged or misconnected sewer pipes in the component plane the concentration of no3 increased from the right to the left while the ph and hco3 decreased within the group boundary fig 3a indeed the ph and hco3 concentrations showed significant negative correlations p 0 05 with no3 see table s3 in supplementary information probably because hco3 was consumed in buffering reactions with acid produced during nitrification belser 1984 groundwater of group 2 was sporadically distributed on the map fig 4b it appears that there was no clear spatial pattern similarly lee et al 2003 found a weak spatial relationship between the land use and the nitrate concentration in groundwater of seoul this suggests that diverse sources of nitrate were sporadically and heterogeneously distributed in seoul in summary group 2 represented nitrate contaminated groundwater that typically occurs beneath the urban city eiswirth and hötzl 1997 foster 1990 lerner and barrett 1996 lerner et al 1999 mcgrane 2016 wakida and lerner 2002 2006 4 3 group 3 highly contaminated groundwater with low no3 levels group 3 represented the most severely contaminated groundwater in seoul as indicated by both the highest mean tds and ec values mean tds 527 1 mg l and mean ec 644 9 μs cm and the high concentrations of major ions about 1 5 2 times higher than those of group 2 except for nitrate see table s2 in supplementary information in addition group 3 showed the lowest mean eh and do values mean eh 411 4 mv and do 4 15 mg l with the highest mean concentrations of dissolved fe and mn mean fe 1 14 mg l and mn 0 45 mg l the most obvious difference between the two contaminated groups 2 and 3 was the concentration of no3 the nitrate in groundwater of group 3 showed the low mean concentration 13 1 mg l with the large cv of 126 5 while the nitrate concentration of group 2 had the high mean 42 6 mg l with the small cv of 62 4 the high cv reflects that the concentration of nitrate was controlled by various sources and or sink processes kim et al 2014 as mentioned in section 3 1 despite the absence of direct denitrification evidence e g n and o isotopic data we consider that denitrification likely occurred in group 3 groundwater based on the following three reasons first in the component planes the concentration of no3 decreased with the increases of ph and hco3 within the group 3 field fig 3a the no3 concentration of group 3 groundwater showed a significant negative correlation p 0 05 with the concentration of hco3 see table s3 in supplementary information denitrification using organic carbon as the electron donor accompanies the production of co2 that increases the concentration of hco3 and ph in groundwater rivett et al 2008 trudell et al 1986 a strong candidate for organic carbon sources in urban groundwater can be the septic sewage water released from broken sewer pipes macquarrie and sudicky 2001 mcgrane 2016 robertson et al 1991 wilhelm et al 1994 the high sd of no3 and hco3 concentrations in group 3 see table s1 implied that the magnitude of denitrification varied across group 3 second the cl concentration levels of group 3 groundwater were high mean 62 8 mg l and had a significant positive correlation p 0 05 with the no3 concentration see table s3 in supplementary information as mentioned above nitrate in urban groundwater mostly originates from sewer leakage that also contains high levels of chloride eiswirth and hötzl 1997 in addition due to geological characteristics chloride in groundwater cannot be derived from natural origins via the water rock interaction e g halite dissolution in case of seoul thus we consider that no3 in groundwater of group 3 originated from septic sewage and was further locally influenced by varying degrees of denitrification third group 3 groundwater had the highest concentrations of dissolved fe and mn which are also redox sensitive compounds group 3 groundwater was mostly found in the center of seoul and around the tributaries of the han river where the groundwater table was significantly lowered due to excessive groundwater pumping see figs 1e and 4c the decline of groundwater levels was also remarkable along the subway lines as a large amount of groundwater was continuously pumped out to keep the water levels below the subway tunnels chae et al 2008 kim and lee 2003 lee et al 2007 shen and xu 2011 the heavy abstraction of groundwater accelerates the substantial vertical inflow of organic contaminants cronin et al 2003 lawrence et al 2000 lerner 2002 powell et al 2003 which induces the reducing environment in an aquifer in addition the increase of n loading enhances the denitrification rate to some extents seitzinger et al 2006 wall et al 2005 namely an excessive pumping of groundwater accelerates the accumulation of organic contaminants and nitrate in a local area and creates the reducing environment which makes a preferential condition for denitrification and further reduction of mn and fe bearing solids contained in the aquifer matrix or tunnel constructing materials chae et al 2008 lawrence et al 2000 the spatial distribution of group 3 was probably due to harsh groundwater extraction near the han river and its tributaries where subway tunnels were densely located in the natural hydrologic context the han river and its tributaries control groundwater discharge however heavy pumping disrupts the natural groundwater flow regime joo et al 2009 and excessive pumping in underground facilities such as subway tunnels causes serious local disturbance in groundwater flow as well as groundwater contamination through groundwater drawdown kim et al 2016 compared the distributions of ec of seoul groundwater for 2000 2005 and 2010 2014 and revealed that the most contaminated groundwater occurred in highly urbanized areas which were spatially consistent with the group 3 groundwater of this study fig 4c in summary group 3 groundwater in seoul represented the highly contaminated groundwater that alongside with fe and mn reduction was also affected by denitrification here it is noteworthy that denitrification can fuel n2o emissions at the surface via various ways e g diffusion through the unsaturated zone and discharge to wells or streams because n2o is an intermediate product of denitrification such n2o can contribute to the atmospheric temperature rise because it is one of the greenhouse gases hiscock et al 2003 well et al 2005 4 4 groundwater samples not belonging to any group groundwater samples that did not belong to a group showed transitional properties as compared to three groups see table s2 in supplementary information the median ec and tds levels of these samples were 497 5 μs cm and 407 2 mg l respectively that were higher than those of group 1 and fell between those of group 2 and group 3 the median values of the most major ion concentrations except k and no3 also lied between group 2 and group 3 the p values from mann whitney u test also revealed that the samples not belonging to any group had overlapping hydrogeochemical properties of two or three groups mostly of group 2 and group 3 see table s4 in supplementary information these groundwater samples had similar levels of eh ec na k mg cl and of sio2 to group 2 and ph eh do no3 and sio2 to group 3 thus water quality of these samples ranged within those of group 2 and group 3 the high median values of nitrate 23 8 mg l ec and tds indicate that many of the samples were polluted these groundwater samples distributed over the map data not shown and showed no spatial patterns this is probably because pollution sources were widely distributed and mixed all over seoul through the complicated local groundwater flows 5 conclusions this study clustered water chemistry quality data of urban groundwater in seoul to three groups using both som and fcm based on the hydrogeochemical properties of three groundwater groups and their spatial distributions the three groups well represented the regional groundwater properties in seoul in addition 100 samples that did not exclusively belong to any group were identified our results demonstrate that the cooperative use of som and the fcm clustering provides a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogeochemical processes of urban groundwater which experiences a highly heterogeneous mixture of diverse water types and whose chemistry is affected by a range of natural and anthropogenic factors som makes it easy to examine the groundwater quality by simplifying complex high dimensioned input data into an intuitive 2d output surface the fcm clustering copes with the ambiguity of water group boundaries and provides a helpful interpretation about highly heterogeneous urban groundwater quality altogether the combined use of som and fcm clustering helps us quantitatively characterize the complex urban groundwater quality the results of this study may contribute to the development of a sustainable scheme for urban groundwater management in seoul and other metropolitan cities all over the world for instance understanding the water quality distribution with respect to land use underground structures e g sewage pipes subway tunnels and groundwater extraction can help to establish a locally customized groundwater management plan furthermore the combined use of som and fcm we suggested in this study can be applied to other complex environmental data e g surface water chemistry data through this work we could reach that leakage of sewage wastewater was a major cause of groundwater contamination in seoul except for mountainous areas at the northern and southern parts of seoul therefore an urgent need for repairing the underground sewer pipe networks of seoul is suggested the biggest problem of sewer leakage is the nitrate pollution the influence of leaking sewer pipes in urban groundwater quality however is not limited to the nitrate pollution and is associated with other water quality constituents e g fe and mn besides sewage wastewater contains various pathogenic microbes including coliform bacteria which can cause serious health problems additionally local denitrification is supposed to occur around subway lines where heavy groundwater pumping takes place the intense pumping of groundwater may induce a substantial downward flow of surface or near surface contaminants containing high organic carbon contaminants facilitating denitrifying conditions therefore the complex urban settings may produce spatial variability in redox conditions which can regulate the concentration of nitrate via denitrification conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

6784,climate change has the potential to exacerbate eutrophication and the risk of harmful algal blooms in lakes periodic adjustment of nutrient criteria as the cornerstone of eutrophication control and water quality management is expected to help mitigate the impact of climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms the nutrient criteria that do not threaten the function of the water body determined with generalized additive models gams were 0 88 mg l for total nitrogen tn and 0 021 mg l for total phosphorus tp during the period of 1996 2005 based on 26 lakes and reservoirs in china climate change induced temperature increases will substantially reduce the required nutrient criteria by 46 17 for tn and 15 24 for tp in lakes and reservoirs by the end of the century under the business as usual scenario the results indicate that some lakes that currently meet the nutrient criteria could become dominated by cyanobacteria and experience blooms in a warmer future even without increases in nutrient inputs therefore as climate change persists nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication strict control of tp would be particularly advantageous to suppress algal blooms it is imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future climate changes on nutrient criteria and that nutrient criteria are periodically modified the corresponding nutrient risk thresholds should be determined to ensure that lakes and reservoirs escape the threat of harmful algal blooms under the impact of extreme weather events keywords climate change lake reservoir generalized additive model algae bloom eutrophication nutrient criteria 1 introduction eutrophication caused by substantial increases in nutrient loads from agricultural run off industrial activity and wastewater treatment facilities is a growing global problem moreover global warming is expected to increase the frequency intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many aquatic ecosystems worldwide couture et al 2018 huisman et al 2018 michalak 2016 xia et al 2012 climate change can both directly and indirectly affect the hydrology aquatic environment and ecosystem structure and function of lakes and reservoirs for instance surface runoff can be influenced by changes in precipitation with subsequent impacts on nutrient loads from catchments which is an important source of nutrients for phytoplankton couture et al 2018 xia et al 2015 moreover increasing temperatures are expected to expand the thermal stratification period deepen the thermocline and promote earlier onset and proliferation of algal blooms which could threaten aquatic ecosystems deng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2014 nutrient reduction strategies aimed at alleviating eutrophication may be weakened by the impacts of climate change on the aquatic environment havens and paerl 2015 given that climate change is expected to severely affect the ability to control blooms and in some cases could make it near impossible for example total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations in lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china decreased by 42 5 and 31 2 from 2007 to 2015 respectively but the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms did not significantly decrease due to climate driven changes yang et al 2016 thus the nutrient load especially internal load must be further reduced while the temperature is increased chen et al 2018 nutrient criteria represent the maximum acceptable concentrations of nutrients that do not threaten the function of the waterbody which is crucial for cultural eutrophication control and lake and reservoir water quality protection huo et al 2018 kelly et al 2015 research has shown that climate change factors such as temperature precipitation and wind speed influence the relationships between nutrients and chlorophyll a chl a and impact the development of nutrient criteria liu et al 2018 however little research has assessed the need for changes in nutrient criteria as climate change persists or the impact of climate change on nutrient criteria to address this gap in knowledge we quantified the contribution of climatic factors in particular air temperature to chl a concentrations and estimated the impact of future climate scenarios on nutrient criteria using generalized additive models gams alcaraz et al 2011 grieve et al 2017 the estimates were derived from anticipated changes in air temperature as projected under three climate model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models for four climate scenarios such as the rcp2 6 mitigation scenario the rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 stabilization scenarios and the rcp8 5 business as usual scenario for eight future time periods which are in ten year increments from 2016 to 2095 as a climate sensitive area the largest increases in temperature will most likely occur in china ipcc 2001 therefore the impacts on 26 lakes and reservoirs were estimated within mainland china although a number of factors could impact nutrient criteria we focused specifically on the impacts of changes in temperature in the absence of other concurrent changes such as light intensity and extremely weather events because these impacts cannot be avoided through management efforts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study 17 lakes and 9 reservoirs in mainland china were investigated to identify the impact of climate change on nutrient criteria fig 1 table s1 supporting information si presents information on the 26 studied lakes and reservoirs the analysis of the tn tp ratios indicated that all studied lakes and reservoirs were primarily phosphorus limited and that the growth of algal was more sensitive to changes in phosphorus than nitrogen schindler et al 2008 wu et al 2017 2 2 data collection water quality data for the 26 lakes and reservoirs were obtained from the china national environmental monitoring centre tn tp and chl a concentrations were determined at several sites in each lake and reservoir during monthly routine monitoring from 2006 to 2010 the tn tp and chl a concentrations were analyzed in a laboratory using the standard testing procedures recommended by the ministry of environmental protection of china prc mep 2002 these procedures are summarized here tn was determined using a spectrophotometric procedure after the alkaline persulfate digestion of the sample tp was measured using a spectrophotometric procedure after the acid potassium persulfate digestion of the sample the detection limits for tp and tn were 0 01 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively for chl a analysis a certain number of samples were filtered and blocked algae by filter membrane grinded and broken algae cells and chlorophyll was extracted by acetone solution after centrifugation separation the absorbance of the extract was determined at 750 664 647 and 630 nm wavelengths respectively the concentration of chlorophyll in water was calculated according to the formula to maintain the validity of the data observations below the limits of detection were replaced with one half the detection limit for the given variable as the processed data were sufficiently accurate to determine descriptive statistics epa 2006 huo et al 2013 the monthly averages of the variables in each lake or reservoir were calculated as the model input dataset in this study meteorological data simulated by three global climate models gcms of the cmip5 under four greenhouse gas emission scenarios were downloaded from the world climate research programme the three gcms giss e3 h hadgem2 es and mri cgcm3 table 1 were expected to perform well for the simulation of surface air temperature in china hu et al 2014 yan et al 2013 the ensemble mean values of these three gcms were calculated using equal weights which could model the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of meteorological data better than a single gcm at a regional scale zhang et al 2016b the observation dataset cn05 1 obtained from the china meteorological administration was used to evaluate the performance of the gcms in simulating surface air temperature climatology in china wu and gao 2013 xu et al 2009 monthly average surface air temperature tas c was selected as the climatic factor based on spearman correlation analysis fig 2 and variance inflation factors see text s1 in si four greenhouse gas emission scenarios table 2 rcp2 6 mitigation scenario rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 stabilization scenarios and rcp8 5 business as usual scenario with no climate policy were used to predict the future nutrient criteria moss et al 2010 2 3 statistical methods the relationships among chl a nutrient variables and meteorological variables were analyzed with spearman correlation analyses performed using spss ver 20 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa and r 3 4 4 r core development team see si meteorological data were processed using arcgis ver 10 2 esri redlands ca usa and matlab 2017b mathworks natick ma usa taylor diagram was plotted in matlab 2017b to provide a concise statistical summary of how well the three individual gcms and three model ensemble matched the observation data in terms of their correlation root mean square difference and standard variances taylor 2001 the gams g1 g2 and g3 were performed with r ver 3 4 4 software using the gmcv package to combine nutrient concentrations and tas as the explanatory variables and chl a as the response variable gams are nonparametric regression models meaning that the relationships between the stressor and response variables are established by the data rather than an a priori statistical distribution alcaraz et al 2011 grieve et al 2017 the smooth terms of the stressor variables were simulated by thin plate regression spline and the parameters of the smooth function were selected via synthesis considering the generalized cross validation gcv criterion and the akaike s information criterion aic to ensure that the models could explain most information of variables while avoiding over fitting song et al 2015 wood 2017 the smooth function representing the relative importance of each stressor variable to the response variables paerl et al 2016 was used to calculate the contribution of the stressor variable to the variation in the response variable the numeric nutrient criteria were derived from these models using fixed response variable values epa 2010 huo et al 2014b and the standard error was used to calculate the prediction interval of the numeric criteria fahrmeir and lang 2001 marra and wood 2012 to prevent under and over protection 5 μg l chl a was considered as a reasonable limit to ensure the safety of lakes and reservoirs huo et al 2014a nutrient criteria should be set so as to protect lakes and reservoirs during the warmest period of the year therefore the air temperature in july was selected as the fixed climatic factor to derive the nutrient criteria which represents the highest monthly air temperature for the studied lakes and reservoirs according to the ipcc variations in climate can lead to differences in the impacts at an interdecadal scale bindoff et al 2013 the future interdecadal fluctuation of temperature under different scenarios was calculated starting in 2006 to predict the numeric nutrient criteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variations in nutrient criteria under future climate change based on the tn tp ratios the studied lakes and reservoirs were primarily phosphorus limited indicating that phosphorus is the primary restrictive nutrient for algal growth however previous studies have shown that nitrogen is equally likely to limit algal growth in inland waters lewis et al 2011 based on these considerations three gams were developed using chl a as the response variable and tn tp and tas as the explanatory variables for the period of 2006 2010 table 3 all parameters in all three models were significant p 0 001 and the aic and gcv results indicated that these explanatory variables were suitable for the models contributions of temperature tn and tp to chl a based on gams were described in text s2 see in si g1 and g2 were developed by considering only single nutrient stressor variables and one climatic factor the nutrient criteria from 1996 to 2005 simulated by the gams were 0 88 tn mg l and 0 021 tp mg l which were considered as the historical nutrient criteria the anticipated changes in future temperature patterns under the business as usual scenario could lead to large and robust decreases in the tn and tp criteria by the end of the century fig 3 without considering the impact of tp the tn criterion was 5 71 13 69 and 21 71 lower by the end of this century under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 scenarios respectively than the historical criterion by contrast there was a sharp decrease in the tn criterion under the rcp8 5 scenario to 0 47 mg l by the end of this century 46 17 lower than the historical criterion the predicted tp criterion exhibited a similar trend and the predicted tp criterion decreased by 3 81 7 62 9 52 and 15 24 of the historical criterion by the end of the century under the four scenarios respectively overall the tp criterion exhibited a smaller range in variation than the tn criterion g3 model was developed by considering both nitrogen and phosphorus as stressor variables and temperature as the climatic factor to simulate the impact of the covariation of tn and tp on chl a table 3 the nitrogen or phosphorus criteria were estimated by fixing the other nutrient variable using the results of g1 and g2 at a given time the nutrient criteria of 1996 2005 simulated by g3 were considered as the historical criteria by fixing the tp criterion using the results of g2 the historical tn criterion simulated by g3 was 1 89 mg l which was much higher than that of g1 although declining trends in the predicted tn criterion were observed under the different scenarios no sharp decline was observed fig 4 a the minimum predicted tn criterion of 1 80 mg l was observed at the end of the century under rcp8 5 which was only 4 82 lower than the historical criterion the historical tp criterion simulated by g3 was 0 034 mg l which was higher than that of g2 g3 yielded similar trends in the tp criterion as g2 fig 4b in particular the tp criterion under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 was 4 65 12 21 17 73 and 37 50 lower than the historical criterion by the end of the century respectively in the case of strict control of tn the tp criterion still declined sharply under the influence of increasing air temperature these results indicated that under strict control of tp loading the tn criterion exhibited a very slow decreasing trend under global warming this suggests that there would be little risk of algal overgrowth under strict tp loading control even in water with high tn concentrations under future warmer climates therefore strict control of tp would be more advantageous for suppressing cyanobacterial blooms than tn control in a future warmer climate this may be because phosphorus is often the key limiting factor for phytoplankton growth and controlling phosphorus loading is a primary goal for lake reservoir management schindler et al 2008 the predicted nutrient criteria of g3 were higher than those of g2 indicating that under a dual nutrient management strategy each nutrient could be controlled under less strict criteria than under single nutrient management strategies similarly a recent study paerl et al 2016 of integrated nutrient loading analyses nutrient addition bioassays and nutrient cycling recommended that a dual nutrient management strategy was much more reasonable than single nutrient strategies 3 2 analysis of the impacts of climate change on nutrient criteria the trends in nutrient criteria were in contrast to those of temperature fig 5 in response to climate change indicating that stricter nutrient criteria should be set with increasing air temperature for instance at a given nutrient concentration increasing temperatures are expected to increase nutrient availability to cyanobacteria water temperature is highly correlated with primary productivity and affects cyanobacterial development wang et al 2016 moreover higher temperatures promote the growth of microcystis which have been found to have optimal temperatures for growth and photosynthesis at or above 25 c davis et al 2009 therefore rising temperatures could offer a distinct growth advantage to microcystis over eukaryotic primary producers under eutrophic conditions in addition higher temperatures could decrease the viscosity of surface water increasing the sedimentation rate of eukaryotic phytoplankton and further strengthening the competitive advantage of microcystis because cyanobacteria can regulate their buoyancy to optimize nutrient and light acquisition paerl and huisman 2009 the results indicated that some lakes with nutrient levels below the criteria could develop cyanobacterial dominances and experience blooms under warmer climates even without further rises in nutrient inputs moreover the predicted tn criteria decreased much more rapidly than the tp criteria in response to warming indicating that efforts to reduce tp inputs would generally be more effective than efforts to reduce tn inputs grizzetti et al 2012 3 3 uncertainty analysis surface air temperature is an important climatic factor for lakes since it can have direct or indirect influences the physicochemical variables of lakes dong et al 2012 wu et al 2014 in this study the ensemble simulated averages of three gcms were applied to establish the gams and infer nutrient criteria under future warmer climates comparing the cn05 1 observation dataset with the gcm results with a taylor diagram fig 6 the selected gcms appeared to exhibit good performance in simulating surface air temperature in china during 1996 2005 moreover the standard deviation ratios of the simulated gcm data to the cn05 1 observation data were between 1 03 and 1 22 and the correlation coefficients between the simulated and observation data were all above 0 9 indicating that the spatial distribution of the simulated gcm data was similar to that of the observation data taylor 2001 hence the three model ensemble values could accurately simulate the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of surface air temperature in china in the absence of human activities other environment factors aside from tp tn and temperature e g light intensity water color and suspended sediment can promote or inhibit algal growth huo et al 2014a light intensity is an important condition for phytoplankton growth which is related to the uptake of phosphorus and other micronutrients paerl et al 2011 however no significant changes on the growth rate of phytoplankton are observed at light intensities greater than 150 200 μe m2s tian et al 2018 hence light intensity could be ignored in this study moreover water color can change the light available for photosynthesis and increased suspended sediments which often coincides with increased n and p concentrations also reduces light availability us epa 2010 therefore these factors should be considered in future models climate change has altered the assemblage structure of phytoplankton and production of microcystin davis et al 2009 sienkiewicz et al 2017 wood et al 2016 in particular climate driven changes in water temperature can modify phytoplankton communities by favoring bloom forming cyanobacteria which can exploit warmer conditions havens and paerl 2015 sienkiewicz et al 2017 reported that climate warming drove changes in diatom species composition and almost all planktonic taxa abruptly decreased in frequency which became dominated by benthic forms in spitsbergen lake at the beginning of the 20th century therefore changes in algal composition can cause major alterations in toxin concentrations and compositions during cyanobacterial blooms yu et al 2014 moreover positive relationships p 0 001 have been identified between microcystin and water temperature and the sensitivity of temperature is related to the nutrient levels in the water shi et al 2017 wood et al 2016 for instance davis et al 2009 showed that with continually enhancing surface water temperatures in laboratory experiments toxic microcystis exhibited more significant growth rates than non toxic microcystis and could synthesize more microcystin synthetase suggesting that climate warming may additively promote the growth of toxic rather than non toxic populations of microcystis leading to blooms with higher microcystin contents davis et al 2009 the impacts of climate change on the assemblage structure of phytoplankton and microcystin production should be carefully considered within the context of evolving eutrophication management strategies in addition the release of internal nitrogen and phosphorus loads in lakes should be also attracted much attention which hinder the improvement of water quality and sustain the eutrophication for decades even if external p loading source has been effectively reduced the rate of sediment p release will increases with the increase of temperature ding et al 2018 extreme weather events ewes driven by climate change have a more important role in extended bloom formation after nutrient levels are reduced wang et al 2016 ewes such as heavy rainfall events extreme heat and large storms can increase nutrient loading primary productivity and sediment resuspension promoting the formation of cyanobacterial blooms couture et al 2018 ouyang et al 2017 hence corresponding nutrient risk thresholds must be determined to ensure that the water quality of lakes and reservoirs escapes the threat of eutrophication under the impact of ewes moreover the difference of hydraulic retention time between different lakes and reservoirs will also affect the change of nutrient nutrient with the increase of temperature further studies should consider the effect of hydraulic residence time on nutrient criteria 4 conclusion the impact of climate change on nutrient criteria was estimated with gams using chl a as the response variable and tn tp and tas as the explanatory variables the results indicated that future climate change could significantly impact nutrient criteria in lakes and reservoirs at lower temperatures less stringent nutrient criteria could be applied due to the lower nutrient availability to cyanobacteria by contrast temperature increases could significantly enhance chl a concentrations suggesting that lakes with nutrient concentrations within the existing nutrient criteria could develop a dominance of cyanobacteria and experience blooms under warmer future scenarios even without further increases in nutrient inputs to ensure that cyanobacteria occurrence frequencies remain low stricter nutrient criteria should be developed to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication under a future warmer climate in particular the strict control of tp would be more advantageous to suppress cyanobacterial blooms than that of tn in the lakes and reservoirs studied moreover nutrient risk thresholds should be determined to ensure that the water quality of lakes and reservoirs escapes from the threat of eutrophication under the impacts of ewes overall climate change should be considered in eutrophication mitigation strategies and should be taken into consideration in the determination of nutrient criteria acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and development program of

6784,climate change has the potential to exacerbate eutrophication and the risk of harmful algal blooms in lakes periodic adjustment of nutrient criteria as the cornerstone of eutrophication control and water quality management is expected to help mitigate the impact of climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms the nutrient criteria that do not threaten the function of the water body determined with generalized additive models gams were 0 88 mg l for total nitrogen tn and 0 021 mg l for total phosphorus tp during the period of 1996 2005 based on 26 lakes and reservoirs in china climate change induced temperature increases will substantially reduce the required nutrient criteria by 46 17 for tn and 15 24 for tp in lakes and reservoirs by the end of the century under the business as usual scenario the results indicate that some lakes that currently meet the nutrient criteria could become dominated by cyanobacteria and experience blooms in a warmer future even without increases in nutrient inputs therefore as climate change persists nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication strict control of tp would be particularly advantageous to suppress algal blooms it is imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future climate changes on nutrient criteria and that nutrient criteria are periodically modified the corresponding nutrient risk thresholds should be determined to ensure that lakes and reservoirs escape the threat of harmful algal blooms under the impact of extreme weather events keywords climate change lake reservoir generalized additive model algae bloom eutrophication nutrient criteria 1 introduction eutrophication caused by substantial increases in nutrient loads from agricultural run off industrial activity and wastewater treatment facilities is a growing global problem moreover global warming is expected to increase the frequency intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many aquatic ecosystems worldwide couture et al 2018 huisman et al 2018 michalak 2016 xia et al 2012 climate change can both directly and indirectly affect the hydrology aquatic environment and ecosystem structure and function of lakes and reservoirs for instance surface runoff can be influenced by changes in precipitation with subsequent impacts on nutrient loads from catchments which is an important source of nutrients for phytoplankton couture et al 2018 xia et al 2015 moreover increasing temperatures are expected to expand the thermal stratification period deepen the thermocline and promote earlier onset and proliferation of algal blooms which could threaten aquatic ecosystems deng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2014 nutrient reduction strategies aimed at alleviating eutrophication may be weakened by the impacts of climate change on the aquatic environment havens and paerl 2015 given that climate change is expected to severely affect the ability to control blooms and in some cases could make it near impossible for example total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations in lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china decreased by 42 5 and 31 2 from 2007 to 2015 respectively but the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms did not significantly decrease due to climate driven changes yang et al 2016 thus the nutrient load especially internal load must be further reduced while the temperature is increased chen et al 2018 nutrient criteria represent the maximum acceptable concentrations of nutrients that do not threaten the function of the waterbody which is crucial for cultural eutrophication control and lake and reservoir water quality protection huo et al 2018 kelly

climatic factor to derive the nutrient criteria which represents the highest monthly air temperature for the studied lakes and reservoirs according to the ipcc variations in climate can lead to differences in the impacts at an interdecadal scale bindoff et al 2013 the future interdecadal fluctuation of temperature under different scenarios was calculated starting in 2006 to predict the numeric nutrient criteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variations in nutrient criteria under future climate change based on the tn tp ratios the studied lakes and reservoirs were primarily phosphorus limited indicating that phosphorus is the primary restrictive nutrient for algal growth however previous studies have shown that nitrogen is equally likely to limit algal growth in inland waters lewis et al 2011 based on these considerations three gams were developed using chl a as the response variable and tn tp and tas as the explanatory variables for the period of 2006 2010 table 3 all parameters in all three models were significant p 0 001 and the aic and gcv results indicated that these explanatory variables were suitable for the models contributions of temperature tn and tp to chl a based on gams were described in text s2 see in si g1 and g2 were developed by considering only single nutrient stressor variables and one climatic factor the nutrient criteria from 1996 to 2005 simulated by the gams were 0 88 tn mg l and 0 021 tp mg l which were considered as the historical nutrient criteria the anticipated changes in future temperature patterns under the business as usual scenario could lead to large and robust decreases in the tn and tp criteria by the end of the century fig 3 without considering the impact of tp the tn criterion was 5 71 13 69 and 21 71 lower by the end of this century under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 scenarios respectively than the historical criterion by contrast there was a sharp decrease in the tn criterion under the rcp8 5 scenario to 0 47 mg l by the end of this century 46 17 lower than the historical criterion the predicted tp criterion exhibited a similar trend and the predicted tp criterion decreased by 3 81 7 62 9 52 and 15 24 of the historical criterion by the end of the century under the four scenarios respectively overall the tp criterion exhibited a smaller range in variation than the tn criterion g3 model was developed by considering both nitrogen and phosphorus as stressor variables and temperature as the climatic factor to simulate the impact of the covariation of tn and tp on chl a table 3 the nitrogen or phosphorus criteria were estimated by fixing the other nutrient variable using the results of g1 and g2 at a given time the nutrient criteria of 1996 2005 simulated by g3 were considered as the historical criteria by fixing the tp criterion using the results of g2 the historical tn criterion simulated by g3 was 1 89 mg l which was much higher than that of g1 although declining trends in the predicted tn criterion were observed under the different scenarios no sharp decline was observed fig 4 a the minimum predicted tn criterion of 1 80 mg l was observed at the end of the century under rcp8 5 which was only 4 82 lower than the historical criterion the historical tp criterion simulated by g3 was 0 034 mg l which was higher than that of g2 g3 yielded similar trends in the tp criterion as g2 fig 4b in particular the tp criterion under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 was 4 65 12 21 17 73 and 37 50 lower than the historical criterion by the end of the century respectively in the case of strict control of tn the tp criterion still declined sharply under the influence of increasing air temperature these results indicated that under strict control of tp loading the tn criterion exhibited a very slow decreasing trend under global warming this suggests that there would be little risk of algal overgrowth under strict tp loading control even in water with high tn concentrations under future warmer climates therefore strict control of tp would be more advantageous for suppressing cyanobacterial blooms than tn control in a future warmer climate this may be because phosphorus is often the key limiting factor for phytoplankton growth and controlling phosphorus loading is a primary goal for lake reservoir management schindler et al 2008 the predicted nutrient criteria of g3 were higher than those of g2 indicating that under a dual nutrient management strategy each nutrient could be controlled under less strict criteria than under single nutrient management strategies similarly a recent study paerl et al 2016 of integrated nutrient loading analyses nutrient addition bioassays and nutrient cycling recommended that a dual nutrient management strategy was much more reasonable than single nutrient strategies 3 2 analysis of the impacts of climate change on nutrient criteria the trends in nutrient criteria were in contrast to those of temperature fig 5 in response to climate change indicating that stricter nutrient criteria should be set with increasing air temperature for instance at a given nutrient concentration increasing temperatures are expected to increase nutrient availability to cyanobacteria water temperature is highly correlated with primary productivity and affects cyanobacterial development wang et al 2016 moreover higher temperatures promote the growth of microcystis which have been found to have optimal temperatures for growth and photosynthesis at or above 25 c davis et al 2009 therefore rising temperatures could offer a distinct growth advantage to microcystis over eukaryotic primary producers under eutrophic conditions in addition higher temperatures could decrease the viscosity of surface water increasing the sedimentation rate of eukaryotic phytoplankton and further strengthening the competitive advantage of microcystis because cyanobacteria can regulate their buoyancy to optimize nutrient and light acquisition paerl and huisman 2009 the results indicated that some lakes with nutrient levels below the criteria could develop cyanobacterial dominances and experience blooms under warmer climates even without further rises in nutrient inputs moreover the predicted tn criteria decreased much more rapidly than the tp criteria in response to warming indicating that efforts to reduce tp inputs would generally be more effective than efforts to reduce tn inputs grizzetti et al 2012 3 3 uncertainty analysis surface air temperature is an important climatic factor for lakes since it can have direct or indirect influences the physicochemical variables of lakes dong et al 2012 wu et al 2014 in this study the ensemble simulated averages of three gcms were applied to establish the gams and infer nutrient criteria under future warmer climates comparing the cn05 1 observation dataset with the gcm results with a taylor diagram fig 6 the selected gcms appeared to exhibit good performance in simulating surface air temperature in china during 1996 2005 moreover the standard deviation ratios of the simulated gcm data to the cn05 1 observation data were between 1 03 and 1 22 and the correlation coefficients between the simulated and observation data were all above 0 9 indicating that the spatial distribution of the simulated gcm data was similar to that of the observation data taylor 2001 hence the three model ensemble values could accurately simulate the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of surface air temperature in china in the absence of human activities other environment factors aside from tp tn and temperature e g light intensity water color and suspended sediment can promote or inhibit algal growth huo et al 2014a light intensity is an important condition for phytoplankton growth which is related to the uptake of phosphorus and other micronutrients paerl et al 2011 however no significant changes on the growth rate of phytoplankton are observed at light intensities greater than 150 200 μe m2s tian et al 2018 hence light intensity could be ignored in this study moreover water color can change the light available for photosynthesis and increased suspended sediments which often coincides with increased n and p concentrations also reduces light availability us epa 2010 therefore these factors should be considered in future models climate change has altered the assemblage structure of phytoplankton and production of microcystin davis et al 2009 sienkiewicz et al 2017 wood et al 2016 in particular climate driven changes in water temperature can modify phytoplankton communities by favoring bloom forming cyanobacteria which can exploit warmer conditions havens and paerl 2015 sienkiewicz et al 2017 reported that climate warming drove changes in diatom species composition and almost all planktonic taxa abruptly decreased in frequency which became dominated by benthic forms in spitsbergen lake at the beginning of the 20th century therefore changes in algal composition can cause major alterations in toxin concentrations and compositions during cyanobacterial blooms yu et al 2014 moreover positive relationships p 0 001 have been identified between microcystin and water temperature and the sensitivity of temperature is related to the nutrient levels in the water shi et al 2017 wood et al 2016 for instance davis et al 2009 showed that with continually enhancing surface water temperatures in laboratory experiments toxic microcystis exhibited more significant growth rates than non toxic microcystis and could synthesize more microcystin synthetase suggesting that climate warming may additively promote the growth of toxic rather than non toxic populations of microcystis leading to blooms with higher microcystin contents davis et al 2009 the impacts of climate change on the assemblage structure of phytoplankton and microcystin production should be carefully considered within the context of evolving eutrophication management strategies in addition the release of internal nitrogen and phosphorus loads in lakes should be also attracted much attention which hinder the improvement of water quality and sustain the eutrophication for decades even if external p loading source has been effectively reduced the rate of sediment p release will increases with the increase of temperature ding et al 2018 extreme weather events ewes driven by climate change have a more important role in extended bloom formation after nutrient levels are reduced wang et al 2016 ewes such as heavy rainfall events extreme heat and large storms can increase nutrient loading primary productivity and sediment resuspension promoting the formation of cyanobacterial blooms couture et al 2018 ouyang et al 2017 hence corresponding nutrient risk thresholds must be determined to ensure that the water quality of lakes and reservoirs escapes the threat of eutrophication under the impact of ewes moreover the difference of hydraulic retention time between different lakes and reservoirs will also affect the change of nutrient nutrient with the increase of temperature further studies should consider the effect of hydraulic residence time on nutrient criteria 4 conclusion the impact of climate change on nutrient criteria was estimated with gams using chl a as the response variable and tn tp and tas as the explanatory variables the results indicated that future climate change could significantly impact nutrient criteria in lakes and reservoirs at lower temperatures less stringent nutrient criteria could be applied due to the lower nutrient availability to cyanobacteria by contrast temperature increases could significantly enhance chl a concentrations suggesting that lakes with nutrient concentrations within the existing nutrient criteria could develop a dominance of cyanobacteria and experience blooms under warmer future scenarios even without further increases in nutrient inputs to ensure that cyanobacteria occurrence frequencies remain low stricter nutrient criteria should be developed to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication under a future warmer climate in particular the strict control of tp would be more advantageous to suppress cyanobacterial blooms than that of tn in the lakes and reservoirs studied moreover nutrient risk thresholds should be determined to ensure that the water quality of lakes and reservoirs escapes from the threat of eutrophication under the impacts of ewes overall climate change should be considered in eutrophication mitigation strategies and should be taken into consideration in the determination of nutrient criteria acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and development program of
