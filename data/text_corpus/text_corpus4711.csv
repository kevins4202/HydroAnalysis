compares the motion response of a floating rectangular cylinder under freak and irregular waves and quantifies the difference through experimental measurements this provides a basis for understanding the mechanism of interaction between freak waves and structures 2 experiments 2 1 experimental setup the tests were carried out in a wave flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology the flume is 60 m long 4 0 m wide and 2 5 m deep the wave generation system is hydro servo irregular wave maker system and it generates waves with a wave period ranging from 0 5s to 5 0s at the other end of the flume an absorbing beach is installed for wave dissipation the motion responses were measured by a non touched 6dof degree of freedom measurement system consisting of dual ccd cameras and a data acquisition system three light markers were arranged in a plane and fixed on the top of the cylinder to track the motion behaviors by the dual ccd cameras the images of the markers were continuously acquired by the two cameras at 30 frames per second and the signals were processed to recover the instantaneous position of each marker in a calibrated coordinate system the mooring tension was measured by a tension sensor with an accuracy of 0 1 n the wave heights were measured by ds30 waves measuring system which controlled 64 wave gauges synchronously the wave gauges were calibrated before tests with an accuracy is 0 1 mm 2 2 model design and experimental parameters the floater is an airtight rectangular cylinder made of acrylic fig 1 the cylinder is a rectangular solid with a height of h 62 cm and a square base with a side length of d 50 cm the sharp corners of the cylinder were grinded to smooth arcs with a radius of r 6 6 cm the clump weight was set on the bottom of the cylinder to achieve the design center of gravity cog center of buoyancy cob and draft the prototype of the rectangular cylinder with the smooth arc corners is a floating moored structure for 30 000 ton vessel operating in a wind farm in china the hydrodynamic parameters of the model are presented in table 1 the floating rectangular cylinder was anchored by four mooring lines as illustrated in fig 2 each mooring line is made of nylon ropes to simulate the weight length and tension deformation curve the length of each mooring line is 4 m and the relation between the tension tm and deformation δs is 1 t m c p d p δ s s n λ 3 t m mooring tension of the model cable n c p elasticity coefficient of prototype cable with nylon rope of

similarity an example of the tension deformation curve for the prototype and model is presented in fig 1 it can be observed that excellent agreement was achieved between the model and prototype fig 2 shows the layout of the model in the wave flume mooring pattern and mooring configuration the lower ends of the mooring lines were anchored on the bottom of the wave flume the top ends together with tension sensors were connected to the four corners of the rectangular cylinder and each connecting point was 25 cm measured from the bottom of the cylinder for three dimensional floater the motion responses are sway surge heave roll pitch and yaw for two dimensional case three motion components are investigated surge heave and pitch to ensure the scope of investigation in a practical level dimentional analysis is performed firstly it is assumed that the motion response depends on the following variables the dimensions of the rectangular cylinder the side length of d the moulded height of h hydrodynamic parameters of the floating body refer to table 1 and wave parameters the significant wave height hs peak period tp freak wave parameters αn and spectral pattern etc generally the characteristics of the freak waves can be defined by four parameters klinting and sand 1987 α1 hmax hs α2 hmax hmax 1 α3 hmax hmax 1 α4 ηmax hmax where hmax is the maximum wave height in the measured sequence hmax 1 the wave height before the maximum wave height hmax 1 the wave height after the maximum wave height ηmax is surface elevation of the maximum wave height in the irregular wave sequence in the experiments jonswap spectrum was applied with a water depth of d 1 4 m and a draft of floating body of h0 34 cm to compare the experimental results collected under freak and irregular wave conditions the same spectrum with identical spectral parameters were adopted in the wave simulation in the current study the freak wave was generated using a random wave train combined with two transient wave trains pei et al 2007 based on the above parameters the dimensional analysis can be performed as 2 бm fm h d tp t0m αn where m 1 3 m 1 бm surge d t0m t0surge m 2 бm heave d t0m t0heave m 3 бm pitch t0m t0pitch the detailed wave parameters in the experiments are summarized in table 2 2 3 analysis methodology firstly the design waves were calibrated at the center of the model in the wave flume the model was then installed and moored with initial tension of 1 1 2 n the measurements for each test typically lasted for approximately 100 waves and were performed 2 or 3 times to ensure repeatability during each test the motions and mooring tensions were recorded synchronously with a frequency of 30 hz the measured data can be analyzed statistically in time domain and spectrually in frequency domain statistical analysis in time domain provides the maximum value 1 10 value 1 3 value effective value average value and other statistical characteristics 3 analysis of experiments results 3 1 comparison on the time history of the wave series and motion responses with identical significant wave height hs and peak period tp hs 13 62 cm tp 1 41s using jonswap spectrum two wave series were generated during the experiment one was a freak wave series with freak parameters of α1 2 11 α2 1 72 α3 2 03 α4 0 62 as shown in fig 3 a1 the other was a random wave series with freak parameters of the most critical wave α1 1 51 α2 1 40 α3 1 45 α4 0 61 as shown in fig 3 a2 the corresponding motion responses surge heave and pitch are illustrated in fig 3 b d under freak and irregular waves respectively it is observed that the low frequency components of surge occur under both freak and irregular wave in particular the observed critical surge in freak wave series is significant larger than that under random waves to understand the difference the critical wave heights and motion components in fig 3 were zoomed in and shown in fig 4 it shows that the maximum surge and heave of the floater were observed at the phase with the occurrence of the freak wave however similar phenomenon was not observed for pitch it indicates that the freak wave has direct effect on the surge and heave of the floater while not for pitch the maximum surge and heave under the freak wave condition are significantly larger than those under irregular wave condition 3 2 effect of relative wave height to investigate the effect of the relative wave heights two wave series were generated with the identical peak period of tp 1 4 s and relative wave heights of hs d 0 03 0 1 using jonswap spectrum the freak wave series are generated with the characteristics of 2 01 α1 2 20 1 71 α2 2 15 1 35 α3 2 13 0 53 α4 0 62 and the random waves are generated with 1 51 α1 1 59 1 33 α2 1 69 1 92 α3 1 99 0 51 α4 0 63 in fig 5 the extreme surge heave and pitch are plotted and compared between freak and irregular wave conditions it is shown that the statistical characteristic of surge increases with the relative wave heights for both freak and irregular waves but the extreme surge under freak waves is significantly larger while the statistical average value of surge in freak wave series is identical to that under random wave series it indicates that the extreme surge depends on the type of wave series comparing the surge and heave under freak and irregular waves in fig 5 a and b the tendency of statistical characteristics varying with the relative wave height is indentical although the range of variation is not exactly the same similarly the dimensionless effective value and average value of heave under freak and irregular waves are almost indentical fig 5 c shows that there is no significant increment in maximum pitch under freak waves than that under irregular waves with hs d 0 05 it is different from the surge and heave the maximum pitch transfer from each other alternatively with relative wave heights more information can be obtained by plotting the motions under freak waves normalized by the motions under random waves against the relative wave heights the parameters of surge f surge i heave f heave i and pitch f pitch i are the pair extreme value for the surge heave and pitch under freak and irregular waves respectively the graph is shown in fig 6 with hs d 0 03 0 1 in the range of hs d 0 03 0 1 the maximum surge heave and pitch under freak waves are 30 60 20 40 and 20 33 respectively larger than those under irregular waves it should also be noted that the extreme pitch in freak waves is almost identical to that under random waves in the relative wave heights range of hs d 0 06 0 1 the surge usually has wave frequency component and low frequency component which probably caused by the non linear towing force however the heave is dominated by the wave frequency component only fig 6 shows the same trend of the specific value of the maximum surge and heave under freak wave and irregular waves both decrease with the relative wave height this can eliminate the possibility that the phenomenon is caused by the low frequency motions of the floating body on the other hand the motion of the floater is related to the mooring pattern and material of mooring ropes using nylon material when the displacement of the floating body increases the rapid growth of the cable tension will limit the movement significantly in addition there are some cases with pitch f pitch i 1 in fig 6 the probably reasons could be that there is no one to one relationships between the maximum pitch and the maximum wave height under irregular waves fig 5 the pitch under the maximum wave height is related to the posture of the floater at the moment it depends on the wave sequence before the maximum wave height even if the maximum wave heights and the corresponding period are identical the maximum pitches could be different in other words the maximum pitches may have insignificant difference under irregular waves with various maximum wave heights fig 7 c this has been pointed out in previous studies i e bennett et al 2013 3 3 effect of relative period to investigate the effect of relative wave period two wave series were generated with the identical wave height of hs 8 cm and relative periods of tp t0surge 0 114 0 310 tp t0heave 0 8 2 2 tp t0pitch 0 5 1 6 using jonswap spectrum the freak wave series are generated with the characteristics of 2 01 α1 2 20 1 40 α2 2 14 1 40 α3 2 37 0 51 α4 0 66 and the random waves are generated with 1 45 α1 1 53 1 06 α2 2 16 1 29 α3 1 99 0 51 α4 0 64 under freak and irregular waves fig 7 a b and c illustrate the dimensionless statistical motions versus the relative period for surge heave and pitch respectively it is observed from fig 7 a that for both freak and irregular wave conditions the variation of the dimensionless surge with the relative period shows the same trend the surge increases with the relative periods and reaches the local peak at approximately tp t0surge 0 14 tp t0heave 1 this may be due to the peak spectral period of the wave is consistent with the natural period of heave the maximum surge is affected by the resonant phenomenon of heave it then decreases and then increases slightly again towards larger tp t0surge however the maximum surge observed under freak wave condition is approximately 1 5 times to that under irregular waves in fig 7 b the variation of the statistical characteristic of heave with the relative period is oscillating with increasing relative period tp t0heave however the critical heave under freak waves is significantly larger than that under irregular waves the extreme heave occurs at the resonance period of tp t0heave 1 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 2 2 2 3 respectively however the resonance period under random waves are tp t0heave 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 respectively fig 7 a and b shows that the variation of statistical characteristic of surge and heave with the relative periods are different which could be attributed to the various natural periods of surge and heave for the maximum heave the impact of freak wave action is larger than that under irregular waves it is observed from fig 7 c for both freak and irregular wave conditions the variation of the statistical characteristic of pitch are generally the same and with approximately the same resonance period of tp t0pitch 1 the minor difference is the pitch under freak waves oscillating with the relative period tp t0pitch this could be attributed to the freak wave parameters which have an impact on pitch more information can be obtained by plotting the motions under freak waves normalized by the motions under random waves against the relative periods the graph is shown in fig 8 with surge heave and pitch periods of tp t0surge 0 114 0 310 tp t0heave 0 8 2 2 and tp t0pitch 0 5 1 6 respectively it is observed that the maximum variation occurs at the resonance period of the floater under both freak and irregular waves the variation of surge heave and pitch are 44 40 and 30 respectively 3 4 effect of freak wave parameters in this section the effect of the four freak wave parameters α1 α4 on the motion responses are discussed respectively 3 4 1 the effect of α1 to investigate the effect of the freak wave parameter α1 wave series were generated with various α1 α1 1 7 2 83 all wave series were generated under constant wave height of hs 8 cm peak period of tp 1 6s and other parameters of α2 1 30 1 52 α3 1 42 1 60 α4 0 51 0 56 in fig 9 the extreme surge heave and pitch are plotted against the freak wave parameter α1 and compared between freak and irregular wave conditions the irregular waves are generated with the characteristics of 1 57 α1 1 60 2 15 α2 2 31 1 92 α3 1 99 0 54 α4 0 55 in fig 9 a the surge of the rectangular cylinder is increases with α1 almost linearly which indicates that α1 has significant effect on surge with α1 2 2 83 the maximum surge under freak waves is 1 4 2 5 times larger than that under irregular waves fig 9 b shows that the heave of interceptive rectangular cylinder increases with the freak wave parameter α1 and reaches the local peak at approximately α1 2 3 it then decreases mildly with father increment with α1 2 2 83 the maximum heave under freak waves is 1 4 1 6 times larger than that under irregular waves fig 9 c shows that the pitch of interceptive rectangular cylinder has minor dependence on the freak wave parameter α1 it depends on the wave sequence before the maximum wave height in the range of α1 2 2 83 the maximum pitch under freak waves increases 30 than that under irregular waves 3 4 2 the effect of α2 and α3 freak wave parameters α2 and α3 reflect the characteristics of the waves before and after the maximum wave respectively the effect of α2 and α3 on motion responses are expected to be similar and thus discussed together test sequence 1 with α2 1 7 2 15 peak period tp 1 6s relative wave height hs d 0 03 0 1 and the other three freak wave parameters α1 2 0 2 2 α3 1 92 1 99 α4 0 53 0 62 the test results demonstrating the effect of α2 and α3 on motion responses are shown in fig 10 a and b test sequence 2 with α2 1 14 2 14 significant wave height of hs 8 cm relative period tp t0surge 0 114 0 310 tp t0heave 0 8 2 2 tp t0pitch 0 5 1 6 and the other three freak wave parameters are α1 2 0 2 2 α3 1 35 2 37 α4 0 5 0 66 the test results demonstrating the effect of α2 and α3 on motion responses are shown in fig 11 a and b it is observed from figs 10 and 11 that the motion responses of the floater fluctuate with the variation of the freak wave parameters α2 and α3 which suggests α2 and α3 have no significant effects on the motion response 3 4 3 the effect of α4 to investigate the effect of α4 on the motion response the same analysis method is chosen as α2 and α3 the results are shown in fig 12 a and b respectively it is observed from fig 12 that the surge and heave fluctuate with the variation of the freak wave parameter α4 which suggests α4 has no significant impact on the motion response with of α4 0 66 however the pitch motions for the two wave series are different the results of sequence 1 show that the pitch increases with α4 which could be attributed to the relative wave height of hs d 0 03 0 1 the increment of pitch is caused by the increment of the relative wave height the results of sequence 2 show that the pitch fluctuates with α4 which shall be investigated further in future studies 4 conclusion in this study the motion response of a rectangular cylinder under the freak and random wave conditions was investigated experimentally extensive tests were conducted to quantify the effect of relative wave height period and freak wave parameters and the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 given identical wave spectrum the maximum motion response of the mooring rectangular cylinder differs substantially under the action of the freak versus random waves the difference is closely correlated with the relative wave height relative period and freak wave parameter α1 2 the freak wave has direct effect on the surge and heave of the floater but not for pitch the maximum surge and heave under the freak wave are significantly larger than those under irregular wave it indicates that the maximum surge and heave depends on the type of wave series 3 there is no one to one relationships between the extreme pitch and wave height under irregular waves the pitch under maximum wave height is related to the posture of the floater in other words it depends on the wave sequence prior to the maximum wave height 4 the variation of motion response under freak and irregular waves decreases with the increasing relative wave heights with hs d 0 03 0 1 α1 2 2 2 the maximum surge under freak wave is 30 60 larger than that under irregular wave with hs d 0 03 0 05 the heave and pitch are approximately 20 40 and 20 33 larger than those under irregular wave respectively however the influence becomes insignificant for hs d 0 06 0 1 5 for the effect of relative period on the motion response significant difference was observed at tp t0surge 0 14 tp t0heave 1 0 1 5 2 0 and tp t0pitch 1 it is observed that the maximum variation occurs at the resonance period of the floater under both freak and irregular waves given identical relative period and α1 2 2 2 the variation of surge heave and pitch under freak and irregular waves were 44 40 30 respectively 6 the freak wave parameters α1 has direct impact on surge and heave but not on pitch within the range of α1 2 2 8 the maximum surge and heave under freak waves are 1 4 2 5 and 1 4 1 6 times larger than those under irregular waves and the maximum pitch increases approximately 30 based on the observation in the current study α2 α3 and α4 have no direct impact on the motion response of the floating cylinder

transient wave trains pei et al 2007 based on the above parameters the dimensional analysis can be performed as 2 бm fm h d tp t0m αn where m 1 3 m 1 бm surge d t0m t0surge m 2 бm heave d t0m t0heave m 3 бm pitch t0m t0pitch the detailed wave parameters in the experiments are summarized in table 2 2 3 analysis methodology firstly the design waves were calibrated at the center of the model in the wave flume the model was then installed and moored with initial tension of 1 1 2 n the measurements for each test typically lasted for approximately 100 waves and were performed 2 or 3 times to ensure repeatability during each test the motions and mooring tensions were recorded synchronously with a frequency of 30 hz the measured data can be analyzed statistically in time domain and spectrually in frequency domain statistical analysis in time domain provides the maximum value 1 10 value 1 3 value effective value average value and other statistical characteristics 3 analysis of experiments results 3 1 comparison on the time history of the wave series and motion responses with identical significant wave height hs and peak period tp hs 13 62 cm tp 1 41s using jonswap spectrum two wave series were generated during the experiment one was a freak wave series with freak parameters of α1 2 11 α2 1 72 α3 2 03 α4 0 62 as shown in fig 3 a1 the other was a random wave series with freak parameters of the most critical wave α1 1 51 α2 1 40 α3 1 45 α4 0 61 as shown in fig 3 a2 the corresponding motion responses surge heave and pitch are illustrated in fig 3 b d under freak and irregular waves respectively it is observed that the low frequency components of surge occur under both freak and irregular wave in particular the observed critical surge in freak wave series is significant larger than that under random waves to understand the difference the critical wave heights and motion components in fig 3 were zoomed in and shown in fig 4 it shows that the maximum surge and heave of the floater were observed at the phase with the occurrence of the freak wave however similar phenomenon was not observed for pitch it indicates that the freak wave has direct effect on the surge and heave of the floater while not for pitch the maximum surge and heave under the freak wave condition are significantly larger than those under irregular wave condition 3 2 effect of relative wave height to investigate the effect of the relative wave heights two wave series were generated with the identical peak period of tp 1 4 s and relative wave heights of hs d 0 03 0 1 using jonswap spectrum the freak wave series are generated with the characteristics of 2 01 α1 2 20 1 71 α2 2 15 1 35 α3 2 13 0 53 α4 0 62 and the random waves are generated with 1 51 α1 1 59 1 33 α2 1 69 1 92 α3 1 99 0 51 α4 0 63 in fig 5 the extreme surge heave and pitch are plotted and compared between freak and irregular wave conditions it is shown that the statistical characteristic of surge increases with the relative wave heights for both freak and irregular waves but the extreme surge under freak waves is significantly larger while the statistical average value of surge in freak wave series is identical to that under random wave series it indicates that the extreme surge depends on the type of wave series comparing the surge and heave under freak and irregular waves in fig 5 a and b the tendency of statistical characteristics varying with the relative wave height is indentical although the range of variation is not exactly the same similarly the dimensionless effective value and average value of heave under freak and irregular waves are almost indentical fig 5 c shows that there is no significant increment in maximum pitch under freak waves than that under irregular waves with hs d 0 05 it is different from the surge and heave the maximum pitch transfer from each other alternatively with relative wave heights more information can be obtained by plotting the motions under freak waves normalized by the motions under random waves against the relative wave heights the parameters of surge f surge i heave f heave i and pitch f pitch i are the pair extreme value for the surge heave and pitch under freak and irregular waves respectively the graph is shown in fig 6 with hs d 0 03 0 1 in the range of hs d 0 03 0 1 the maximum surge heave and pitch under freak waves are 30 60 20 40 and 20 33 respectively larger than those under irregular waves it should also be noted that the extreme pitch in freak waves is almost identical to that under random waves in the relative wave heights range of hs d 0 06 0 1 the surge usually has wave frequency component and low frequency component which probably caused by the non linear towing force however the heave is dominated by the wave frequency component only fig 6 shows the same trend of the specific value of the maximum surge and heave under freak wave and irregular waves both decrease with the relative wave height this can eliminate the possibility that the phenomenon is caused by the low frequency motions of the floating body on the other hand the motion of the floater is related to the mooring pattern and material of mooring ropes using nylon material when the displacement of the floating body increases the rapid growth of the cable tension will limit the movement significantly in addition there are some cases with pitch f pitch i 1 in fig 6 the probably reasons could be that there is no one to one relationships between the maximum pitch and the maximum wave height under irregular waves fig 5 the pitch under the maximum wave height is related to the posture of the floater at the moment it depends on the wave sequence before the maximum wave height even if the maximum wave heights and the corresponding period are identical the maximum pitches could be different in other words the maximum pitches may have insignificant difference under irregular waves with various maximum wave heights fig 7 c this has been pointed out in previous studies i e bennett et al 2013 3 3 effect of relative period to investigate the effect of relative wave period two wave series were generated with the identical wave height of hs 8 cm and relative periods of tp t0surge 0 114 0 310 tp t0heave 0 8 2 2 tp t0pitch 0 5 1 6 using jonswap spectrum the freak wave series are generated with the characteristics of 2 01 α1 2 20 1 40 α2 2 14 1 40 α3 2 37 0 51 α4 0 66 and the random waves are generated with 1 45 α1 1 53 1 06 α2 2 16 1 29 α3 1 99 0 51 α4 0 64 under freak and irregular waves fig 7 a b and c illustrate the dimensionless statistical motions versus the relative period for surge heave and pitch respectively it is observed from fig 7 a that for both freak and irregular wave conditions the variation of the dimensionless surge with the relative period shows the same trend the surge increases with the relative periods and reaches the local peak at approximately tp t0surge 0 14 tp t0heave 1 this may be due to the peak spectral period of the wave is consistent with the natural period of heave the maximum surge is affected by the resonant phenomenon of heave it then decreases and then increases slightly again towards larger tp t0surge however the maximum surge observed under freak wave condition is approximately 1 5 times to that under irregular waves in fig 7 b the variation of the statistical characteristic of heave with the relative period is oscillating with increasing relative period tp t0heave however the critical heave under freak waves is significantly larger than that under irregular waves the extreme heave occurs at the resonance period of tp t0heave 1 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 2 2 2 3 respectively however the resonance period under random waves are tp t0heave 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 respectively fig 7 a and b shows that the variation of statistical characteristic of surge and heave with the relative periods are different which could be attributed to the various natural periods of surge and heave for the maximum heave the impact of freak wave action is larger than that under irregular waves it is observed from fig 7 c for both freak and irregular wave conditions the variation of the statistical characteristic of pitch are generally the same and with approximately the same resonance period of tp t0pitch 1 the minor difference is the pitch under freak waves oscillating with the relative period tp t0pitch this could be attributed to the freak wave parameters which have an impact on pitch more information can be obtained by plotting the motions under freak waves normalized by the motions under random waves against the relative periods the graph is shown in fig 8 with surge heave and pitch periods of tp t0surge 0 114 0 310 tp t0heave 0 8 2 2 and tp t0pitch 0 5 1 6 respectively it is observed that the maximum variation occurs at the resonance period of the floater under both freak and irregular waves the variation of surge heave and pitch are 44 40 and 30 respectively 3 4 effect of freak wave parameters in this section the effect of the four freak wave parameters α1 α4 on the motion responses are discussed respectively 3 4 1 the effect of α1 to investigate the effect of the freak wave parameter α1 wave series were generated with various α1 α1 1 7 2 83 all wave series were generated under constant wave height of hs 8 cm peak period of tp 1 6s and other parameters of α2 1 30 1 52 α3 1 42 1 60 α4 0 51 0 56 in fig 9 the extreme surge heave and pitch are plotted against the freak wave parameter α1 and compared between freak and irregular wave conditions the irregular waves are generated with the characteristics of 1 57 α1 1 60 2 15 α2 2 31 1 92 α3 1 99 0 54 α4 0 55 in fig 9 a the surge of the rectangular cylinder is increases with α1 almost linearly which indicates that α1 has significant effect on surge with α1 2 2 83 the maximum surge under freak waves is 1 4 2 5 times larger than that under irregular waves fig 9 b shows that the heave of interceptive rectangular cylinder increases with the freak wave parameter α1 and reaches the local peak at approximately α1 2 3 it then decreases mildly with father increment with α1 2 2 83 the maximum heave under freak waves is 1 4 1 6 times larger than that under irregular waves fig 9 c shows that the pitch of interceptive rectangular cylinder has minor dependence on the freak wave parameter α1 it depends on the wave sequence before the maximum wave height in the range of α1 2 2 83 the maximum pitch under freak waves increases 30 than that under irregular waves 3 4 2 the effect of α2 and α3 freak wave parameters α2 and α3 reflect the characteristics of the waves before and after the maximum wave respectively the effect of α2 and α3 on motion responses are expected to be similar and thus discussed together test sequence 1 with α2 1 7 2 15 peak period tp 1 6s relative wave height hs d 0 03 0 1 and the other three freak wave parameters α1 2 0 2 2 α3 1 92 1 99 α4 0 53 0 62 the test results demonstrating the effect of α2 and α3 on motion responses are shown in fig 10 a and b test sequence 2 with α2 1 14 2 14 significant wave height of hs 8 cm relative period tp t0surge 0 114 0 310 tp t0heave 0 8 2 2 tp t0pitch 0 5 1 6 and the other three freak wave parameters are α1 2 0 2 2 α3 1 35 2 37 α4 0 5 0 66 the test results demonstrating the effect of α2 and α3 on motion responses are shown in fig 11 a and b it is observed from figs 10 and 11 that the motion responses of the floater fluctuate with the variation of the freak wave parameters α2 and α3 which suggests α2 and α3 have no significant effects on the motion response 3 4 3 the effect of α4 to investigate the effect of α4 on the motion response the same analysis method is chosen as α2 and α3 the results are shown in fig 12 a and b respectively it is observed from fig 12 that the surge and heave fluctuate with the variation of the freak wave parameter α4 which suggests α4 has no significant impact on the motion response with of α4 0 66 however the pitch motions for the two wave series are different the results of sequence 1 show that the pitch increases with α4 which could be attributed to the relative wave height of hs d 0 03 0 1 the increment of pitch is caused by the increment of the relative wave height the results of sequence 2 show that the pitch fluctuates with α4 which shall be investigated further in future studies 4 conclusion in this study the motion response of a rectangular cylinder under the freak and random wave conditions was investigated experimentally extensive tests were conducted to quantify the effect of relative wave height period and freak wave parameters and the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 given identical wave spectrum the maximum motion response of the mooring rectangular cylinder differs substantially under the action of the freak versus random waves the difference is closely correlated with the relative wave height relative period and freak wave parameter α1 2 the freak wave has direct effect on the surge and heave of the floater but not for pitch the maximum surge and heave under the freak wave are significantly larger than those under irregular wave it indicates that the maximum surge and heave depends on the type of wave series 3 there is no one to one relationships between the extreme pitch and wave height under irregular waves the pitch under maximum wave height is related to the posture of the floater in other words it depends on the wave sequence prior to the maximum wave height 4 the variation of motion response under freak and irregular waves decreases with the increasing relative wave heights with hs d 0 03 0 1 α1 2 2 2 the maximum surge under freak wave is 30 60 larger than that under irregular wave with hs d 0 03 0 05 the heave and pitch are approximately 20 40 and 20 33 larger than those under irregular wave respectively however the influence becomes insignificant for hs d 0 06 0 1 5 for the effect of relative period on the motion response significant difference was observed at tp t0surge 0 14 tp t0heave 1 0 1 5 2 0 and tp t0pitch 1 it is observed that the maximum variation occurs at the resonance period of the floater under both freak and irregular waves given identical relative period and α1 2 2 2 the variation of surge heave and pitch under freak and irregular waves were 44 40 30 respectively 6 the freak wave parameters α1 has direct impact on surge and heave but not on pitch within the range of α1 2 2 8 the maximum surge and heave under freak waves are 1 4 2 5 and 1 4 1 6 times larger than those under irregular waves and the maximum pitch increases approximately 30 based on the observation in the current study α2 α3 and α4 have no direct impact on the motion response of the floating cylinder 
23556,propeller induced vibration on ships may originate from separation and wake non uniformity and can be dealt with stern form redesign wake adapted propeller design or wake modification devices such as fins ducts or vortex generators for an existing ship the retrofit options are limited and vortex generators are the most cost efficient measure with quick and easy application however selection of the design parameters such as size location and angle of attack relative to the flow are still not straightforward and can be very costly to be evaluated by model tests or full scale investigations rans based cfd methods can be used effectively to select these parameters current research presents a methodology through a full scale test case consisting of initial numerical flow calculations and full scale testing cfd calculations final numerical flow calculations and full scale testing which shows significant improvements on the wake non uniformity hence the suffered shipboard vibration keywords cfd wake vortex generator propeller induced vibration full scale test wake non uniformity 1 introduction shipboard vibration may be a major design problem for ships with high block coefficient hull forms such as tankers bulk carriers etc as the vibration severity increases with the ship speed and propeller loading the speed is often restricted by the vibration rather than the thrust torque capability of ship engine propeller this in turn forces to run the propulsion engine at a lower loading relative to the engine maximum continuous rating mcr resulting in high engine maintenance costs as well as high emissions a ship moving in calm water generates disturbances on the free surface i e ship waves and streamlined flow pattern i e three dimensional boundary layer on the ship surface and flow separation from hull created vortices as the ship hull moves in water separation may occur in the cross flow direction creating longitudinal vortices generally the flow is downward and outward over the forward section of the hull and upward and inward towards the stern this leads to various vortices including bow bow dome bilge and stern vortices as given in fig 1 by lugt 1981 and explained by gorski 2001 boundary layer is in the nature of turbulent flow and responsible for the viscous resistance vortices are aimed to be minimised to reduce vortex generation resistance and to provide higher propulsion efficiency the complicated interaction of thick boundary layer and bilge stern vortex system may result in flow separation at the aft end additionally the flow may separate due to wave breaking at the bow and appendage sharp edges may stimulate separation the conventional propulsion arrangement for merchant ships causes the propeller to partially operate in the boundary layer or wake of the hull this may result in complex inflow patterns to the impeller propeller possibly leading to vibrations material fatigue and reduction of the overall performance of the craft may be overcome by laborious propulsion system design the strong circumferentially non uniform wake distribution on the propeller disc will cause cyclic changes in flow incidence to each blade cavitation and strong pressure pulses at propeller blade frequency matheson 1980 2 evaluation of propeller induced vibrations vibration on ships may be originated from the mechanical sources i e main engine generators reduction gears etc of from the hydrodynamic sources i e propeller cavitation wake non uniformity etc fundamental mechanism and characteristics of hydrodynamic vibration sources can be stated as bmt 1979 excessive levels of forced vibration are predominantly due to the flare up of cavitation on each propeller blade passing through the wake peak at the top dead center position rapid growth and collapse of sheet tip vortex and propeller hull vortex cavitation transmits large oscillatory pressures to the shell plating in the close vicinity of the propeller plane cavitation number and wake non uniformity are critical parameters governing respectively the amount of vibratory excitation large stable cavities tend to generate mainly blade rate oscillatory pressures while rapid collapse gives rise to higher harmonic components in order to reduce the propeller induced vibration a number of design decisions may be taken the after body hull lines may be designed in such a fashion that would accordingly reduce the wake non uniformity the choice of the engine dictates the operational rate of revolution and hence propeller diameter and cavitation susceptibility compatibility of wake and propeller design may be ensured by empirical analytical numerical and experimental methods failure of accounting for these measures may result in propeller induced vibrations that would be encountered during the sea trials and the measures to reduce their effects are very limited after this point wake modifying solutions can be used to force the wake propeller compatibility as a retrofit solution ducts fins or vortex generators may be utilized if the propeller is kept unchanged the technologies for the use of these measures exist for many years oledal 1997 but there is still little knowledge about the design methodology the scale effects and full scale validation the effectiveness of retrofit options must be assessed and optimized by either numerical methods or experimental methods as the retrofit options are located at the aft end of the flow reynolds number in model tests is generally low to assess the effectiveness of the retrofit options numerical methods based on rans cfd solvers can be utilized to test the effect of ducts fins and vortex generators heinke and hellwig reick 2011 hollenbach and reinholz 2011 kim et al 2015 schmode 2008 has successfully evaluated vg effect on the boundary layer and wake using cfd methods including reynolds stress model and sst k ω turbulence modelling the current research is based on a test case study of a small tanker with a high block coefficient hull form for which dimensions are given in table 1 and the body plan of the hull form is presented in fig 2 the ship was built in 2009 and there have been major complaints about the vibration as propeller pitch and ship speed is increased during loaded condition voyages although the ship was designed for 12 5 knots speed severe vibration above 10 knots limits the voyage speed analysis of such vibration and retrofitting of vortex generators should start with a current state analysis and root cause analysis hence cfd calculations and full scale trials were carried out on the initial ship for the cfd calculations ansys cfx v14 0 has been utilized the solid model geometry and unstructured tetrahedron mesh structure of the cfd calculations are given in fig 3 the unstructured tetrahedral meshing method in ansys mesher has been used this method enables quicker meshing without compromising accuracy at the expense of increased number of cells cfd calculations were performed both with free surface using volume of fluid vof model in free to trim and sinkage condition and underwater alone by using a symmetry condition on the free surface the effect of propeller operation was not modelled hence all wake values are nominal wake rather than effective wake initial calculations were conducted to assess the influence of different turbulence models on the obtained wake for free surface calculation in model scale 974 523 cells were used meanwhile in the underwater calculations 5 271 000 cells were used for the model scale and full scale calculations using sst k ω turbulence modelling both model scale and full scale viscous flow computations were performed to be able to understand the effect of reynolds number on the stern flow as given fig 4 it is clear that model scale calculation hence model scale tests at low reynolds number can be very misleading as the boundary layer formation and the wake patterns are influenced considerably by the reynolds number this conclusion was also supported by dymarski and kraskowski 2011 the studies of starke et al 2006 and ponkratov and zegos 2015 have shown that satisfactory predictions of the wake field and self propulsion characteristics may be achieved at ship s scale by comparing ship s scale predictions with actual measurements analyses with the free surface model have been conducted for 9 to 13 knots of full scale speed the wave formation at 9 11 and 12 knots speed is given in fig 5 it has been seen that increase of wave elevation leads to higher propeller thrust requirement at 11 knots however the wave formation changes above the propeller location and trim sinkage of the hull are negligible up to 13 knots resistance and power requirement is estimated as in fig 6 it was reported by the operators that the ship encounters severe vibration above 10 knots corresponding to propeller pitch angle of 12 after an initial consultation it was decided to conduct full scale stern flow calculations in order to determine the influence of separation and wake non uniformity on the vibrations fig 7 clearly displays that a separation region an iso surface of fluid region with zero velocity exists on the upper part of the stern just in front of the propeller disc as ship speed is increased from 9 knots to 13 knots separation region grows and cover top dead center tdc of the propeller inflow region the swirling motion of the wake shown in fig 7d and 3d velocity vectors given in fig 8 suggests that the vortex at the tdc is severe and separates from the hull at the stern region the position of the vortex is shifted outwards as the speed is increased from 9 knots to 13 knots the wake contours are compared in fig 9 for design draught and ballast draught for 13 knots of ship speed the large region of wake fraction between 0 8 and 0 9 for design draught disappears for the ballast draught indicating there will be less probability of propeller induced vibration at the ballast draught the non uniformity effect on the shipboard vibration can be assessed utilising bmt criteria odabasi and fitzsimmons 1978 the criteria expresses the cavitation number on the base of wake non uniformity w δ w m a x w m i n 1 w 1 0 r σ n p a p v ρ g h i 1 2 ρ π n d 2 where w m a x maximum wake fraction at the tip w m i n minimum wake fraction on at the tip w circumferential average wake fraction p a atmospheric pressure p v saturated vapour pressure h i propeller hub immersion n propeller rate of revolution ρ fluid density d propeller diameter bmt wake non uniformity criteria at the design draught for various speeds is presented in fig 10 the area in fig 10 is divided into two regions the lower region is where there is a higher probability for the propeller induced vibration hence with a fixed propeller design wake non uniformity should be reduced in order to mitigate the vibration the current ship is entering intermediate zone at 9 knots of ship speed and 13 knots is clearly in the high excitation forces region indicating higher propeller induced vibration probability sea trials were conducted to determine the scale of the shipboard vibration fig 11 a b and c demonstrate the longitudinal transverse and vertical vibration speeds respectively vibration measurements were performed at navigating bridge on the main deck and at engine control room ecr for both design and ballast draught conditions there is clear indication that vibrations experienced at the design draught condition are higher than at ballast draught these full scale measurements are inline with the numerical wake non uniformity results as given in fig 9 vibration levels for both longitudinal and vertical direction increase above a pitch angle of 12 meanwhile transverse vibration does not increase so much at this pitch experienced longitudinal vibration velocities are up to 6 mm s vertical vibrations are up to 8 5 mm s both are well above acceptable habitability standards under the current circumstances it can be proposed that vibration is propeller induced and severe in longitudinal and vertical axis hence wake non uniformity plays an important role 3 vortex generator effects on ship stern flow a number of devices have been developed for the improvement of flow field at the stern such as grouthes spoilers schneekluth wake equalizing duct mewis duct twisted fins leading to redistribution of flow field before propeller in order to minimize the effects of flow distortion at the propeller the use of vortex generators as means of flow control devices are widely used to reduce the separation in various flows such as airplane wings cars lorries trains and ships for marine applications a number of other factors must also be considered such as erosive cavitation impact damage of debris to vortex generators vortex generators are just small winglets with different planform geometry they are located in the aft part of the hull mostly in the skeg or bilge positioned with an angle to the incoming flow vortex generators can delay the separation in a thick boundary layer at the full hull form stern flow the principle of vortex generators is to create vortices on the upper parts of the boundary layer to transfer high energy fluid down to hull surface where low energy flow separates as the kinetic energy level is increased on the surface the flow can withstand greater adverse pressure gradient before separation occurs as shown in fig 12 the axial flow momentum can be increased at the propeller disc as a result falchi et al 2014 the design of vortex generator must balance the vorticity generation to prevent or delay the separation and generate minimum resistance due to addition of vortex generator the first goal requires a large dimension to protrude the boundary layer meanwhile the second goal minimises the surface area of the vortex generator additionally the size of the vortex generators should not exceed the base line and maximum breadth of the hull to minimize the damage risk when they are positioned on the bilge there are various vortex generator geometries in the literature including foils triangular rectangular plates wishbone doublet etc as shown in fig 13 triangular vortex generators were chosen in the current case study and two different sizes were investigated 300 mm 200 mm as small vg and 500 mm 300 mm as large vg in principle vortex generator span should be large enough to be higher than the boundary layer thickness to be able transfer the energy of the upper layers into the lower sub layers of the boundary layer brandner and walker 2001 2003 have shown that the flow speed is reduced at higher levels and flow speed is increased in the lower levels this is a difficult task as boundary layer thickness at the aft end of the ship is thicker than the aerodynamic examples of wings trucks etc additionally the larger size of the vg shall results in larger appendage drag perera and muk pavic 2015 has indicated the resistance increase is at the order of 1 2 for the model scale a compromised solution needs to be searched for optimum performance in the current example the vg resistance is 0 4 and 0 23 of the hull resistance for the large and small vg respectively due to the reduced separation a total resistance reduction in the vg cases was observed up to 3 of the hull resistance the angle of attack to the incoming flow is as important as the geometry of the vortex generator the angle between horizontal plane and the vg is static angle of attack which is different from the effective angle of attack as flow streamlines may have upward speed at the stern hence effective angle of attack may also be different for the multiple vortex generators in a ship for example three vg are mounted in 5 degrees of static angle attack in fig 14 a but effective angle of attack is almost 0 for the upper vg and 20 for the lower vg as shown in fig 14a location of the vortex generators should be chosen according to hull vortex leading to flow separation the literature review such as of dymarski and kraskowski 2010 on the vortex generators revealed that most favourable position is at the bilge with positive angle attack around 10 if the bilge vortex is responsible for the separation then vortex generators should be placed around bilge with negative angle of attack in the current case the stern vortex is the cause of the separation as shown in fig 7a to e hence vortex generator placement around bilge was not successful vortex generators were placed in the level of propeller tdc about 4 propeller diameters in front of propeller in horizontal position creating a positive angle of attack due to strong upwards flow various vortex generator longitudinal and vertical positions and angles of attacks were considered see table 2 and analysed as given in fig 14b the large angle between the flow lines and vortex generator of the current case resulted in not only improvements on the wake non uniformity but also keeping average wake fraction value over propeller disc resulting in no loss of hull efficiency position 7 68 m in front of the propeller disc had the greatest improvement potential without sacrificing the propulsion efficiency the mesh structure in way of the vortex generators as given in fig 15 was refined to cover the flow properties and swirling motion behind the vg ahmed et al 2015 dudek 2011 has described a numerical methodology to include the effect of the vortex generator without changing the geometry in the computational domain such an approach was not utilized and flow around the vg has been modelled by mesh changes and local refinement the stern streamlines are given in fig 16 and wake on the propeller disc is given in fig 17 the separation is clearly prevented and the wake region between 0 8 and 0 9 has been eliminated bmt wake non uniformity criteria is checked in fig 18 the wake non uniformity coefficient is significantly reduced from 0 9 to 0 75 shifting the ship operation point in the zone of moderate forces region 4 mitigation of piv by vortex generator although cfd is the main design tool for vortex generators the effectiveness of the vortex generator configuration must still be tested by full scale trials the ship selected for case study was equipped with three vortex generators in each side during the dry dock operations as shown in fig 19 sea trials were performed with loaded ship at the design draught and shipboard vibrations were measured at the bridge location at various propeller pitch speeds the longitudinal transverse and vertical vibration measurements are presented in fig 20 a b and c for propeller pitch angle of 17 corresponding to a ship speed of 12 5 knots influential frequencies are 1 09 4 09 shaft frequency of 246 rpm 8 2 2 shaft frequency 12 3 3 shaft frequency and 16 4 blade frequency hz the change of longitudinal vibration across the speed propeller pitch range is given in fig 21 clearly the frequency of 13 2 hz i e 3 shaft frequency is the most influential frequency indicating the cavitation effect on the propeller for the lower speeds at the top speed propeller rpm drops down to 246 rpm and blade frequency 16 4 hz becomes influential indicating that wake non uniformity effect on shipboard vibration is delayed up to pitch angle of 17 reduction of vibration is clearly visible for propeller pitch angle from 12 to 15 as shown in fig 22 the vertical vibration velocity level was reduced to 4 mm s from 8 5 mm s meanwhile longitudinal vibration velocity is reduced from 5 75 mm s to 3 5 mm s at propeller pitch angle of 15 the reduction in vibration levels on both longitudinal and vertical is approximately 50 5 conclusions propeller induced vibrations may be due to propeller cavitation propeller induced pressures on the hull and wake non uniformity each requiring different solutions probability of shipboard vibrations due to wake non uniformity can be predicted using bmt wake non uniformity criteria and can be solved by utilising vortex generators designed and assessed by rans cfd and they should be used with great care the position and angle attack has prime effect on the magnitude of the nominal wake distribution case study clearly has indicated that vortex generators have improved the shipboard comfort and this application was enabled to achieve higher operational speeds as well addition of 3 vortex generators on each side has enabled the ship vibration to be reduced by 50 on both longitudinal and vertical directions further studies are required using self propulsion modelling in cfd to assess the propulsion efficiency changes the nominal wake value is highly affected by the vortex generators further data is needed to assess the effects on effective wake hence hull efficiency it is also expected that thrust deduction should be reduced by use of vortex generators

flow is downward and outward over the forward section of the hull and upward and inward towards the stern this leads to various vortices including bow bow dome bilge and stern vortices as given in fig 1 by lugt 1981 and explained by gorski 2001 boundary layer is in the nature of turbulent flow and responsible for the viscous resistance vortices are aimed to be minimised to reduce vortex generation resistance and to provide higher propulsion efficiency the complicated interaction of thick boundary layer and bilge stern vortex system may result in flow separation at the aft end additionally the flow may separate due to wave breaking at the bow and appendage sharp edges may stimulate separation the conventional propulsion arrangement for merchant ships causes the propeller to partially operate in the boundary layer or wake of the hull this may result in complex inflow patterns to the impeller propeller possibly leading to vibrations material fatigue and reduction of the overall performance of the craft may be overcome by laborious propulsion system design the strong circumferentially non uniform wake distribution on the propeller disc will cause cyclic changes in flow incidence to each blade cavitation and strong pressure pulses at propeller blade frequency matheson 1980 2 evaluation of propeller induced vibrations vibration on ships may be originated from the mechanical sources i e main engine generators reduction gears etc of from the hydrodynamic sources i e propeller cavitation wake non uniformity etc fundamental mechanism and characteristics of hydrodynamic vibration sources can be stated as bmt 1979 excessive levels of forced vibration are predominantly due to the flare up of cavitation on each propeller blade passing through the wake peak at the top dead center position rapid growth and collapse of sheet tip vortex and propeller hull vortex cavitation transmits large oscillatory pressures to the shell plating in the close vicinity of the propeller plane cavitation number and wake non uniformity are critical parameters governing respectively the amount of vibratory excitation large stable cavities tend to generate mainly blade rate oscillatory pressures while rapid collapse gives rise to higher harmonic components in order to reduce the propeller induced vibration a number of design decisions may be taken the after body hull lines may be designed in such a fashion that would accordingly reduce the wake non uniformity the choice of the engine dictates the operational rate of revolution and hence propeller diameter and cavitation susceptibility compatibility of wake and propeller design may be ensured by empirical analytical numerical and experimental methods failure of accounting for these measures may result in propeller induced vibrations that would be encountered during the sea trials and the measures to reduce their effects are very limited after this point wake modifying solutions can be used to force the wake propeller compatibility as a retrofit solution ducts fins or vortex generators may be utilized if the propeller is kept unchanged the technologies for the use of these measures exist for many years oledal 1997 but there is still little knowledge about the design methodology the scale effects and full scale validation the effectiveness of retrofit options must be assessed and optimized by either numerical methods or experimental methods as the retrofit options are located at the aft end of the flow reynolds number in model tests is generally low to assess the effectiveness of the retrofit options numerical methods based on rans cfd solvers can be utilized to test the effect of ducts fins and vortex generators heinke and hellwig reick 2011 hollenbach and reinholz 2011 kim et al 2015 schmode 2008 has successfully evaluated vg effect on the boundary layer and wake using cfd methods including reynolds stress model and sst k ω turbulence modelling the current research is based on a test case study of a small tanker with a high block coefficient hull form for which dimensions are given in table 1 and the body plan of the hull form is presented in fig 2 the ship was built in 2009 and there have been major complaints about the vibration as propeller pitch and ship speed is increased during loaded condition voyages although the ship was designed for 12 5 knots speed severe vibration above 10 knots limits the voyage speed analysis of such vibration and retrofitting of vortex generators should start with a current state analysis and root cause analysis hence cfd calculations and full scale trials were carried out on the initial ship for the cfd calculations ansys cfx v14 0 has been utilized the solid model geometry and unstructured tetrahedron mesh structure of the cfd calculations are given in fig 3 the unstructured tetrahedral meshing method in ansys mesher has been used this method enables quicker meshing without compromising accuracy at the expense of increased number of cells cfd calculations were performed both with free surface using volume of fluid vof model in free to trim and sinkage condition and underwater alone by using a symmetry condition on the free surface the effect of propeller operation was not modelled hence all wake values are nominal wake rather than effective wake initial calculations were conducted to assess the influence of different turbulence models on the obtained wake for free surface calculation in model scale 974 523 cells were used meanwhile in the underwater calculations 5 271 000 cells were used for the model scale and full scale calculations using sst k ω turbulence modelling both model scale and full scale viscous flow computations were performed to be able to understand the effect of reynolds number on the stern flow as given fig 4 it is clear that model scale calculation hence model scale tests at low reynolds number can be very misleading as the boundary layer formation and the wake patterns are influenced considerably by the reynolds number this conclusion was also supported by dymarski and kraskowski 2011 the studies of starke et al 2006 and ponkratov and zegos 2015 have shown that satisfactory predictions of the wake field and self propulsion characteristics may be achieved at ship s scale by comparing ship s scale predictions with actual measurements analyses with the free surface model have been conducted for 9 to 13 knots of full scale speed the wave formation at 9 11 and 12 knots speed is given in fig 5 it has been seen that increase of wave elevation leads to higher propeller thrust requirement at 11 knots however the wave formation changes above the propeller location and trim sinkage of the hull are negligible up to 13 knots resistance and power requirement is estimated as in fig 6 it was reported by the operators that the ship encounters severe vibration above 10 knots corresponding to propeller pitch angle of 12 after an initial consultation it was decided to conduct full scale stern flow calculations in order to determine the influence of separation and wake non uniformity on the vibrations fig 7 clearly displays that a separation region an iso surface of fluid region with zero velocity exists on the upper part of the stern just in front of the propeller disc as ship speed is increased from 9 knots to 13 knots separation region grows and cover top dead center tdc of the propeller inflow region the swirling motion of the wake shown in fig 7d and 3d velocity vectors given in fig 8 suggests that the vortex at the tdc is severe and separates from the hull at the stern region the position of the vortex is shifted outwards as the speed is increased from 9 knots to 13 knots the wake contours are compared in fig 9 for design draught and ballast draught for 13 knots of ship speed the large region of wake fraction between 0 8 and 0 9 for design draught disappears for the ballast draught indicating there will be less probability of propeller induced vibration at the ballast draught the non uniformity effect on the shipboard vibration can be assessed utilising bmt criteria odabasi and fitzsimmons 1978 the criteria expresses the cavitation number on the base of wake non uniformity w δ w m a x w m i n 1 w 1 0 r σ n p a p v ρ g h i 1 2 ρ π n d 2 where w m a x maximum wake fraction at the tip w m i n minimum wake fraction on at the tip w circumferential average wake fraction p a atmospheric pressure p v saturated vapour pressure h i propeller hub immersion n propeller rate of revolution ρ fluid density d propeller diameter bmt wake non uniformity criteria at the design draught for various speeds is presented in fig 10 the area in fig 10 is divided into two regions the lower region is where there is a higher probability for the propeller induced vibration hence with a fixed propeller design wake non uniformity should be reduced in order to mitigate the vibration the current ship is entering intermediate zone at 9 knots of ship speed and 13 knots is clearly in the high excitation forces region indicating higher propeller induced vibration probability sea trials were conducted to determine the scale of the shipboard vibration fig 11 a b and c demonstrate the longitudinal transverse and vertical vibration speeds respectively vibration measurements were performed at navigating bridge on the main deck and at engine control room ecr for both design and ballast draught conditions there is clear indication that vibrations experienced at the design draught condition are higher than at ballast draught these full scale measurements are inline with the numerical wake non uniformity results as given in fig 9 vibration levels for both longitudinal and vertical direction increase above a pitch angle of 12 meanwhile transverse vibration does not increase so much at this pitch experienced longitudinal vibration velocities are up to 6 mm s vertical vibrations are up to 8 5 mm s both are well above acceptable habitability standards under the current circumstances it can be proposed that vibration is propeller induced and severe in longitudinal and vertical axis hence wake non uniformity plays an important role 3 vortex generator effects on ship stern flow a number of devices have been developed for the improvement of flow field at the stern such as grouthes spoilers schneekluth wake equalizing duct mewis duct twisted fins leading to redistribution of flow field before propeller in order to minimize the effects of flow distortion at the propeller the use of vortex generators as means of flow control devices are widely used to reduce the separation in various flows such as airplane wings cars lorries trains and ships for marine applications a number of other factors must also be considered such as erosive cavitation impact damage of debris to vortex generators vortex generators are just small winglets with different planform geometry they are located in the aft part of the hull mostly in the skeg or bilge positioned with an angle to the incoming flow vortex generators can delay the separation in a thick boundary layer at the full hull form stern flow the principle of vortex generators is to create vortices on the upper parts of the boundary layer to transfer high energy fluid down to hull surface where low energy flow separates as the kinetic energy level is increased on the surface the flow can withstand greater adverse pressure gradient before separation occurs as shown in fig 12 the axial flow momentum can be increased at the propeller disc as a result falchi et al 2014 the design of vortex generator must balance the vorticity generation to prevent or delay the separation and generate minimum resistance due to addition of vortex generator the first goal requires a large dimension to protrude the boundary layer meanwhile the second goal minimises the surface area of the vortex generator additionally the size of the vortex generators should not exceed the base line and maximum breadth of the hull to minimize the damage risk when they are positioned on the bilge there are various vortex generator geometries in the literature including foils triangular rectangular plates wishbone doublet etc as shown in fig 13 triangular vortex generators were chosen in the current case study and two different sizes were investigated 300 mm 200 mm as small vg and 500 mm 300 mm as large vg in principle vortex generator span should be large enough to be higher than the boundary layer thickness to be able transfer the energy of the upper layers into the lower sub layers of the boundary layer brandner and walker 2001 2003 have shown that the flow speed is reduced at higher levels and flow speed is increased in the lower levels this is a difficult task as boundary layer thickness at the aft end of the ship is thicker than the aerodynamic examples of wings trucks etc additionally the larger size of the vg shall results in larger appendage drag perera and muk pavic 2015 has indicated the resistance increase is at the order of 1 2 for the model scale a compromised solution needs to be searched for optimum performance in the current example the vg resistance is 0 4 and 0 23 of the hull resistance for the large and small vg respectively due to the reduced separation a total resistance reduction in the vg cases was observed up to 3 of the hull resistance the angle of attack to the incoming flow is as important as the geometry of the vortex generator the angle between horizontal plane and the vg is static angle of attack which is different from the effective angle of attack as flow streamlines may have upward speed at the stern hence effective angle of attack may also be different for the multiple vortex generators in a ship for example three vg are mounted in 5 degrees of static angle attack in fig 14 a but effective angle of attack is almost 0 for the upper vg and 20 for the lower vg as shown in fig 14a location of the vortex generators should be chosen according to hull vortex leading to flow separation the literature review such as of dymarski and kraskowski 2010 on the vortex generators revealed that most favourable position is at the bilge with positive angle attack around 10 if the bilge vortex is responsible for the separation then vortex generators should be placed around bilge with negative angle of attack in the current case the stern vortex is the cause of the separation as shown in fig 7a to e hence vortex generator placement around bilge was not successful vortex generators were placed in the level of propeller tdc about 4 propeller diameters in front of propeller in horizontal position creating a positive angle of attack due to strong upwards flow various vortex generator longitudinal and vertical positions and angles of attacks were considered see table 2 and analysed as given in fig 14b the large angle between the flow lines and vortex generator of the current case resulted in not only improvements on the wake non uniformity but also keeping average wake fraction value over propeller disc resulting in no loss of hull efficiency position 7 68 m in front of the propeller disc had the greatest improvement potential without sacrificing the propulsion efficiency the mesh structure in way of the vortex generators as given in fig 15 was refined to cover the flow properties and swirling motion behind the vg ahmed et al 2015 dudek 2011 has described a numerical methodology to include the effect of the vortex generator without changing the geometry in the computational domain such an approach was not utilized and flow around the vg has been modelled by mesh changes and local refinement the stern streamlines are given in fig 16 and wake on the propeller disc is given in fig 17 the separation is clearly prevented and the wake region between 0 8 and 0 9 has been eliminated bmt wake non uniformity criteria is checked in fig 18 the wake non uniformity coefficient is significantly reduced from 0 9 to 0 75 shifting the ship operation point in the zone of moderate forces region 4 mitigation of piv by vortex generator although cfd is the main design tool for vortex generators the effectiveness of the vortex generator configuration must still be tested by full scale trials the ship selected for case study was equipped with three vortex generators in each side during the dry dock operations as shown in fig 19 sea trials were performed with loaded ship at the design draught and shipboard vibrations were measured at the bridge location at various propeller pitch speeds the longitudinal transverse and vertical vibration measurements are presented in fig 20 a b and c for propeller pitch angle of 17 corresponding to a ship speed of 12 5 knots influential frequencies are 1 09 4 09 shaft frequency of 246 rpm 8 2 2 shaft frequency 12 3 3 shaft frequency and 16 4 blade frequency hz the change of longitudinal vibration across the speed propeller pitch range is given in fig 21 clearly the frequency of 13 2 hz i e 3 shaft frequency is the most influential frequency indicating the cavitation effect on the propeller for the lower speeds at the top speed propeller rpm drops down to 246 rpm and blade frequency 16 4 hz becomes influential indicating that wake non uniformity effect on shipboard vibration is delayed up to pitch angle of 17 reduction of vibration is clearly visible for propeller pitch angle from 12 to 15 as shown in fig 22 the vertical vibration velocity level was reduced to 4 mm s from 8 5 mm s meanwhile longitudinal vibration velocity is reduced from 5 75 mm s to 3 5 mm s at propeller pitch angle of 15 the reduction in vibration levels on both longitudinal and vertical is approximately 50 5 conclusions propeller induced vibrations may be due to propeller cavitation propeller induced pressures on the hull and wake non uniformity each requiring different solutions probability of shipboard vibrations due to wake non uniformity can be predicted using bmt wake non uniformity criteria and can be solved by utilising vortex generators designed and assessed by rans cfd and they should be used with great care the position and angle attack has prime effect on the magnitude of the nominal wake distribution case study clearly has indicated that vortex generators have improved the shipboard comfort and this application was enabled to achieve higher operational speeds as well addition of 3 vortex generators on each side has enabled the ship vibration to be reduced by 50 on both longitudinal and vertical directions further studies are required using self propulsion modelling in cfd to assess the propulsion efficiency changes the nominal wake value is highly affected by the vortex generators further data is needed to assess the effects on effective wake hence hull efficiency it is also expected that thrust deduction should be reduced by use of vortex generators

been used as an important element for decreasing the fluctuation in motion of floating structure it is well known that in the offshore oil industry mooring systems have wide applications as an important element of floating platforms unites in these applications the traditional catenary mooring systems are widely used in practical projects zhou et al 2010 chen and zhu 2011 mohanraj et al 2011 weight of the mooring system is the important issue in offshore industry especially when sea depth is extremely increased also with increase in sea depth the cost becomes severely increased and uneconomical qiao et al 2010 therefore the catenary mooring system can be replaced with taut mooring system in this system synthetic fiber is used to decrease the weight of the mooring system but taut mooring systems may reduce the safety storage under the extremely harsh ocean environment conditions sun and wang 2010 ćatipović et al 2011 for compensating the weight of heavy chain and wire the buoys can be used in the catenary mooring line qiao and ou 2009 for analyses the mooring line system the lumped mass method are widely used chai et al 2002 orcina 2009 in this method every mooring

asymmetric mooring arrangement with considering damage line conditions are investigated by ahmed et al 2016 in most of the mooring dynamic analysis which uses commercial codes such as riflex cable3d and orcaflex are focused on the suspended component in the water fylling et al 2008 orcina 2009 and it is assumed that anchors are a fixed point placed on the seabed surface kim et al 2013 tahar and kim 2003 and also the seabed is modeled as a rigid plane or an elastic spring chai et al 2002 ma and webster 1994 morrison s equations is used to investigate the slender structural however it is well known that for sufficiently large structure using morrison s equations for estimating the interaction loads may have significant errors and diffraction theory should be used a submerged sphere in deep

mooring line response for production platforms in a deep sea have been investigated davies et al 2008 the effects of current with and without the effect of waves on deep water mooring floating platform motions and mooring line tensions are investigated stansberg 2008 decreasing high loads on the floating structure weight and cost of the mooring system is an important issue in offshore industries often for this purpose use multi component mooring line is used mooring line contains of chains and wire ropes with different diameters and weights connected to two buoys are solved by static analysis and based on catenary equations static analysis has been employed in investigating the influences of cable elongation size and weight of the buoy dongjiao 2007 in this study a hybrid

results and discussion the amirkabir semi submersible platform is modeled in ansys aqwa software the results of semi submersible platform in two states with mooring and without mooring in frequency domain are compared the obtained result from aqwa have been compared with the experimental results obtained from model test in a wave tank of sharif university of technology results then the effects of buoy size on a catenary mooring line system and also the effect of stretch mooring line on the motion responses of semi submersible platform is numerically investigated through frequency and time domains simulations here it is necessary to mention that all presented simulations are implemented in a pc has corei5 7400 processor z270 tomahawk motherboard and 8gb ddr4 2400mhz ram accordingly each time simulation has take more than 2 h and frequency domain takes more than 12 h in ansys aqua at first a time simulation in one frequency is carried out and after that gradually frequency is increased to obtain results in frequency domain by using the catenary mooring system in semi submersible platform mooring stiffness and mooring force are added to the equation of motion to reduce the structure motion fig 3 shows the results of semi submersible platform in two states with mooring and without mooring in frequency domain 4 1 validation by developing computer software the responses of floating structure in regular wave can be obtained amirkabir semi submersible platform modeled in the ansys aqwa software five type of meshing networks have been investigated in these analyses for obtaining a reasonable number of meshes in this analysis the size of the required mesh has been changed in 5 steps which are presented in table 2 as shown in fig 4 these results show that convergence of the solution is obtained with 62408 elements and increasing the number of elements after that only increases the time required for analysis while significant change in the results is not observed fig 5 show the numerical model of platform that use using a total number of 62408 elements for meshing also a 1 143 scale model test is shown in fig 6 where the experiments of this model were carried out in a wave tank of sharif university of technology tehran iran the wave tank has 25 m length 2 5 m wide and 1 8 m deep semi submersible motion results have been compared with the results obtained from model test rashidi et al 2015 from the comparisons between numerical and experimental model test in the regular wave tests it is seen that there are good agreement between the test and simulation results among them the surge pitch and heave response amplitude operator is shown in fig 7 4 2 case studies 4 2 1 buoy size adding the buoy in the catenary mooring system can reduce the heavyweight of chain and cable of semi submersible platform for deep sea mooring system to study the effect of buoy size on the global responses of the semi submersible platform four buoys with different size on catenary mooring system have been investigated the mooring system consists of 8 parts that are positioned 45 apart each mooring line consists of a top chain a buoy a middle wire and a bottom chain respectively fig 8 shows the position of the buoy in one of the mooring system for 4 types of case studies and top view of mooring system arrangements the mooring system properties are summarized in table 3 fig 9 shows the numerical results obtained for these 4 case studies in order to investigate the effects of buoy size on the global responses of a semi submersible platform in time and frequency domains as shown in fig 9 from frequency domain analyses it was found that with increasing the size of buoy the amplitude of serge heave and pitch motion response are increased it was found that the oscillation of serge motion decreases with increase in size of buoy but the heave and pitch motion oscillation are increased also in heave motion it can be seen that semi submersible draft has less changes with increase in buoy size because the weight of cable and chain is compensated by the buoyancy force of buoy the results from frequency domains simulation shows that with increasing buoy s size the amplitude of serge heave and pitch motion are increased fig 10 shows that increasing the size of buoy can cause decrease in the tension force of mooring line also it can be seen that there are two resonant frequencies for mooring tension and with increasing the size of buoy the first amplitude resonant frequency is increased and the second frequency amplitude is decreased 4 2 2 stretch of mooring line in order to observe the effect of stretch mooringon serge heave and pitch motions four case studies shown in table 3 are investigated the response of system is determined in time and frequency domains each case study has three sections upper chain with 900 m length and middle cable with 1000 m and bottom chain with 1100 m length different mooring arrangements are studied fig 11 shows the schematic of mooring line in four different radiuses anchor point in each case study has a different mooring projected length radius for type1 of case study the mooring projected length radius is r 2500 m and type 2 3 and 4 has projected length radius of 1 02 r 1 04 r and 1 06 r respectively in this study four case studies were compared in time and frequency domains to find the effect of mooring s stretch on semi submersible motion the results of 4 case studies are compared in fig 12 the results from time and frequency domains simulation of fig 12 show that with increasing stretch of mooring line the amplitude of serge heave and pitch motions are decreased also it has shown that with the increasing the stretch of mooring line the amplitude at resonant frequencies of heave and pitch motion are decreased with increasing moorings stretch the length of chain lying on the sea bed is reduced which in turn increases tension on the mooring system fig 13 4 2 3 buoy location in this section the effects of buoy location on catenary mooring line system have been investigated the arrangement of mooring line system is similar to section 4 2 1 so 8 mooring line consisted of chain wire and buoy are used in four case studies the radius of buoy is 2 5 m in each case study the location of buoy point has a different distance to the platform for type1 of case study the distance between buoy and platform is 500 m and type 2 3 and 4 has distance of 600 m 700 m and 800 m respectively the results of 4 case studies in time and frequency domains are compared in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 with increasing the distance of buoy from the platform the amplitude of serge in time domain is decreased and the amplitude of resonant frequencies in these case studies is constant but the amplitude of serge motion is decreased the heave dynamic response of the platform shows that with increasing the buoy distance of the platform the amplitude of oscillations is reduced and the draft of platform is increased in fact whatever buoy placed in higher place on the mooring line a greater amount of mooring weight is supported and therefore reduces the effect of mooring weight on the platform also in pitch motion it is observed that the increase in the distance of buoy from the platform could reduce the amplitude of oscillations but the amplitude of resonant frequency of platform is increased 4 2 4 numbers of buoys to study the effect of the number of buoys on the global responses of the semi submersible platform four case studies have been investigated in all case studies the volumes of buoys is assumed to be constant and just the number of buoys is changed case 1 has one buoy with radius of 2 6 m case 2 has 2 buoys with radius of 2 063 m case 3 has 3 buoys with radius of1 8 m and type4 has 4 buoys with radius of 1 637 m each case study has three sections upper chain with 600 m length and middle cable with 1000 m and bottom chain with 1100 m length the first type has a 600 m distance of platform and in other types the distance between every two buoys is 250 m fig 15 shows the numerical results obtained for these 4 cases studies and from them the effects of the number of buoys on the global responses of a semi submersible platform in time and frequency domains are investigated as shown in fig 15 adding the number of the buoys reduces the amplitude of serge in time domain and from the results shown in frequency domain the amplitudes of serge motions in the resonant frequencies are decreased also it is observed that in heave motion adding the number of the buoys on the mooring line could lead to increasing the amplitude of oscillations in the time domain and in the frequency domain and the amplitude of heave motion in resonant frequency is increased also the pitch dynamic response of the semisubmersible platform shows that by adding the number of the buoys the amplitude of oscillations is increased in time response and it is shown that by adding the number of the buoys on the mooring line the amplitude at the resonant frequencies of pitch motion is increased 5 conclusion mooring systems have been used as an important element for decreasing oscillations of floating structure in this study the frequency and time domains analysis of ansys aqwa software is used to investigate the effects of buoy size stretch of mooring line the location and number of buoys on the responses of platform according to the results obtained in this study following conclusions are summarized as follows 5 1 time domain serge motion oscillation decrease with increasing in the size of buoys but heaves and pitch motion oscillations are increased in heave motion semi submersible draft has less change with increase in buoy because the weight of cable and chain is compensated by the buoyancy force of buoy increasing the size of buoy can cause decrease in the tension of mooring line increasing the stretch of mooring line could reduce motions of the platform with increase in the stretch of mooring line the mooring line tension is increased the effects of change in the location of buoy of the mooring line in heave motion are more than serge and pitch and this reflects the importance of the buoy position on heave motion of the platform by increasing the number of the buoys the amplitude of oscillations for heave and pitch motions are increased while the amplitude of oscillation for serge motion is decreased 5 2 frequency domain the results from frequency domains simulation show that with increasing the size of buoy the amplitudes of serge heave and pitch motion are increased with increase the size in buoy the first amplitude resonant frequency is increased and the second resonance amplitude is decreased with increasing in stretch of mooring line the amplitude in resonant frequencies of heave and pitch motions are decreased adding the number of the buoys on the mooring line could lead to increase in the amplitude at the resonant frequencies of heave and pitch motion and decrease in the serge motion with increasing the size of buoy the amplitudes of serge heave and pitch motions are increased the result from the effect of buoy location shows that the increase in the distance of buoy to the platform could lead to reduce in the amplitude of serge and heave motions and instead increases the amplitude of heave motion acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the marine engineering research center merc of sharif university of technology of iran and kepco appendix a supplementary data

important element of floating platforms unites in these applications the traditional catenary mooring systems are widely used in practical projects zhou et al 2010 chen and zhu 2011 mohanraj et al 2011 weight of the mooring system is the important issue in offshore industry especially when sea depth is extremely increased also with increase in sea depth the cost becomes severely increased and uneconomical qiao et al 2010 therefore the catenary mooring system can be replaced with taut mooring system in this system synthetic fiber is used to decrease the weight of the mooring system but taut mooring systems may reduce the safety storage under the extremely harsh ocean environment conditions sun and wang 2010 ćatipović et al 2011 for compensating the weight of heavy chain and wire the

table 3 fig 9 shows the numerical results obtained for these 4 case studies in order to investigate the effects of buoy size on the global responses of a semi submersible platform in time and frequency domains as shown in fig 9 from frequency domain analyses it was found that with increasing the size of buoy the amplitude of serge heave and pitch motion response are increased it was found that the oscillation of serge motion decreases with increase in size of buoy but the heave and pitch motion oscillation are increased also in heave motion it can be seen that semi submersible draft has less changes with increase in buoy size because the weight of cable and chain is compensated by the buoyancy force of buoy the results from frequency domains simulation shows that with increasing buoy s size the amplitude of serge heave and pitch motion are increased fig 10 shows that increasing the size of buoy can cause decrease in the tension force of mooring line also it can be seen that there are two resonant frequencies for mooring tension and with increasing the size of buoy the first amplitude resonant frequency is increased and the second frequency amplitude is decreased 4 2 2 stretch of mooring line in order to observe the effect of stretch mooringon serge heave and pitch motions four case studies shown in table 3 are investigated the response of system is determined in time and frequency domains each case study has three sections upper chain with 900 m length and middle cable with 1000 m and bottom chain with 1100 m length different mooring arrangements are studied fig 11 shows the schematic of mooring line in four different radiuses anchor point in each case study has a different mooring projected length radius for type1 of case study the mooring projected length radius is r 2500 m and type 2 3 and 4 has projected length radius of 1 02 r 1 04 r and 1 06 r respectively in this study four case studies were compared in time and frequency domains to find the effect of mooring s stretch on semi submersible motion the results of 4 case studies are compared in fig 12 the results from time and frequency domains simulation of fig 12 show that with increasing stretch of mooring line the amplitude of serge heave and pitch motions are decreased also it has shown that with the increasing the stretch of mooring line the amplitude at resonant frequencies of heave and pitch motion are decreased with increasing moorings stretch the length of chain lying on the sea bed is reduced which in turn increases tension on the mooring system fig 13 4 2 3 buoy location in this section the effects of buoy location on catenary mooring line system have been investigated the arrangement of mooring line system is similar to section 4 2 1 so 8 mooring line consisted of chain wire and buoy are used in four case studies the radius of buoy is 2 5 m in each case study the location of buoy point has a different distance to the platform for type1 of case study the distance between buoy and platform is 500 m and type 2 3 and 4 has distance of 600 m 700 m and 800 m respectively the results of 4 case studies in time and frequency domains are compared in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 with increasing the distance of buoy from the platform the amplitude of serge in time domain is decreased and the amplitude of resonant frequencies in these case studies is constant but the amplitude of serge motion is decreased the heave dynamic response of the platform shows that with increasing the buoy distance of the platform the amplitude of oscillations is reduced and the draft of platform is increased in fact whatever buoy placed in higher place on the mooring line a greater amount of mooring weight is supported and therefore reduces the effect of mooring weight on the platform also in pitch motion it is observed that the increase in the distance of buoy from the platform could reduce the amplitude of oscillations but the amplitude of resonant frequency of platform is increased 4 2 4 numbers of buoys to study the effect of the number of buoys on the global responses of the semi submersible platform four case studies have been investigated in all case studies the volumes of buoys is assumed to be constant and just the number of buoys is changed case 1 has one buoy with radius of 2 6 m case 2 has 2 buoys with radius of 2 063 m case 3 has 3 buoys with radius of1 8 m and type4 has 4 buoys with radius of 1 637 m each case study has three sections upper chain with 600 m length and middle cable with 1000 m and bottom chain with 1100 m length the first type has a 600 m distance of platform and in other types the distance between every two buoys is 250 m fig 15 shows the numerical results obtained for these 4 cases studies and from them the effects of the number of buoys on the global responses of a semi submersible platform in time and frequency domains are investigated as shown in fig 15 adding the number of the buoys reduces the amplitude of serge in time domain and from the results shown in frequency domain the amplitudes of serge motions in the resonant frequencies are decreased also it is observed that in heave motion adding the number of the buoys on the mooring line could lead to increasing the amplitude of oscillations in the time domain and in the frequency domain and the amplitude of heave motion in resonant frequency is increased also the pitch dynamic response of the semisubmersible platform shows that by adding the number of the buoys the amplitude of oscillations is increased in time response and it is shown that by adding the number of the buoys on the mooring line the amplitude at the resonant frequencies of pitch motion is increased 5 conclusion mooring systems have been used as an important element for decreasing oscillations of floating structure in this study the frequency and time domains analysis of ansys aqwa software is used to investigate the effects of buoy size stretch of mooring line the location and number of buoys on the responses of platform according to the results obtained in this study following conclusions are summarized as follows 5 1 time domain serge motion oscillation decrease with increasing in the size of buoys but heaves and pitch motion oscillations are increased in heave motion semi submersible draft has less change with increase in buoy because the weight of cable and chain is compensated by the buoyancy force of buoy increasing the size of buoy can cause decrease in the tension of mooring line increasing the stretch of mooring line could reduce motions of the platform with increase in the stretch of mooring line the mooring line tension is increased the effects of change in the location of buoy of the mooring line in heave motion are more than serge and pitch and this reflects the importance of the buoy position on heave motion of the platform by increasing the number of the buoys the amplitude of oscillations for heave and pitch motions are increased while the amplitude of oscillation for serge motion is decreased 5 2 frequency domain the results from frequency domains simulation show that with increasing the size of buoy the amplitudes of serge heave and pitch motion are increased with increase the size in buoy the first amplitude resonant frequency is increased and the second resonance amplitude is decreased with increasing in stretch of mooring line the amplitude in resonant frequencies of heave and pitch motions are decreased adding the number of the buoys on the mooring line could lead to increase in the amplitude at the resonant frequencies of heave and pitch motion and decrease in the serge motion with increasing the size of buoy the amplitudes of serge heave and pitch motions are increased the result from the effect of buoy location shows that the increase in the distance of buoy to the platform could lead to reduce in the amplitude of serge and heave motions and instead increases the amplitude of heave motion acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the marine engineering research center merc of sharif university of technology of iran and kepco appendix a supplementary data

modification delaunay triangulation resistance performance optimization 1 introduction the energy efficiency design index eedi was proposed by imo in 2009 mepc 2009 and ship resistance performance optimization is an effective method for meeting the eedi requirements with the rapid development of computer technology and computational fluid dynamics cfd hull form optimization based on simulation has become a research hotspot harries et al 2001 peri and campana 2003 2005 campana et al 2006 diez and peri 2010 li and zhao 2011 li 2012 yang and kim 2011 yang et al 2015b and tahara et al 2004 2006 have combined numerical simulation techniques and optimization algorithms realised the integration of cad and cfd established a cfd based hull form optimization platform successfully completed the simulation optimization design of hull lines and obtained an optimal hull form with improved hydrodynamic performance xu and wang 2001 traced the development of a classified optimization procedure consisting of five levels in order to complete the fine optimization of ship hull lines and demonstrated that cfd code is applicable to the optimization of ship hull lines in terms of hull resistance performance abt et al 2003 presented a parametric approach to modelling with the friendship modeler as well as hydrodynamics with shipflow for ship hull forms campana et al 2003 2004 and 2005 investigated a variable fidelity approach for speeding up the optimization process using a free surface rans in a multi objective design problem tahara et al 2004 employed a finite difference gradient based approach for stern and sonar dome optimization peri et al 2004 introduced a design optimization method based on large scale numerical simulations simulation based design sbd for complex

operating and environmental conditions and a particle swarm optimization algorithm was applied for the global minimisation process minimising the expectation and standard deviation of the unit transportation cost since then the feasibility of rdo based on actual operating ship data has been demonstrated grigoropoulos and chalkias 2010 proposed an improved scheme for hull form optimization with respect to calm water resistance and seakeeping these authors also adopted the friendship modeler for hull form modelling and modification as well as modefrontier and easycodes to accomplish multi objective optimization by means of evolutionary strategies yang and kim 2011 developed an efficient and effective hull surface modification technique for cfd based hull form optimization in order to achieve both local and global hull form modifications by combining the two approaches kim et al 2010 developed a new methodology for hydrodynamic optimization of a triswach which considers not only the side hull positions but also their shape in order to satisfy the requirements of a ship s hydrodynamic performance the hull form is somewhat complicated when using a non uniform rational b spline nurbs to represent the hull surface accurately the number of control points must be extremely large which presents difficulties in hull surface modification therefore several hull surface modification methods have been explored and can be divided into two categories as follows 1 the fusion method based on the initial hull form tahara et al 2006 feng et al 2010 this method can guarantee that the new hull surface is faired when the initial hull form is smooth however the limitation of this method is that it cannot consider the deformation of local hull lines 2 direct modification of the control points based on the bezier patch and free form deformation methods this approach can be used for geometric reconstruction of the entire hull form but the design variables are relatively more important and the control points must be carefully selected hull surface deformation is achieved using the initial ship s nurbs control points as design parameters in the above methods this study focuses on the hull surface modification method a hull optimization tool is developed with the hull surface modification module the enhanced hull optimization tool is applied to the resistance performance optimization of a series 60 vessel and model tests are carried out in order to verify the method s validity 2 hull surface modification method the hull surface modification method plays a vital role in ship hydrodynamic performance optimization and should meet the following requirements 1 in order to save optimization time hull surface modification should be achieved using few design parameters 2 the modification range of the hull form should be sufficiently large 3 the local modified hull surface should have a fairing connection with other parts of the hull surface 4 the optimal hull form should be suitable for applying to manufacturing in this paper the radial base interpolation technique is used to modify the hull surface based on the nurbs hull surface representation 2 1 nurbs surface representation for hull form in this paper the nurbs surface is used to represent the hull form the theory for which is as follows piegl 1989 1 p u v i 0 n j 0 m w i j d i j n i k u n j l v i 0 n j 0 m w i j n i k u n j l v where u v are the knot vectors w 0 0 w m 0 w 0 n w m n 0 are the nurbs control points w i j 0 are the weight factors that can contact the control points w 0 0 w m 0 w 0 n w m n 0 respectively and n j l v j 0 1 n is a b spline basic function with its first subscript u showing the sequence numbers and its second subscript k showing the power its order is 1 of the b spline it can be defined by a recurrence formula 2 n i 0 u 1 u i u u i 1 0 o t h e r n i k u u u i u i k u i n i k 1 u 0 0 0 u i k 1 u i u i k 1 u i 1 n i 1 k 1 u it can be demonstrated that when the knot vectors in the v directions are fixed the value types at each hull form point are decided by the control point positions therefore surface modification can be achieved by modifying the control point positions to generate a new hull form 2 2 hull surface modification method based on rbf interpolation and existing problems the radial basis function rbf for automatic modification was briefly introduced by kim et al 2008 the rbf is a type of real valued function that is symmetric along the radial direction the value of which depends only on the euclidean distance between any point x and the centre of point xi buhmann 2004 the basis function is described as follows 3 ϕ x x i i 1 2 n where xi is the centre of the rbf and p x y z is the rbf of the variable euclidean distance when rbf interpolation is used during hull form modification the function can be described as follows morris et al 2008 4 s x i 1 n λ i ϕ x x i p x where s x represents the displacement of point p x on the hull surface p x a low order polynomial is used to recover the translation and rotation and has the specific form p x c 1 x c 2 y c 3 z c 4 n is the number of control points and x x i is the euclidean distance between two points in this case the 3d wendland s function with compact support features is adopted as a basis function 5 ϕ x 1 x 4 4 x 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 this equation guarantees that the constructed system matrix is a positive definite matrix the equation coefficients f f 1 f 2 f 3 s b p n d s and f f 1 f 2 f 3 s b p n d s are obtained by changing the control point coordinates morse et al 2001 6 f f 1 f 2 f 3 s b p n d s where m m 1 m 2 m 3 s b p r n d s is the control point displacement additional requirements include the following buhmann 2000 7 k 1 n λ k x k t 0 k 1 n λ k 0 the values of coefficients λ j and ρ can be obtained by solving the linear system 8 f 0 m q q t 0 λ c where λ λ 1 λ 2 λ n t c c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 t f f 1 f 2 f n t m i j ϕ x i x j i j 1 2 n 9 q x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 1 x n y n z n 1 all of the unknown coefficients in eq 4 can be determined by solving the above equations then new coordinates for all unknown points can be obtained by means of rbf interpolation in order to enable a compactly supported function to exhibit effective universality wendland added a scaling factor a also known as a supported radius resulting in the basis function below 10 ϕ x 1 x a 4 4 x a 1 the added scaling factor a of a set value does not influence the basis function s positive definite but can control its deformation range the size of the supported radius directly affects the deformation range solution efficiency and surface smoothing the larger the supported radius the larger the deformation range and the lower the solution efficiency are although a smaller supported radius results in a smaller deformation range it is possible for this to lead to abnormal hull surfaces therefore calculating an appropriate supported radius according to the distribution of the hull surface s control points is an important issue in order to resolve these problems the graphics triangulation concept is used for selecting the most appropriate supported radius for reference in this paper 3 basic principle of delaunay triangulation in this study delaunay triangulation is applied to solve the problem of determining the nearest point and most adjacent areas as per its application in the fields of computer graphics and geographic information systems delaunay triangulation describes the topological relation between a certain point and its surrounding points in the points set in the form of a triangular mesh the influence of distance between the points set on deformation can be determined by delaunay triangulation following which the support radius of the radial basis interpolation can be identified 3 1 voronoi diagram a voronoi diagram consists of several continuous areas formed by the perpendicular bisector of two adjacent points okabe et al 2009 its mathematical definition is as follows let x x 1 x 2 x n be the set of discrete points on a plane domain r2 the voronoi diagram includes several voronoi polygons and the i th voronoi is determined by formula 11 11 v i x r 2 x x i x x j i 1 2 n j 1 2 n j i where x x i represents the euclidean distance between two points because vi is the intersection of the half planes formed by the perpendicular bisector of point xi and each adjacent point any point x within it is closer to the centre point xi than other points the voronoi diagram divides the entire plane into several separate areas each of which is the closest area of the point within it as shown in fig 1 the half plane v a determined by the perpendicular bisectors between point a and b is an area closer to point a than b and contains point a the planar point set is illustrated in fig 2 vi is a polygonal area consisting of perpendicular bisectors and the closest area of point xi the closest areas of all points form a voronoi diagram of nearest points 3 2 delaunay triangulation delaunay triangulation involves building a triangular network which is the first step in constructing a voronoi diagram as shown in fig 3 a point black point in the voronoi diagram belongs to three voronoi polygons while only one point lies within each voronoi polygon a voronoi polygon connecting three common points includes three points which is a deformed delaunay triangle a collection of all these triangles is known as a delaunay triangulation and the delaunay triangle edges are known as delaunay edges properties of delaunay triangle 1 uniqueness no matter where building is started in the area a unique result exists 2 regional adding deleting or moving one vertex only affects the adjacent triangles 3 closest the latest three points form a triangle and none of the segments triangle sides intersect 4 empty circle features there does not exist within any other point in a triangle a circumcircle range of the delaunay triangulation network 5 maximising minimum angle features the minimum angle of a triangle in delaunay triangulation formed by a scatter point set is the largest this prevents generation of a narrow triangle with a sharp interior angle 4 method for determining support radius 4 1 two 2d control points the wendlandψ 3 1 basis function expression is ψ r 1 r a 4 4 r a 1 where the support radius is a and has been described in the literature yang et al 2008 because of the movement of the two control points the remainder of the points will generate a corresponding displacement in the y direction as shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4 if the support radius is relatively small and the deformation range is concentrated saddle shaped curves will form in the area between the two control points p1 and p2 the points of which are known as saddle points fig 4 a if the support radius is relatively large the deformation regions will form an intersection so that a smooth transition is realised in the area between the control points fig 4 c it has been demonstrated yang et al 2008 that in the case of two 2d control points as long as the area between the two control points does not exhibit a saddle point it can be ensured that there will be no saddle point in other locations when the value of the support radius is double the distance between the two points the second derivative at the midpoint of the connecting line between the two points will be less than zero and there will be no saddle point therefore in this case when using the wendlandψ 3 1 basis functions for curve surface deformation the value of the support radius should satisfy the requirement of a 2 d where d is the distance between the two control points 4 2 2d control points set in order to extend the above conclusion to an arbitrary 2d control points set the nearest area of each control point must be determined as long as the deformation range of each control point can fully cover its nearest area as shown in fig 5 the deformation generated by rbf interpolation can act on the entire area furthermore as long as the area between the two farthest points does not include a saddle point we can ensure that there will be no saddle point in other locations the control points set ω x i y i i 1 2 n is regarded as a scattered points set in the 2d plane every area in the convex hull of the scattered points set determined by delaunay triangulation is a triangle assuming that l i is the length of an arbitrary side of the delaunay triangle the maximum distance of control points is d max l i i 1 2 3 n 6 according to the above conclusion when the basis function is wendlandψ 3 1 it is appropriate to make a 2d d the largest side length of points set triangulation o 4 3 3d control points set for ship hull surface because the hull surface is a complex 3d surface it is necessary to extend the above conclusions to a 3d surface in order to obtain the support radius of the 3d control points set the maximum side length of the delaunay triangle should be determined and 3d triangulation carried out on the points set there are two triangulation methods for space points luo et al 2011 the plane projection and direct triangulation algorithms plane projection triangulation involves projecting the points set onto a plane triangulating by means of the 2d delaunay triangulation algorithm and then mapping this back to form a 3d delaunay triangulation on the basis of maintaining the original geometric topology in the direct triangulation algorithm the 3d points set is triangulated directly considering the spatial position of the point it is difficult to calculate the normal vector and external sphere of each surface of the space tetrahedron although the plane projection triangulation algorithm does not fully consider 3d space constraints it is mature stable simple and quick in actual hull surface deformation applications the points set size is not large the points set topology relationship is simple and the control points generally exhibit uniform distribution along the length and height directions therefore the plane projection triangulation algorithm will be applied in a later study considering that the length is greater than the breadth of the ship the space discrete points can be projected onto a plane xoz plane and then 2d triangulation can be carried out on the points set on that plane then 3d information y direction can be incorporated to reflect back to the original ship form s space thereby completing triangulation of the 3d points set the 2d triangulation algorithm includes the split and merge algorithm radial scan algorithm and basic triangle network growth method in this study we use the basic triangle network method in order to carry out triangulation of the control points set wen et al 2000 the idea is to generate a triangle that satisfies the condition and then determine the point of the satisfying condition in each direction based on the three sides of the triangle and generate new triangles that grow around it until the entire triangle region is full the key to the algorithm is the generation of each triangle while the key to generating triangles is the expansion of each side with the aim of searching for the third appropriate point in the points set to constitute a new triangle as shown in fig 6 point p3 meets the conditions and constitutes a new triangle with points p1 p2 the searching for points and expansion of sides should meet the following four criteria 1 the target point is not on the side to be extended or its extended line 2 the target point and the third point of the triangle to be extended are located on each side of the extended edge 3 each side of a triangle should be used at most twice 4 the angle formed by the target point and the two end points of the side to be extended should be as large as possible basic triangle network growth algorithm steps 1 select a point p 1 from the points set and traverse the remaining points to determine its closest point p2 when searching for a point p3 that forms a triangle with points p1 p2 the angles with points p1 p2 should be as large as possible 2 in the same manner based on side p1p3 the target point and the point p2 are on different sides and each side should be used at most twice and p2p3 continue to expand in order to obtain new triangles 3 traverse all remaining mesh points to form a triangulation 4 4 influence of support radius on ship hull surface deformation apply the above conclusions to hull surface deformation and then select control vertexes of five nurbs on the bow surface as variable points as shown in fig 7 the five control points move along the y direction with appropriate displacement the changes in coordinates are displayed in table 1 the moving of control points causes the bow to expand in the positive y axis and control points can be selected on the outline of the bow and station lines at mid ship as constraint points as indicated by the solid lines in the figure construct a delaunay triangulation on the control points set as illustrated in fig 8 the maximum side length of the triangulation is d different support radiuses are used to carry out research on surface deformation the ellipse area in fig 9 a and b is located on the cross sectional line between control points 2 3 and 4 5 when the support radius increases from d to 2d the ellipse area surface continues to deform outwards as shown in fig 9 when the support radius is d the strain energy in the surface area between control points 2 3 and 4 5 is smaller and a saddle point is formed so that the surface cannot transit smoothly fig 10 demonstrates that when the support radius increases from 2d to 3d surface deformation in the area in which the ship bow control points are located is completely consistent and only slight deformation occurs on the hull surface behind control points 4 5 as shown in fig 10 therefore when the support radius is 2d the surface between the control points set will transit smoothly if the supporting radius continues to increase deformation will become less obvious in summary it is appropriate to select a 2d when applying the wendlandψ 3 1 basis functions to ship hull surface deformation 4 5 deformation example the advantages of applying rbf interpolation to realise ship hull surface modification include ensuring that the waterline deck at the side or control points between specific stations do not change when conducting hull deformation so that the specific lines of the initial ship can be maintained in order to allow for easier general arrangement design the following is an example of this concept as shown in fig 11 firstly select the control points on the bow outline design the waterline as invariant points and the other five control points as variable points then insert the coordinates of all control points including invariant and variable points into formula 4 and solve the equation to obtain the undetermined coefficients λ i c i finally insert the remaining grid points of the original hull into the equation to obtain the position of the new grid points in order to obtain new hull lines from fig 11 we can conclude that the waterline shape does not change following deformation similarly as shown in fig 12 select six control points as variable points and control points on the bow outline and partial station lines as invariable points by adjusting the six variable control points a new ship will be obtained following rbf interpolation as illustrated in fig 12 the line type does not change following deformation of the bow part for stations 8 to 12 5 resistance performance optimization and model test validation the hull form optimization process is illustrated in fig 13 and outlined as follows 1 the rbf interpolation method described in section 2 2 is applied in order to realise ship hull surface deformation 2 the hydrostatical properties of each new ship such as displacement and longitudinal position of the buoyancy centre are calculated if the constraint conditions are satisfied the wave making resistance calculation is carried out by cfd software otherwise variables are modified again in order to create a new hull form 3 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ is used to drive the entire optimization process if the maximum generation is reached the optimal ship is output else the design variables are modified in order to repeat the above process cfd analysis can be performed using either potential or viscous flow theory and potential flow theory is selected for the current application with the post processing algorithms the computational results such as wave pattern and longitudinal wave cut can be displayed in a user friendly manner in this study the shipflow software is used as the cfd solver shipflow developed by swedish flowtech international ab is designed to solve ship hydrodynamic problems 5 1 description of optimization problem the series 60 vessel calibration model is accredited as a standard ship by the ittc organisation for model testing the length between perpendiculars of the ship model is 3 048 m and the block coefficient is 0 6 the main elements are displayed in fig 14 and table 2 in order to save optimization time this paper adopt step by step optimization for the series 60 ship firstly the bow of the series 60 ship is optimised where the optimization objective is minimised wave resistance secondly on the basis of the bow optimization optimization of the tail shape is continued where the optimization objective is minimum total resistance 5 2 step 1 bow shape optimization 5 2 1 optimization objectives the key point of this paper is for the optimal hull to achieve the effect of reducing resistance within a certain speed range therefore the optimization objective is defined as follows min f o b j r w f n 0 27 5 2 2 optimization variables this example uses the method described in section 2 2 to modify the hull surface firstly constraints are applied to the deck on the side line of the bottom and stern profile six variable points are selected as shown in fig 15 wherein variable point 1 changes along the x and z directions to control the length and height parameters of the bulbous bow furthermore variable points 2 to 6 change along the y direction wherein variable point 2 controls the width parameter of the bulbous bow variable points 3 and 5 are arranged along the waterline to control the inflow angle size and the inflow section shape on the waterline and variable points 4 and 6 can have a significant impact on the bilge line the upper and lower limits and initial value of each variable point are displayed in table 3 5 2 3

tail shape of the ship remain unchanged in the above δ l c b and s are the displacement longitudinal distance from the buoyancy centre to amidships and the wet surface area of the initial ship respectively while δ o p t i l c b o p t i and s o p t i are the corresponding parameters of the optimised ship 4 optimization algorithms in order to save optimization time according to optimization experience genetic algorithms with a population size of 50 and hereditary algebra of 50 are applied 5 results analysis compared with the initial ship the wave making and total resistance of the optimal ship decrease by 27 5 and 7 68 respectively with the design speed see fig 16 table 4 5 3 step 2 tail shape optimization 5 3 1 optimization objectives based on the bow shape optimization results we continue to optimise the tail shape of the series 60 vessel model the optimization objectives are defined as follows min f o b j r t f n 0 27 5 3 2 optimization variables for hull surface modification this paper still use the method described in section 2 2 the variable point numbers are selected as 7 to 12 see fig 17 all the variable points move along the y direction and the constraint conditions are the deck at side line of the bottom and stern profile the upper and lower limits and initial value of each variable point are displayed in table 5 5 3 3 constraints 1 displacement δ o p t i 0 99 δ 2 longitudinal location of centre of buoyancy l c b l c b o p t i l c b 0 01 3 only the geometry of the bow profile is changed the length breadth draft and tail shape of the ship remain unchanged in the above δ l c b and s are the displacement longitudinal distance from the buoyancy centre to amidships and the wet surface area of the initial ship respectively while δ o p t i l c b o p t i and s o p t i are the corresponding parameters of the optimal ship 4 optimization algorithms in order to save optimization time according to optimization experience genetic algorithms with a population size of 50 and hereditary algebra of 50 are applied to the hull form optimization process 5 results analysis the optimal model s60 step 2 total resistance drops by 10 64 compared to the initial ship with the design speed see table 6 it can be seen from fig 18 that the bulbous bow of the optimised ship is slightly upturned and the longitudinal profile is s shaped similar to the sv shaped bulbous bow which may produce significantly beneficial wave interference at high speed the transverse section area curve of the optimised ship is slightly concave after the position of 0 5 times the length so the ship bow is thinner the inlet flow angle decreases and the inlet flow length increases which are beneficial factors in reducing wave making resistance it can be concluded from table 6 that the stern optimization result is the scheme of the wet surface area with a small increase under the displacement constraints so that too much friction resistance cannot be added and the optimised stern can be positioned more inward than that of the initial ship furthermore the flow length increases slightly which is beneficial to the reduction of viscous pressure resistance the optimised ship resistance is calculated with the shipflow tool during the optimization process computations are performed on a 2 cpu pc intel core 3 10 ghz 4 gb ram the resistance curve trend of the two conditions is almost the same as illustrated in fig 19 during the bulbous bow optimization stage the total resistance decreases significantly at high speed approximately 7 and increases by approximately 3 before reaching the design speed fr 0 27 this is because the bulbous bow increases the wet surface area which results in higher friction resistance at low speed the wave making resistance accounts for a smaller proportion therefore the total resistance increases when the speed is increased above the design speed the wave making resistance component increases and the bulbous bow effect becomes obvious which reduces the total resistance following optimization of the bow profile it can be seen that compared to the results of the first optimization step the resistance performance is improved slightly when the speed is below the design speed the optimization of the stern shape decreases the viscous pressure resistance and total resistance across the entire speed range compared with the initial ship figs 20 25 represent the waveform and side longitudinal wave comparison charts of the initial and optimised ship at three typical speeds when fr 0 2176 as shown in fig 21 in addition to the reduction of the first crest in the optimised ship bow the wave amplitude in other positions is increased to varying degrees which indicates that the effect of the bulbous bow on reducing wave making resistance is not obvious at low speed but is obvious at medium or high speeds in the side longitudinal wave diagram the first wave crest height in the bow decreases obviously and the wave crest height in other positions also decreases significantly which suggests that the wave energy decreases so that the work done on wave making resistance by the ship is reduced and wave making resistance performance is improved 5 4 model test validation in order to validate the hull form optimization results resistance tests were conducted on the series 60 initial model and optimal model the test was carried out in the wuhan university of technology whut ship towing tank test conditions shown in table 7 the models are displayed in fig 26 under conditions of free heave and trim the total resistance of the s60 opti decreases within the entire speed ranges as shown in fig 27 below the design speed v 1 49 m s the decreased total resistance range is small the drag reduction effect is 8 79 at design speed as the speed increases the optimization effect is more obvious and reaches approximately 12 6 conclusion this article focuses on the support radius selection method which is extended from two 2d control points to the 3d surface control points set and significant conclusions are obtained hull form optimization based on radial basis interpolation in the hull form modification process has been improved and has been applied to the optimization of the series 60 vessel model the conclusions are as follows 1 the wendlandψ 3 1 basis function has local and global basis function characteristics within limits and is more flexible it offers the advantages of being qualitative sparse and reducing computation time and is suitable for ship hull surface fairing deformation 2 the scaling factor support radius can be introduced into the wendlandψ 3 1 basis function to broaden the application scope of the hull form modification method 3 when radial basis interpolation technology is used in hull form modification the support radius should be twice the maximum length of the delaunay triangulation 4 the optimization results and model test verification of the series 60 vessel model indicate that the hull form modification method based on radial basis interpolation offers effective practical engineering value and can be applied to a variety of ship hydrodynamic optimization processes future studies will mainly concentrate on the following three aspects 1 thus far variable control points of the bow have been uniformly arranged on the hull surface therefore there must be certain control points with little effect on hydrodynamic performance for this reason in a later study we intend to conduct a sensitivity analysis on these control points in accordance with the site and retain the points with a greater influence on optimization results in order to save optimization time and provide experience and a basis for a later study on selecting appropriate control points for other ships 2 ship form optimization requires a great deal of time therefore a later study will focus on an approximation technique that saves optimization time by means of establishing an approximate model to replace high precision cfd calculations 3 multidisciplinary and multi objective ship optimization constitute a development trend for the future therefore a later study will also focus on the development of a comprehensive optimization study of ship speediness manoeuvrability and seakeeping performance acknowledgement the work are

modification delaunay triangulation resistance performance optimization 1 introduction the energy efficiency design index eedi was proposed by imo in 2009 mepc 2009 and ship resistance performance optimization is an effective method for meeting the eedi requirements with the rapid development of computer technology and computational fluid dynamics cfd hull form optimization based on simulation has become a research hotspot harries et al 2001 peri and campana 2003 2005 campana et al 2006 diez and peri 2010 li and zhao 2011 li 2012 yang and kim 2011 yang et al 2015b and tahara et al 2004 2006 have combined numerical simulation techniques and optimization algorithms realised the integration of cad and cfd established a cfd based hull form optimization platform successfully completed the simulation optimization design of hull lines and obtained an optimal hull form with improved hydrodynamic performance xu and wang 2001 traced the development of a classified optimization procedure consisting of five levels in order to complete the fine optimization of ship hull lines and demonstrated that cfd code is applicable to the optimization of ship hull lines in terms of hull resistance performance abt et al 2003 presented a parametric approach to modelling with the friendship modeler as well as hydrodynamics with shipflow for ship hull forms campana et al 2003 2004 and 2005 investigated a variable fidelity approach for speeding up the optimization process using a free surface rans in a multi objective design problem tahara et al 2004 employed a finite difference gradient based approach for stern and sonar dome optimization peri et al 2004 introduced a design optimization method based on large scale numerical simulations simulation based design sbd for complex

operating and environmental conditions and a particle swarm optimization algorithm was applied for the global minimisation process minimising the expectation and standard deviation of the unit transportation cost since then the feasibility of rdo based on actual operating ship data has been demonstrated grigoropoulos and chalkias 2010 proposed an improved scheme for hull form optimization with respect to calm water resistance and seakeeping these authors also adopted the friendship modeler for hull form modelling and modification as well as modefrontier and easycodes to accomplish multi objective optimization by means of evolutionary strategies yang and kim 2011 developed an efficient and effective hull surface modification technique for cfd based hull form optimization in order to achieve both local and global hull form modifications by combining the two approaches kim et al 2010 developed a new methodology for hydrodynamic optimization of a triswach which considers not only the side hull positions but also their shape in order to satisfy the requirements of a ship s hydrodynamic performance the hull form is somewhat complicated when using a non uniform rational b spline nurbs to represent the hull surface accurately the number of control points must be extremely large which presents difficulties in hull surface modification therefore several hull surface modification methods have been explored and can be divided into two categories as follows 1 the fusion method based on the initial hull form tahara et al 2006 feng et al 2010 this method can guarantee that the new hull surface is faired when the initial hull form is smooth however the limitation of this method is that it cannot consider the deformation of local hull lines 2 direct modification of the control points based on the bezier patch and free form deformation methods this approach can be used for geometric reconstruction of the entire hull form but the design variables are relatively more important and the control points must be carefully selected hull surface deformation is achieved using the initial ship s nurbs control points as design parameters in the above methods this study focuses on the hull surface modification method a hull optimization tool is developed with the hull surface modification module the enhanced hull optimization tool is applied to the resistance performance optimization of a series 60 vessel and model tests are carried out in order to verify the method s validity 2 hull surface modification method the hull surface modification method plays a vital role in ship hydrodynamic performance optimization and should meet the following requirements 1 in order to save optimization time hull surface modification should be achieved using few design parameters 2 the modification range of the hull form should be sufficiently large 3 the local modified hull surface should have a fairing connection with other parts of the hull surface 4 the optimal hull form should be suitable for applying to manufacturing in this paper the radial base interpolation technique is used to modify the hull surface based on the nurbs hull surface representation 2 1 nurbs surface representation for hull form in this paper the nurbs surface is used to represent the hull form the theory for which is as follows piegl 1989 1 p u v i 0 n j 0 m w i j d i j n i k u n j l v i 0 n j 0 m w i j n i k u n j l v where u v are the knot vectors w 0 0 w m 0 w 0 n w m n 0 are the nurbs control points w i j 0 are the weight factors that can contact the control points w 0 0 w m 0 w 0 n w m n 0 respectively and n j l v j 0 1 n is a b spline basic function with its first subscript u showing the sequence numbers and its second subscript k showing the power its order is 1 of the b spline it can be defined by a recurrence formula 2 n i 0 u 1 u i u u i 1 0 o t h e r n i k u u u i u i k u i n i k 1 u 0 0 0 u i k 1 u i u i k 1 u i 1 n i 1 k 1 u it can be demonstrated that when the knot vectors in the v directions are fixed the value types at each hull form point are decided by the control point positions therefore surface modification can be achieved by modifying the control point positions to generate a new hull form 2 2 hull surface modification method based on rbf interpolation and existing problems the radial basis function rbf for automatic modification was briefly introduced by kim et al 2008 the rbf is a type of real valued function that is symmetric along the radial direction the value of which depends only on the euclidean distance between any point x and the centre of point xi buhmann 2004 the basis function is described as follows 3 ϕ x x i i 1 2 n where xi is the centre of the rbf and p x y z is the rbf of the variable euclidean distance when rbf interpolation is used during hull form modification the function can be described as follows morris et al 2008 4 s x i 1 n λ i ϕ x x i p x where s x represents the displacement of point p x on the hull surface p x a low order polynomial is used to recover the translation and rotation and has the specific form p x c 1 x c 2 y c 3 z c 4 n is the number of control points and x x i is the euclidean distance between two points in this case the 3d wendland s function with compact support features is adopted as a basis function 5 ϕ x 1 x 4 4 x 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 this equation guarantees that the constructed system matrix is a positive definite matrix the equation coefficients f f 1 f 2 f 3 s b p n d s and f f 1 f 2 f 3 s b p n d s are obtained by changing the control point coordinates morse et al 2001 6 f f 1 f 2 f 3 s b p n d s where m m 1 m 2 m 3 s b p r n d s is the control point displacement additional requirements include the following buhmann 2000 7 k 1 n λ k x k t 0 k 1 n λ k 0 the values of coefficients λ j and ρ can be obtained by solving the linear system 8 f 0 m q q t 0 λ c where λ λ 1 λ 2 λ n t c c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 t f f 1 f 2 f n t m i j ϕ x i x j i j 1 2 n 9 q x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 1 x n y n z n 1 all of the unknown coefficients in eq 4 can be determined by solving the above equations then new coordinates for all unknown points can be obtained by means of rbf interpolation in order to enable a compactly supported function to exhibit effective universality wendland added a scaling factor a also known as a supported radius resulting in the basis function below 10 ϕ x 1 x a 4 4 x a 1 the added scaling factor a of a set value does not influence the basis function s positive definite but can control its deformation range the size of the supported radius directly affects the deformation range solution efficiency and surface smoothing the larger the supported radius the larger the deformation range and the lower the solution efficiency are although a smaller supported radius results in a smaller deformation range it is possible for this to lead to abnormal hull surfaces therefore calculating an appropriate supported radius according to the distribution of the hull surface s control points is an important issue in order to resolve these problems the graphics triangulation concept is used for selecting the most appropriate supported radius for reference in this paper 3 basic principle of delaunay triangulation in this study delaunay triangulation is applied to solve the problem of determining the nearest point and most adjacent areas as per its application in the fields of computer graphics and geographic information systems delaunay triangulation describes the topological relation between a certain point and its surrounding points in the points set in the form of a triangular mesh the influence of distance between the points set on deformation can be determined by delaunay triangulation following which the support radius of the radial basis interpolation can be identified 3 1 voronoi diagram a voronoi diagram consists of several continuous areas formed by the perpendicular bisector of two adjacent points okabe et al 2009 its mathematical definition is as follows let x x 1 x 2 x n be the set of discrete points on a plane domain r2 the voronoi diagram includes several voronoi polygons and the i th voronoi is determined by formula 11 11 v i x r 2 x x i x x j i 1 2 n j 1 2 n j i where x x i represents the euclidean distance between two points because vi is the intersection of the half planes formed by the perpendicular bisector of point xi and each adjacent point any point x within it is closer to the centre point xi than other points the voronoi diagram divides the entire plane into several separate areas each of which is the closest area of the point within it as shown in fig 1 the half plane v a determined by the perpendicular bisectors between point a and b is an area closer to point a than b and contains point a the planar point set is illustrated in fig 2 vi is a polygonal area consisting of perpendicular bisectors and the closest area of point xi the closest areas of all points form a voronoi diagram of nearest points 3 2 delaunay triangulation delaunay triangulation involves building a triangular network which is the first step in constructing a voronoi diagram as shown in fig 3 a point black point in the voronoi diagram belongs to three voronoi polygons while only one point lies within each voronoi polygon a voronoi polygon connecting three common points includes three points which is a deformed delaunay triangle a collection of all these triangles is known as a delaunay triangulation and the delaunay triangle edges are known as delaunay edges properties of delaunay triangle 1 uniqueness no matter where building is started in the area a unique result exists 2 regional adding deleting or moving one vertex only affects the adjacent triangles 3 closest the latest three points form a triangle and none of the segments triangle sides intersect 4 empty circle features there does not exist within any other point in a triangle a circumcircle range of the delaunay triangulation network 5 maximising minimum angle features the minimum angle of a triangle in delaunay triangulation formed by a scatter point set is the largest this prevents generation of a narrow triangle with a sharp interior angle 4 method for determining support radius 4 1 two 2d control points the wendlandψ 3 1 basis function expression is ψ r 1 r a 4 4 r a 1 where the support radius is a and has been described in the literature yang et al 2008 because of the movement of the two control points the remainder of the points will generate a corresponding displacement in the y direction as shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4 if the support radius is relatively small and the deformation range is concentrated saddle shaped curves will form in the area between the two control points p1 and p2 the points of which are known as saddle points fig 4 a if the support radius is relatively large the deformation regions will form an intersection so that a smooth transition is realised in the area between the control points fig 4 c it has been demonstrated yang et al 2008 that in the case of two 2d control points as long as the area between the two control points does not exhibit a saddle point it can be ensured that there will be no saddle point in other locations when the value of the support radius is double the distance between the two points the second derivative at the midpoint of the connecting line between the two points will be less than zero and there will be no saddle point therefore in this case when using the wendlandψ 3 1 basis functions for curve surface deformation the value of the support radius should satisfy the requirement of a 2 d where d is the distance between the two control points 4 2 2d control points set in order to extend the above conclusion to an arbitrary 2d control points set the nearest area of each control point must be determined as long as the deformation range of each control point can fully cover its nearest area as shown in fig 5 the deformation generated by rbf interpolation can act on the entire area furthermore as long as the area between the two farthest points does not include a saddle point we can ensure that there will be no saddle point in other locations the control points set ω x i y i i 1 2 n is regarded as a scattered points set in the 2d plane every area in the convex hull of the scattered points set determined by delaunay triangulation is a triangle assuming that l i is the length of an arbitrary side of the delaunay triangle the maximum distance of control points is d max l i i 1 2 3 n 6 according to the above conclusion when the basis function is wendlandψ 3 1 it is appropriate to make a 2d d the largest side length of points set triangulation o 4 3 3d control points set for ship hull surface because the hull surface is a complex 3d surface it is necessary to extend the above conclusions to a 3d surface in order to obtain the support radius of the 3d control points set the maximum side length of the delaunay triangle should be determined and 3d triangulation carried out on the points set there are two triangulation methods for space points luo et al 2011 the plane projection and direct triangulation algorithms plane projection triangulation involves projecting the points set onto a plane triangulating by means of the 2d delaunay triangulation algorithm and then mapping this back to form a 3d delaunay triangulation on the basis of maintaining the original geometric topology in the direct triangulation algorithm the 3d points set is triangulated directly considering the spatial position of the point it is difficult to calculate the normal vector and external sphere of each surface of the space tetrahedron although the plane projection triangulation algorithm does not fully consider 3d space constraints it is mature stable simple and quick in actual hull surface deformation applications the points set size is not large the points set topology relationship is simple and the control points generally exhibit uniform distribution along the length and height directions therefore the plane projection triangulation algorithm will be applied in a later study considering that the length is greater than the breadth of the ship the space discrete points can be projected onto a plane xoz plane and then 2d triangulation can be carried out on the points set on that plane then 3d information y direction can be incorporated to reflect back to the original ship form s space thereby completing triangulation of the 3d points set the 2d triangulation algorithm includes the split and merge algorithm radial scan algorithm and basic triangle network growth method in this study we use the basic triangle network method in order to carry out triangulation of the control points set wen et al 2000 the idea is to generate a triangle that satisfies the condition and then determine the point of the satisfying condition in each direction based on the three sides of the triangle and generate new triangles that grow around it until the entire triangle region is full the key to the algorithm is the generation of each triangle while the key to generating triangles is the expansion of each side with the aim of searching for the third appropriate point in the points set to constitute a new triangle as shown in fig 6 point p3 meets the conditions and constitutes a new triangle with points p1 p2 the searching for points and expansion of sides should meet the following four criteria 1 the target point is not on the side to be extended or its extended line 2 the target point and the third point of the triangle to be extended are located on each side of the extended edge 3 each side of a triangle should be used at most twice 4 the angle formed by the target point and the two end points of the side to be extended should be as large as possible basic triangle network growth algorithm steps 1 select a point p 1 from the points set and traverse the remaining points to determine its closest point p2 when searching for a point p3 that forms a triangle with points p1 p2 the angles with points p1 p2 should be as large as possible 2 in the same manner based on side p1p3 the target point and the point p2 are on different sides and each side should be used at most twice and p2p3 continue to expand in order to obtain new triangles 3 traverse all remaining mesh points to form a triangulation 4 4 influence of support radius on ship hull surface deformation apply the above conclusions to hull surface deformation and then select control vertexes of five nurbs on the bow surface as variable points as shown in fig 7 the five control points move along the y direction with appropriate displacement the changes in coordinates are displayed in table 1 the moving of control points causes the bow to expand in the positive y axis and control points can be selected on the outline of the bow and station lines at mid ship as constraint points as indicated by the solid lines in the figure construct a delaunay triangulation on the control points set as illustrated in fig 8 the maximum side length of the triangulation is d different support radiuses are used to carry out research on surface deformation the ellipse area in fig 9 a and b is located on the cross sectional line between control points 2 3 and 4 5 when the support radius increases from d to 2d the ellipse area surface continues to deform outwards as shown in fig 9 when the support radius is d the strain energy in the surface area between control points 2 3 and 4 5 is smaller and a saddle point is formed so that the surface cannot transit smoothly fig 10 demonstrates that when the support radius increases from 2d to 3d surface deformation in the area in which the ship bow control points are located is completely consistent and only slight deformation occurs on the hull surface behind control points 4 5 as shown in fig 10 therefore when the support radius is 2d the surface between the control points set will transit smoothly if the supporting radius continues to increase deformation will become less obvious in summary it is appropriate to select a 2d when applying the wendlandψ 3 1 basis functions to ship hull surface deformation 4 5 deformation example the advantages of applying rbf interpolation to realise ship hull surface modification include ensuring that the waterline deck at the side or control points between specific stations do not change when conducting hull deformation so that the specific lines of the initial ship can be maintained in order to allow for easier general arrangement design the following is an example of this concept as shown in fig 11 firstly select the control points on the bow outline design the waterline as invariant points and the other five control points as variable points then insert the coordinates of all control points including invariant and variable points into formula 4 and solve the equation to obtain the undetermined coefficients λ i c i finally insert the remaining grid points of the original hull into the equation to obtain the position of the new grid points in order to obtain new hull lines from fig 11 we can conclude that the waterline shape does not change following deformation similarly as shown in fig 12 select six control points as variable points and control points on the bow outline and partial station lines as invariable points by adjusting the six variable control points a new ship will be obtained following rbf interpolation as illustrated in fig 12 the line type does not change following deformation of the bow part for stations 8 to 12 5 resistance performance optimization and model test validation the hull form optimization process is illustrated in fig 13 and outlined as follows 1 the rbf interpolation method described in section 2 2 is applied in order to realise ship hull surface deformation 2 the hydrostatical properties of each new ship such as displacement and longitudinal position of the buoyancy centre are calculated if the constraint conditions are satisfied the wave making resistance calculation is carried out by cfd software otherwise variables are modified again in order to create a new hull form 3 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ is used to drive the entire optimization process if the maximum generation is reached the optimal ship is output else the design variables are modified in order to repeat the above process cfd analysis can be performed using either potential or viscous flow theory and potential flow theory is selected for the current application with the post processing algorithms the computational results such as wave pattern and longitudinal wave cut can be displayed in a user friendly manner in this study the shipflow software is used as the cfd solver shipflow developed by swedish flowtech international ab is designed to solve ship hydrodynamic problems 5 1 description of optimization problem the series 60 vessel calibration model is accredited as a standard ship by the ittc organisation for model testing the length between perpendiculars of the ship model is 3 048 m and the block coefficient is 0 6 the main elements are displayed in fig 14 and table 2 in order to save optimization time this paper adopt step by step optimization for the series 60 ship firstly the bow of the series 60 ship is optimised where the optimization objective is minimised wave resistance secondly on the basis of the bow optimization optimization of the tail shape is continued where the optimization objective is minimum total resistance 5 2 step 1 bow shape optimization 5 2 1 optimization objectives the key point of this paper is for the optimal hull to achieve the effect of reducing resistance within a certain speed range therefore the optimization objective is defined as follows min f o b j r w f n 0 27 5 2 2 optimization variables this example uses the method described in section 2 2 to modify the hull surface firstly constraints are applied to the deck on the side line of the bottom and stern profile six variable points are selected as shown in fig 15 wherein variable point 1 changes along the x and z directions to control the length and height parameters of the bulbous bow furthermore variable points 2 to 6 change along the y direction wherein variable point 2 controls the width parameter of the bulbous bow variable points 3 and 5 are arranged along the waterline to control the inflow angle size and the inflow section shape on the waterline and variable points 4 and 6 can have a significant impact on the bilge line the upper and lower limits and initial value of each variable point are displayed in table 3 5 2 3 constraints 1 displacement δ o p t i 0 99 δ 2 longitudinal location of centre of buoyancy l c b l c b o p t i l c b 0 01 3 only the geometry of the bow profile is changed the length breadth draft and tail shape of the ship remain unchanged in the above δ l c b and s are the displacement longitudinal distance from the buoyancy centre to amidships and the wet surface area of the initial ship respectively while δ o p t i l c b o p t i and s o p t i are the corresponding parameters of the optimised ship 4 optimization algorithms in order to save optimization time according to optimization experience genetic algorithms with a population size of 50 and hereditary algebra of 50 are applied 5 results analysis compared with the initial ship the wave making and total resistance of the optimal ship decrease by 27 5 and 7 68 respectively with the design speed see fig 16 table 4 5 3 step 2 tail shape optimization 5 3 1 optimization objectives based on the bow shape optimization results we continue to optimise the tail shape of the series 60 vessel model the optimization objectives are defined as follows min f o b j r t f n 0 27 5 3 2 optimization variables for hull surface modification this paper still use the method described in section 2 2 the variable point numbers are selected as 7 to 12 see fig 17 all the variable points move along the y direction and the constraint conditions are the deck at side line of the bottom and stern profile the upper and lower limits and initial value of each variable point are displayed in table 5 5 3 3 constraints 1 displacement δ o p t i 0 99 δ 2 longitudinal location of centre of buoyancy l c b l c b o p t i l c b 0 01 3 only the geometry of the bow profile is changed the length breadth draft and tail shape of the ship remain unchanged in the above δ l c b and s are the displacement longitudinal distance from the buoyancy centre to amidships and the wet surface area of the initial ship respectively while δ o p t i l c b o p t i and s o p t i are the corresponding parameters of the optimal ship 4 optimization algorithms in order to save optimization time according to optimization experience genetic algorithms with a population size of 50 and hereditary algebra of 50 are applied to the hull form optimization process 5 results analysis the optimal model s60 step 2 total resistance drops by 10 64 compared to the initial ship with the design speed see table 6 it can be seen from fig 18 that the bulbous bow of the optimised ship is slightly upturned and the longitudinal profile is s shaped similar to the sv shaped bulbous bow which may produce significantly beneficial wave interference at high speed the transverse section area curve of the optimised ship is slightly concave after the position of 0 5 times the length so the ship bow is thinner the inlet flow angle decreases and the inlet flow length increases which are beneficial factors in reducing wave making resistance it can be concluded from table 6 that the stern optimization result is the scheme of the wet surface area with a small increase under the displacement constraints so that too much friction resistance cannot be added and the optimised stern can be positioned more inward than that of the initial ship furthermore the flow length increases slightly which is beneficial to the reduction of viscous pressure resistance the optimised ship resistance is calculated with the shipflow tool during the optimization process computations are performed on a 2 cpu pc intel core 3 10 ghz 4 gb ram the resistance curve trend of the two conditions is almost the same as illustrated in fig 19 during the bulbous bow optimization stage the total resistance decreases significantly at high speed approximately 7 and increases by approximately 3 before reaching the design speed fr 0 27 this is because the bulbous bow increases the wet surface area which results in higher friction resistance at low speed the wave making resistance accounts for a smaller proportion therefore the total resistance increases when the speed is increased above the design speed the wave making resistance component increases and the bulbous bow effect becomes obvious which reduces the total resistance following optimization of the bow profile it can be seen that compared to the results of the first optimization step the resistance performance is improved slightly when the speed is below the design speed the optimization of the stern shape decreases the viscous pressure resistance and total resistance across the entire speed range compared with the initial ship figs 20 25 represent the waveform and side longitudinal wave comparison charts of the initial and optimised ship at three typical speeds when fr 0 2176 as shown in fig 21 in addition to the reduction of the first crest in the optimised ship bow the wave amplitude in other positions is increased to varying degrees which indicates that the effect of the bulbous bow on reducing wave making resistance is not obvious at low speed but is obvious at medium or high speeds in the side longitudinal wave diagram the first wave crest height in the bow decreases obviously and the wave crest height in other positions also decreases significantly which suggests that the wave energy decreases so that the work done on wave making resistance by the ship is reduced and wave making resistance performance is improved 5 4 model test validation in order to validate the hull form optimization results resistance tests were conducted on the series 60 initial model and optimal model the test was carried out in the wuhan university of technology whut ship towing tank test conditions shown in table 7 the models are displayed in fig 26 under conditions of free heave and trim the total resistance of the s60 opti decreases within the entire speed ranges as shown in fig 27 below the design speed v 1 49 m s the decreased total resistance range is small the drag reduction effect is 8 79 at design speed as the speed increases the optimization effect is more obvious and reaches approximately 12 6 conclusion this article focuses on the support radius selection method which is extended from two 2d control points to the 3d surface control points set and significant conclusions are obtained hull form optimization based on radial basis interpolation in the hull form modification process has been improved and has been applied to the optimization of the series 60 vessel model the conclusions are as follows 1 the wendlandψ 3 1 basis function has local and global basis function characteristics within limits and is more flexible it offers the advantages of being qualitative sparse and reducing computation time and is suitable for ship hull surface fairing deformation 2 the scaling factor support radius can be introduced into the wendlandψ 3 1 basis function to broaden the application scope of the hull form modification method 3 when radial basis interpolation technology is used in hull form modification the support radius should be twice the maximum length of the delaunay triangulation 4 the optimization results and model test verification of the series 60 vessel model indicate that the hull form modification method based on radial basis interpolation offers effective practical engineering value and can be applied to a variety of ship hydrodynamic optimization processes future studies will mainly concentrate on the following three aspects 1 thus far variable control points of the bow have been uniformly arranged on the hull surface therefore there must be certain control points with little effect on hydrodynamic performance for this reason in a later study we intend to conduct a sensitivity analysis on these control points in accordance with the site and retain the points with a greater influence on optimization results in order to save optimization time and provide experience and a basis for a later study on selecting appropriate control points for other ships 2 ship form optimization requires a great deal of time therefore a later study will focus on an approximation technique that saves

23559,the hydrodynamic loads of mean drag and fluctuating lift are presented for a circular cylinder fitted with 2 4 and 8 wake control cylinders positioned around its circumference the device is fitted around the body to interact with the flow in the near wake and control vortex shedding the efficiency regarding lift suppression and drag reduction has been investigated for nine different cases varying the diameter of the control cylinders and their relative gap from the wall all cases have been compared with the hydrodynamic forces of a plain cylinder the configuration with 4 control cylinders gap ratio of g d 0 05 g is the gap between the control cylinders and the main cylinder of diameter d and diameter ratio of d d 0 06 d is the diameter of the control cylinders produced the lowest drag when compared to all other configurations mean drag coefficient was 0 75 approximately 50 lower than that of a bare cylinder experiments have been conducted in a free surface water channel at moderated reynolds numbers between 5000 and 50 000 keywords vortex shedding wake control drag reduction axial rods shrouds 1 introduction the periodic shedding of vortices downstream of a bluff body generates cyclic hydrodynamic loads that feed back on the body fluctuating lift will be at the frequency f s in which vortices are shed in the wake while drag will be at double that frequency 2 f s with time the cyclic loads may cause structural problems to the body such as fatigue damage a special concern for slender structures as riser pipes and submarine cables flexible structures with a bluff shape may be excited by this periodic load and respond with considerable oscillations the motion of the structure interacts with the flow and develop into what is called vortex induced vibrations viv mitigating vortex shedding and viv are important issues for many engineering applications ranging from aeroacoustic problems in aviation to the vibration of a drilling riser in offshore exploration hence the scientific community and the industry are constantly pursuing the development of new methods to control the wake and design novel viv suppressors devices attached to the body to mitigate the damaging effects of the vibration wake control mechanisms can be classified as passive or active systems choi et al 2008 with the latter considering both open loop and closed loop control systems zdravkovich 1981 presents several passive control devices classifying them into three categories according to the way they affect the vortex shedding mechanism i surface protrusions which affect separation lines and or separated shear layers they involve helical strakes wires fins studs or spheres among others ii shrouds that affect the entrainment layers around the body the perforated shroud and the axial rods are two examples iii near wake stabilizers that affect the switch of the confluence point fairings and splitter plates which prevents communication between the opposing shear layers of the wake are common examples these passive methods require no external energy supply and they act primarily disrupting the formation and development of an organized wake of vortices among the various solutions for passive vortex shedding and viv suppression the helical strakes are one of the most commonly used in air and water flows bearman and brankovic 2004 korkischko and meneghini 2010 but despite the proven efficiency of the strakes in reducing fluctuating lift they increase the mean drag korkischko and meneghini 2011 zdravkovich 1981 which is undesirable in a great number of applications placing a smaller control rod upstream of the main cylinder is a well established strategy for drag reduction lee et al 2004 strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 proved that if the small control cylinder is otherwise placed within a defined region in the near wake downstream of the main cylinder the wake could be effectively suppressed at a reynolds number of r e 80 suppression of the vortex street is associated with damping the instability in the near wake region in their investigation the ratio between the diameter of the control cylinder to the diameter of the main cylinder varied between d d 1 3 to 1 20 they also showed that wake suppression is the most efficient when the small control cylinder is placed roughly around 1 d downstream of the cylinder center and 1 d to the side of the centerline of the wake for d d 0 05 to 0 07 their experimental and numerical results also indicate that this region of effectiveness strongly depends on r e and d d for r e 80 to 300 kuo et al 2007 showed detailed flow structures revealing the primary mechanism that led to significant lift and drag reduction without completely suppressing the shedding of a vortex street zdravkovich 1981 presented results of an axial rod shroud following the concept that the shroud should break up the flow into a large number of small vortices axial rods were fitted about the circular cylinder and several parameters were varied in order to find an optimum configuration for viv suppression the number of rods varied between 4 and 218 defining the shroud porosity the distance of the rods to the wall of the cylinder gap and their circumferential distribution tests were performed in a water channel and in a wind tunnel for r e 10 3 10 5 the most interesting result as far as suppression was concerned was obtained for a porosity of 63 39 rods when the rods were positioned with a gap of g d 0 25 from the cylinder wall but most surprisingly was the fact that the best suppression was achieve when the rods were not evenly distributed around the cylinder but grouped close to the near wake leaving an unshrouded portion of about 90 degrees of the circumference facing the free stream more recently control of the wake of a cylinder with rotating control cylinders has been investigated experimentally korkischko and meneghini 2012 and numerically mittal 2001 silva ortega et al 2014b in a recent study silva ortega and assi 2017 reported on viv experiments performed with the same control cylinder discussed in the present work acting as viv suppressors they found that the best viv suppressor was composed of 8 control cylinders and mitigated 99 of the peak amplitude of vibration when compared to that of a plain cylinder mean drag was increased by 12 they also concluded that a polar array of 4 control cylinders was the most efficient configuration to minimize the mean drag but the system developed severe vibrations combining viv and a galloping like response the objective of the present work is to investigate a method of suppressing the vortex wake of a circular cylinder employing a passive control strategy a rigid section of a circular cylinder of diameter d is surrounded by a polar array of n 2 4 and 8 smaller control cylinders of diameter d equally spaced about the circumference and separated by a gap g from the wall of the main cylinder the ratios d d and g d are the control parameters of the experimental investigation as seen above previous results found in the literature indicate that there are many other significant parameters apart from the number and size of the control cylinders therefore we have conducted an experimental investigation trying to probe the domain of only a few of those governing parameters the diameter of the control cylinders d was varied in three steps around the size of the smaller cylinders reported by strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 since the vortex formation length tends to be reduced by an increase in r e the region of effective wake control presented by strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 for r e 80 should be brought much closer to the base of the cylinder for our r e range inspired by the work of zdravkovich 1981 the gap between the control cylinders and the wall of the main cylinder g was also varied in three steps in the present parametric study neither the main cylinder nor the control cylinders were allowed to move or respond to the flow so the efficiency of the wake control method was evaluated by measuring the hydrodynamic loads acting on the body 2 experimental method experiments have been carried out in the recirculating water channel of ndf fluids and dynamics research group at the university of são paulo brazil the water channel has a free surface test section which is 0 7 m wide 0 9 m deep and 7 5 m long good quality flow can be achieved up to 1 0 m s with turbulence intensity less than 3 this laboratory has been especially designed for experiments with flow induced vibrations for further details the apparatus validation and information on the facilities please refer to assi et al 2013 2010a 2010b a rigid section of a circular cylinder was made of a perspex tube of external diameter d 100 mm with a smooth surface two four or eight identical control cylinders were made of perspex rods and supported by rings attached to the ends of the main cylinder the distribution of the control cylinders about the main cylinder is presented in fig 1 in which the arrow indicates the direction of the incoming flow the position of the n control cylinders was chosen so that they were equally spaced around the main cylinder but keeping a symmetric distribution in relation to the streamwise axis with no cylinder at the frontal stagnation point the axes of the control cylinders were parallel to the axis of the main cylinder spanning the whole length of the model immersed length of l 700 mm two extra supporting rings were installed at l 3 and l 2 3 positions to hold the control cylinders in place and prevent them from vibrating by reducing their free span the control cylinders did not present significant deflections nor vibrations due to their own viv in the course of the experiments the diameter of the control cylinders was varied in three steps of d d 0 04 0 06 and 0 08 the gap measured between the wall of the control cylinders and the wall of the main cylinder could be set to g d 0 05 0 10 and 0 15 the angular distribution of the control cylinders was kept constant for all cases while varying d d and g d the models were the same employed by silva ortega and assi 2017 models were mounted on a especially built load cell developed by assi 2009 rigidly attached to the frame of the test section to deduce the instantaneous and time averaged hydrodynamic forces on the cylinder model an illustration of the experimental setup is presented in fig 2 a summary of all the parameters investigated in the experiment is presented in table 1 adding up to 27 different experimental configurations in addition preliminary tests have been performed with a bare cylinder without control cylinders to serve as a reference for comparison the only flow variable changed during the course of the experiments was the flow velocity u which alters the reynolds number r e u d ν based on the diameter d of the bare cylinder and the viscosity of water ν between 5000 and 50 000 3 results measurements of lift and drag were made for each of the 27 configurations presented above results for a bare cylinder in the range r e 5 000 to 50 000 are presented as a reference and for validation this r e range falls in the subcritical regime in which transition to turbulence occurs in the separated shear layers and a considerable scatter of lift and drag is found in the literature zdravkovich 1997 the mean drag coefficient c d and the rms of the lift coefficient c ˆ l are presented for a bare or plain cylinder in fig 3 in fig 3a mean drag for the plain cylinder remains roughly around c d 1 4 not too far but higher than the curve presented by zdravkovich 1997 who summarized results from various sources it is worth highlighting that in the present experiments the top end of the cylinder pierced the free surface of the water hence a small fraction of the drag is due to the generation of waves the froude number f r u g d where g is the acceleration of gravity was rather small varying between f r 0 05 and 0 5 for a constant ratio of reynolds number to froude number of r e f r 10 5 chaplin and teigen 2003 who measured the wave resistance drag on a bare cylinder piercing a free surface at r e f r 2 79 10 5 concluded that an increase in drag due to the formation of waves is only significant for f r around 1 and should not occur for the f r 0 5 which is the case in the present experiments other effects due to free stream turbulence intensity bell 1983 or cylinder aspect ratio zdravkovich et al 1989 for example may contribute to change the mean drag from the canonical value expected for a two dimensional body nevertheless since all models have been measured under the same condition the current value of c d for a plain cylinder will be taken as a reference for comparison in this study fig 3b compares the rms of lift to the data collected by norberg 2003 in our study the overall force acting on the cylinder was measured with a load cell positioned on the top due to three dimensional flow effects c ˆ l 0 3 differs from that expected for a two dimensional section of the cylinder norberg 2003 analyzed several experimental and numerical results at different conditions and proposed an expression to convert three dimensional lift c ˆ l into sectional lift c ˆ l taking into account r e and the aspect ratio of the body therefore fig 3b also presents the corrected c ˆ l 0 4 as proposed by norberg 2003 which is in good agreement with the results collected in the literature tests with n 2 4 and 8 control cylinders with different diameters d d were performed for the same r e range of the bare cylinder for each configuration c d and c ˆ l were measured for 36 equally spaced values of r e as flow speed was increased in order to evaluate the force coefficients the cylinder diameter d was employed as a standard dimension for all configurations it is known that the effective external diameter of the system is slightly different depending on the distribution diameter and gap of the control cylinders for each case silva ortega and assi 2017 suggested the use of the combined parameter g d d simply representing the outermost radial distance of the control cylinders from the wall of the main cylinder in a way suggesting how far into the flow the control cylinders could interfere in the present study g d d varied between 0 09 and 0 23 however as far as hydrodynamic forces are concerned the frontal area of the model did not change as g was increased for each d also variations in d only slightly changed the frontal area therefore we believe the main body s diameter d is the most representative dimension to non dimensionalize the hydrodynamic loads so that they could be compared against each other for each case results are presented in three sets grouped by the diameter of the control cylinders 3 1 control cylinders with d d 0 04 c d for all cases with d d 0 04 is shown in fig 4 a apart from the lowest values of r e the behavior of each case is quite clear all cases with 2 control cylinders 2 cyl presented c d higher than that of the bare cylinder with the case g d 0 15 showing the highest c d 1 8 the cases with 4 control cylinders 4 cyl presented the highest variations with the great majority of points falling below c d for the bare cylinder the case g d 0 05 in special presented the lowest c d 0 8 of all cases for most of the r e range all cases with 8 control cylinders 8 cyl presented values below c d for the bare cylinder also showing the smaller dispersion within the group fig 4b shows c ˆ l for all cases with d d 0 04 like before all cases with 2 control cylinders tend to show c ˆ l higher than that of the bare cylinder cases with 4 control cylinders tend to show c ˆ l below the value for the bare cylinder but more importantly cases with 8 control cylinders showed the lowest values of c ˆ l for the r e range with the cases g d 0 05 and 0 10 presenting the rms of lift very close to zero please note that the limits of the vertical axes in all figures were kept the same to allow for direct qualitative comparison between all figures in the paper 3 2 control cylinders with d d 0 06 fig 5 a shows c d for all cases with d d 0 06 at first sight one may realize that the larger diameter of the control cylinders has increased c d for all cases for most cases this might be due to the increase of the effective diameter of the body while all cases with 2 control cylinders produced the highest c d all cases with 8 control cylinders now fall in the middle but still with c d below that for the bare cylinder with the lowest c d now appears the group with 4 control cylinders with the case g d 0 05 showing the lowest c d 0 75 for most of the r e range results of c ˆ l in fig 5b are not very different all cases with 2 control cylinders produce the highest rms of lift above the value for the bare cylinder on the other hand all cases with 4 and 8 control cylinders managed to reduce c ˆ l below that of a bare cylinder for most of the r e range highlighting cases 8 cyl with g d 0 15 and 4 cyl with g d 0 05 that produced almost zero c ˆ l 3 3 control cylinders with d d 0 08 finally fig 6 a presents c d for cases with d d 0 08 with the largest control cylinders almost all cases presented c d roughly equal or higher than that of the bare cylinder the exception was the group with 4 control cylinders which showed c d 1 for most of the r e range this time the cases with 4 control cylinders and g d 0 05 and 0 10 presented the lowest c d the rms of lift shown in fig 6b follows the same behavior seen before with all cases with 2 control cylinders showing higher c ˆ l than that of the bare cylinder again cases with 4 and 8 control cylinders reduced c ˆ l considerably with cases n 8 with g d 0 10 and n 4 with g d 0 05 reaching almost zero c ˆ l 4 discussion it is easy to get confused with so many response curves considering the variations in all three parameters n d d and g d the first general consideration to be made is that the position of the control cylinders in relation to the flow is indeed very important the three parameters combined work to alter the influence of the control cylinders over the near wake not to mention their influence over the flow before it separates from the body for example for the case with n 2 it is believed that the control cylinders are interfering with the flow near the separation points since they are positioned at 90 in relation to the incoming flow with 4 control cylinders we can still suppose that the rear cylinders located at 135 interact with the separating flow and or the separated shear layers in the near wake but the front cylinders located at 45 are most likely interacting with the attached boundary layers the same must be happening with n 8 while cylinders positioned at 22 5 and 67 5 are most likely interacting with the boundary layer cylinders at 112 5 are located very near the natural separation points while cylinders at 157 5 might be interacting with the near wake this is supported by the flow visualization provided by the numerical simulations performed by silva ortega et al 2014a b at r e 100 the cases with 2 control cylinders have shown a behavior similar to that observed by mittal 2001 who performed numerical simulation of the flow past a circular cylinder at r e 10 4 with d d 0 05 and g d 0 075 in their case the numerical simulations allowed for a better understanding of the flow in our study among all experiments the cases with n 2 consistently appeared as the worst arrangement to suppress c ˆ l and reduce c d it actually increased drag above the value for a bare cylinder on the other hand the cases with 4 control cylinders with diameters d d 0 06 and 0 08 presented a considerable reduction of c ˆ l with the lowest c d recently motivated by the work of strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 patino et al 2015 performed flow sensibility analysis of the flow to study the effects of wake control with small cylinders located around the main cylinder with d d 0 06 and g d 0 07 at r e 47 changing the position of a single control cylinder around the main cylinder they found that the wake became stable when the control cylinder was positioned at 0 50 135 225 and 310 360 thus inhibiting the formation of vortices please note that their study suggested an effective control of the wake with control cylinder positioned at the front and at the back of the main body of course the sensibility analysis conducted by patino et al 2015 was focusing at an extremely low r e at the beginning of the hydrodynamic instability that leads to the formation of the vortex wake nevertheless leaving the difference of r e aside we cannot ignore the fact that in our work only the cases with n 4 and 8 have cylinders located within the regions highlighted by patino et al 2015 those cases were precisely the ones to present the most reduction in c ˆ l and c d it is worth noting that the case with 8 control cylinders is the closest to an omnidirectional system tested in this investigation even though with discrete elements positioned 45 apart needless to say that an omnidirectional device would be very interesting for practical applications in engineering finally considering only the diameters of the control cylinders cases with d d 0 06 have shown a slight advantage in reducing c ˆ l and c d over the other cases interestingly d d 0 06 was not the smallest nor the largest of the tested diameters finally the g d parameter showed the lowest influence on the results when compared to the effect of d d and n all this could tell us that there is an optimum value of d d to suppress the wake and it would probably be dependent on r e the distribution of control cylinders and weakly dependent on g d within the range of this investigation the current investigation does not provide information on the hydrodynamic interaction of the bodies only presented the hydrodynamic loads experienced by the cylinder future studies should investigate the flow to look for the physical mechanisms in action it is widely accepted that if the wake is controlled and the shedding of vortices is eliminated the bluff body will not only generate considerably less drag but will also become invulnerable to vortex induced vibrations 5 conclusion we have presented the hydrodynamic loads of mean drag c d and fluctuating lift c ˆ l for a circular cylinder fitted with n 2 4 and 8 control cylinders positioned around its circumference the efficiency regarding the mitigation of c ˆ l and reduction of c d was investigated for 27 different cases varying the diameter of the control cylinders d d and their relative distance from the wall g d all cases have been compared with the hydrodynamic forces of a plain cylinder cases with n 4 and 8 appeared to perform much better than the cases with 2 control cylinders this might not be directly related to the total number of control cylinders n but instead with the actual position of the cylinder around the main body having learnt from previous investigations strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 patino et al 2015 we believe the position of the control cylinders is crucial to the way they interfere with the flow to control the wake for a future optimization study the angular distribution of the control cylinders must be investigated with a much smaller step than the one we have employed in this work especially when compared with the small variations performed in the d d and g d parameters the configuration with 4 control cylinders with g d 0 05 and d d 0 06 produced the lowest drag when compared to all other configurations c d 0 75 approximately 50 lower than that of a bare cylinder for the configuration with 8 control cylinders with d d 0 04 all g d ratios showed an average c d 1 which corresponds to a 33 reduction only the configurations with 2 control cylinders showed a 10 increase in drag with c d 1 66 on average there is no guarantee that a fixed cylinder with low c ˆ l will not oscillate due to viv once it is free to respond especially if a low mass damping system is concerned however a suppressor that produces low c ˆ l in a fixed condition might produce a system with low viv response if not get viv suppressed altogether not coincidentally the case with n 8 d d 0 08 and g d 0 10 that presented one of the lowest c ˆ l in the present work was also the most successful in suppressing viv in the work of silva ortega and assi 2017 future work in this topic will also consider the rotation of the control cylinders as we explore active control methods finally the wave interaction between the control cylinders and the main cylinder produced rather interesting patterns that sometimes appeared to increase and other times to reduce the height of the waves being formed the wave interaction between the various configurations of control cylinders and its effect on drag or viv were not properly understood based on the principle that there might be an arrangement of control cylinders to suppress the formation of a vortex wake it is possible that an arrangement of interacting control cylinder could be able to mitigate the formation of surface waves this questions certainly appears as an interesting topic

experiments the top end of the cylinder pierced the free surface of the water hence a small fraction of the drag is due to the generation of waves the froude number f r u g d where g is the acceleration of gravity was rather small varying between f r 0 05 and 0 5 for a constant ratio of reynolds number to froude number of r e f r 10 5 chaplin and teigen 2003 who measured the wave resistance drag on a bare cylinder piercing a free surface at r e f r 2 79 10 5 concluded that an increase in drag due to the formation of waves is only significant for f r around 1 and should not occur for the f r 0 5 which is the case in the present experiments other effects due to free stream turbulence intensity bell 1983 or cylinder aspect ratio zdravkovich et al 1989 for example may contribute to change the mean drag from the canonical value expected for a two dimensional body nevertheless since all models have been measured under the same condition the current value of c d for a plain cylinder will be taken as a reference for comparison in this study fig 3b compares the rms of lift to the data collected by norberg 2003 in our study the overall force acting on the cylinder was measured with a load cell positioned on the top due to three dimensional flow effects c ˆ l 0 3 differs from that expected for a two dimensional section of the cylinder norberg 2003 analyzed several experimental and numerical results at different conditions and proposed an expression to convert three dimensional lift c ˆ l into sectional lift c ˆ l taking into account r e and the aspect ratio of the body therefore fig 3b also presents the corrected c ˆ l 0 4 as proposed by norberg 2003 which is in good agreement with the results collected in the literature tests with n 2 4 and 8 control cylinders with different diameters d d were performed for the same r e range of the bare cylinder for each configuration c d and c ˆ l were measured for 36 equally spaced values of r e as flow speed was increased in order to evaluate the force coefficients the cylinder diameter d was employed as a standard dimension for all configurations it is known that the effective external diameter of the system is slightly different depending on the distribution diameter and gap of the control cylinders for each case silva ortega and assi 2017 suggested the use of the combined parameter g d d simply representing the outermost radial distance of the control cylinders from the wall of the main cylinder in a way suggesting how far into the flow the control cylinders could interfere in the present study g d d varied between 0 09 and 0 23 however as far as hydrodynamic forces are concerned the frontal area of the model did not change as g was increased for each d also variations in d only slightly changed the frontal area therefore we believe the main body s diameter d is the most representative dimension to non dimensionalize the hydrodynamic loads so that they could be compared against each other for each case results are presented in three sets grouped by the diameter of the control cylinders 3 1 control cylinders with d d 0 04 c d for all cases with d d 0 04 is shown in fig 4 a apart from the lowest values of r e the behavior of each case is quite clear all cases with 2 control cylinders 2 cyl presented c d higher than that of the bare cylinder with the case g d 0 15 showing the highest c d 1 8 the cases with 4 control cylinders 4 cyl presented the highest variations with the great majority of points falling below c d for the bare cylinder the case g d 0 05 in special presented the lowest c d 0 8 of all cases for most of the r e range all cases with 8 control cylinders 8 cyl presented values below c d for the bare cylinder also showing the smaller dispersion within the group fig 4b shows c ˆ l for all cases with d d 0 04 like before all cases with 2 control cylinders tend to show c ˆ l higher than that of the bare cylinder cases with 4 control cylinders tend to show c ˆ l below the value for the bare cylinder but more importantly cases with 8 control cylinders showed the lowest values of c ˆ l for the r e range with the cases g d 0 05 and 0 10 presenting the rms of lift very close to zero please note that the limits of the vertical axes in all figures were kept the same to allow for direct qualitative comparison between all figures in the paper 3 2 control cylinders with d d 0 06 fig 5 a shows c d for all cases with d d 0 06 at first sight one may realize that the larger diameter of the control cylinders has increased c d for all cases for most cases this might be due to the increase of the effective diameter of the body while all cases with 2 control cylinders produced the highest c d all cases with 8 control cylinders now fall in the middle but still with c d below that for the bare cylinder with the lowest c d now appears the group with 4 control cylinders with the case g d 0 05 showing the lowest c d 0 75 for most of the r e range results of c ˆ l in fig 5b are not very different all cases with 2 control cylinders produce the highest rms of lift above the value for the bare cylinder on the other hand all cases with 4 and 8 control cylinders managed to reduce c ˆ l below that of a bare cylinder for most of the r e range highlighting cases 8 cyl with g d 0 15 and 4 cyl with g d 0 05 that produced almost zero c ˆ l 3 3 control cylinders with d d 0 08 finally fig 6 a presents c d for cases with d d 0 08 with the largest control cylinders almost all cases presented c d roughly equal or higher than that of the bare cylinder the exception was the group with 4 control cylinders which showed c d 1 for most of the r e range this time the cases with 4 control cylinders and g d 0 05 and 0 10 presented the lowest c d the rms of lift shown in fig 6b follows the same behavior seen before with all cases with 2 control cylinders showing higher c ˆ l than that of the bare cylinder again cases with 4 and 8 control cylinders reduced c ˆ l considerably with cases n 8 with g d 0 10 and n 4 with g d 0 05 reaching almost zero c ˆ l 4 discussion it is easy to get confused with so many response curves considering the variations in all three parameters n d d and g d the first general consideration to be made is that the position of the control cylinders in relation to the flow is indeed very important the three parameters combined work to alter the influence of the control cylinders over the near wake not to mention their influence over the flow before it separates from the body for example for the case with n 2 it is believed that the control cylinders are interfering with the flow near the separation points since they are positioned at 90 in relation to the incoming flow with 4 control cylinders we can still suppose that the rear cylinders located at 135 interact with the separating flow and or the separated shear layers in the near wake but the front cylinders located at 45 are most likely interacting with the attached boundary layers the same must be happening with n 8 while cylinders positioned at 22 5 and 67 5 are most likely interacting with the boundary layer cylinders at 112 5 are located very near the natural separation points while cylinders at 157 5 might be interacting with the near wake this is supported by the flow visualization provided by the numerical simulations performed by silva ortega et al 2014a b at r e 100 the cases with 2 control cylinders have shown a behavior similar to that observed by mittal 2001 who performed numerical simulation of the flow past a circular cylinder at r e 10 4 with d d 0 05 and g d 0 075 in their case the numerical simulations allowed for a better understanding of the flow in our study among all experiments the cases with n 2 consistently appeared as the worst arrangement to suppress c ˆ l and reduce c d it actually increased drag above the value for a bare cylinder on the other hand the cases with 4 control cylinders with diameters d d 0 06 and 0 08 presented a considerable reduction of c ˆ l with the lowest c d recently motivated by the work of strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 patino et al 2015 performed flow sensibility analysis of the flow to study the effects of wake control with small cylinders located around the main cylinder with d d 0 06 and g d 0 07 at r e 47 changing the position of a single control cylinder around the main cylinder they found that the wake became stable when the control cylinder was positioned at 0 50 135 225 and 310 360 thus inhibiting the formation of vortices please note that their study suggested an effective control of the wake with control cylinder positioned at the front and at the back of the main body of course the sensibility analysis conducted by patino et al 2015 was focusing at an extremely low r e at the beginning of the hydrodynamic instability that leads to the formation of the vortex wake nevertheless leaving the difference of r e aside we cannot ignore the fact that in our work only the cases with n 4 and 8 have cylinders located within the regions highlighted by patino et al 2015 those cases were precisely the ones to present the most reduction in c ˆ l and c d it is worth noting that the case with 8 control cylinders is the closest to an omnidirectional system tested in this investigation even though with discrete elements positioned 45 apart needless to say that an omnidirectional device would be very interesting for practical applications in engineering finally considering only the diameters of the control cylinders cases with d d 0 06 have shown a slight advantage in reducing c ˆ l and c d over the other cases interestingly d d 0 06 was not the smallest nor the largest of the tested diameters finally the g d parameter showed the lowest influence on the results when compared to the effect of d d and n all this could tell us that there is an optimum value of d d to suppress the wake and it would probably be dependent on r e the distribution of control cylinders and weakly dependent on g d within the range of this investigation the current investigation does not provide information on the hydrodynamic interaction of the bodies only presented the hydrodynamic loads experienced by the cylinder future studies should investigate the flow to look for the physical mechanisms in action it is widely accepted that if the wake is controlled and the shedding of vortices is eliminated the bluff body will not only generate considerably less drag but will also become invulnerable to vortex induced vibrations 5 conclusion we have presented the hydrodynamic loads of mean drag c d and fluctuating lift c ˆ l for a circular cylinder fitted with n 2 4 and 8 control cylinders positioned around its circumference the efficiency regarding the mitigation of c ˆ l and reduction of c d was investigated for 27 different cases varying the diameter of the control cylinders d d and their relative distance from the wall g d all cases have been compared with the hydrodynamic forces of a plain cylinder cases with n 4 and 8 appeared to perform much better than the cases with 2 control cylinders this might not be directly related to the total number of control cylinders n but instead with the actual position of the cylinder around the main body having learnt from previous investigations strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 patino et al 2015 we believe the position of the control cylinders is crucial to the way they interfere with the flow to control the wake for a future optimization study the angular distribution of the control cylinders must be investigated with a much smaller step than the one we have employed in this work especially when compared with the small variations performed in the d d and g d parameters the configuration with 4 control cylinders with g d 0 05 and d d 0 06 produced the lowest drag when compared to all other configurations c d 0 75 approximately 50 lower than that of a bare cylinder for the configuration with 8 control cylinders with d d 0 04 all g d ratios showed an average c d 1 which corresponds to a 33 reduction only the configurations with 2 control cylinders showed a 10 increase in drag with c d 1 66 on average there is no guarantee that a fixed cylinder with low c ˆ l will not oscillate due to viv once it is free to respond especially if a low mass damping system is concerned however a suppressor that produces low c ˆ l in a fixed condition might produce a system with low viv response if not get viv suppressed altogether not coincidentally the case with n 8 d d 0 08 and g d 0 10 that presented one of the lowest c ˆ l in the present work was also the most successful in suppressing viv in the work of silva ortega and assi 2017 future work in this topic will also consider the rotation of the control cylinders as we explore active control methods finally the wave interaction between the control cylinders and the main cylinder produced rather interesting patterns that sometimes appeared to increase and other times to reduce the height of the waves being formed the wave interaction between the various configurations of control cylinders and its effect on drag or viv were not properly understood based on the principle that there might be an arrangement of control cylinders to suppress the formation of a vortex wake it is possible that an arrangement of interacting control cylinder could be able to mitigate the formation of surface waves this questions certainly appears as an interesting topic
