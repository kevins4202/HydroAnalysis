3560,there has been a strong tendency in recent decades to develop real time urban flood prediction models for early warning to the public due to a large number of worldwide urban flood occurrences and their disastrous consequences while a significant breakthrough has been made so far there are still some potential knowledge gaps that need further investigation this paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of the art and future trends of real time modelling of flood forecasting in urban drainage systems findings showed that the combination of various real time sources of rainfall measurement and the inclusion of other real time data such as soil moisture wind flow patterns evaporation fluvial flow and infiltration should be more investigated in real time flood forecasting models additionally artificial intelligence is also present in most of the new rtff models in uds and consequently further developments of this technique are expected to appear in future works keywords artificial intelligence based models data driven models real time flood forecasting urban drainage systems urban flood 1 introduction climate change has likely consequences in hydrology including extreme rainfall and changing precipitation patterns that both result in more urban floods and adverse effects on existing urban infrastructure rubinato et al 2019 balistrocchi et al 2020 these effects result in loss of property particularly utility infrastructure and household assets human and economy especially income in industries and transport interruption in trades miller and hutchins 2017 konami et al 2021 fig 1 shows the geographical spread of flood occurrences and associated losses by country over the recent 30 years based on the data collected from cred 2021 the figure shows developing countries especially in asia and africa have been dealing mainly with social damages i e human losses and affected populations while developed countries in europe and north america have been mainly suffering from economic loss for example china and india as countries mainly affected by flood events in asia are ranked first in the world for the average affected people per event whereas the top ranking of average human loss and economic loss are reported for venezuela and denmark respectively this unequal distribution of impacts shows the diverse effects of flood occurrence besides in recent 30 years floods have caused more than us 1 280 billion for the world economy affected nearly 2 billion people around the world and killed about 214 000 undrr 2019 therefore it is of paramount importance for all involved parties including stakeholders communities and researchers to take proper actions and mitigate the risk of flood occurrence furthermore the increasing need for new developments and urbanisation will probably exacerbate these consequences as natural drainage and open spaces in urban areas are routinely being modified or replaced with impervious drainage channels paved and impermeable areas han and he 2021 numerous structural measures have been developed such as blue green infrastructure and stormwater management facilities to decline the adverse effects of floods li et al 2020 however non structural approaches especially early flood warning systems have attracted more attention in recent decades due mainly to the time saving for development and operation cost effectiveness and no extra space or facilities required for new construction or physical modification berndtsson et al 2019 hadi pour et al 2020 early flood warning systems have been widely used for real time forecasting of flood in the case of river basins reservoirs lakes stream flows mountainous areas prairies urban surface runoff and urban flooding in coastal cities hadid et al 2020 meyers et al 2021 however unique features of floods in urban and non urban areas as listed in table 1 need to be realised for any planning of real time forecasting these features can be used to determine the requirements for spatial and temporal data types of flood modelling the inclusion of potential flood impacts and key performance indicators more specifically real time flood forecasting rtff in urban drainage systems uds typically requires modelling of distributed systems with high spatial and temporal complexity which is overstressed by spatial limitation as well as short preparation time zhao et al 2019a mullapudi et al 2020 a significant breakthrough has been made over the recent decades to overcome some major challenges in the main steps of rtff meaning data collection and preparation model development and performance assessment multiple attempts have been made in the research works that focused on at least one of these three main areas of rtff modelling however there are still some potential knowledge gaps that need further investigation to address this a few recent reviews given in table 2 show thorough literature from various perspectives of concepts models and tools for real time forecasting of urban flooding data collection and preparation have been critically analysed by several researchers in recent years mckee and binns 2015 suggested some applicable data merging methods within the scope of hydrological models of urban flooding furthermore ochoa rodriguez et al 2018 evaluated the capability of different data merging methods in the context of data resolution only daal et al 2017 and thorndahl et al 2017 linked the data resources to performance assessment of urban flood forecasting without supporting model development daal et al 2017 argued high demand for the model performance assessment is heavily affected by the lack of uncertainty analysis of input data thorndahl et al 2017 pointed out the accuracy of radar data through numerous examples of only hydrological models salvadore et al 2015 critically analysed various modelling of urban hydrological processes and mapped the future trends of model development based on only data resolutions garcía et al 2015 and nkwunonwo et al 2020 reviewed several real time control strategies and listed relevant models and software tools finally more recently kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 analysed the impacts of climate change on uds design and reviewed the associated challenges in summary these reviews have mainly focused on urban flood forecasting with the aid of describing data requirements developing models and measuring model performance rather than discussing real time forecasting models in the context of urban drainage systems as a result to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of a critical and comprehensive review to provide knowledge on this context to enable the field of research and provide the articulation of current and future directions hence extending the aforementioned works the overall objective of this paper is to review all advances of the real time data driven forecasting models of urban flooding and thereby demonstrating a comprehensive picture of the present approaches and highlighting future directions of real time control of urban flooding the current review is organised in the following four sections the research design structure with the relevant bibliometric analysis used to select the peer reviewed papers is first described data types and available data sources for developing rtff models in uds is then presented along with reviewing data merging techniques hydrological and hydraulic models for rtff in uds and their performance assessment are then analysed in the next section finally conclusions are drawn by summarising key findings and making recommendations for future studies on rtff in uds 2 research design and bibliometric tracking rtff in uds can be used for a wide range of assessments and applications such as risk assessment deep learning visual assessment and gis based flood monitoring the current review mainly focuses on scientific peer reviewed papers studying real time forecasting of water depth discharge in the urban sewer chambers over the last decade between 2011 and 2021 this is because this area of research has been advancing in recent years and is now placed as a central concern in many mitigation flood hazard attempts appropriate research works were collected from the scopus search engine according to the guideline suggested by moher et al 2009 they were refined by a set of six search and screen strategies s1 s6 demonstrated in table 3 the search results started from 913 publications in s1 and were gradually narrowed down through the following steps s2 s3 and finally limited to a total of 67 studies that were then classified under three categories of studies as 48 for data collection s4 49 for model development s5 and 62 for performance assessment s6 note that although the main focus of this review is flood forecasting in urbanised areas non urbanised flood forecasting is also reviewed to capture recently developed concepts in the field that can be used for future directions 2 1 bibliometric analysis bibliometric analysis ba was first conducted for the collected publications as shown in fig 2 for the geographical distribution of case studies and clustering analysis density and timeline of keywords the ba shows most of the relevant studies rtff are from europe 66 and the three highest countries for these publications are the uk 17 5 china 15 5 and denmark 10 5 by comparing this with fig 1 it relatively agrees with geographical locations of flood events generally for countries in europe and america although it is only 7 in asia mainly from china evidently more studies related to rtff in uds may be required from southeast asia and south america to have a better balance between geographical locations of flood events and relevant publications analysis of knowledge domain bibliometric track fig 2b d was conducted by vosviewer software for the collected publications based on co occurrence of key terms for a specific unit of analysis keywords titles and abstracts type of analysis co occurrence and counting method full counting the findings of this analysis can support researchers to appraise close relationships between the frequency of co occurred keywords in the publications and determine the directions of future studies by highlighting the core content of specific subjects goh and see 2021 more specifically three types of analysis were carried out here based on the methodologies introduced by ding et al 2014 and perianes rodriguez et al 2016 1 cluster analysis in fig 2b grouping a collection of keywords into multiple classes in which node size representing the frequency of co occurrence links representing co reference and colours representing different clusters 2 density analysis in fig 2c extraction of the number of times that keywords appear in the publications 3 timeline analysis in fig 2d mapping keywords onto the colour coded timespan of studies within the last decade the three major clusters green blue and red identified in fig 2b show strong connections of keywords in those publications more specifically the green cluster mainly represented by rainfall is strongly connected with radar in the same cluster and is also related to data sources data quality and data preparation techniques the blue cluster recognised by data is connected with time steps and the main characteristics of system such as uds combined sewer systems both clusters are strongly connected to the model in the red cluster as the major focus of all papers in other words model as the largest keyword represents the leading research area for rtff in uds similarly the density of keywords in fig 2c also confirms the majority of research topics in the last decade are mainly scattered around data and model this is also in line with the two main steps of modelling in tables 2 data collection and preparation and model development the colour coded visualisation of the keywords in the studies in figurer 2d shows how the research focus of frontiers of knowledge has changed over the past decade more specifically the research works were mainly dealing with rainfall data sources such as radar data at the beginning of the decade while exploring model and system were the primary focus in the middle of the decade and finally the studies were concentrated on specific issues such as climate change and urban flooding and the role of urbanisation in recent years 3 data collection and preparation rtff models heavily rely on the types and quality of data collection and preparation for model development and performance assessment therefore available data and measurements have a major impact on rtff models in uds these data may be unavailable or inaccessible mainly due to the restriction in both temporal ad spatial gaps the typical data required in rtff modelling include rainfall data flow measurement of uds and catchment and weather characteristics thrysøe et al 2019 li 2020 rainfall depth and chamber water depth in uds are the main data required whereas others are alternatively used for modelling when needed to enhance the model performance these data are not necessarily the same as used in flood forecasting models that are applied for designing uds for example some conventional parameters like land use slops angles catchment area vegetation ratio installed sustainable urban drainage systems and surface roughness which are routinely used for modelling uds hamil 2011 may not be required to capture as real time data otherwise some other variables need to be recorded and used in the real time flood forecasting models which are the focus of this section 3 1 real time rainfall data sources three main sources of real time rainfall data widely used in hydrological science include telemetry ground rain gauges rainfall radar data and weather satellites with the key features shown in table 4 rain gauge data are the most applicable and primary source of rainfall estimation and installed rainfall stations are currently spread all over the world fig 3 rain gauges measure the accumulative depth of rainfall over a specific period e g 15 min for a given location to obtain representative rainfall measurements over the area while rain gauge stations can provide an accurate point of measurement they are subject to numerous sources of uncertainty that can limit their exclusive application in rtff two main limitations of rain gauge data are 1 the inability of point measurements to accurately characterise the spatial distribution of rainfall and 2 high systematic and calibration errors dao et al 2020a wu et al 2020 to overcome this a network of gauges constituting a series of gauges distributed throughout the area is recommended to provide a spatial distribution and approximate rainfall accumulations at ungauged areas jiang and tung 2013 wu et al 2020 however there may be uds with multiple sub catchments covered by just a few rain gauges which are not sufficient enough to provide accurate forecasting borup et al 2016 in addition the combination of more than one source of rainfall data can also be helpful to overcome the weaknesses and enhance the accuracy and confidence level of rainfall estimations for example rainfall radar estimates with the advantage of capturing the spatial distribution of rainfall and their variation in time were used to improve the accuracy of the data collected in rain gauge stations paz et al 2017 even with such a combination they may still fail to satisfy the accuracy and resolution requirements for modelling urban hydrology wang et al 2015 this is mainly because they are heavily dependent on radar environments such as visibility effects and variability in time and space pulkkinen et al 2016 cecinati et al 2017 this situation can be improved by calibrating rain gauge stations through other sources especially the historic records of rainfall radar stations which is known as merging techniques mckee and binns 2015 boudevillain et al 2016 three basic techniques used for merging rain gauge and radar data are bias adjustment interpolation and integration bias adjustment techniques are based on the correction of rain gauge data accumulations using radar data accumulations while interpolation techniques minimise the variance between the two measurement types furthermore integration techniques proportionally combine rain gauge and radar data based on their relative uncertainty to minimise the overall estimation uncertainty table 5 lists recent applications of merging techniques with a dashboard summarised in fig 4 as can be seen interpolation techniques were used in almost 68 of relevant studies in which the majority of cases 59 applied kriging techniques followed by the conditional merging technique 18 while most of the studies used merging techniques for a single type of data source only a few studies discussed a comparison of different merging methods when using the kriging method berndt et al 2014 reported the measurement accuracy was increased by at least 14 and nanding et al 2016 showed measurement errors were cut down by half however berndt et al 2014 and rabiei and haberlandt 2015 proved conditional merging techniques outperformed other interpolation techniques besides delrieu et al 2014 and boudevillain et al 2016 showed interpolation techniques can effectively increase the measurement accuracy when compared to bias adjustment for adjusting rain gauge precipitation estimates by radar data jewell and gaussiat 2015 showed kriging methods have more accuracy than bias adjustment especially when long term data are predicted finally wang et al 2015 argued that while integration techniques have more capability to increase the model accuracy than interpolation and bias adjustment techniques their applications have no much interest due mainly to the requirements for more model complexity data records and higher computational efforts while early flood warning systems need proper lead time i e the time required for rain falling inside the catchment boundary to flow over the surface and discharge into the first entrance of uds to take the desired actions brunner et al 2021 rain gauge and rainfall radar data may have limited special resolution of rainfall data which results in the inability of models to provide accurate predictions for long term ahead to overcome this challenge other studies on non urban hydrology suggested exploiting new data sources especially weather satellites belete et al 2020 chen et al 2021 the use of satellite products in urban rainfall estimates can support rtff in uds particularly in poorly gauged or radar areas and provide data with a higher range of spatial resolution islam et al 2020 kim et al 2020 however these data may suffer from a lack of high resolution for small watersheds such as urban areas which may result in decreasing the accuracy of prediction azim et al 2020 brunner et al 2021 this can be mitigated by merging satellite products with rainfall data sources for future works on rtff in uds other key factors of the rainfall data influencing the rtff accuracy are temporal and spatial resolutions and historical duration period of available data note that temporal resolution refers to the time between two subsequent data and spatial resolution particularly in rainfall radar refers to one side length of a single pixel in network data table 6 lists a summary of temporal and spatial resolutions for the two rainfall measurement sources including rain gauge and rainfall radar it shows most rainfall radar data 73 were used with a short high temporal resolution of fewer than 5 min for each timestep whereas various time steps were used for rain gauge data although 15 minute timesteps were slightly predominant 40 as expected many of the studies using radar data often take advantage of high temporal resolution due to more advanced technologies used in radar stations despite the availability of high tech rain gauge stations to capture rainfall with high resolution many countries are still using relatively old rain gauge stations ncar 2012 wu et al 2020 furthermore the majority of the rainfall radar data 60 had a spatial resolution of 1km while 34 of radar data also had a finer resolution of less than 1 km a few studies recommended the most appropriate data resolutions for obtaining a satisfactory performance as temporal resolution of smaller than 15 min ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 and spatial resolution of less than 1 km ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 wang et al 2019 also confirmed spatial resolutions greater than 1 km can be unsuitable for urban flooding simulation martens et al 2013 also showed using the data with higher temporal resolution outperforms the data with the finer spatial resolution for obtaining more accurate estimates however schaller et al 2020 argued that using data with either higher temporal resolution or finer spatial resolution cannot necessarily result in more accurate flood predictions in comparison to when the resolution of different data resources are overridden they argued that attempts to provide data resources with the same resolution may result in more achievement rather than trying to find data with better resolution 3 2 flow measurement of uds the flow of the surface runoff discharged into uds is usually measured at gauging stations and expressed as either flow or chamber water depth this measurement at multiple points of uds is an essential variable used for rtff swain et al 2018 the chamber water depth flow measured in a conduit of uds comprise various flows listed in table 7 it can include surface runoff collected from the catchment and discharged into the uds sanitary sewage if the sewer is combined infiltration into the conduit leakage exfiltration into the ground and evaporation met office 2020 defra 2021 sanitary sewage typically with a diurnal pattern adds an extra load in combined sewer systems and reduces the capacity of uds for carrying surface runoff during a flood troutman et al 2017 this issue is suitably covered in cso cases especially in data driven models fluvial flooding occurs when uds s water flow spills onto the urban surfaces these excessed flows have different hydrodynamic characteristics including 1 usually appearing earlier than surface runoff pluvial flood in uds and 2 failure in draining can happen everywhere of uds length whereas usually uds s drainage points are more vulnerable in surface runoff hamill 2011 tanaka et al 2020 selected studies have been focused on the prediction of pluvial flood in uds and fluvial flood is indexed in the inundated urban flood maps or risk assessment of urban catchments shih et al 2019 geravand et al 2020 other flows such as leakage from conduits evaporation from the water surface of open conduits and infiltration into conduits contribute to the total flow of conduits these parameters are practised in physical models very well but are not focused on the data driven models however while they can add noise on chamber water depth data without any uniform recognisable pattern and reduce the model accuracy they have been not captured completely in the data driven models ravazzani et al 2016 courdent et al 2018 fidal and kjeldsen 2020 3 3 catchment and weather characteristics there are some key features in the catchment and weather such as soil moisture evaporation of surface runoff air temperature and moisture and wind characteristics that have a key role on rtff modelling in uds they are summarised in table 8 and described below soil moisture and its effects on soil infiltration is an important parameter required for the estimation of surface runoff li et al 2018 dao et al 2020a in the concept of data driven models only a few studies focus on this parameter courdent et al 2018 argued that the soil moisture in rainfall runoff modelling can be considered in two parts of fast and slow while the fast part directly enters uds the slow one infiltrates with a considerable lag time fidal and kjeldsen 2020 also showed the accuracy of rainfall runoff simulation increases by 12 when the soil moisture is included weather characteristics such as wind flow pattern speed and direction air temperature and air moisture regularly reported by weather stations defra 2021 are considered as main weather parameters in rtff wind flow patterns can also affect the speed of rainfall movement and the direction pattern of rain figueroa et al 2020 kc et al 2021 besides high air temperature and low air moisture can prevent rainfall from reaching uds by evaporation rubinato et al 2019 the use of wind flow patterns for the estimation of surface runoff has almost been overlooked in rtff modelling similarly evaporation was not precisely be used for rtff models although some studies used simple statical equations for calculating daily evaporation olsson et al 2017 courdent et al 2018 fidal and kjeldsen 2020 3 4 missing data while the performance of the rtff models depends on data availability missing data that are a common occurrence can affect the model s performance significantly sharifi et al 2016 missing data occur when part of the data is not available mainly due to equipment failures database loss no data accessibility and no allowance to publicise kamwaga et al 2018 brunner et al 2021 aissia et al 2017 recommended three approaches when dealing with incomplete or missing data as 1 selecting only continuous data records and neglecting events with missing data 2 removing minor gaps from the dataset and considering the remaining data as a continuous dataset 3 infilling gaps with suitable imputation techniques such as linear regression double mass curve technique and subsidiary rainfall runoff modelling the first two approaches may either remove a large part of the dataset or be impossible when dealing with time series data however the third one seems more efficient despite skewing the existing patterns recognised by original data aieb et al 2019 while there are no clear guidelines for data imputation in the context of uds s missing data infilling gaps have been widely used for rainfall prediction or non urbanised flood forecasting aires 2020 kamkhad et al 2020 specific methods used for infilling missing data include the simple mean value of available data anbarasan et al 2020 data mining techniques such as the k nearest neighbours method motta et al 2021 and empirical regression methods kamwaga et al 2018 dumedah et al 2014 also applied 14 different artificial neural networks ann and statisticalmethods for infilling missing soil moisture records in flood forecasting and showed ann is the best suited infilling method however this issue needs to be more focused on rtff in the uds context 3 5 data cleaning data cleaning is defined as the process of identification and removal of irrelevant and outlier data to increase the accuracy of data driven modelling brunner et al 2021 although hydrological data are usually collected continuously for both dry and wet weather fig 5 rainfall and runoff data may only be needed during wet weather chamber water depth in the uds conduits can change as a result of several reasons including 1 sanitary sewage discharged into combined uds 2 leakage exfiltration or infiltration and 3 flood from the uds catchments rahmati et al 2020 brunner et al 2021 hence the time series data during dry weather i e 1 and 2 in fig 5 or wet weather with no changes on chamber water depth i e 3 in fig 5 can be removed from the analysing period removal of irrelevant data can improve the computational time of building data driven models and enhance the accuracy of estimations such data cleaning techniques have been considered in a few studies such as the warehouse method such as a data mining technique used to classify data in urban flood databases wu et al 2020 and the surrogate model for data assimilation lund et al 2019 while there is no general guideline for flood event identification specifically in urban areas darabi et al 2019 rahmati et al 2020 classification techniques such as data mining methods and their application in event identification can be promising for future works when using flood events in the rtff in uds other important factors for the prediction accuracy are the numbers of rainfall events and their return periods obviously the more the number of rainfall events and the longer return periods in the dataset the better model performance and accuracy we can expect analysis of the rtff in uds in fig 6 shows only a small proportion of studies 19 benefited from a large number of events i e over 1000 events whereas the majority 73 used less than 100 events in the rtff furthermore a similar proportion of the studies 17 used rainfall with maximum return periods of over 10 years while almost half of the studies 48 employed rainfall events with less than a one year return period while storms with a return period of over 5 years are used for uds design hamil 2011 defra 2021 the existing data driven models for rtff have mainly relied on events with short return periods as they may suffer from the lack of sufficient accessible or reliable data or alternatively prefer to focus on more frequent events 4 model development models developed for urban flood forecasting are mostly classified based on the model structure and spatial extension salvadore et al 2015 sitterson et al 2017 the three typical structures of urban flood forecasting models are physical conceptual and empirical as defined and compared in table 9 physical models are basically hydraulic models that simulate flood events based on physical laws and theoretical principles with hydrological and hydraulic data muller and haberlandt 2018 wang et al 2019 although these models have significant advantages their disadvantages are known as requiring extreme detail and various data macchione et al 2019 li 2020 despite the physical models that are used mostly for uds design empirical models are mostly applied to rtff in uds using physical models in rtff can be challenging due mainly to 1 high demand for geospatial data such as sewer networks and high resolution topography for developing a numerical urban flood model which is constantly altered by intense human activities 2 inability to simulate urban flood forecasting in a real time or near real time and 3 poor performance in ungauged areas because the model parameters may not be well calibrated or the calibration can be sophisticated when physical conditions change yin et al 2017 abou rajeily et al 2018 yin et al 2020 4 lack of proper sampling design or strategy for collecting measurement data to be used for model calibration behzadian et al 2009 hence the physical models have been mainly used for uds design purposes under specific return periods of rainfall or certain predicted or historic rainfall data rather than real time flood predictions based on rainfall data records garcía et al 2015 garofalo et al 2017 nkwunonwo et al 2020 to overcome this advanced empirical models with interconnected time series data were developed tian et al 2019 xu et al 2020 these models can be made by training through several observed input and output data without any restrictions of prior knowledge about hydrological processes and can be adapted by real time data frequently ravazzani et al 2016 however the accuracy of these data driven models heavily relies on the accuracy of input data zhang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 furthermore estimations may be highly inaccurate for extrapolated events that were not used within the scope of input data of the model development zhao et al 2019 wu et al 2020 finally as a trade off between physical and empirical models conceptual models were defined based on the knowledge and relationships of the hydrological processes without using physical data ben et al 2019 kc et al 2021 three main approaches found in the literature to improve the quality of the rtff in uds a list of recently developed models used in real case studies of flood forecasting in uds is shown in table 10 with a dashboard summary in fig 7 are as follows 1 optimisation methods for calibration of model parameters 2 hybridisation approach by adding ai based methods to existing physical models and 3 alternative conventional or dynamic ann models to predict longer steps ahead compared to physical models the vast majority of the optimisation models have been introduced recently such as evolutionary algorithms e g memetic algorithms and particle swarms optimisation for calibration of model parameters in the other contexts rather than rtff in uds rajput and datta 2020 raut et al 2021 however a few of them were used to advance physically based models in uds genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimisation have been the most popular approaches that were used for optimal calibration design and operation of uds that were mainly simulated by storm water management model swmm overall urban flood forecasting models have been developed for three main purposes including flood inundation and understanding the surface runoff risk design of uds due to flood occurrence and chamber water depth prediction most of the studies have relied on the first two purposes out of 35 studies published in the last decade 77 were published in the recent five years showing great interest in urban flood forecasting in uds however an increasing rate of studies for using data driven methods indicate the special attention to these models due mainly to more availability of real time data improved computational efforts in the recent software and hardware and ai enhancement this progress has also allowed researchers to use both data driven and conceptual physical models as a hybrid approach for example bermúdez et al 2018 coupled deep learning techniques such as gradient boosting decision tree gbdt to enhance the prediction of urban floods and concluded that hybrid methods can perfectly cover the drawback of both empirical and physical models physical and empirical models account for the majority of those developed in the recent decade for forecasting urban flooding fig 7a the relatively equal usage of the three spatial resolutions i e lump semi distributed and distributed models in the developed models fig 7b can also indicate the importance and interest of all spatial resolutions for model developers however results show that empirical models are mostly developed by lumped spatial resolution whereas physical models have used the distributed option furthermore in the past academic research has favoured the development of physical and empirical models over data driven ones but this trend is changing now among empirical models developed recently for urban flood modelling as shown in fig 7d curved number method cnm and artificial neural network ann are the most used methods in recent years yin et al 2017 dao et al 2020a the cnm techniques have been further advanced by including spatial variability more accurate data collection and hiring finer data resolution yin et al 2020 birkinshaw et al 2020 furthermore ann has been used to upgrade the physical models bermúdez et al 2018 li 2020 only about 20 of the 37 studies reviewed here applied ai for the rtff in uds those studies used deep learning models to find a relationship between time series rainfall data and water depth of conduits in uds for predicting the water depth in the future time steps mounce et al 2014 used conventional ann to predict water depth in sewer chambers up to 3h ahead using time series of rainfall radar and gauging station data in uds chang et al 2014 used recurrent ann for urban flood control and compared the performance of convolutional ann with dynamic anns particularly nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx their results showed narx models outperform other models for prediction accuracy in longer periods due to the memory capability in processing the variable length sequences of inputs and creating feedback connections enclosing several layers of the network abou rjeily et al 2017 showed narx model can effectively predict flood in a complex uds for both minor and severe storm events finally zhange et al 2018 applied a dynamic ann method called long short term memory lstm for monitoring combined sewer overflow and showed conventional ann models can only forecast one or two steps ahead accurately while lstm has the capability for predicting multiple steps ahead especially for multivariate time series data despite the promising results reported for applying the ai based methods e g ann support vector machine models adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and decision tree method to rtff of non urbanised areas mosavi et al 2018 zounemat kermani et al 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2021 these applications are in the early stage of development for urban areas hence the rtff in uds is expected to improve through any of the above approaches with significant research modelling methods and experimentation for further improvement 4 1 performance assessment as part of the model development its performance needs to be evaluated basically by comparing the model outputs with the corresponding measurements for the data not used for the model development dal et al 2017 the performance assessment can also be along with adjusting the model parameters that are typically called model calibration and validation after the model calibration the model performance can be tested for future events and unseen data performance assessment can be carried out through key performance indicators kpis represented as either model accuracy of predictions or computational effort time table 11 lists typical kpis used in the recent studies of the rtff in uds as the main goal of the rtff is to give time for early actions to reduce the flood risks the maximum time spent by the model to process the data and predict the flood is an important factor for relevant authorities to select the model for their operations however this issue is not focused very well in the papers the first approach to measure is computational time i e time spent on performing computational processes however this parameter highly depends on the characteristic of system configuration and cannot be compared for different developed models that are presented all around the world therefore the number of iterations for iterative based models is introduced as a surrogate kpi for the computational time by abou rjeily et al 2017 in this approach correlation between the model accuracy and the number of iteration was investigated to specify the model performance prediction range is the other factor that shows the model performance as the main goal of the rtff is to give sufficient time for early actions to reduce the flood risks the maximum prediction range is an important factor for relevant authorities to select the model for their operations however the number of time steps ahead for prediction of urban flood in recent studies has been limited to short term mostly between 15 min to 90 min see table 11 these studies show that the accuracy of predictions made for periods longer than 60 min have been reduced significantly note that some physically based parameters such as catchment area and time of concentration can influence the performance of model predictions for example the accuracy of model predictions for larger catchment areas can be lower than those for smaller catchment areas also note that the impact of these parameters are likely to be negligible temporally and spatially for small catchment areas or short times of concentration as a result this poor performance can be translated as the deficiency of current rtff in uds to provide accurate predictions for longer periods which need more attention in future works finally although sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis methods have been widely used as an integral part of uncertainty assessments and accuracy of model calibration their potential benefits have not been fully revealed in the concepts of rtff in uds razavi et al 2021 nkwunonwo et al 2020 stated that parameterisation data and sensitivity analysis were usually overlooked in this concept and lack of uncertainty analysis is identified as the main deficiency in the performance assessment of real time urban flood forecasting methods daal et al 2017 as a result the particular importance of including sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis in any rtff in uds should be incorporated in the model results 5 conclusions this paper used a bibliometric approach to conduct a critical review of the recent developments of real time flood forecasting models in urban drainage systems the review evaluated all steps of the rtff models in uds including data collection and preparation model calibration and performance assessment the results demonstrated that there has been a surge of interest in the rtff in uds and this will continue to receive more attention in the future the following points are concluded for future directions of the rtff in uds rain gauge radar merging methods have been mainly employed in large scale non urbanised applications however most literature worked on rtff in uds have been used a single rainfall source for their modelling mainly because other rainfall sources cannot provide required data resolution or they are not compatible with the main rainfall data source which needs to be merged with as a result the literature on the performance assessment of using multiple rainfall resources is needed to specify the applicability of data merging in the context of rtff in uds the rainfall merging techniques have been highly relied on the application of interpolation techniques leading by kriging techniques and conditional merging techniques however there is a high demand to investigate the accuracy of integration techniques for urban data collection due to the successful application of this method in other hydrological applications using satellite products alone or by merging with a rain gauge or radar data should be more practised to take the opportunity of extending the valuable prediction range for early actions as a result of early flood warning the effect of rainfall both spatial and temporal resolution on the accuracy of urban flood forecasting is recognised as an important research area that can be more focussed diurnal pattern of sewage for combined system cases leakage fluvial flow uds s infiltration and leakage rate evaporation from the water surface of open conduits and should be dynamically accounted for building more accurate rtff models furthermore the dynamic role of soil moisture wind flow pattern air temperature and evaporation of surface runoff should be explored effectively to be included in these models providing effective imputation techniques to infill the missing data as a pre processing step is significant to have reliable data for the rtff models in uds data cleaning especially event identification needs to be considered properly for developing rtff models more specifically data classification techniques particularly data mining techniques should be used to remove unnecessary data physical models have been mostly used for the uds design and few cases focus on rtff models in uds while ai models such as narx and lstm have been revitalised in recent years it seems that they are taken into account as first steps in this context consequently further progress in applying these models is an imperative demand as a momentous future direction computational time and prediction range should be more spotlighted in future studies as part of the performance assessment due to their role in offering sufficient lead time for taking preventive decisions by operators sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis should be more discovered for rtff in uds in order to cover the gap of calibration of model parameters and the uncertainty of model results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3560,there has been a strong tendency in recent decades to develop real time urban flood prediction models for early warning to the public due to a large number of worldwide urban flood occurrences and their disastrous consequences while a significant breakthrough has been made so far there are still some potential knowledge gaps that need further investigation this paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of the art and future trends of real time modelling of flood forecasting in urban drainage systems findings showed that the combination of various real time sources of rainfall measurement and the inclusion of other real time data such as soil moisture wind flow patterns evaporation fluvial flow and infiltration should be more investigated in real time flood forecasting models additionally artificial intelligence is also present in most of the new rtff models in uds and consequently further developments of this technique are expected to appear in future works keywords artificial intelligence based models data driven models real time flood forecasting urban drainage systems urban flood 1 introduction climate change has likely consequences in hydrology including extreme rainfall and changing precipitation patterns that both result in more urban floods and adverse effects on existing urban infrastructure rubinato et al 2019 balistrocchi et al 2020 these effects result in loss of property particularly utility infrastructure and household assets human and economy especially income in industries and transport interruption in trades miller and hutchins 2017 konami et al 2021 fig 1 shows the geographical spread of flood occurrences and associated losses by country over the recent 30 years based on the data collected from cred 2021 the figure shows developing countries especially in asia and africa have been dealing mainly with social damages i e human losses and affected populations while developed countries in europe and north america have been mainly suffering from economic loss for example china and india as countries mainly affected by flood events in asia are ranked first in the world for the average affected people per event whereas the top ranking of average human loss and economic loss are reported for venezuela and denmark respectively this unequal distribution of impacts shows the diverse effects of flood occurrence besides in recent 30 years floods have caused more than us 1 280 billion for the world economy affected nearly 2 billion people around the world and killed about 214 000 undrr 2019 therefore it is of paramount importance for all involved parties including stakeholders communities and researchers to take proper actions and mitigate the risk of flood occurrence furthermore the increasing need for new developments and urbanisation will probably exacerbate these consequences as natural drainage and open spaces in urban areas are routinely being modified or replaced with impervious drainage channels paved and impermeable areas han and he 2021 numerous structural measures have been developed such as blue green infrastructure and stormwater management facilities to decline the adverse effects of floods li et al 2020 however non structural approaches especially early flood warning systems have attracted more attention in recent decades due mainly to the time saving for development and operation cost effectiveness and no extra space or facilities required for new construction or physical modification berndtsson et al 2019 hadi pour et al 2020 early flood warning systems have been widely used for real time forecasting of flood in the case of river basins reservoirs lakes stream flows mountainous areas prairies urban surface runoff and urban flooding in coastal cities hadid et al 2020 meyers et al 2021 however unique features of floods in urban and non urban areas as listed in table 1 need to be realised for any planning of real time forecasting these features can be used to determine the requirements for spatial and temporal data types of flood modelling the inclusion of potential flood impacts and key performance indicators more specifically real time flood forecasting rtff in urban drainage systems uds typically requires modelling of distributed systems with high spatial and temporal complexity which is overstressed by spatial limitation as well as short preparation time zhao et al 2019a mullapudi et al 2020 a significant breakthrough has been made over the recent decades to overcome some major challenges in the main steps of rtff meaning data collection and preparation model development and performance assessment multiple attempts have been made in the research works that focused on at least one of these three main areas of rtff modelling however there are still some potential knowledge gaps that need further investigation to address this a few recent reviews given in table 2 show thorough literature from various perspectives of concepts models and tools for real time forecasting of urban flooding data collection and preparation have been critically analysed by several researchers in recent years mckee and binns 2015 suggested some applicable data merging methods within the scope of hydrological models of urban flooding furthermore ochoa rodriguez et al 2018 evaluated the capability of different data merging methods in the context of data resolution only daal et al 2017 and thorndahl et al 2017 linked the data resources to performance assessment of urban flood forecasting without supporting model development daal et al 2017 argued high demand for the model performance assessment is heavily affected by the lack of uncertainty analysis of input data thorndahl et al 2017 pointed out the accuracy of radar data through numerous examples of only hydrological models salvadore et al 2015 critically analysed various modelling of urban hydrological processes and mapped the future trends of model development based on only data resolutions garcía et al 2015 and nkwunonwo et al 2020 reviewed several real time control strategies and listed relevant models and software tools finally more recently kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 analysed the impacts of climate change on uds design and reviewed the associated challenges in summary these reviews have mainly focused on urban flood forecasting with the aid of describing data requirements developing models and measuring model performance rather than discussing real time forecasting models in the context of urban drainage systems as a result to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of a critical and comprehensive review to provide knowledge on this context to enable the field of research and provide the articulation of current and future directions hence extending the aforementioned works the overall objective of this paper is to review all advances of the real time data driven forecasting models of urban flooding and thereby demonstrating a comprehensive picture of the present approaches and highlighting future directions of real time control of urban flooding the current review is organised in the following four sections the research design structure with the relevant bibliometric analysis used to select the peer reviewed papers is first described data types and available data sources for developing rtff models in uds is then presented along with reviewing data merging techniques hydrological and hydraulic models for rtff in uds and their performance assessment are then analysed in the next section finally conclusions are drawn by summarising key findings and making recommendations for future studies on rtff in uds 2 research design and bibliometric tracking rtff in uds can be used for a wide range of assessments and applications such as risk assessment deep learning visual assessment and gis based flood monitoring the current review mainly focuses on scientific peer reviewed papers studying real time forecasting of water depth discharge in the urban sewer chambers over the last decade between 2011 and 2021 this is because this area of research has been advancing in recent years and is now placed as a central concern in many mitigation flood hazard attempts appropriate research works were collected from the scopus search engine according to the guideline suggested by moher et al 2009 they were refined by a set of six search and screen strategies s1 s6 demonstrated in table 3 the search results started from 913 publications in s1 and were gradually narrowed down through the following steps s2 s3 and finally limited to a total of 67 studies that were then classified under three categories of studies as 48 for data collection s4 49 for model development s5 and 62 for performance assessment s6 note that although the main focus of this review is flood forecasting in urbanised areas non urbanised flood forecasting is also reviewed to capture recently developed concepts in the field that can be used for future directions 2 1 bibliometric analysis bibliometric analysis ba was first conducted for the collected publications as shown in fig 2 for the geographical distribution of case studies and clustering analysis density and timeline of keywords the ba shows most of the relevant studies rtff are from europe 66 and the three highest countries for these publications are the uk 17 5 china 15 5 and denmark 10 5 by comparing this with fig 1 it relatively agrees with geographical locations of flood events generally for countries in europe and america although it is only 7 in asia mainly from china evidently more studies related to rtff in uds may be required from southeast asia and south america to have a better balance between geographical locations of flood events and relevant publications analysis of knowledge domain bibliometric track fig 2b d was conducted by vosviewer software for the collected publications based on co occurrence of key terms for a specific unit of analysis keywords titles and abstracts type of analysis co occurrence and counting method full counting the findings of this analysis can support researchers to appraise close relationships between the frequency of co occurred keywords in the publications and determine the directions of future studies by highlighting the core content of specific subjects goh and see 2021 more specifically three types of analysis were carried out here based on the methodologies introduced by ding et al 2014 and perianes rodriguez et al 2016 1 cluster analysis in fig 2b grouping a collection of keywords into multiple classes in which node size representing the frequency of co occurrence links representing co reference and colours representing different clusters 2 density analysis in fig 2c extraction of the number of times that keywords appear in the publications 3 timeline analysis in fig 2d mapping keywords onto the colour coded timespan of studies within the last decade the three major clusters green blue and red identified in fig 2b show strong connections of keywords in those publications more specifically the green cluster mainly represented by rainfall is strongly connected with radar in the same cluster and is also related to data sources data quality and data preparation techniques the blue cluster recognised by data is connected with time steps and the main characteristics of system such as uds combined sewer systems both clusters are strongly connected to the model in the red cluster as the major focus of all papers in other words model as the largest keyword represents the leading research area for rtff in uds similarly the density of keywords in fig 2c also confirms the majority of research topics in the last decade are mainly scattered around data and model this is also in line with the two main steps of modelling in tables 2 data collection and preparation and model development the colour coded visualisation of the keywords in the studies in figurer 2d shows how the research focus of frontiers of knowledge has changed over the past decade more specifically the research works were mainly dealing with rainfall data sources such as radar data at the beginning of the decade while exploring model and system were the primary focus in the middle of the decade and finally the studies were concentrated on specific issues such as climate change and urban flooding and the role of urbanisation in recent years 3 data collection and preparation rtff models heavily rely on the types and quality of data collection and preparation for model development and performance assessment therefore available data and measurements have a major impact on rtff models in uds these data may be unavailable or inaccessible mainly due to the restriction in both temporal ad spatial gaps the typical data required in rtff modelling include rainfall data flow measurement of uds and catchment and weather characteristics thrysøe et al 2019 li 2020 rainfall depth and chamber water depth in uds are the main data required whereas others are alternatively used for modelling when needed to enhance the model performance these data are not necessarily the same as used in flood forecasting models that are applied for designing uds for example some conventional parameters like land use slops angles catchment area vegetation ratio installed sustainable urban drainage systems and surface roughness which are routinely used for modelling uds hamil 2011 may not be required to capture as real time data otherwise some other variables need to be recorded and used in the real time flood forecasting models which are the focus of this section 3 1 real time rainfall data sources three main sources of real time rainfall data widely used in hydrological science include telemetry ground rain gauges rainfall radar data and weather satellites with the key features shown in table 4 rain gauge data are the most applicable and primary source of rainfall estimation and installed rainfall stations are currently spread all over the world fig 3 rain gauges measure the accumulative depth of rainfall over a specific period e g 15 min for a given location to obtain representative rainfall measurements over the area while rain gauge stations can provide an accurate point of measurement they are subject to numerous sources of uncertainty that can limit their exclusive application in rtff two main limitations of rain gauge data are 1 the inability of point measurements to accurately characterise the spatial distribution of rainfall and 2 high systematic and calibration errors dao et al 2020a wu et al 2020 to overcome this a network of gauges constituting a series of gauges distributed throughout the area is recommended to provide a spatial distribution and approximate rainfall accumulations at ungauged areas jiang and tung 2013 wu et al 2020 however there may be uds with multiple sub catchments covered by just a few rain gauges which are not sufficient enough to provide accurate forecasting borup et al 2016 in addition the combination of more than one source of rainfall data can also be helpful to overcome the weaknesses and enhance the accuracy and confidence level of rainfall estimations for example rainfall radar estimates with the advantage of capturing the spatial distribution of rainfall and their variation in time were used to improve the accuracy of the data collected in rain gauge stations paz et al 2017 even with such a combination they may still fail to satisfy the accuracy and resolution requirements for modelling urban hydrology wang et al 2015 this is mainly because they are heavily dependent on radar environments such as visibility effects and variability in time and space pulkkinen et al 2016 cecinati et al 2017 this situation can be improved by calibrating rain gauge stations through other sources especially the historic records of rainfall radar stations which is known as merging techniques mckee and binns 2015 boudevillain et al 2016 three basic techniques used for merging rain gauge and radar data are bias adjustment interpolation and integration bias adjustment techniques are based on the correction of rain gauge data accumulations using radar data accumulations while interpolation techniques minimise the variance between the two measurement types furthermore integration techniques proportionally combine rain gauge and radar data based on their relative uncertainty to minimise the overall estimation uncertainty table 5 lists recent applications of merging techniques with a dashboard summarised in fig 4 as can be seen interpolation techniques were used in almost 68 of relevant studies in which the majority of cases 59 applied kriging techniques followed by the conditional merging technique 18 while most of the studies used merging techniques for a single type of data source only a few studies discussed a comparison of different merging methods when using the kriging method berndt et al 2014 reported the measurement accuracy was increased by at least 14 and nanding et al 2016 showed measurement errors were cut down by half however berndt et al 2014 and rabiei and haberlandt 2015 proved conditional merging techniques outperformed other interpolation techniques besides delrieu et al 2014 and boudevillain et al 2016 showed interpolation techniques can effectively increase the measurement accuracy when compared to bias adjustment for adjusting rain gauge precipitation estimates by radar data jewell and gaussiat 2015 showed kriging methods have more accuracy than bias adjustment especially when long term data are predicted finally wang et al 2015 argued that while integration techniques have more capability to increase the model accuracy than interpolation and bias adjustment techniques their applications have no much interest due mainly to the requirements for more model complexity data records and higher computational efforts while early flood warning systems need proper lead time i e the time required for rain falling inside the catchment boundary to flow over the surface and discharge into the first entrance of uds to take the desired actions brunner et al 2021 rain gauge and rainfall radar data may have limited special resolution of rainfall data which results in the inability of models to provide accurate predictions for long term ahead to overcome this challenge other studies on non urban hydrology suggested exploiting new data sources especially weather satellites belete et al 2020 chen et al 2021 the use of satellite products in urban rainfall estimates can support rtff in uds particularly in poorly gauged or radar areas and provide data with a higher range of spatial resolution islam et al 2020 kim et al 2020 however these data may suffer from a lack of high resolution for small watersheds such as urban areas which may result in decreasing the accuracy of prediction azim et al 2020 brunner et al 2021 this can be mitigated by merging satellite products with rainfall data sources for future works on rtff in uds other key factors of the rainfall data influencing the rtff accuracy are temporal and spatial resolutions and historical duration period of available data note that temporal resolution refers to the time between two subsequent data and spatial resolution particularly in rainfall radar refers to one side length of a single pixel in network data table 6 lists a summary of temporal and spatial resolutions for the two rainfall measurement sources including rain gauge and rainfall radar it shows most rainfall radar data 73 were used with a short high temporal resolution of fewer than 5 min for each timestep whereas various time steps were used for rain gauge data although 15 minute timesteps were slightly predominant 40 as expected many of the studies using radar data often take advantage of high temporal resolution due to more advanced technologies used in radar stations despite the availability of high tech rain gauge stations to capture rainfall with high resolution many countries are still using relatively old rain gauge stations ncar 2012 wu et al 2020 furthermore the majority of the rainfall radar data 60 had a spatial resolution of 1km while 34 of radar data also had a finer resolution of less than 1 km a few studies recommended the most appropriate data resolutions for obtaining a satisfactory performance as temporal resolution of smaller than 15 min ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 and spatial resolution of less than 1 km ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 wang et al 2019 also confirmed spatial resolutions greater than 1 km can be unsuitable for urban flooding simulation martens et al 2013 also showed using the data with higher temporal resolution outperforms the data with the finer spatial resolution for obtaining more accurate estimates however schaller et al 2020 argued that using data with either higher temporal resolution or finer spatial resolution cannot necessarily result in more accurate flood predictions in comparison to when the resolution of different data resources are overridden they argued that attempts to provide data resources with the same resolution may result in more achievement rather than trying to find data with better resolution 3 2 flow measurement of uds the flow of the surface runoff discharged into uds is usually measured at gauging stations and expressed as either flow or chamber water depth this measurement at multiple points of uds is an essential variable used for rtff swain et al 2018 the chamber water depth flow measured in a conduit of uds comprise various flows listed in table 7 it can include surface runoff collected from the catchment and discharged into the uds sanitary sewage if the sewer is combined infiltration into the conduit leakage exfiltration into the ground and evaporation met office 2020 defra 2021 sanitary sewage typically with a diurnal pattern adds an extra load in combined sewer systems and reduces the capacity of uds for carrying surface runoff during a flood troutman et al 2017 this issue is suitably covered in cso cases especially in data driven models fluvial flooding occurs when uds s water flow spills onto the urban surfaces these excessed flows have different hydrodynamic characteristics including 1 usually appearing earlier than surface runoff pluvial flood in uds and 2 failure in draining can happen everywhere of uds length whereas usually uds s drainage points are more vulnerable in surface runoff hamill 2011 tanaka et al 2020 selected studies have been focused on the prediction of pluvial flood in uds and fluvial flood is indexed in the inundated urban flood maps or risk assessment of urban catchments shih et al 2019 geravand et al 2020 other flows such as leakage from conduits evaporation from the water surface of open conduits and infiltration into conduits contribute to the total flow of conduits these parameters are practised in physical models very well but are not focused on the data driven models however while they can add noise on chamber water depth data without any uniform recognisable pattern and reduce the model accuracy they have been not captured completely in the data driven models ravazzani et al 2016 courdent et al 2018 fidal and kjeldsen 2020 3 3 catchment and weather characteristics there are some key features in the catchment and weather such as soil moisture evaporation of surface runoff air temperature and moisture and wind characteristics that have a key role on rtff modelling in uds they are summarised in table 8 and described below soil moisture and its effects on soil infiltration is an important parameter required for the estimation of surface runoff li et al 2018 dao et al 2020a in the concept of data driven models only a few studies focus on this parameter courdent et al 2018 argued that the soil moisture in rainfall runoff modelling can be considered in two parts of fast and slow while the fast part directly enters uds the slow one infiltrates with a considerable lag time fidal and kjeldsen 2020 also showed the accuracy of rainfall runoff simulation increases by 12 when the soil moisture is included weather characteristics such as wind flow pattern speed and direction air temperature and air moisture regularly reported by weather stations defra 2021 are considered as main weather parameters in rtff wind flow patterns can also affect the speed of rainfall movement and the direction pattern of rain figueroa et al 2020 kc et al 2021 besides high air temperature and low air moisture can prevent rainfall from reaching uds by evaporation rubinato et al 2019 the use of wind flow patterns for the estimation of surface runoff has almost been overlooked in rtff modelling similarly evaporation was not precisely be used for rtff models although some studies used simple statical equations for calculating daily evaporation olsson et al 2017 courdent et al 2018 fidal and kjeldsen 2020 3 4 missing data while the performance of the rtff models depends on data availability missing data that are a common occurrence can affect the model s performance significantly sharifi et al 2016 missing data occur when part of the data is not available mainly due to equipment failures database loss no data accessibility and no allowance to publicise kamwaga et al 2018 brunner et al 2021 aissia et al 2017 recommended three approaches when dealing with incomplete or missing data as 1 selecting only continuous data records and neglecting events with missing data 2 removing minor gaps from the dataset and considering the remaining data as a continuous dataset 3 infilling gaps with suitable imputation techniques such as linear regression double mass curve technique and subsidiary rainfall runoff modelling the first two approaches may either remove a large part of the dataset or be impossible when dealing with time series data however the third one seems more efficient despite skewing the existing patterns recognised by original data aieb et al 2019 while there are no clear guidelines for data imputation in the context of uds s missing data infilling gaps have been widely used for rainfall prediction or non urbanised flood forecasting aires 2020 kamkhad et al 2020 specific methods used for infilling missing data include the simple mean value of available data anbarasan et al 2020 data mining techniques such as the k nearest neighbours method motta et al 2021 and empirical regression methods kamwaga et al 2018 dumedah et al 2014 also applied 14 different artificial neural networks ann and statisticalmethods for infilling missing soil moisture records in flood forecasting and showed ann is the best suited infilling method however this issue needs to be more focused on rtff in the uds context 3 5 data cleaning data cleaning is defined as the process of identification and removal of irrelevant and outlier data to increase the accuracy of data driven modelling brunner et al 2021 although hydrological data are usually collected continuously for both dry and wet weather fig 5 rainfall and runoff data may only be needed during wet weather chamber water depth in the uds conduits can change as a result of several reasons including 1 sanitary sewage discharged into combined uds 2 leakage exfiltration or infiltration and 3 flood from the uds catchments rahmati et al 2020 brunner et al 2021 hence the time series data during dry weather i e 1 and 2 in fig 5 or wet weather with no changes on chamber water depth i e 3 in fig 5 can be removed from the analysing period removal of irrelevant data can improve the computational time of building data driven models and enhance the accuracy of estimations such data cleaning techniques have been considered in a few studies such as the warehouse method such as a data mining technique used to classify data in urban flood databases wu et al 2020 and the surrogate model for data assimilation lund et al 2019 while there is no general guideline for flood event identification specifically in urban areas darabi et al 2019 rahmati et al 2020 classification techniques such as data mining methods and their application in event identification can be promising for future works when using flood events in the rtff in uds other important factors for the prediction accuracy are the numbers of rainfall events and their return periods obviously the more the number of rainfall events and the longer return periods in the dataset the better model performance and accuracy we can expect analysis of the rtff in uds in fig 6 shows only a small proportion of studies 19 benefited from a large number of events i e over 1000 events whereas the majority 73 used less than 100 events in the rtff furthermore a similar proportion of the studies 17 used rainfall with maximum return periods of over 10 years while almost half of the studies 48 employed rainfall events with less than a one year return period while storms with a return period of over 5 years are used for uds design hamil 2011 defra 2021 the existing data driven models for rtff have mainly relied on events with short return periods as they may suffer from the lack of sufficient accessible or reliable data or alternatively prefer to focus on more frequent events 4 model development models developed for urban flood forecasting are mostly classified based on the model structure and spatial extension salvadore et al 2015 sitterson et al 2017 the three typical structures of urban flood forecasting models are physical conceptual and empirical as defined and compared in table 9 physical models are basically hydraulic models that simulate flood events based on physical laws and theoretical principles with hydrological and hydraulic data muller and haberlandt 2018 wang et al 2019 although these models have significant advantages their disadvantages are known as requiring extreme detail and various data macchione et al 2019 li 2020 despite the physical models that are used mostly for uds design empirical models are mostly applied to rtff in uds using physical models in rtff can be challenging due mainly to 1 high demand for geospatial data such as sewer networks and high resolution topography for developing a numerical urban flood model which is constantly altered by intense human activities 2 inability to simulate urban flood forecasting in a real time or near real time and 3 poor performance in ungauged areas because the model parameters may not be well calibrated or the calibration can be sophisticated when physical conditions change yin et al 2017 abou rajeily et al 2018 yin et al 2020 4 lack of proper sampling design or strategy for collecting measurement data to be used for model calibration behzadian et al 2009 hence the physical models have been mainly used for uds design purposes under specific return periods of rainfall or certain predicted or historic rainfall data rather than real time flood predictions based on rainfall data records garcía et al 2015 garofalo et al 2017 nkwunonwo et al 2020 to overcome this advanced empirical models with interconnected time series data were developed tian et al 2019 xu et al 2020 these models can be made by training through several observed input and output data without any restrictions of prior knowledge about hydrological processes and can be adapted by real time data frequently ravazzani et al 2016 however the accuracy of these data driven models heavily relies on the accuracy of input data zhang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 furthermore estimations may be highly inaccurate for extrapolated events that were not used within the scope of input data of the model development zhao et al 2019 wu et al 2020 finally as a trade off between physical and empirical models conceptual models were defined based on the knowledge and relationships of the hydrological processes without using physical data ben et al 2019 kc et al 2021 three main approaches found in the literature to improve the quality of the rtff in uds a list of recently developed models used in real case studies of flood forecasting in uds is shown in table 10 with a dashboard summary in fig 7 are as follows 1 optimisation methods for calibration of model parameters 2 hybridisation approach by adding ai based methods to existing physical models and 3 alternative conventional or dynamic ann models to predict longer steps ahead compared to physical models the vast majority of the optimisation models have been introduced recently such as evolutionary algorithms e g memetic algorithms and particle swarms optimisation for calibration of model parameters in the other contexts rather than rtff in uds rajput and datta 2020 raut et al 2021 however a few of them were used to advance physically based models in uds genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimisation have been the most popular approaches that were used for optimal calibration design and operation of uds that were mainly simulated by storm water management model swmm overall urban flood forecasting models have been developed for three main purposes including flood inundation and understanding the surface runoff risk design of uds due to flood occurrence and chamber water depth prediction most of the studies have relied on the first two purposes out of 35 studies published in the last decade 77 were published in the recent five years showing great interest in urban flood forecasting in uds however an increasing rate of studies for using data driven methods indicate the special attention to these models due mainly to more availability of real time data improved computational efforts in the recent software and hardware and ai enhancement this progress has also allowed researchers to use both data driven and conceptual physical models as a hybrid approach for example bermúdez et al 2018 coupled deep learning techniques such as gradient boosting decision tree gbdt to enhance the prediction of urban floods and concluded that hybrid methods can perfectly cover the drawback of both empirical and physical models physical and empirical models account for the majority of those developed in the recent decade for forecasting urban flooding fig 7a the relatively equal usage of the three spatial resolutions i e lump semi distributed and distributed models in the developed models fig 7b can also indicate the importance and interest of all spatial resolutions for model developers however results show that empirical models are mostly developed by lumped spatial resolution whereas physical models have used the distributed option furthermore in the past academic research has favoured the development of physical and empirical models over data driven ones but this trend is changing now among empirical models developed recently for urban flood modelling as shown in fig 7d curved number method cnm and artificial neural network ann are the most used methods in recent years yin et al 2017 dao et al 2020a the cnm techniques have been further advanced by including spatial variability more accurate data collection and hiring finer data resolution yin et al 2020 birkinshaw et al 2020 furthermore ann has been used to upgrade the physical models bermúdez et al 2018 li 2020 only about 20 of the 37 studies reviewed here applied ai for the rtff in uds those studies used deep learning models to find a relationship between time series rainfall data and water depth of conduits in uds for predicting the water depth in the future time steps mounce et al 2014 used conventional ann to predict water depth in sewer chambers up to 3h ahead using time series of rainfall radar and gauging station data in uds chang et al 2014 used recurrent ann for urban flood control and compared the performance of convolutional ann with dynamic anns particularly nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx their results showed narx models outperform other models for prediction accuracy in longer periods due to the memory capability in processing the variable length sequences of inputs and creating feedback connections enclosing several layers of the network abou rjeily et al 2017 showed narx model can effectively predict flood in a complex uds for both minor and severe storm events finally zhange et al 2018 applied a dynamic ann method called long short term memory lstm for monitoring combined sewer overflow and showed conventional ann models can only forecast one or two steps ahead accurately while lstm has the capability for predicting multiple steps ahead especially for multivariate time series data despite the promising results reported for applying the ai based methods e g ann support vector machine models adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and decision tree method to rtff of non urbanised areas mosavi et al 2018 zounemat kermani et al 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2021 these applications are in the early stage of development for urban areas hence the rtff in uds is expected to improve through any of the above approaches with significant research modelling methods and experimentation for further improvement 4 1 performance assessment as part of the model development its performance needs to be evaluated basically by comparing the model outputs with the corresponding measurements for the data not used for the model development dal et al 2017 the performance assessment can also be along with adjusting the model parameters that are typically called model calibration and validation after the model calibration the model performance can be tested for future events and unseen data performance assessment can be carried out through key performance indicators kpis represented as either model accuracy of predictions or computational effort time table 11 lists typical kpis used in the recent studies of the rtff in uds as the main goal of the rtff is to give time for early actions to reduce the flood risks the maximum time spent by the model to process the data and predict the flood is an important factor for relevant authorities to select the model for their operations however this issue is not focused very well in the papers the first approach to measure is computational time i e time spent on performing computational processes however this parameter highly depends on the characteristic of system configuration and cannot be compared for different developed models that are presented all around the world therefore the number of iterations for iterative based models is introduced as a surrogate kpi for the computational time by abou rjeily et al 2017 in this approach correlation between the model accuracy and the number of iteration was investigated to specify the model performance prediction range is the other factor that shows the model performance as the main goal of the rtff is to give sufficient time for early actions to reduce the flood risks the maximum prediction range is an important factor for relevant authorities to select the model for their operations however the number of time steps ahead for prediction of urban flood in recent studies has been limited to short term mostly between 15 min to 90 min see table 11 these studies show that the accuracy of predictions made for periods longer than 60 min have been reduced significantly note that some physically based parameters such as catchment area and time of concentration can influence the performance of model predictions for example the accuracy of model predictions for larger catchment areas can be lower than those for smaller catchment areas also note that the impact of these parameters are likely to be negligible temporally and spatially for small catchment areas or short times of concentration as a result this poor performance can be translated as the deficiency of current rtff in uds to provide accurate predictions for longer periods which need more attention in future works finally although sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis methods have been widely used as an integral part of uncertainty assessments and accuracy of model calibration their potential benefits have not been fully revealed in the concepts of rtff in uds razavi et al 2021 nkwunonwo et al 2020 stated that parameterisation data and sensitivity analysis were usually overlooked in this concept and lack of uncertainty analysis is identified as the main deficiency in the performance assessment of real time urban flood forecasting methods daal et al 2017 as a result the particular importance of including sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis in any rtff in uds should be incorporated in the model results 5 conclusions this paper used a bibliometric approach to conduct a critical review of the recent developments of real time flood forecasting models in urban drainage systems the review evaluated all steps of the rtff models in uds including data collection and preparation model calibration and performance assessment the results demonstrated that there has been a surge of interest in the rtff in uds and this will continue to receive more attention in the future the following points are concluded for future directions of the rtff in uds rain gauge radar merging methods have been mainly employed in large scale non urbanised applications however most literature worked on rtff in uds have been used a single rainfall source for their modelling mainly because other rainfall sources cannot provide required data resolution or they are not compatible with the main rainfall data source which needs to be merged with as a result the literature on the performance assessment of using multiple rainfall resources is needed to specify the applicability of data merging in the context of rtff in uds the rainfall merging techniques have been highly relied on the application of interpolation techniques leading by kriging techniques and conditional merging techniques however there is a high demand to investigate the accuracy of integration techniques for urban data collection due to the successful application of this method in other hydrological applications using satellite products alone or by merging with a rain gauge or radar data should be more practised to take the opportunity of extending the valuable prediction range for early actions as a result of early flood warning the effect of rainfall both spatial and temporal resolution on the accuracy of urban flood forecasting is recognised as an important research area that can be more focussed diurnal pattern of sewage for combined system cases leakage fluvial flow uds s infiltration and leakage rate evaporation from the water surface of open conduits and should be dynamically accounted for building more accurate rtff models furthermore the dynamic role of soil moisture wind flow pattern air temperature and evaporation of surface runoff should be explored effectively to be included in these models providing effective imputation techniques to infill the missing data as a pre processing step is significant to have reliable data for the rtff models in uds data cleaning especially event identification needs to be considered properly for developing rtff models more specifically data classification techniques particularly data mining techniques should be used to remove unnecessary data physical models have been mostly used for the uds design and few cases focus on rtff models in uds while ai models such as narx and lstm have been revitalised in recent years it seems that they are taken into account as first steps in this context consequently further progress in applying these models is an imperative demand as a momentous future direction computational time and prediction range should be more spotlighted in future studies as part of the performance assessment due to their role in offering sufficient lead time for taking preventive decisions by operators sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis should be more discovered for rtff in uds in order to cover the gap of calibration of model parameters and the uncertainty of model results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3561,japan recently introduced a feed in tariff for small scale hydropower plants promoting the development of run of river hydropower plants in small sized basins however appropriate implementation requires gauging station streamflow data at substantial costs and time i e more than several years thus in this study we generated streamflow maps for small sized basins 10 km2 throughout japan using artificial neural networks anns modeled output streamflow characteristics relied upon the input variables obtained from 176 basin characteristics and consisted of mean annual streamflow qmean daily streamflow indices in a flow duration curve qd and a water volume index for run of river hydropower energy production wd95 we preliminarily investigated the impacts of selecting the input variables obtained from 176 basin characteristics on performances of the anns which indicated that the anns showed high robustness for disinformative input variables and multicollinearity between input variables although qmean high qd and wd95 performed well low qd were inadequate possibly due to snowmelt contributions and small catchment sizes obstructing the detection of geological impacts to accurately estimate the streamflow characteristics throughout japan we emphasize the importance of developing robust methods for correcting wind induced precipitation undercatch and a spatial interpolation for precipitation in high montane areas nevertheless the anns for japan proposed herein significantly outperformed a previous study exhibiting excellent global scale ability a map expressing run of river hydropower potential in small sized basins was generated and closely corresponded to the spatial distribution and electrical output of existing hydropower plants furthermore we demonstrated that the hydropower potential map reproduces the hydropower developments corresponding to the history of the electric power systems in japan which reflects its high reliability therefore the hydropower potential map can greatly aid the exploration of optimal sites for hydropower developments keywords artificial neural network basin characteristic geology wind induced precipitation

causing rainfall in the baiu front during early summer ohba and sugimoto 2019 and heavy snowfall during the winter kazama et al 2008 although the annual precipitation in japan has high spatial variability the country wide average precipitation is 1800 mm y 1 kondo 1994 which is comparable to the equatorial region hwang and frierson 2013 in addition 53 5 of all japanese islands are primarily covered by steep forested mountains takahasi 2004 oguchi et al 2001 as hydropower energy production depends on streamflow and hydraulic head basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 the unique combination of climatic and geomorphological features provides high potential for hydropower generation in the region bildirici 2019 recently the japanese government introduced a feed in tariff fit scheme designed to accelerate the development of renewable energy by offering long term contracts to renewable energy producers dong and shimada 2017 under the fit scheme the smaller the electric output the higher the purchase price of hydropower energy dong and shimada 2017 this leads to the promotion of small scale hydropower plant development considering a region consisting of steep mountains and the implementation of the fit scheme the development of run of river hydropower plants in small sized basins i e 100 km2 is proved to be one of the best economical approaches in japan however it requires gauging station streamflow data which entails significant cost and time to implement appropriately i e more than several years therefore estimates of streamflow in small sized and ungauged basins in japan are vital there are two categories of models to estimate streamflow in ungauged basins empirical and physical booker and woods 2014 although some studies have applied empirical modeling such as regressions between streamflow and basin characteristics e g climate land use geology soil topography etc in japan musiake et al 1981 komatsu et al 2012 their objective was not to estimate the streamflow in ungauged basins but to investigate the relationships between streamflow and basin characteristics numerous other studies have applied physical approaches examining rainfall runoff or land surface models throughout japan tachikawa et al 2011 yabu et al 2017 konja et al 2019 sayama et al 2020 however their primary objective was to aid flood prediction and not estimate the streamflow in ungauged basins when applying a physical model to estimate streamflow in ungauged basins it is necessary to transfer the model parameters from gauged to ungauged basins i e regionalization approach he et al 2011 razavi and coulibaly 2013 parajka et al 2013 although there are many regionalization approaches for physical models singh et al 2014 rakovec et al 2016 beck et al 2016 it is not clear how to select the best approach furthermore the estimates of streamflow in small sized basins 10 km2 throughout japan require targeting several thousand basins considering the computational costs to calculate these numerous basins it is difficult to select a regionalization approach with a physical model in fact the studies applying physical models throughout japan tachikawa et al 2011 yabu et al 2017 konja et al 2019 sayama et al 2020 did not apply any regionalization approaches therefore few studies have adequately estimated the spatial distribution of streamflow in small sized basins of japan artificial neural networks anns which are a subset of machine learning algorithms can be used to model complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs bishop 1995 recently anns capable of estimating streamflow characteristics using basin characteristics as input achieved extremely high accuracy at a global scale beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 and barbarossa et al 2018 trained anns using observed discharge data from thousands of basins worldwide achieving coefficient of determination r2 values of 0 88 and 0 92 for their mean streamflow indices respectively ultimately beck et al 2015 concluded that the anns outperformed four macroscale hydrological models used globally however there are significant challenges to maintaining this level of accuracy in small sized basins of japan these studies applied observed discharge data for japan obtained from the worldwide discharge database of global runoff data centre grdc https www bafg de with an average catchment size of 2642 km2 n 152 data accessed 2 3 2021 since most medium sized basins i e 100 km2 in japan have been previously developed for flood control or water utilization such as hydropower drinking water supply and irrigation musiake and koike 2009 takahasi 2009 japan dam foundation 2015 they are not always ideal candidates for streamflow estimation furthermore global streamflow estimates are generally limited by the availability of basin data due to the difficulty in maintaining data quality on a global scale indeed barbarossa et al 2018 and beck et al 2015 selected only 13 and 20 indices to characterize basins in their anns respectively therefore when targeting streamflow estimation in small sized basins of japan there is still significant room for improvement in the selection of target basins and their characteristics for inclusion in the anns this study aimed to produce maps for the streamflow characteristics in small sized basins throughout japan using the anns the basin size was set at 10 km2 to map the streamflow characteristics the secondary objectives were as follows 1 investigate the relationships between streamflow and basin characteristics 2 validate the generalization performances of the anns and 3 explore the optimal locations for the development of run of river hydropower plants within the research area the workflow of this study is shown in fig 1 first we selected target basins with negligible anthropogenic disturbances for the development of the anns second we trained the anns that output streamflow characteristics based on inputs of 176 basin characteristics by using data from the target basins notably we also investigated the impact of selecting the input variables obtained from among the 176 basin characteristics on the performances of the anns third maps for the streamflow characteristics in small sized basins throughout japan were produced by using the trained anns finally a potential map of the run of river hydropower developments was produced by using the streamflow map and elevation data 2 data 2 1 target basins the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism releases daily discharge data in two portals namely the database of dams http mudam nilim go jp and the water information system http www1 river go jp which were used to select the target basins considering discharge records and basin characteristics the target period was set from 1981 to 2014 since the present study aimed to map the streamflow characteristics in ungauged basins anthropogenic influences on discharge data in the target basins were eliminated thus referencing the dam yearbook japan dam foundation 2015 and map of geospatial information authority of japan https maps gsi go jp only those basins without upstream dams or hydropower stations and a minimum of five years of available discharge data were extracted although the present study solely focused on the streamflow estimation of small sized basins 10 km2 the basin identification is limited by the resolution of the digital elevation model dem thus only basins 5 km2 were analyzed ultimately 387 target basins were identified throughout japan fig 2 and their corresponding average median catchment size and periods of discharge records were 161 0 km2 75 0 km2 and 17 1 years 17 years respectively 2 2 streamflow characteristics we employed mean annual streamflow qmean daily streamflow indices in an annual flow duration curve qd and a water volume index for run of river hydropower energy production wd95 see fig s56 these streamflow characteristics were expressed by runoff height the units correspond to mm y 1 for qmean and wd95 and mm d 1 for qd four indices of qd were used qd95 qd185 qd275 and qd355 where the values correspond to the days per year exceeded of daily streamflow calculated using the mean annual flow duration curve e g qd95 is the greatest value of qd fig s56 vogel and fennessey 1995 blöschl et al 2013 these four indices are conventionally used to compare the runoff regime among rivers in japan e g musiake et al 1981 yokoo and oki 2010 toyoda et al 2015 run of river hydropower plants can use sub design streamflow for energy production basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 thus wd95 corresponds to water volume for the energy production when applying the design streamflow to qd95 notably qd95 is the closest value of qd to design streamflow applied in a global estimation of run of river hydropower potential gernaat et al 2017 we also note that the calculations of all streamflow characteristics were based on water year october september in order to avoid the mismatch of annual water balances due to snowmelt contributions 2 3 basin characteristics in this study 176 basin characteristics were selected pertaining to climate land use geology soil and topography table 1 geographic information system data were integrated using esri arcgis v 10 6 and basin characteristics were extracted from the corresponding coverage areas resolutions were adjusted by nearest neighbor interpolation to ensure equal treatment of characteristics precipitation and snow indices were based on daily data with 1 mm d 1 aphro jp v1207 kamiguchi et al 2010 a database of observed precipitation throughout japan at 5 km resolution was utilized to express the precipitation indices snow indices were applied to the agro meteorological grid square data kominami et al 2015 which was calculated using a snow water equivalent model accounting for heat and radiative balance at 1 km resolution according to a poisson process of precipitation events rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 the mean frequency of daily precipitation λp and daily snowfall λsnow was defined as the reciprocal of mean days until the next precipitation snowfall event these indices considered the variability in time corresponding to the period of discharge records except for the corrected values of wind induced precipitation undercatch in the winter up since japan has one of the areas with the heaviest snowfall in the world kazama et al 2008 observed precipitation can be significantly underestimated by wind induced precipitation undercatch sevruk 1996 therefore masuda et al 2019 developed a corrected product for wind induced precipitation undercatch during 2009 2012 namely aphro jp v1801 thus up was set up in this study by calculating the mean annual difference between aphro jp v1207 and v1801 in the winter i e december february for these years potential evapotranspiration pet indices were obtained from the cgiar csi global aridity and global pet database zomer et al 2007 the aridity index ai was calculated by dividing the mean annual precipitation p by the mean annual pet the seasonality indices of precipitation and pet were calculated according to beck et al 2013 equations described in table 1 we applied the national land numerical information nlni database http nlftp mlit go jp ksj e index html to express temperature and solar indices the nlni database in combination with previous studies yokoo et al 2001 yokoo and oki 2010 musiake et al 1981 was employed to assign indices on land use geology soil and topography in particular topographic indices were generated using the elevation data of hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 at 90 m resolution with this data having been previously applied to small sized basins in japan to estimate streamflow arai et al 2021 shakti et al 2020 however pakoksung and takagi 2021 reported that dems of hydrosheds and gtopo30 developed by the united states geological survey showed lower accuracy than those of the geographical survey institute of japan when targeting the shikoku region fig 2 a therefore dem displacement might be an approach to improve the performances of the anns in the future 3 methodology 3 1 streamflow and basin characteristics generally it is difficult to decipher the relationship between any single input variable and the output in anns due to their multilayer nonlinear structure buhrmester et al 2019 furthermore the linearity of relationships between streamflow and basin characteristics is also uncertain thus spearman s rank correlation analyses were conducted to better understand these relationships throughout japan 3 2 anns development previous studies have developed feed forward anns to estimate streamflow characteristics by inputting basin characteristics directly beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 barbarossa et al 2018 however this could potentially adversely impact the performance of the anns when inputting basin characteristics which demonstrate either poor correlations with streamflow characteristics i e disinformative relationships or multicollinearity in fact we observed disinformative relationships figs s2 s10 and some strong correlations between basin characteristics figs s11 s55 therefore we prepared 12 cases that input different variables of basin characteristics fig 3 to address the problem of disinformative relationships we applied spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ between these relationships as thresholds to select input variables obtained from among the 176 basin characteristics it is worth noting that ρ as the threshold was set to the highest absolute value in all the streamflow characteristics because there were only three basin characteristics with a ρ 0 5 fig s57 we set five thresholds for ρ from 0 1 to 0 5 the selected basin characteristics based on these thresholds are shown in fig s57 additionally we performed principal component analysis pca to generate uncorrelated variables of the basin characteristics which helped address the problem of multicollinearity specifically we applied the principal components to the input variables of the anns to choose the appropriate number of principal components a cumulative contribution rate of 80 is commonly adopted as a criterion e g li et al 2016 with this also applied in the present study table s9 as shown in fig 3 pca was applied after the selections based on the ρ thresholds moreover we introduced two cases to establish the input variables 1 directly using all basin characteristics i e case 1 and 2 using uncorrelated variables obtained from all basin characteristics i e case 7 we then developed 12 anns by inputting the 12 datasets as shown in fig 3 the number of hidden layers was set to two in the anns which output six streamflow characteristics qmean qd95 qd185 qd275 qd355 and wd95 when developing the anns we normalized the input variables using the min max method in order to promote faster calculations and improve the results jin et al 2015 furthermore we applied l2 regularization to the cost functions of the anns to prevent overfitting graves 2011 see supporting information we evaluated the generalization performances of the anns using a leave one out cross validation procedure which is commonly employed for the assessment of streamflow estimation in ungauged basins razavi and coulibaly 2013 the schematic diagram of this procedure is shown in fig s58 in the first step one target basin was used for testing and the others for training n 386 the training continued until the completion of 1000 iterations that learned all data in the 386 basins applied for training i e epochs 1000 the testing for one basin was also conducted in this phase by using the trained ann we note that application of an intel core i9 10885h processor base frequency 2 40 ghz resulted in a computation time of 140 s in this phase this procedure was repeated until all 387 basins had been tested we subsequently calculated the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse to obtain the generalization performance in this study we identified the hyperparameters in the anns e g the number of neurons in the hidden layers the learning rate and regularization parameter see supporting information by trial and error to maximize r2 and minimize rmse finally we identified the best performing streamflow characteristics among the 12 anns for mapping procedures 3 3 mapping streamflow characteristics the anns showing the best performances among the 12 anns for streamflow characteristics section 3 2 were then trained using all of the target basins n 387 to extract small sized basin basins with areas 10 km2 were identified throughout japan using 90 m resolution dem data lehner et al 2008 as a result 8901 basins were identified and their corresponding basin characteristics were extracted notably anthropogenic influences on streamflow were not considered in this process basin characteristic data which incorporated time variability i e indices of precipitation and snow table 1 were set to the 10 year period from 2001 to 2010 finally streamflow characteristics were estimated for all identified basins by transferring the extracted basin characteristics into the trained anns 3 4 optimal sites for run of river hydropower hydropower energy production depends on streamflow and hydraulic head basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 in particular energy production from run of river hydropower plants is directly influenced by flow duration curves as the run of river hydropower plants can use sub design streamflow for energy production see fig s56 basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 therefore the potential of the run of river hydropower developments namely the hydropower potential index hp was defined by eq 1 as follows 1 h p i w d 95 i w d 95 h i h where i denotes a target basin overbars denote the mean value in small sized basins 8901 and h is the gross head fig 4 set by calculating the difference between the minimum elevation of the basin and the minimum elevation within a 1 km radius from the basin hp in small sized basins was further estimated using the outputs of wd95 4 results 4 1 streamflow and basin characteristics the results of spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ between streamflow and basin characteristics are shown in fig 5 notably the results of basin characteristics containing subgroups i e lu geo1 geo2 geo3 soil1 soil2 and topo1 see table 1 are represented by their greatest ρ value observed ρ values were expressed as absolute values some indices contained in the subgroups did not exhibit any correlations as these indices contained no or limited existence in the target basins trends of correlations displayed a similarity among the streamflow characteristics although a lesser correlation for the low streamflow indices was observed according to mean ρ for all streamflow characteristics the five most influential basin characteristics were ai λp p soil1 corresponding to podozolic dry soil see tables s11 s16 the mean snow water equivalent on snowy days αsnow overall fig 5 shows that some climate indices namely ai λp and p demonstrated the strongest influence on predicting streamflow characteristics soil and land use indices also maintained some effects and the impacts of geology and topography were weak 4 2 anns performance fig 6 shows the results of the leave one out cross validations for the 12 anns whether the uncorrelated variables were used or not had little effect on the accuracy of the anns in addition the best performances of streamflow characteristics were observed in case 1 for qd185 qd275 qd355 and wd95 and in case 4 for qmean and qd95 table 2 shows the detailed results of the best performances the overall r2 and rmse values for the training data outperformed the testing data good generalization performances were observed for qmean qd95 qd185 and wd95 r2 0 70 the performances across qd varied significantly r2 0 47 0 84 decreasing from qd95 to qd355 normalized rmse values were also calculated using the means of observed streamflow characteristics table 2 the normalized rmse for the streamflow characteristics except qd355 were 0 50 increasing from qd95 to qd355 4 3 small sized basin streamflow maps streamflow maps in small sized basins 10 km2 are shown for qmean fig 7 as the results for all other streamflow characteristics displayed similar features to qmean see figs s59 s63 notably the displayed results in these figures correspond to geometries of the small sized basins as shown in the enlarged view in fig 7 the highest values of qmean were distributed in the heavy snowfall areas of tohoku and hokuriku facing the japan sea fig 1 a d qmean also showed high in the typhoon prone areas of kyushu shikoku and kinki facing the pacific ocean fig 1 a goldberg 2018 4 4 mapping hydropower potential index fig 8 displays the derived map of hp where maximum values were distributed around the japanese alps fig 1 b one of the highest montane areas in japan the distributions of peak hp values did not always correspond to those of heavy precipitation fig 1 c or snowfall fig 1 d the minimum hp values were located around coastal land areas due to the elevation related limitations of obtaining high gross head h compared to the results of streamflow characteristics fig 7 the distribution of hp demonstrated a high variance between basins 5 discussion 5 1 selection of basin characteristics when inputting all basin characteristics directly i e case 1 we observed relatively good performances for all streamflow characteristics in the 12 anns fig 6 this indicated that the anns showed high robustness for both disinformative input variables and multicollinearity between input variables moreover previous studies reported that anns tend to be insensitive to problems of multicollinearity de veaux and ungar 1994 obite et al 2020 which is consistent with our observation however noise in the input variables may have harmful effects on the performance to evaluate these effects we eliminated individual input variables and then compared the performance fig 9 notably we conducted this evaluation by targeting case 4 which included certain informative basin characteristics for streamflow characteristics according to fig 9 the performance was hardly changed by eliminating individual input variables which indicated that the impact of noise in the input variables was low nevertheless searching for a truly optimal subset of input variables has been shown to be np hard in the field of machine learning since there are numerous combinations of input variables that could be selected bins and draper 2001 this indicates that there is room to improve the selection of input variables in this study several methods to select the input variables have been proposed wang et al 2016 which may be helpful for improving performance in the future we found that qmean and qd95 continued to exhibit excellent performances r2 0 80 case 6 fig 6 even on application of the three most influential basin characteristics i e ai λp and p fig s57 some previous studies have applied anns to estimate annual runoff in ungauged basins mazvimavi et al 2005 beck et al 2015 barbarossa et al 2018 although most of these studies introduced p in their anns as an input variable few considered both ai and λp because ai λp and p can be obtained easily from global datasets e g zomer et al 2007 fick and hijmans 2017 hersbach et al 2020 we recommend considering the three indices when estimating annual runoff in ungauged basins using anns notably applying the three variables i e case 6 resulted in worse performance for qd355 in the 12 anns fig 6 generally low streamflow is the result of a complex combination of processes related to the climate and the catchment blöschl et al 2013 considering that the three variables comprise only climate indices they were insufficient for estimating qd355 additionally previous studies have applied anns to estimate low streamflow or baseflow index in ungauged basins mazvimavi et al 2004 beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 barbarossa et al 2018 which considers both climate and physiographic characteristics as input variables however few studies have investigated the relationship between the performances for low streamflow or baseflow index and the number of basin characteristics thus the results of the present study which reveal that increasing the number of basin characteristics improved the estimations of qd355 fig 6 can be useful for upgrading the performances of anns estimating low streamflow or baseflow index 5 2 low streamflow anns performances decreased from qd95 r2 0 84 to qd355 r2 0 47 table 2 which aligned with the results exhibiting that the influence of informative climate indices i e ai λp p on streamflow characteristics also decreased across the same range fig 5 this result suggested that there were fewer informative basin characteristics for low streamflow than for high streamflow previous studies have investigated the relationship between a low streamflow index i e qd355 and basin characteristics in japan musiake et al 1981 yokoo and oki 2010 and reported a larger impact of geology on low streamflow than climatic conditions however the results in our study did not support the above findings fig 5 the discrepancy found in previous researches likely occurred due to the selection of target basins firstly snowfall areas were excluded from their target basins to eliminate the impact of snowmelt on low streamflow secondly the ca of the target basins in their studies were larger ranging from 100 km2 in yokoo and oki 2010 to an average size of 258 km2 in musiake et al 1981 spearman s rank correlation analyses were conducted for qd355 by adjusting the thresholds of swe and ca to investigate the impact of snowfall and ca on the low streamflow observed in the present study fig 10 it was revealed that there were strong geological impacts on qd355 when targeting low swe 200 mm y 1 and large ca 200 km2 generally snowfall promotes abundant groundwater recharge via contributions from snowmelt earman et al 2006 which increases the baseflow wang et al 2015 considering the amount of snowfall in japan kazama et al 2008 the heavy snowfall areas fig 1 d can sustain high baseflow throughout the year therefore the results shown in fig 10 suggest that snowmelt contributions masked the impact of geology on low streamflow few studies have addressed the impacts of both geology and ca on low streamflow through investigating dissolved silica concentrations to detect the depth of flow paths on hillslopes uchida et al 2008 asano and uchida 2010 found a heterogeneous hydrologic response among headwater streams within a very small montane basin 5 km2 with homogeneous geology the authors inferred the existence of a ca threshold namely the representative elementary area beyond which an average hydrologic response can be found wood et al 1988 subsequently asano et al 2020 reported that baseflow specific discharge increased with ca within a small montane basin 100 km2 comprising of permeable bedrock they indicated that considerable amounts of water infiltrated the upstream bedrock and returned to surface flow downstream due to the storage discharge properties of the montane basin thus two different impacts of ca on low streamflow in small basins have been described inhibiting proper low streamflow estimation in addition the limited information available on the relationship between low streamflow and ca in small basins further complicated matters therefore future studies should aim to reveal a universal relationship using a large number of field studies from geographically diverse locations 5 3 features of streamflow estimation throughout japan the anns of beck et al 2015 achieved excellent generalization performances for the streamflow estimations of global basins e g r2 0 88 for qmean comparatively the generalization performance scores achieved for the present study were slightly inferior table 2 r2 0 85 for qmean since the aforementioned authors released their global map online their model s performance for the target basins in japan was investigated fig 11 notably some differences in the selection criteria of target basins exist in particular the authors had set the minimum discharge record to a length of 10 years five years was used for the present study and the minimum ca of 10 km2 5 km2 in this study nevertheless the performance of the model derived in this study outperformed that of beck et al 2015 when examining the japanese target basins fig 11 furthermore the other model performed poorly in japan compared to its global evaluation indicating the difficulty of streamflow estimation in this part of the world the results from this study suggest that the discrepancy arose from wind induced precipitation undercatch for snowfall and the inadequacy of rain gauge stations in high montane areas generally wind induced precipitation undercatch as estimated by rain gauge observations can reach up to 80 of snowfall amounts sevruk 1996 and some studies have investigated this process in japan yokoyama et al 2003 observed this process and fitted the observed data using an equation proposed by yoshida 1959 expressing a decrease in catch rate corresponding to wind speed although the observed data tended to follow the equation the authors reported large variations in the observed catch rate even in conditions of homogeneous wind speed masuda et al 2019 corrected the wind induced precipitation undercatch for snowfall throughout japan by applying the same equation of yoshida 1959 in order to validate the correction they analyzed the water balance at four dam basins in heavy snowfall areas although the correction improved estimates the authors still revealed an underestimation of precipitation by 20 masuda et al 2019 ultimately concluded that the primary source of error is the sparseness of rain gauge stations in high montane areas in japan the present study accounted for the effect of wind induced precipitation undercatch through the corrected data of masuda et al 2019 however the correction method was a function of wind speed yoshida 1959 which did not always reproduce the observed data yokoyama et al 2003 therefore it may be difficult to obtain the true precipitation values for these regions in japan to develop a robust method to correct the wind induced precipitation undercatch for snowfall it is important to understand the true precipitation values by measuring the thickness of the snow layer and the water content at nearby rain gauge stations in addition improvements in the spatial interpolation method of precipitation for high montane areas should be addressed in the future 5 4 optimal locations for run of river hydropower numerous studies have estimated hydropower potential at a regional cyr et al 2011 fujii et al 2017 tamm and tamm 2020 and global scale zhou et al 2015 hoes et al 2017 gernaat et al 2017 although the prediction of streamflow in ungauged basins is one of the most important factors when searching for optimal sites of hydropower developments most of the aforementioned studies failed to address this unknown factor therefore few studies have adequately tested the generalization performances of their streamflow estimation model for hydropower potential in the present study the generalization performances of the anns were tested by leave one out cross validations whose wd95 was applied to map hp in small sized basins of japan fig 8 although wd95 showed good generalization performance r2 0 79 the accuracy of the hp map is unknown we have discussed how to test the hp map below in japan the history of hydropower extends as far back as the 1880s bildirici 2019 when considering its lengthy historical context it can be assumed that the most favorable hydropower sites have already been developed therefore we can evaluate the accuracy of the hp map derived here using data from the existing hydropower stations fig 12 shows the locations and the power outputs of hydropower plants selected from nlni p03 13 dam yearbook japan dam foundation 2015 and the hydropower plant database by electric power civil engineering association https www jepoc or jp hydro notably all hydropower plants are shown except for pumped storage hydropower plants although the intent of the hp estimated was to target run of river hydropower plants favorable sites for all types of hydropower except pumped storage hydropower similarly require abundant streamflow with a high gross head geographically the density and the electric outputs of existing hydropower plants agreed with the estimations of high hp fig 8 in order to evaluate the quantitative accuracy of the hp map the relationship between mean hp and existing plant output was investigated fig 13 particularly focusing on first class basins fig 12 directly managed by the central government fig 13 shows the significant correlation between the mean hp and power output of the existing plants r2 0 67 indicating a certain level of reliability of the hp map in the same way we investigated the relationship between mean hp and existing plant output by the construction periods fig 14 the correlation coefficient peaked from 1951 to 1970 fig 14 d this can be explained by focusing on the history of electric power systems in japan considering that hydropower developments started in the 1880s in japan bildirici 2019 the period before 1910 corresponds to the early days of electric power short distance power grids between power plants and consumers were standard in this period musiake et al 1981 which indicates that the developers could not always select the optimal hydropower sites thus it is natural that there is no correlation between hp and the development in this period fig 14 a on the other hand we can see a strong correlation during 1931 1970 fig 14 c and d according to the agency for natural resources and energy 2018 the growth of power grid length peaked in the 1970s which indicates that the expansion of the power grid allowed the development of hydropower stations at more optimal sites although hydropower was the largest electricity source until the middle of 1960 the transition from hydropower to fossil or nuclear energy was relatively rapid after that bildirici 2019 this corresponds with the fact that the scale range of the developed hydroelectric outputs has been shrinking since the 1970s fig 14 e f and g in line with this our results show that the correlation coefficient also has been decreasing since the 1970s fig 14 e f and g which may reflect the fact that the optimal sites for hydropower had already been developed in 2012 the japanese government introduced the fit scheme to accelerate the development of renewable energy by offering long term contracts to renewable energy producers dong and shimada 2017 the fit increased more profitable sites for developers of hydropower than ever before accordingly we observed active developments in relatively low hp fig 14 g reflecting the impact of the fit scheme as discussed above the hp map is consistent with the history of the electric power systems in japan this fact reinforces the reliability of the hp map nevertheless hp has room for improvement as in the current version hp is only based on energy production for example it is necessary for the profitable developments to consider the energy production and economic aspects such as initial and operational costs blanco et al 2008 toyoda et al 2015 therefore future studies should introduce the hp map considering these economic aspects which will effectively accelerate the development of hydropower systems 6 conclusions the present study generated maps of streamflow in small sized basins 10 km2 throughout japan using anns to investigate the impact of selecting input variables obtained from among 176 basin characteristics on the performances of the anns we preliminarily prepared 12 anns that input different variables of basin characteristics directly inputting all basin characteristics resulted in relatively good overall performances indicating that the anns showed high robustness for disinformative input variables and multicollinearity between input variables additionally we found that increasing the number of basin characteristics improved the estimations of qd355 which can be useful for upgrading the performances of anns estimating low streamflow or baseflow index in ungauged basins according to these findings we selected the best performing streamflow characteristics among the 12 anns the performance for qmean high streamflow characteristics i e qd95 qd185 and wd95 were good although decreased performances were recorded for low streamflow characteristics due to its weaker correlations with basin characteristics according to previous studies in japan geology established a larger impact on low streamflow than climatic conditions however similar results were obtained in the present study for areas with low swe and large ca indicating that 1 snowmelt contributions mask geological impacts and 2 small ca can complicate the hydrologic response for low streamflow the difficulty of estimating streamflow in japan was also highlighted as one of the heaviest snowfall areas in the world is located in this region leading to large discrepancies arising from wind induced precipitation undercatch in addition the sparse distribution of rain gauge stations in high montane areas further contributes to the underestimation of precipitation in order to improve the model performance for japan future studies should develop robust methods for correcting wind induced precipitation undercatch and a spatial interpolation of precipitation in high montane areas nevertheless at the national level the performance of the anns derived in this study greatly outperformed that of a previous study with excellent global scale performance the present study also generated a map of hp for small sized basins in japan and accurately corresponded to spatial distributions and electrical outputs of existing hydropower plants furthermore we demonstrated that the hp map reproduces the hydropower developments corresponding to the history of electric power systems in japan which reflects the high reliability of the hp map therefore this map can greatly aid the exploration for optimal sites of run of river

3561,japan recently introduced a feed in tariff for small scale hydropower plants promoting the development of run of river hydropower plants in small sized basins however appropriate implementation requires gauging station streamflow data at substantial costs and time i e more than several years thus in this study we generated streamflow maps for small sized basins 10 km2 throughout japan using artificial neural networks anns modeled output streamflow characteristics relied upon the input variables obtained from 176 basin characteristics and consisted of mean annual streamflow qmean daily streamflow indices in a flow duration curve qd and a water volume index for run of river hydropower energy production wd95 we preliminarily investigated the impacts of selecting the input variables obtained from 176 basin characteristics on performances of the anns which indicated that the anns showed high robustness for disinformative input variables and multicollinearity between input variables although qmean high qd and wd95 performed well low qd were inadequate possibly due to snowmelt contributions and small catchment sizes obstructing the detection of geological impacts to accurately estimate the streamflow characteristics throughout japan we emphasize the importance of developing robust methods for correcting wind induced precipitation undercatch and a spatial interpolation for precipitation in high montane areas nevertheless the anns for japan proposed herein significantly outperformed a previous study exhibiting excellent global scale ability a map expressing run of river hydropower potential in small sized basins was generated and closely corresponded to the spatial distribution and electrical output of existing hydropower plants furthermore we demonstrated that the hydropower potential map reproduces the hydropower developments corresponding to the history of the electric power systems in japan which reflects its high reliability therefore

causing rainfall in the baiu front during early summer ohba and sugimoto 2019 and heavy snowfall during the winter kazama et al 2008 although the annual precipitation in japan has high spatial variability the country wide average precipitation is 1800 mm y 1 kondo 1994 which is comparable to the equatorial region hwang and frierson 2013 in addition 53 5 of all japanese islands are primarily covered by steep forested mountains takahasi 2004 oguchi et al 2001 as hydropower energy production depends on streamflow and hydraulic head basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 the unique combination of climatic and geomorphological features provides high potential for hydropower generation in the region bildirici 2019 recently the japanese government introduced a feed in tariff fit scheme designed to accelerate the development of renewable energy by offering long term contracts to renewable energy producers dong and shimada 2017 under the fit scheme the smaller the electric output the higher the purchase price of hydropower energy dong and shimada 2017 this leads to the promotion of small scale hydropower plant development considering a region consisting of steep mountains and the implementation of the fit scheme the development of run of river hydropower plants in small sized basins i e 100 km2 is proved to be one of the best economical approaches in japan however it requires gauging station streamflow data which entails significant cost and time to implement appropriately i e more than several years therefore estimates of streamflow in small sized and ungauged basins in japan are vital there are two categories of models to estimate streamflow in ungauged basins empirical and physical booker and woods 2014 although some studies have applied empirical modeling such as regressions between streamflow and basin characteristics e g climate land use geology soil topography etc in japan musiake et al 1981 komatsu et al 2012 their objective was not to estimate the streamflow in ungauged basins but to investigate the relationships between streamflow and basin characteristics numerous other studies have applied physical approaches examining rainfall runoff or land surface models throughout japan tachikawa et al 2011 yabu et al 2017 konja et al 2019 sayama et al 2020 however their primary objective was to aid flood prediction and not estimate the streamflow in ungauged basins when applying a physical model to estimate streamflow in ungauged basins it is necessary to transfer the model parameters from gauged to ungauged basins i e regionalization approach he et al 2011 razavi and coulibaly 2013 parajka et al 2013 although there are many regionalization approaches for physical models singh et al 2014 rakovec et al 2016 beck et al 2016 it is not clear how to select the best approach furthermore the estimates of streamflow in small sized basins 10 km2 throughout japan require targeting several thousand basins considering the computational costs to calculate these numerous basins it is difficult to select a regionalization approach with a physical model in fact the studies applying physical models throughout japan tachikawa et al 2011 yabu et al 2017 konja et al 2019 sayama et al 2020 did not apply any regionalization approaches therefore few studies have adequately estimated the spatial distribution of streamflow in small sized basins of japan artificial neural networks anns which are a subset of machine learning algorithms can be used to model complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs bishop 1995 recently anns capable of estimating streamflow characteristics using basin characteristics as input achieved extremely high accuracy at a global scale beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 and barbarossa et al 2018 trained anns using observed discharge data from thousands of basins worldwide achieving coefficient of determination r2 values of 0 88 and 0 92 for their mean streamflow indices respectively ultimately beck et al 2015 concluded that the anns outperformed four macroscale hydrological models used globally however there are significant challenges to maintaining this level of accuracy in small sized basins of japan these studies applied observed discharge data for japan obtained from the worldwide discharge database of global runoff data centre grdc https www bafg de with an average catchment size of 2642 km2 n 152 data accessed 2 3 2021 since most medium sized basins i e 100 km2 in japan have been previously developed for flood control or water utilization such as hydropower drinking water supply and irrigation musiake and koike 2009 takahasi 2009 japan dam foundation 2015 they are not always ideal candidates for streamflow estimation furthermore global streamflow estimates are generally limited by the availability of basin data due to the difficulty in maintaining data quality on a global scale indeed barbarossa et al 2018 and beck et al 2015 selected only 13 and 20 indices to characterize basins in their anns respectively therefore when targeting streamflow estimation in small sized basins of japan there is still significant room for improvement in the selection of target basins and their characteristics for inclusion in the anns this study aimed to produce maps for the streamflow characteristics in small sized basins throughout japan using the anns the basin size was set at 10 km2 to map the streamflow characteristics the secondary objectives were as follows 1 investigate the relationships between streamflow and basin characteristics 2 validate the generalization performances of the anns and 3 explore the optimal locations for the development of run of river hydropower plants within the research area the workflow of this study is shown in fig 1 first we selected target basins with negligible anthropogenic disturbances for the development of the anns second we trained the anns that output streamflow characteristics based on inputs of 176 basin characteristics by using data from the target basins notably we also investigated the impact of selecting the input variables obtained from among the 176 basin characteristics on the performances of the anns third maps for the streamflow characteristics in small sized basins throughout japan were produced by using the trained anns finally a potential map of the run of river hydropower developments was produced by using the streamflow map and elevation data 2 data 2 1 target basins the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism releases daily discharge data in two portals namely the database of dams http mudam nilim go jp and the water information system http www1 river go jp which were used to select the target basins considering discharge records and basin characteristics the target period was set from 1981 to 2014 since the present study aimed to map the streamflow characteristics in ungauged basins anthropogenic influences on discharge data in the target basins were eliminated thus referencing the dam yearbook japan dam foundation 2015 and map of geospatial information authority of japan https maps gsi go jp only those basins without upstream dams or hydropower stations and a minimum of five years of available discharge data were extracted although the present study solely focused on the streamflow estimation of small sized basins 10 km2 the basin identification is limited by the resolution of the digital elevation model dem thus only basins 5 km2 were analyzed ultimately 387 target basins were identified throughout japan fig 2 and their corresponding average median catchment size and periods of discharge records were 161 0 km2 75 0 km2 and 17 1 years 17 years respectively 2 2 streamflow characteristics we employed mean annual streamflow qmean daily streamflow indices in an annual flow duration curve qd and a water volume index for run of river hydropower energy production wd95 see fig s56 these streamflow characteristics were expressed by runoff height the units correspond to mm y 1 for qmean and wd95 and mm d 1 for qd four indices of qd were used qd95 qd185 qd275 and qd355 where the values correspond to the days per year exceeded of daily streamflow calculated using the mean annual flow duration curve e g qd95 is the greatest value of qd fig s56 vogel and fennessey 1995 blöschl et al 2013 these four indices are conventionally used to compare the runoff regime among rivers in japan e g musiake et al 1981 yokoo and oki 2010 toyoda et al 2015 run of river hydropower plants can use sub design streamflow for energy production basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 thus wd95 corresponds to water volume for the energy production when applying the design streamflow to qd95 notably qd95 is the closest value of qd to design streamflow applied in a global estimation of run of river hydropower potential gernaat et al 2017 we also note that the calculations of all streamflow characteristics were based on water year october september in order to avoid the mismatch of annual water balances due to snowmelt contributions 2 3 basin characteristics in this study 176 basin characteristics were selected pertaining to climate land use geology soil and topography table 1 geographic information system data were integrated using esri arcgis v 10 6 and basin characteristics were extracted from the corresponding coverage areas resolutions were adjusted by nearest neighbor interpolation to ensure equal treatment of characteristics precipitation and snow indices were based on daily data with 1 mm d 1 aphro jp v1207 kamiguchi et al 2010 a database of observed precipitation throughout japan at 5 km resolution was utilized to express the precipitation indices snow indices were applied to the agro meteorological grid square data kominami et al 2015 which was calculated using a snow water equivalent model accounting for heat and radiative balance at 1 km resolution according to a poisson process of precipitation events rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 the mean frequency of daily precipitation λp and daily snowfall λsnow was defined as the reciprocal of mean days until the next precipitation snowfall event these indices considered the variability in time corresponding to the period of discharge records except for the corrected values of wind induced precipitation undercatch in the winter up since japan has one of the areas with the heaviest snowfall in the world kazama et al 2008 observed precipitation can be significantly underestimated by wind induced precipitation undercatch sevruk 1996 therefore masuda et al 2019 developed a corrected product for wind induced precipitation undercatch during 2009 2012 namely aphro jp v1801 thus up was set up in this study by calculating the mean annual difference between aphro jp v1207 and v1801 in the winter i e december february for these years potential evapotranspiration pet indices were obtained from the cgiar csi global aridity and global pet database zomer et al 2007 the aridity index ai was calculated by dividing the mean annual precipitation p by the mean annual pet the seasonality indices of precipitation and pet were calculated according to beck et al 2013 equations described in table 1 we applied the national land numerical information nlni database http nlftp mlit go jp ksj e index html to express temperature and solar indices the nlni database in combination with previous studies yokoo et al 2001 yokoo and oki 2010 musiake et al 1981 was employed to assign indices on land use geology soil and topography in particular topographic indices were generated using the elevation data of hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 at 90 m resolution with this data having been previously applied to small sized basins in japan to estimate streamflow arai et al 2021 shakti et al 2020 however pakoksung and takagi 2021 reported that dems of hydrosheds and gtopo30 developed by the united states geological survey showed lower accuracy than those of the geographical survey institute of japan when targeting the shikoku region fig 2 a therefore dem displacement might be an approach to improve the performances of the anns in the future 3 methodology 3 1 streamflow and basin characteristics generally it is difficult to decipher the relationship between any single input variable and the output in anns due to their multilayer nonlinear structure buhrmester et al 2019 furthermore the linearity of relationships between streamflow and basin characteristics is also uncertain thus spearman s rank correlation analyses were conducted to better understand these relationships throughout japan 3 2 anns development previous studies have developed feed forward anns to estimate streamflow characteristics by inputting basin characteristics directly beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 barbarossa et al 2018 however this could potentially adversely impact the performance of the anns when inputting basin characteristics which demonstrate either poor correlations with streamflow characteristics i e disinformative relationships or multicollinearity in fact we observed disinformative relationships figs s2 s10 and some strong correlations between basin characteristics figs s11 s55 therefore we prepared 12 cases that input different variables of basin characteristics fig 3 to address the problem of disinformative relationships we applied spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ between these relationships as thresholds to select input variables obtained from among the 176 basin characteristics it is worth noting that ρ as the threshold was set to the highest absolute value in all the streamflow characteristics because there were only three basin characteristics with a ρ 0 5 fig s57 we set five thresholds for ρ from 0 1 to 0 5 the selected basin characteristics based on these thresholds are shown in fig s57 additionally we performed principal component analysis pca to generate uncorrelated variables of the basin characteristics which helped address the problem of multicollinearity specifically we applied the principal components to the input variables of the anns to choose the appropriate number of principal components a cumulative contribution rate of 80 is commonly adopted as a criterion e g li et al 2016 with this also applied in the present study table s9 as shown in fig 3 pca was applied after the selections based on the ρ thresholds moreover we introduced two cases to establish the input variables 1 directly using all basin characteristics i e case 1 and 2 using uncorrelated variables obtained from all basin characteristics i e case 7 we then developed 12 anns by inputting the 12 datasets as shown in fig 3 the number of hidden layers was set to two in the anns which output six streamflow characteristics qmean qd95 qd185 qd275 qd355 and wd95 when developing the anns we normalized the input variables using the min max method in order to promote faster calculations and improve the results jin et al 2015 furthermore we applied l2 regularization to the cost functions of the anns to prevent overfitting graves 2011 see supporting information we evaluated the generalization performances of the anns using a leave one out cross validation procedure which is commonly employed for the assessment of streamflow estimation in ungauged basins razavi and coulibaly 2013 the schematic diagram of this procedure is shown in fig s58 in the first step one target basin was used for testing and the others for training n 386 the training continued until the completion of 1000 iterations that learned all data in the 386 basins applied for training i e epochs 1000 the testing for one basin was also conducted in this phase by using the trained ann we note that application of an intel core i9 10885h processor base frequency 2 40 ghz resulted in a computation time of 140 s in this phase this procedure was repeated until all 387 basins had been tested we subsequently calculated the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse to obtain the generalization performance in this study we identified the hyperparameters in the anns e g the number of neurons in the hidden layers the learning rate and regularization parameter see supporting information by trial and error to maximize r2 and minimize rmse finally we identified the best performing streamflow characteristics among the 12 anns for mapping procedures 3 3 mapping streamflow characteristics the anns showing the best performances among the 12 anns for streamflow characteristics section 3 2 were then trained using all of the target basins n 387 to extract small sized basin basins with areas 10 km2 were identified throughout japan using 90 m resolution dem data lehner et al 2008 as a result 8901 basins were identified and their corresponding basin characteristics were extracted notably anthropogenic influences on streamflow were not considered in this process basin characteristic data which incorporated time variability i e indices of precipitation and snow table 1 were set to the 10 year period from 2001 to 2010 finally streamflow characteristics were estimated for all identified basins by transferring the extracted basin characteristics into the trained anns 3 4 optimal sites for run of river hydropower hydropower energy production depends on streamflow and hydraulic head basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 in particular energy production from run of river hydropower plants is directly influenced by flow duration curves as the run of river hydropower plants can use sub design streamflow for energy production see fig s56 basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 therefore the potential of the run of river hydropower developments namely the hydropower potential index hp was defined by eq 1 as follows 1 h p i w d 95 i w d 95 h i h where i denotes a target basin overbars denote the mean value in small sized basins 8901 and h is the gross head fig 4 set by calculating the difference between the minimum elevation of the basin and the minimum elevation within a 1 km radius from the basin hp in small sized basins was further estimated using the outputs of wd95 4 results 4 1 streamflow and basin characteristics the results of spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ between streamflow and basin characteristics are shown in fig 5 notably the results of basin characteristics containing subgroups i e lu geo1 geo2 geo3 soil1 soil2 and topo1 see table 1 are represented by their greatest ρ value observed ρ values were expressed as absolute values some indices contained in the subgroups did not exhibit any correlations as these indices contained no or limited existence in the target basins trends of correlations displayed a similarity among the streamflow characteristics although a lesser correlation for the low streamflow indices was observed according to mean ρ for all streamflow characteristics the five most influential basin characteristics were ai λp p soil1 corresponding to podozolic dry soil see tables s11 s16 the mean snow water equivalent on snowy days αsnow overall fig 5 shows that some climate indices namely ai λp and p demonstrated the strongest influence on predicting streamflow characteristics soil and land use indices also maintained some effects and the impacts of geology and topography were weak 4 2 anns performance fig 6 shows the results of the leave one out cross validations for the 12 anns whether the uncorrelated variables were used or not had little effect on the accuracy of the anns in addition the best performances of streamflow characteristics were observed in case 1 for qd185 qd275 qd355 and wd95 and in case 4 for qmean and qd95 table 2 shows the detailed results of the best performances the overall r2 and rmse values for the training data outperformed the testing data good generalization performances were observed for qmean qd95 qd185 and wd95 r2 0 70 the performances across qd varied significantly r2 0 47 0 84 decreasing from qd95 to qd355 normalized rmse values were also calculated using the means of observed streamflow characteristics table 2 the normalized rmse for the streamflow characteristics except qd355 were 0 50 increasing from qd95 to qd355 4 3 small sized basin streamflow maps streamflow maps in small sized basins 10 km2 are shown for qmean fig 7 as the results for all other streamflow characteristics displayed similar features to qmean see figs s59 s63 notably the displayed results in these figures correspond to geometries of the small sized basins as shown in the enlarged view in fig 7 the highest values of qmean were distributed in the heavy snowfall areas of tohoku and hokuriku facing the japan sea fig 1 a d qmean also showed high in the typhoon prone areas of kyushu shikoku and kinki facing the pacific ocean fig 1 a goldberg 2018 4 4 mapping hydropower potential index fig 8 displays the derived map of hp where maximum values were distributed around the japanese alps fig 1 b one of the highest montane areas in japan the distributions of peak hp values did not always correspond to those of heavy precipitation fig 1 c or snowfall fig 1 d the minimum hp values were located around coastal land areas due to the elevation related limitations of obtaining high gross head h compared to the results of streamflow characteristics fig 7 the distribution of hp demonstrated a high variance between basins 5 discussion 5 1 selection of basin characteristics when inputting all basin characteristics directly i e case 1 we observed relatively good performances for all streamflow characteristics in the 12 anns fig 6 this indicated that the anns showed high robustness for both disinformative input variables and multicollinearity between input variables moreover previous studies reported that anns tend to be insensitive to problems of multicollinearity de veaux and ungar 1994 obite et al 2020 which is consistent with our observation however noise in the input variables may have harmful effects on the performance to evaluate these effects we eliminated individual input variables and then compared the performance fig 9 notably we conducted this evaluation by targeting case 4 which included certain informative basin characteristics for streamflow characteristics according to fig 9 the performance was hardly changed by eliminating individual input variables which indicated that the impact of noise in the input variables was low nevertheless searching for a truly optimal subset of input variables has been shown to be np hard in the field of machine learning since there are numerous combinations of input variables that could be selected bins and draper 2001 this indicates that there is room to improve the selection of input variables in this study several methods to select the input variables have been proposed wang et al 2016 which may be helpful for improving performance in the future we found that qmean and qd95 continued to exhibit excellent performances r2 0 80 case 6 fig 6 even on application of the three most influential basin characteristics i e ai λp and p fig s57 some previous studies have applied anns to estimate annual runoff in ungauged basins mazvimavi et al 2005 beck et al 2015 barbarossa et al 2018 although most of these studies introduced p in their anns as an input variable few considered both ai and λp because ai λp and p can be obtained easily from global datasets e g zomer et al 2007 fick and hijmans 2017 hersbach et al 2020 we recommend considering the three indices when estimating annual runoff in ungauged basins using anns notably applying the three variables i e case 6 resulted in worse performance for qd355 in the 12 anns fig 6 generally low streamflow is the result of a complex combination of processes related to the climate and the catchment blöschl et al 2013 considering that the three variables comprise only climate indices they were insufficient for estimating qd355 additionally previous studies have applied anns to estimate low streamflow or baseflow index in ungauged basins mazvimavi et al 2004 beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 barbarossa et al 2018 which considers both climate and physiographic characteristics as input variables however few studies have investigated the relationship between the performances for low streamflow or baseflow index and the number of basin characteristics thus the results of the present study which reveal that increasing the number of basin characteristics improved the estimations of qd355 fig 6 can be useful for upgrading the performances of anns estimating low streamflow or baseflow index 5 2 low streamflow anns performances decreased from qd95 r2 0 84 to qd355 r2 0 47 table 2 which aligned with the results exhibiting that the influence of informative climate indices i e ai λp p on streamflow characteristics also decreased across the same range fig 5 this result suggested that there were fewer informative basin characteristics for low streamflow than for high streamflow previous studies have investigated the relationship between a low streamflow index i e qd355 and basin characteristics in japan musiake et al 1981 yokoo and oki 2010 and reported a larger impact of geology on low streamflow than climatic conditions however the results in our study did not support the above findings fig 5 the discrepancy found in previous researches likely occurred due to the selection of target basins firstly snowfall areas were excluded from their target basins to eliminate the impact of snowmelt on low streamflow secondly the ca of the target basins in their studies were larger ranging from 100 km2 in yokoo and oki 2010 to an average size of 258 km2 in musiake et al 1981 spearman s rank correlation analyses were conducted for qd355 by adjusting the thresholds of swe and ca to investigate the impact of snowfall and ca on the low streamflow observed in the present study fig 10 it was revealed that there were strong geological impacts on qd355 when targeting low swe 200 mm y 1 and large ca 200 km2 generally snowfall promotes abundant groundwater recharge via contributions from snowmelt earman et al 2006 which increases the baseflow wang et al 2015 considering the amount of snowfall in japan kazama et al 2008 the heavy snowfall areas fig 1 d can sustain high baseflow throughout the year therefore the results shown in fig 10 suggest that snowmelt contributions masked the impact of geology on low streamflow few studies have addressed the impacts of both geology and ca on low streamflow through investigating dissolved silica concentrations to detect the depth of flow paths on hillslopes uchida et al 2008 asano and uchida 2010 found a heterogeneous hydrologic response among headwater streams within a very small montane basin 5 km2 with homogeneous geology the authors inferred the existence of a ca threshold namely the representative elementary area beyond which an average hydrologic response can be found wood et al 1988 subsequently asano et al 2020 reported that baseflow specific discharge increased with ca within a small montane basin 100 km2 comprising of permeable bedrock they indicated that considerable amounts of water infiltrated the upstream bedrock and returned to surface flow downstream due to the storage discharge properties of the montane basin thus two different impacts of ca on low streamflow in small basins have been described inhibiting proper low streamflow estimation in addition the limited information available on the relationship between low streamflow and ca in small basins further complicated matters therefore future studies should aim to reveal a universal relationship using a large number of field studies from geographically diverse locations 5 3 features of streamflow estimation throughout japan the anns of beck et al 2015 achieved excellent generalization performances for the streamflow estimations of global basins e g r2 0 88 for qmean comparatively the generalization performance scores achieved for the present study were slightly inferior table 2 r2 0 85 for qmean since the aforementioned authors released their global map online their model s performance for the target basins in japan was investigated fig 11 notably some differences in the selection criteria of target basins exist in particular the authors had set the minimum discharge record to a length of 10 years five years was used for the present study and the minimum ca of 10 km2 5 km2 in this study nevertheless the performance of the model derived in this study outperformed that of beck et al 2015 when examining the japanese target basins fig 11 furthermore the other model performed poorly in japan compared to its global evaluation indicating the difficulty of streamflow estimation in this part of the world the results from this study suggest that the discrepancy arose from wind induced precipitation undercatch for snowfall and the inadequacy of rain gauge stations in high montane areas generally wind induced precipitation undercatch as estimated by rain gauge observations can reach up to 80 of snowfall amounts sevruk 1996 and some studies have investigated this process in japan yokoyama et al 2003 observed this process and fitted the observed data using an equation proposed by yoshida 1959 expressing a decrease in catch rate corresponding to wind speed although the observed data tended to follow the equation the authors reported large variations in the observed catch rate even in conditions of homogeneous wind speed masuda et al 2019 corrected the wind induced precipitation undercatch for snowfall throughout japan by applying the same equation of yoshida 1959 in order to validate the correction they analyzed the water balance at four dam basins in heavy snowfall areas although the correction improved estimates the authors still revealed an underestimation of precipitation by 20 masuda et al 2019 ultimately concluded that the primary source of error is the sparseness of rain gauge stations in high montane areas in japan the present study accounted for the effect of wind induced precipitation undercatch through the corrected data of masuda et al 2019 however the correction method was a function of wind speed yoshida 1959 which did not always reproduce the observed data yokoyama et al 2003 therefore it may be difficult to obtain the true precipitation values for these regions in japan to develop a robust method to correct the wind induced precipitation undercatch for snowfall it is important to understand the true precipitation values by measuring the thickness of the snow layer and the water content at nearby rain gauge stations in addition improvements in the spatial interpolation method of precipitation for high montane areas should be addressed in the future 5 4 optimal locations for run of river hydropower numerous studies have estimated hydropower potential at a regional cyr et al 2011 fujii et al 2017 tamm and tamm 2020 and global scale zhou et al 2015 hoes et al 2017 gernaat et al 2017 although the prediction of streamflow in ungauged basins is one of the most important factors when searching for optimal sites of hydropower developments most of the aforementioned studies failed to address this unknown factor therefore few studies have adequately tested the generalization performances of their streamflow estimation model for hydropower potential in the present study the generalization performances of the anns were tested by leave one out cross validations whose wd95 was applied to map hp in small sized basins of japan fig 8 although wd95 showed good generalization performance r2 0 79 the accuracy of the hp map is unknown we have discussed how to test the hp map below in japan the history of hydropower extends as far back as the 1880s bildirici 2019 when considering its lengthy historical context it can be assumed that the most favorable hydropower sites have already been developed therefore we can evaluate the accuracy of the hp map derived here using data from the existing hydropower stations fig 12 shows the locations and the power outputs of hydropower plants selected from nlni p03 13 dam yearbook japan dam foundation 2015 and the hydropower plant database by electric power civil engineering association https www jepoc or jp hydro notably all hydropower plants are shown except for pumped storage hydropower plants although the intent of the hp estimated was to target run of river hydropower plants favorable sites for all types of hydropower except pumped storage hydropower similarly require abundant streamflow with a high gross head geographically the density and the electric outputs of existing hydropower plants agreed with the estimations of high hp fig 8 in order to evaluate the quantitative accuracy of the hp map the relationship between mean hp and existing plant output was investigated fig 13 particularly focusing on first class basins fig 12 directly managed by the central government fig 13 shows the significant correlation between the mean hp and power output of the existing plants r2 0 67 indicating a certain level of reliability of the hp map in the same way we investigated the relationship between mean hp and existing plant output by the construction periods fig 14 the correlation coefficient peaked from 1951 to 1970 fig 14 d this can be explained by focusing on the history of electric power systems in japan considering that hydropower developments started in the 1880s in japan bildirici 2019 the period before 1910 corresponds to the early days of electric power short distance power grids between power plants and consumers were standard in this period musiake et al 1981 which indicates that the developers could not always select the optimal hydropower sites thus it is natural that there is no correlation between hp and the development in this period fig 14 a on the other hand we can see a strong correlation during 1931 1970 fig 14 c and d according to the agency for natural resources and energy 2018 the growth of power grid length peaked in the 1970s which indicates that the expansion of the power grid allowed the development of hydropower stations at more optimal sites although hydropower was the largest electricity source until the middle of 1960 the transition from hydropower to fossil or nuclear energy was relatively rapid after that bildirici 2019 this corresponds with the fact that the scale range of the developed hydroelectric outputs has been shrinking since the 1970s fig 14 e f and g in line with this our results show that the correlation coefficient also has been decreasing since the 1970s fig 14 e f and g which may reflect the fact that the optimal sites for hydropower had already been developed in 2012 the japanese government introduced the fit scheme to accelerate the development of renewable energy by offering long term contracts to renewable energy producers dong and shimada 2017 the fit increased more profitable sites for developers of hydropower than ever before accordingly we observed active developments in relatively low hp fig 14 g reflecting the impact of the fit scheme as discussed above the hp map is consistent with the history of the electric power systems in japan this fact reinforces the reliability of the hp map nevertheless hp has room for improvement as in the current version hp is only based on energy production for example it is necessary for the profitable developments to consider the energy production and economic aspects such as initial and operational costs blanco et al 2008 toyoda et al 2015 therefore future studies should introduce the hp map considering these economic aspects which will effectively accelerate the development of hydropower systems 6 conclusions the present study generated maps of streamflow in small sized basins 10 km2 throughout japan using anns to investigate the impact of selecting input variables obtained from among 176 basin characteristics on the performances of the anns we preliminarily prepared 12 anns that input different variables of basin characteristics directly inputting all basin characteristics resulted in relatively good overall performances indicating that the anns showed high robustness for disinformative input variables and multicollinearity between input variables additionally we found that increasing the number of basin characteristics improved the estimations of qd355 which can be useful for upgrading the performances of anns estimating low streamflow or baseflow index in ungauged basins according to these findings we selected the best performing streamflow characteristics among the 12 anns the performance for qmean high streamflow characteristics i e qd95 qd185 and wd95 were good although decreased performances were recorded for low streamflow characteristics due to its weaker correlations with basin characteristics according to previous studies in japan geology established a larger impact on low streamflow than climatic conditions however similar results were obtained in the present study for areas with low swe and large ca indicating that 1 snowmelt contributions mask geological impacts and 2 small ca can complicate the hydrologic response for low streamflow the difficulty of estimating streamflow in japan was also highlighted as one of the heaviest snowfall areas in the world is located in this region leading to large discrepancies arising from wind induced precipitation undercatch in addition the sparse distribution of rain gauge stations in high montane areas further contributes to the underestimation of precipitation in order to improve the model performance for japan future studies should develop robust methods for correcting wind induced precipitation undercatch and a spatial interpolation of precipitation in high montane areas nevertheless at the national level the performance of the anns derived in this study greatly outperformed that of a previous study with excellent global scale performance the present study also generated a map of hp for small sized basins in japan and accurately corresponded to spatial distributions and electrical outputs of existing hydropower plants furthermore we demonstrated that the hp map reproduces the hydropower developments corresponding to the history of electric power systems in japan which reflects the high reliability of the hp map therefore this map can greatly aid the exploration for optimal sites of run of river

3562,estimating global reservoir evaporation losses is essential for reservoir regulation operation and associated water resources management estimating globe scale reservoir evaporation losses remains a gap due to limited accessibility of global long term continuous reservoir geographic information two new datasets the global reservoir surface area dataset and the global reservoir and dam database try to address inaccessibility and provide an opportunity to bridge the gap here we used the two datasets to estimate the monthly reservoir evaporation volume of global 7242 large reservoirs from 1985 to 2016 around 339 8 km3 of water is estimated to evaporate from these large reservoirs annually during 1985 2016 and the loss amount is near 73 of the municipal water withdrawal in 2010 from 1985 to 2016 the global reservoir evaporation volume increases significantly at a rate of 2 0 km3 a and 80 of the increment is contributed by middle income countries a surge in reservoir construction in middle income countries after 1985 triggers the increment the results can benefit the regulation and operation of reservoirs and realize their role in global water conservation and management keywords reservoir evaporation water resources management global scale middle income countries 1 introduction as an ancient water storage infrastructure the reservoir has been built for 4000 years and currently there are still millions of reservoirs with an area of over 100 m2 in operation over the world assouline et al 2011 lehner et al 2011 zarfl et al 2015 reservoirs serve a pivotal role in agricultural and municipal water storage and deliveries tharme 2003 prigent et al 2012 yet the role is impacted by reservoir evaporation loss shiklomanov 2000 martínez granados et al 2011 zhan et al 2019 jansen and teuling 2020 it is estimated that annual mean reservoir evaporation loss in the united states is more than 90 of its annual public water supply zhao and gao 2019a the annual loss in china is 80 of water delivery volume for the middle route of china s water transfer project tian et al 2021 and annual loss in africa is over 80 of the water storage capacity of cahora bassa africa s fourth largest hydropower reservoir sanchez et al 2021 thus estimating reservoir evaporation loss is important in water conservation and management estimating reservoir evaporation indeed requires specific geographic information and hydro climatic data lowe et al 2009 reca et al 2015 while due to involving national and regional security it is restricted to access the geographic information of reservoirs constrained by data accessibility existing estimates of reservoir evaporation are carried out on limited temporal scales and spatial scales helfer et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2020 the spatial scale of the reservoir evaporation estimation is mainly conducted on national and regional scales as exemplified by estimations in the united states zhao and gao 2019a zhang et al 2017 china tian et al 2021 africa sanchez et al 2021 as well as some watersheds in spain alvarez et al 2008 and australia craig et al 2005 the temporal scale of the reservoir evaporation estimation is generally focused on a certain year e g craig et al 2005 rodrigues et al 2020 sanchez et al 2021 or averages in a period of time e g alvarez et al 2008 helfer et al 2012 consequently limited accessibility of global long term continuous reservoir geographic information leads to estimating global dynamic reservoir evaporation remains to be explored recently international data sharing and the development of remote sensing observations make it possible to obtain global long term continuous geographic data of reservoirs the international global water system project promotes the collation of existing geographic data of global reservoirs and shares the collation as the global reservoir and dam database grand which includes static geographic data of reservoirs such as location shape and multi year average surface area etc lehner et al 2011 this dataset has been keeping updated from version 1 1 in 2011 to 1 3 in 2019 and is widely applied in reservoir research on a global scale e g donchyts et al 2016 grill et al 2019 frederikse et al 2020 the static geographic data of global reservoirs in grand together with the lately development of remote sensing observations gave birth to a global long term continuous geographic data of reservoirs i e the global reservoir surface area dataset grsad zhao and gao 2018 the recent emerge of grand and grsad accordingly provide an opportunity to estimate global long term continuous reservoir evaporation based on grand and grsad here we estimate the global long term continuous reservoir evaporation using the penman equation such a globe scale estimation can benefit the regulation and operation of reservoirs and thus realize their role in global water conservation and management in this paper we first introduced the data and methodology in section 2 and then estimated and investigated changes of reservoir evaporation on a global scale in section 3 finally the discussion and conclusions of this paper are given in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 data used and methods 2 1 data used the surface area and basic information of the global reservoirs were provided by the global reservoir surface area dataset grsad and the global reservoir and dam database grand respectively for the surface area grsad provided the monthly data from 1985 to 2016 for basic information grand provided information on water storage capacity dam location and reservoir depth etc based on the two databases the data of 7242 reservoirs were collected the number of these reservoirs increased from 6028 to 7242 during 1985 2016 and these reservoirs are distributed in 137 countries over the world fig 1 the evaporation calculation needs four meteorological variables namely vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed u surface shortwave radiation ssr and air temperature ta monthly data of the four variables were provided by three datasets viz 1 terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 2 era5 hersbach et al 2020 3 princeton global forcings pgf sheffield et al 2006 spatial resolutions of the three datasets are 1 24 1 24 0 25 0 25 and 0 25 0 25 respectively here the temporal resolutions of the three datasets are all monthly and time ranges are all from 1985 to 2016 the reservoir is a vital infrastructure and its construction especially for large reservoirs requires huge economic investment and can also bring significant economic profit thus the number of reservoirs built in a country is closely related to the country s economic level the level could be measured by the income of the country based on the classification of countries by income of the world bank fantom and serajuddin 2016 the 137 countries in this study were divided into four groups namely high income countries upper middle income countries lower middle income countries and low income countries here the four groups include 48 42 29 and 18 countries respectively 2 2 methodology of estimation in the reservoir evaporation volume the reservoir evaporation volume is determined by the evaporation rate and surface area of the reservoir lowe et al 2009 reca et al 2015 for a single reservoir the monthly evaporation volume can be calculated as follows 1 e volume a e d 1000 where a km2 is the monthly surface area for a single reservoir which was obtained from the grsad in this study zhao and gao 2018 2019b d d is the number of days in the calculated month e mm d is the monthly evaporation rate for a single reservoir and evolume m3 is the evaporation volume for a single reservoir in the calculated month the methods to estimate the reservoir evaporation rate of open water can be classified into energy and process based models the energy based model used the surface available energy and the bowen ratio to estimate evaporation rate such as the conceptual atmospheric boundary layer model liu and yang 2021 etc the process based model includes the penman equation penman 1948 variations of the penman equation monteith 1965 priestley taylor 1972 and the pan coefficient method rotstayn et al 2006 lim et al 2012 lim et al 2013 etc the pan coefficient method uses the product of the recommended pan coefficient and measured or estimated pan evaporation rate as the reservoir evaporation rate yang and yang 2012 lim et al 2016 wang et al 2019a b and this method cannot consider the impact of water body heat storage on open water evaporation rate kişi 2006 friedrich et al 2018 zhao and gao 2019a the impact can be considered in the penman equation and its variations and these methods can be more accurately estimated the open water evaporation rate moreover the penman equation has been validated in many studies to estimate the evaporation rate of open water and this equation was used in this study to calculate the reservoir evaporation rate mcmahon et al 2013 the reservoir evaporation rate is estimated by using the sum of the radiative er and the aerodynamic ea components 2 e s r n δ u λ v s γ e r γ f u e s e a

lack of observation most studies have employed land based data as a substitute winter et al 1995 dos reis and dias 1998 mcjannet et al 2012 which may bring a biased estimation of reservoir evaporation weisman and brutsaert 1973 to reduce estimation biases the area dependent wind function based on the aerodynamic approach was developed which can directly use land based meteorological data to calculate mcjannet et al 2012 here this wind function was adopted to calculate ea 3 f u λ v 2 33 1 65 u 2 l f 0 1 where u2 m s is the wind speed measured at 2 m and lf m is the fetch length for a single reservoir the fetch length was estimated by dividing the reservoir surface area by the reservoir width the width is defined as the distance between two reservoir tangents parallel to the wind direction mcjannet et al 2012 zhao and gao 2019a a key factor of the calculation of er is the change of water body heat storage δu here the equilibrium temperature method was adopted to estimate the

of the reservoir evaporation volume calculated using era5 terraclimate and pgf as the robust estimations in this study in addition all the trends below were and tested by the two tailed mann kendall test of significance mann 1945 kendall 1975 and evaluated by the nonparametric sen s slope 3 result 3 1 significant increase in global reservoir evaporation losses here the annual global reservoir evaporation volume is the sum of the evaporation volume of all reservoirs that year during 1985 2016 the annual mean global reservoir evaporation volume was 339 8 km3 fig 2 a which is about 73 of the global municipal water withdrawal in 2010 464 km3 fao 2016 table 1 shows the ranking of the ten countries with the largest annual average reservoir evaporation volume from 1985 to 2016 the two high income countries namely canada and the united states had the largest annual average reservoir evaporation volume with values of 58 6 km3 and 43 1 km3 respectively accounting for about 30 of the annual average global reservoir evaporation volume the rest eight countries are all middle income countries including 4 upper middle income countries and 4 lower middle income countries whose total annual mean reservoir evaporation volume accounts for about 40 of the annual mean global reservoir evaporation volume from 1985 to 2016 the global reservoir evaporation volume shows a significant p 0 05 increasing trend at a rate of 2 0 km3 a and increased from 292 1 km3 to 364 0 km3 fig 2 b among the 137 countries the total reservoir evaporation volume in 29 countries shown decreasing trends with 14 countries passing the significance test p 0 05 fig 2 b these countries with decreasing trends are prominently clustered in central asia and central africa most notably in iraq which had a significant p 0 05 decreasing trend at a rate of 9 4 107 m3 a for the rest 108 countries the total reservoir evaporation volume all shown increasing trends with 81 countries passing the significance test p 0 05 among these countries brazil s increasing trend was most notably with a significant p 0 05 trend of 47 8 107 m3 a table 2 shows the ranking of the ten countries with the largest trend of reservoir evaporation volume from 1985 to 2016 eight of these ten countries are middle income countries including 6 upper middle income countries and 2 lower middle income countries 3 2 increase in reservoir surface area is the dominant driver of the increase in global reservoir evaporation volume the change in global reservoir evaporation volume was determined by changes in average evaporation rate and total surface area the change in total surface area was greatly affected by the number of the reservoir from 1985 to 2016 1264 new reservoirs 17 of total reservoirs 1264 7242 were constructed globally thus these new reservoirs could affect the change in global reservoir evaporation volume here the changes of the global reservoir evaporation volume were analyzed for two types of reservoirs i e reservoirs built before 1985 and after 1985 the total evaporation volume for the two types of reservoirs both significantly p 0 05 increased from 1985 to 2016 with rates of 0 32 km3 a and 1 70 km3 a respectively fig 3 a 85 1 70 2 01 of trend in global evaporation volume were contributed by reservoirs built after 1985 therefore the total global evaporation volume of 7242 reservoirs was mainly driven by the total evaporation volume of 1214 reservoirs built after 1985 the reservoir evaporation volume was determined by the evaporation rate and surface area of the reservoir during 1985 2016 the total surface area of the 1214 reservoirs built after 1985 significantly p 0 05 increased at a rate of 1307 2 km2 a while the mean evaporation rate insignificantly p 0 12 increased at a rate of 0 001 mm d a fig 3 the main reason for the significant increase in total evaporation of 1214 reservoirs built after 1985 was the significant increase in total surface area therefore the total global evaporation volume of 7242 reservoirs was mainly driven by the total surface area of the 1214 reservoirs built after 1985 3 3 the increase in surface area of reservoirs in the middle income countries dominates the increase in global surface area from 1985 to 2016 the total surface area of reservoirs all showed significant p 0 05 increasing trends for the four group countries namely high income countries upper middle income countries lower middle income countries and low income countries with values of 228 2 743 4 226 5 and 45 4 km2 a respectively the increase in total surface area of reservoirs of middle income countries including upper middle income and lower middle income countries accounts for 78 743 4 226 5 228 2 743 4 226 5 45 4 of the increase in total global surface area fig 4 a focus on the reservoirs built before 1985 the total surface area of the upper middle income countries during 1985 2016 significantly p 0 05 decreased at a rate of 95 9 km2 a while the total surface area of the lower middle income countries was nonsignificant p 0 40 increasing at a rate of 17 8 km2 a fig 4 b above all the total surface area of reservoirs built before 1985 in middle income countries decreased at a rate of 78 1 km2 a 95 9 17 8 focus on the reservoirs after 1985 the total surface area for the two group middle income countries namely upper middle income countries lower middle income countries both significantly p 0 05 increased from 1985 to 2016 with rates of 839 4 km2 a and 208 8 km2 a respectively fig 4 c above all the total surface area of reservoirs built after 1985 in middle income countries decreased at a rate of 1058 2 km2 a 839 4 208 8 109 1058 2 743 4 226 5 of trend in total surface area in middle income countries was contributed by reservoirs built after 1985 therefore the total surface area of middle income countries was mainly driven by the reservoirs built after 1985 above all the change of the total evaporation volume in middle income countries had a significant impact on the change of the global evaporation volume from 1985 to 2016 the increase in total evaporation volume in middle income countries accounts for 80 1 15 0 46 0 31 1 15 0 46 0 09 of the increase in global evaporation volume fig 5 a further 90 1 09 0 36 1 15 0 46 of the trend in the total evaporation volume in middle income countries was contributed by reservoirs built after 1985 fig 5 b c therefore the global evaporation volume was mainly driven by the reservoirs built after 1985 in middle income countries 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties of estimating the reservoir evaporation losses there are some uncertainties in this study first there are some uncertainties in the meteorological data used to estimate the reservoir evaporation rate the three meteorological datasets namely the terraclimate era5 and pgf were used to calculate the evaporation rate the three datasets are inconsistent on some meteorological variables for instance the average surface shortwave radiation over the 7242 reservoirs for the three datasets namely terraclimate era5 and pgf were 176 7 w m2 183 4 w m2 and 186 8 w m2 respectively the differences of meteorological variables in the three datasets resulted in different reservoir evaporation estimations the annual average global reservoir evaporation volumes calculated were 319 1 km3 336 5 km3 and 364 8 km3 during 1985 2016 for the three datasets respectively fig 6 the trends of annual global evaporation volumes were 1 92 km3 a 2 05 km3 a and 2 07 km3 a for the three datasets respectively thus to obtain a robust estimation the ensemble average of the three estimations was shown in this study second there are some uncertainties in the method used to estimate the reservoir evaporation rate generally the methods of estimating evaporation rate included energy and process based models here the process based model the penman equation incorporated with the heat storage was used which has been validated in the estimation of reservoir evaporation zhao and gao 2019a tian et al 2021 the energy based model also shows the accurate estimation in water evaporation rate such as the conceptual atmospheric boundary layer model abl liu and yang 2021 the estimation of this model in china s lake taihu shown good consistency with the measurements of the eddy covariance ec as a comparison the method in this study was used to estimate the water evaporation rate in lake taihu fig s1 the estimation also shown good consistent with the measurements of the ec r2 0 90 rmse 0 47 mm thus the uncertainty of only using the penman model to estimate the evaporation rate could be limited third the ice sublimation cannot be calculated by using the penman method for reservoir evaporation rate estimation once the ta drops below 0 c the reservoir water surface would freeze this situation usually occurs in the winter in high latitude areas 50 n and 40 s in this study there are 457 reservoirs located in the high latitude area accounting for 6 3 of the total 7242 reservoirs the reservoir evaporation estimation of these reservoirs would bring some uncertainties to global reservoir evaporation volume 4 2 comparisons with previous studies here the reservoir evaporation losses and their change for global and countries were estimated during 1984 2016 for country scale estimations zhao and gao 2019a and tian et al 2021 calculated the reservoir evaporation losses for the world s largest developed and developing countries namely the united states and china respectively they indicated that the average annual evaporation losses of 721 and 916 large reservoirs storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 were 33 7 km3 and 10 5 km3 for the two countries respectively and the trend were 6 6 107 m3 a p 0 02 and 19 6 107 m3 a p 0 01 respectively the losses estimation and their trend for the same number of reservoirs in this study are in good agreement with previous studies losses 33 7 km3 vs 34 4 km3 10 5 km3 vs 10 2 km3 trend 6 6 107 m3 a vs 5 3 107 m3 a 19 6 107 m3 a vs 20 2 107 m3 a the significant increase in total reservoir evaporation losses is mainly driven by the increase in total surface area especially in middle income countries zhan et al 2019 reported the consistent view that one of the main reasons for the increase in global water surface evaporation is the increase in the total reservoir area especially brazil and india etc mao et al 2016 illustrated that the change in total reservoir area had a significant impact on evapotranspiration trends over china in addition due to the diversion of water from the amu darya and the syr darya for agricultural irrigation in central asia micklin 1988 micklin 2014 wang et al 2018 the total water surface area was severely reduced micklin 2014 shi et al 2014 the reduction could lead to a significant decrease in reservoir evaporation losses in central asia fig 2 4 3 implications the estimation of the global reservoir evaporation losses can benefit the regional or global water resources management first the estimation can be used to calculate the available water resources for the reservoir tanny et al 2008 lowe et al 2009 khadem et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for a single reservoir the available water resources is estimated based on the water balance equation and the equation needs various variables namely inflow outflow precipitation and reservoir evaporation based on the current observation methods accurate observations can be obtained in the inflow outflow precipitation of the reservoir thus accurate estimation of reservoir evaporation can be used to calculate the available water resources of the reservoir sivapragasam et al 2009 campos 2010 lei and yang 2010 althoff et al 2019 hu and lei 2021 second reservoir evaporation estimation can be used to calculate water saving efficiency reservoir evaporation losses cannot be ignored for local water resources management especially for water resources management in semi arid and arid regions morton 1979 ali et al 2008 mady et al 2020 to reduce reservoir evaporation losses the various shelters are covered on the reservoir water surface the water saving efficiency of the shelter is an important index for selecting shelters the efficiency is calculated by dividing observed or calculated reservoir evaporation under the shelter by reservoir open water evaporation

reduction potential of the fpv can be calculated spencer et al 2019 scavo et al 2021 nagananthini and nagavinothini 2021 sanchez et al 2021 5 conclusions here the monthly reservoir evaporations during 1985 2016 for the 7242 large reservoirs over the world were estimated the annual average global reservoir evaporation volume of all reservoirs during 1985 2016 was 339 8 km3 which is about 73 of the global municipal water withdrawal in 2010 464 km3 the two high income countries namely canada and the united states have the largest reservoir evaporation volume among all countries with values of 58 6 km3 and 43 1 km3 respectively the total global reservoir evaporation volume increased significantly p 0 05 during 1985 2016 from 292 1 km3 to 364 0 km3 at a rate of 2 0 km3 a the significant increment in global reservoir evaporation volume was mainly driven by the total surface area of all reservoirs the increase in surface area of the reservoirs built after 1985 in middle income

3562,estimating global reservoir evaporation losses is essential for reservoir regulation operation and associated water resources management estimating globe scale reservoir evaporation losses remains a gap due to limited accessibility of global long term continuous reservoir geographic information two new datasets the global reservoir surface area dataset and the global reservoir and dam database try to address inaccessibility and provide an opportunity to bridge the gap here we used the two datasets to estimate the monthly reservoir evaporation volume of global 7242 large reservoirs from 1985 to 2016 around 339 8 km3 of water is estimated to evaporate from these large reservoirs annually during 1985 2016 and the loss amount is near 73 of the municipal water withdrawal in 2010 from 1985 to 2016 the global reservoir evaporation volume increases significantly at a rate of 2 0 km3 a and 80 of the increment is contributed by middle income countries a surge in reservoir construction in middle income countries after 1985 triggers the increment the results can benefit the regulation and operation of reservoirs and realize their role in global water conservation and management keywords reservoir evaporation water resources management global scale middle income countries 1 introduction as an ancient water storage infrastructure the reservoir has been built for 4000 years and currently there are still millions of reservoirs with an area of over 100 m2 in operation over the world assouline et al 2011 lehner et al 2011 zarfl et al 2015 reservoirs serve a pivotal role in agricultural and municipal water storage and deliveries tharme 2003 prigent et al 2012 yet the role is impacted by reservoir evaporation loss shiklomanov 2000 martínez granados et al 2011 zhan et al 2019 jansen and teuling 2020 it is estimated that annual mean reservoir evaporation loss in the united states is more than 90 of its annual public water supply zhao and gao 2019a the annual loss in china is 80 of water delivery volume for the middle route of china s water transfer project tian et al 2021 and annual loss in africa is over 80 of the water storage capacity of cahora bassa africa s fourth largest hydropower reservoir sanchez et al 2021 thus estimating reservoir evaporation loss is important in water conservation and management estimating reservoir evaporation indeed requires specific geographic information and hydro climatic data lowe et al 2009 reca et al 2015 while due to involving national and regional security it is restricted to access the geographic information of reservoirs constrained by data accessibility existing estimates of reservoir evaporation are carried out on limited temporal scales and spatial scales helfer et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2020 the spatial scale of the reservoir evaporation estimation is mainly conducted on national and regional scales as exemplified by estimations in the united states zhao and gao 2019a zhang et al 2017 china tian et al 2021 africa sanchez et al 2021 as well as some watersheds in spain alvarez et al 2008 and australia craig et al 2005 the temporal scale of the reservoir evaporation estimation is generally focused on a certain year e g craig et al 2005 rodrigues et al 2020 sanchez et al 2021 or averages in a period of time e g alvarez et al 2008 helfer et al 2012 consequently limited accessibility of global long term continuous reservoir geographic information leads to estimating global dynamic reservoir evaporation remains to be explored recently international data sharing and the development of remote sensing observations make it possible to obtain global long term continuous geographic data of reservoirs the international global water system project promotes the collation of existing geographic data of global reservoirs and shares the collation as the global reservoir and dam database grand which includes static geographic data of reservoirs such as location shape and multi year average surface area etc lehner et al 2011 this dataset has been keeping updated from version 1 1 in 2011 to 1 3 in 2019 and is widely applied in reservoir research on a global scale e g donchyts et al 2016 grill et al 2019 frederikse et al 2020 the static geographic data of global reservoirs in grand together with the lately development of remote sensing observations gave birth to a global long term continuous geographic data of reservoirs i e the global reservoir surface area dataset grsad zhao and gao 2018 the recent emerge of grand and grsad accordingly provide an opportunity to estimate global long term continuous reservoir evaporation based on grand and grsad here we estimate the global long term continuous reservoir evaporation using the penman equation such a globe scale estimation can benefit the regulation and operation of reservoirs and thus realize their role in global water conservation and management in this paper we first introduced the data and methodology in section 2 and then estimated and investigated changes of reservoir evaporation on a global scale in section 3 finally the discussion and conclusions of this paper are given in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 data used and methods 2 1 data used the surface area and basic information of the global reservoirs were provided by the global reservoir surface area dataset grsad and the global reservoir and dam database grand respectively for the surface area grsad provided the monthly data from 1985 to 2016 for basic information grand provided information on water storage capacity dam location and reservoir depth etc based on the two databases the data of 7242 reservoirs were collected the number of these reservoirs increased from 6028 to 7242 during 1985 2016 and these reservoirs are distributed in 137 countries over the world fig 1 the evaporation calculation needs four meteorological variables namely vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed u surface shortwave radiation ssr and air temperature ta monthly data of the four variables were provided by three datasets viz 1 terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 2 era5 hersbach et al 2020 3 princeton global forcings pgf sheffield et al 2006 spatial resolutions of the three datasets are 1 24 1 24 0 25 0 25 and 0 25 0 25 respectively here the temporal resolutions of the three datasets are all monthly and time ranges are all from 1985 to 2016 the reservoir is a vital infrastructure and its construction especially for large reservoirs requires huge economic investment and can also bring significant economic profit thus the number of reservoirs built in a country is closely related to the country s economic level the level could be measured by the income of the country based on the classification of countries by income of the world bank fantom and serajuddin 2016 the 137 countries in this study were divided into four groups namely high income countries upper middle income countries lower middle income countries and low income countries here the four groups include 48 42 29 and 18 countries respectively 2 2 methodology of estimation in the reservoir evaporation volume the reservoir evaporation volume is determined by the evaporation rate and surface area of the reservoir lowe et al 2009 reca et al 2015 for a single reservoir the monthly evaporation volume can be calculated as follows 1 e volume a e d 1000 where a km2 is the monthly surface area for a single reservoir which was obtained from the grsad in this study zhao and gao 2018 2019b d d is the number of days in the calculated month e mm d is the monthly evaporation rate for a single reservoir and evolume m3 is the evaporation volume for a single reservoir in the calculated month the methods to estimate the reservoir evaporation rate of open water can be classified into energy and process based models the energy based model used the surface available energy and the bowen ratio to estimate evaporation rate such as the conceptual atmospheric boundary layer model liu and yang 2021 etc the process based model includes the penman equation penman 1948 variations of the penman equation monteith 1965 priestley taylor 1972 and the pan coefficient method rotstayn et al 2006 lim et al 2012 lim et al 2013 etc the pan coefficient method uses the product of the recommended pan coefficient and measured or estimated pan evaporation rate as the reservoir evaporation rate yang and yang 2012 lim et al 2016 wang et al 2019a b and this method cannot consider the impact of water body heat storage on open water evaporation rate kişi 2006 friedrich et al 2018 zhao and gao 2019a the impact can be considered in the penman equation and its variations and these methods can be more accurately estimated the open water evaporation rate moreover the penman equation has been validated in many studies to estimate the evaporation rate of open water and this equation was used in this study to calculate the reservoir evaporation rate mcmahon et al 2013 the reservoir evaporation rate is estimated by using the sum of the radiative er and the aerodynamic ea components 2 e s r n δ u λ v s γ e r γ f u e s e a

lack of observation most studies have employed land based data as a substitute winter et al 1995 dos reis and dias 1998 mcjannet et al 2012 which may bring a biased estimation of reservoir evaporation weisman and brutsaert 1973 to reduce estimation biases the area dependent wind function based on the aerodynamic approach was developed which can directly use land based meteorological data to calculate mcjannet et al 2012 here this wind function was adopted to calculate ea 3 f u λ v 2 33 1 65 u 2 l f 0 1 where u2 m s is the wind speed measured at 2 m and lf m is the fetch length for a single reservoir the fetch length was estimated by dividing the reservoir surface area by the reservoir width the width is defined as the distance between two reservoir tangents parallel to the wind direction mcjannet et al 2012 zhao and gao 2019a a key factor of the calculation of er is the change of water body heat storage δu here the equilibrium temperature method was adopted to estimate the

of the reservoir evaporation volume calculated using era5 terraclimate and pgf as the robust estimations in this study in addition all the trends below were and tested by the two tailed mann kendall test of significance mann 1945 kendall 1975 and evaluated by the nonparametric sen s slope 3 result 3 1 significant increase in global reservoir evaporation losses here the annual global reservoir evaporation volume is the sum of the evaporation volume of all reservoirs that year during 1985 2016 the annual mean global reservoir evaporation volume was 339 8 km3 fig 2 a which is about 73 of the global municipal water withdrawal in 2010 464 km3 fao 2016 table 1 shows the ranking of the ten countries with the largest annual average reservoir evaporation volume from 1985 to 2016 the two high income countries namely canada and the united states had the largest annual average reservoir evaporation volume with values of 58 6 km3 and 43 1 km3 respectively accounting for about 30 of the annual average global reservoir evaporation volume the rest eight countries are all middle income countries including 4 upper middle income countries and 4 lower middle income countries whose total annual mean reservoir evaporation volume accounts for about 40 of the annual mean global reservoir evaporation volume from 1985 to 2016 the global reservoir evaporation volume shows a significant p 0 05 increasing trend at a rate of 2 0 km3 a and increased from 292 1 km3 to 364 0 km3 fig 2 b among the 137 countries the total reservoir evaporation volume in 29 countries shown decreasing trends with 14 countries passing the significance test p 0 05 fig 2 b these countries with decreasing trends are prominently clustered in central asia and central africa most notably in iraq which had a significant p 0 05 decreasing trend at a rate of 9 4 107 m3 a for the rest 108 countries the total reservoir evaporation volume all shown increasing trends with 81 countries passing the significance test p 0 05 among these countries brazil s increasing trend was most notably with a significant p 0 05 trend of 47 8 107 m3 a table 2 shows the ranking of the ten countries with the largest trend of reservoir evaporation volume from 1985 to 2016 eight of these ten countries are middle income countries including 6 upper middle income countries and 2 lower middle income countries 3 2 increase in reservoir surface area is the dominant driver of the increase in global reservoir evaporation volume the change in global reservoir evaporation volume was determined by changes in average evaporation rate and total surface area the change in total surface area was greatly affected by the number of the reservoir from 1985 to 2016 1264 new reservoirs 17 of total reservoirs 1264 7242 were constructed globally thus these new reservoirs could affect the change in global reservoir evaporation volume here the changes of the global reservoir evaporation volume were analyzed for two types of reservoirs i e reservoirs built before 1985 and after 1985 the total evaporation volume for the two types of reservoirs both significantly p 0 05 increased from 1985 to 2016 with rates of 0 32 km3 a and 1 70 km3 a respectively fig 3 a 85 1 70 2 01 of trend in global evaporation volume were contributed by reservoirs built after 1985 therefore the total global evaporation volume of 7242 reservoirs was mainly driven by the total evaporation volume of 1214 reservoirs built after 1985 the reservoir evaporation volume was determined by the evaporation rate and surface area of the reservoir during 1985 2016 the total surface area of the 1214 reservoirs built after 1985 significantly p 0 05 increased at a rate of 1307 2 km2 a while the mean evaporation rate insignificantly p 0 12 increased at a rate of 0 001 mm d a fig 3 the main reason for the significant increase in total evaporation of 1214 reservoirs built after 1985 was the significant increase in total surface area therefore the total global evaporation volume of 7242 reservoirs was mainly driven by the total surface area of the 1214 reservoirs built after 1985 3 3 the increase in surface area of reservoirs in the middle income countries dominates the increase in global surface area from 1985 to 2016 the total surface area of reservoirs all showed significant p 0 05 increasing trends for the four group countries namely high income countries upper middle income countries lower middle income countries and low income countries with values of 228 2 743 4 226 5 and 45 4 km2 a respectively the increase in total surface area of reservoirs of middle income countries including upper middle income and lower middle income countries accounts for 78 743 4 226 5 228 2 743 4 226 5 45 4 of the increase in total global surface area fig 4 a focus on the reservoirs built before 1985 the total surface area of the upper middle income countries during 1985 2016 significantly p 0 05 decreased at a rate of 95 9 km2 a while the total surface area of the lower middle income countries was nonsignificant p 0 40 increasing at a rate of 17 8 km2 a fig 4 b above all the total surface area of reservoirs built before 1985 in middle income countries decreased at a rate of 78 1 km2 a 95 9 17 8 focus on the reservoirs after 1985 the total surface area for the two group middle income countries namely upper middle income countries lower middle income countries both significantly p 0 05 increased from 1985 to 2016 with rates of 839 4 km2 a and 208 8 km2 a respectively fig 4 c above all the total surface area of reservoirs built after 1985 in middle income countries decreased at a rate of 1058 2 km2 a 839 4 208 8 109 1058 2 743 4 226 5 of trend in total surface area in middle income countries was contributed by reservoirs built after 1985 therefore the total surface area of middle income countries was mainly driven by the reservoirs built after 1985 above all the change of the total evaporation volume in middle income countries had a significant impact on the change of the global evaporation volume from 1985 to 2016 the increase in total evaporation volume in middle income countries accounts for 80 1 15 0 46 0 31 1 15 0 46 0 09 of the increase in global evaporation volume fig 5 a further 90 1 09 0 36 1 15 0 46 of the trend in the total evaporation volume in middle income countries was contributed by reservoirs built after 1985 fig 5 b c therefore the global evaporation volume was mainly driven by the reservoirs built after 1985 in middle income countries 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties of estimating the reservoir evaporation losses there are some uncertainties in this study first there are some uncertainties in the meteorological data used to estimate the reservoir evaporation rate the three meteorological datasets namely the terraclimate era5 and pgf were used to calculate the evaporation rate the three datasets are inconsistent on some meteorological variables for instance the average surface shortwave radiation over the 7242 reservoirs for the three datasets namely terraclimate era5 and pgf were 176 7 w m2 183 4 w m2 and 186 8 w m2 respectively the differences of meteorological variables in the three datasets resulted in different reservoir evaporation estimations the annual average global reservoir evaporation volumes calculated were 319 1 km3 336 5 km3 and 364 8 km3 during 1985 2016 for the three datasets respectively fig 6 the trends of annual global evaporation volumes were 1 92 km3 a 2 05 km3 a and 2 07 km3 a for the three datasets respectively thus to obtain a robust estimation the ensemble average of the three estimations was shown in this study second there are some uncertainties in the method used to estimate the reservoir evaporation rate generally the methods of estimating evaporation rate included energy and process based models here the process based model the penman equation incorporated with the heat storage was used which has been validated in the estimation of reservoir evaporation zhao and gao 2019a tian et al 2021 the energy based model also shows the accurate estimation in water evaporation rate such as the conceptual atmospheric boundary layer model abl liu and yang 2021 the estimation of this model in china s lake taihu shown good consistency with the measurements of the eddy covariance ec as a comparison the method in this study was used to estimate the water evaporation rate in lake taihu fig s1 the estimation also shown good consistent with the measurements of the ec r2 0 90 rmse 0 47 mm thus the uncertainty of only using the penman model to estimate the evaporation rate could be limited third the ice sublimation cannot be calculated by using the penman method for reservoir evaporation rate estimation once the ta drops below 0 c the reservoir water surface would freeze this situation usually occurs in the winter in high latitude areas 50 n and 40 s in this study there are 457 reservoirs located in the high latitude area accounting for 6 3 of the total 7242 reservoirs the reservoir evaporation estimation of these reservoirs would bring some uncertainties to global reservoir evaporation volume 4 2 comparisons with previous studies here the reservoir evaporation losses and their change for global and countries were estimated during 1984 2016 for country scale estimations zhao and gao 2019a and tian et al 2021 calculated the reservoir evaporation losses for the world s largest developed and developing countries namely the united states and china respectively they indicated that the average annual evaporation losses of 721 and 916 large reservoirs storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 were 33 7 km3 and 10 5 km3 for the two countries respectively and the trend were 6 6 107 m3 a p 0 02 and 19 6 107 m3 a p 0 01 respectively the losses estimation and their trend for the same number of reservoirs in this study are in good agreement with previous studies losses 33 7 km3 vs 34 4 km3 10 5 km3 vs 10 2 km3 trend 6 6 107 m3 a vs 5 3 107 m3 a 19 6 107 m3 a vs 20 2 107 m3 a the significant increase in total reservoir evaporation losses is mainly driven by the increase in total surface area especially in middle income countries zhan et al 2019 reported the consistent view that one of the main reasons for the increase in global water surface evaporation is the increase in the total reservoir area especially brazil and india etc mao et al 2016 illustrated that the change in total reservoir area had a significant impact on evapotranspiration trends over china in addition due to the diversion of water from the amu darya and the syr darya for agricultural irrigation in central asia micklin 1988 micklin 2014 wang et al 2018 the total water surface area was severely reduced micklin 2014 shi et al 2014 the reduction could lead to a significant decrease in reservoir evaporation losses in central asia fig 2 4 3 implications the estimation of the global reservoir evaporation losses can benefit the regional or global water resources management first the estimation can be used to calculate the available water resources for the reservoir tanny et al 2008 lowe et al 2009 khadem et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for a single reservoir the available water resources is estimated based on the water balance equation and the equation needs various variables namely inflow outflow precipitation and reservoir evaporation based on the current observation methods accurate observations can be obtained in the inflow outflow precipitation of the reservoir thus accurate estimation of reservoir evaporation can be used to calculate the available water resources of the reservoir sivapragasam et al 2009 campos 2010 lei and yang 2010 althoff et al 2019 hu and lei 2021 second reservoir evaporation estimation can be used to calculate water saving efficiency reservoir evaporation losses cannot be ignored for local water resources management especially for water resources management in semi arid and arid regions morton 1979 ali et al 2008 mady et al 2020 to reduce reservoir evaporation losses the various shelters are covered on the reservoir water surface the water saving efficiency of the shelter is an important index for selecting shelters the efficiency is calculated by dividing observed or calculated reservoir evaporation under the shelter by reservoir open water evaporation estimation yao et al 2010 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 third reservoir evaporation estimation can be used to estimate the evaporation reduction potential of floating photovoltaic fpv fpv system is a new power generation system that places the photovoltaic system on the reservoir surface sahu et al 2016 ranjbaran et al 2019 the system can not only generate power but also reduce evaporation from the reservoir ferrer gisbert et al 2013 santafé et al 2014 redón santafé et al 2014 based on the reservoir evaporation estimation and fpv coverage of the reservoir the evaporation reduction potential of the fpv can be calculated spencer et al 2019 scavo et al 2021 nagananthini and nagavinothini 2021 sanchez et al 2021 5 conclusions here the monthly reservoir evaporations during 1985 2016 for the 7242 large reservoirs over the world were estimated the annual average global reservoir evaporation volume of all reservoirs during 1985 2016 was 339 8 km3 which is about 73 of the global municipal water withdrawal in 2010 464 km3 the two high income countries namely canada and the united states have the largest reservoir evaporation volume among all countries with values of 58 6 km3 and 43 1 km3 respectively the total global reservoir evaporation volume increased significantly p 0 05 during 1985 2016 from 292 1 km3 to 364 0 km3 at a rate of 2 0 km3 a the significant increment in global reservoir evaporation volume was mainly driven by the total surface area of all reservoirs the increase in surface area of the reservoirs built after 1985 in middle income countries dominated the increase in global reservoir surface area the results can support the regulation and operation of reservoirs and realize their role in global water conservation and management

3563,thermal infrared tir remote sensing based et estimates are very appealing for a wide range of scientific applications in hydrology however they are prone to infrequency due to satellite revisit interval and cloud cover temporal interpolation techniques or multi resolution and multi frequency data fusion approach have thus recently been studied to provide continuous et estimates it has been already shown that the interest of temporal interpolation techniques is limited to short return interval that is troublesome in sahelian regions where mesoscale convective systems linked to the west african monsoon wam renders unusable most of tir images during the rainy season here we developed a data fusion approach to provide remote sensing based continuous daily et estimates at kilometric resolution in sahelian areas the proposed algorithm fill gaps in modis based et estimates from evaspa s sebi sahel e3s using the global land evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam product and or et estimates from a simple parametric model for typical sahelian ecosystems as a normalized basis the fusion algorithm is evaluated at the pixel scale against eddy covariance measurements and simulations of a locally calibrated and validated land surface model lsm on a millet crop and a fallow of shrubby savannah in the southwest of the republic of niger consistency of the fusion approach is also evaluated at mesoscale by comparing it with a set of 20 regional lsms globally both level of comparison highlight the very good agreement of et estimates based on the fusion approach with both in situ measurements and lsms simulations we also show the benefit of such a fusion approach compared to linear temporal interpolation techniques of the ratio between et and either incoming solar radiation or reference evapotranspiration the main benefits are observed during the first months of the rainy season in the depiction of the surface response to rainfall events and consecutive drying up of the surface soil layer we suggest that such a fusion approach could be later used in disaggregation chain to enhance field scaled et estimates by the combination of coarse moderate and high resolution remote sensing based et estimates keywords evapotranspiration data fusion e3s gleam modis sahel 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key variable in the coupled water and energy cycles it is involved in numerous biophysical and biochemical process katul et al 2012 its estimation in space and time is thus crucial for a wide range of scientific and operational applications fisher et al 2017 including understanding and forecasting global change in water jung et al 2010 marshall et al 2012 managing irrigation santos et al 2007 toureiro et al 2017 managing and forecasting severe drought events anderson et al 2016 2010 otkin et al 2016 regional water balance and groundwater monitoring olioso et al 2018 2015 ollivier et al 2021 ruggieri et al 2021 or constraining and calibrating distributed hydrological models kunnath poovakka et al 2016 schuurmans et al 2003 tobin and bennett 2017 as it is controlled by several biotic and abiotic factors et is highly variable spatially alfieri et al 2007 however in situ measurements acquired for example using lysimeters eddy correlation systems or scintillometers are only able to provide estimates at small scales 100 103 m these measurements still are essential for model calibration and validation and for biophysical process monitoring at fine spatiotemporal scale boulain et al 2009b ramier et al 2009 velluet et al 2014 although they cannot fulfill the need for et estimates at regional to continental scales in this respect remote sensing rs based approaches are promising zhang et al 2016 especially for the african continent where field measurements are scarce in particular the response of land surface temperature lst to the intensity of water stress through the surface energy balance makes this variable a key target for estimating et from space kalma et al 2008 nevertheless estimation of et from thermal infrared tir data still has limitations the main one is the intermittency of image acquisition at moderate and high resolutions which hinders the feasibility of continuous monitoring of et intermittent acquisition is due both to the revisit frequency of the satellite which is governed by its orbital configuration and to cloud cover occurrence alfieri et al 2017 guillevic et al 2019 lagouarde et al 2013 this last point is particularly critical in west africa where climate is governed by a monsoon regime characterized by mesoscale convective systems that make many of the tir images acquired during the rainy season not usable allies et al 2020 showed that despite having a daily return interval modis tir images availability did not exceed 6 images per month on average during the rainy season in four years of data over south west niger little studies have so far focused on the reconstruction of et between two dates with suitable acquisition in most cases a simple linear interpolation of the ratio between et and a known reference quantity is performed alfieri et al 2017 delogu et al 2021 guillevic et al 2019 lagouarde et al 2010 this quantity can be the incoming solar radiation rg gallego elvira et al 2013 the extra terrestrial solar radiation guillevic et al 2019 ryu et al 2012 or the reference evapotranspiration et0 cammalleri et al 2013 other interpolation methods were proposed e g cubic and hermite spline but proved to be less reliable than the linear method alfieri et al 2017 the interpolation supports should carry information on variations in the drivers of et between two acquisition dates et drivers are essentially related to available energy or to water availability available water for plants and soil evaporation most supports commonly used so far provide information only on energy constraints in relation to solar radiation or on atmospheric water demand in the case of et0 linear interpolation based on et0 or rg cannot account for variations in et related to other drivers than rg or et0 among unaccounted for effects are e g i the impact of re humectations related to water supplies occurring between acquisition days ii the evolution of vegetation cover iii the non linearity of the drying kinetic of soil top layers and iv the non linear responses of stomatal conductance to soil moisture and atmospheric demand this is all the more important as the time between two successive available et data is long alfieri et al 2017 and delogu et al 2021 showed that the interest of these basic temporal interpolation schemes was limited to short return intervals of less than 8 days in order to improve interpolation it may be possible to use variables that more closely follow et variations it is not required that these estimations are fully accurate but they need to respond to more et drivers than only rg or et0 and in particular to precipitation and drying kinetics delogu et al 2021 showed that the inclusion of additional information related to the timing of rainfall events may help in improving the monitoring of daily et this is particularly true in the sahel where soil drainage is fast and the response of surface is abrupt after each rainfall event lohou et al 2014 considering the limitations of temporal interpolation schemes techniques of multiple data source fusion are attractive as they take advantage of information provided by several datasets cammalleri et al 2013 gao et al 2006 li et al 2017 the use of multi resolution et products is interesting to fill gaps in moderately or highly spatially resolved products with temporal information contained in coarser ones for instance cammalleri et al 2013 adapted the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm which was originally developed for generating a synthetic daily surface reflectance product at landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm spatial resolution by gao et al 2006 to produce continuous landsat like daily et images using temporal series of modis images starfm was later applied and evaluated in various eco climatic conditions cammalleri et al 2014 gevaert and garcía haro 2015 semmens et al 2016 wang et al 2014 other algorithms have been proposed to produce fine scale et maps from landsat modis data fusion algorithms based on upstream lst disaggregation eswar et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 simple linear regression bhattarai et al 2015 or machine learning ke et al 2017 nonetheless if such data fusion techniques are engaging to produce field scale et estimates they are prone to modis data gaps due to cloud cover and data quality restricting the reconstruction of daily et maps thus in order to reconstruct continuous daily et time series modis et estimates need to be temporally interpolated in a first step generally linear interpolation of an et reference quantity ratio were used cammalleri et al 2013 ma et al 2018 a similar interpolation scheme was used by gallego elvira et al 2013 and olioso et al 2018 to reconstruct sequences of daily et from modis data as modis data are coming with a daily revisit one may think that such a simple interpolation procedure is sufficient however in many situations as the monsoon season in sahelian regions for example the cloud occurrence can significantly increase and drastically reduce the number of available et estimates allies et al 2020 the fusion of modis estimates with other information having a daily time step or finer can be proposed for improving the production of continuous et estimates it might be possible to use information such as surface variables in weather forecast model reanalysis simulations of distributed water balance model fed by remote sensing data e g gleam miralles et al 2011 or results from land data assimilation systems e g albergel et al 2017 the objective of the present study is to evaluate the capability of a new approach using multiple et data sources to fill gaps between daily et maps generated with remote sensing techniques it is based on a new fusion methodology that makes it possible to derive continuous daily evapotranspiration maps at 1 km resolution by combining intermittent et estimates from modis data to continuous et monitoring obtained at 0 25 resolution from the gleam product this method uses et interpolation supports that account for rainy events and drying kinetics both at mesoscale thanks to the gleam data and at the kilometer scale thanks to a developed simple et parametric model named pameas parametric model for evapotranspiration in the agropastoral sahel in our work the high resolution et maps were produced using the evaspa s sebi sahel e3s approach from modis tir and albedo data which has shown very good performances over south west niger allies et al 2020 however the proposed methodology could be used with any et mapping and daily mesoscale estimation of et together with a surface water balance model the benefits of the data fusion approach were evaluated against standard interpolation schemes to do so et estimates from either the fusion approach or the interpolation schemes were evaluated at field scale against in situ observations acquired on two typical ecosystems of the agropastoral sahel and at mesoscale against ensemble simulations with land surface models lsms this region is characterized by long periods without usable remote sensing optical data due to heavy cloud cover during the rainy season to our knowledge this study is the first to deal with the complex issue of the continuous estimation of daily evapotranspiration from tir images in the sahel potentially giving useful information for worldwide areas with long periods of cloudiness this paper is structured as follows materials and methods are introduced in section 2 the study area is firstly presented section 2 1 followed by the data sets used in fusion and interpolation approaches section 2 2 and the data sets used for the evaluation of the fusion and interpolation schemes section 2 3 the methodology employed is then detailed in section 2 4 results are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 a general conclusion is finally given in section 5 2 materials and methods the fusion method was applied on 4 years 2005 2008 of data at mesoscale in south west niger where surface flux observations were collected by the amma catch national observation service nos galle et al 2018 at two micrometeorological flux towers in a millet crop and a fallow of shrubby savannah the two main land cover types in the region cappelaere et al 2009 the accuracy of daily evapotranspiration retrievals using e3s was previously evaluated at the same site over the 2005 2008 period allies et al 2020 in the present study the data fusion approach is evaluated at field scale against in situ surface energy balance measurements ramier et al 2009 velluet et al 2014 and simulations with a physically based calibrated validated land surface model lsm named sispat simple soil plant atmosphere transfers velluet et al 2014 it is also evaluated at mesoscale by comparison with the simulations from a set of 20 spatially distributed lsms selected in the framework of the almip2 intercomparison exercise boone et al 2009 grippa et al 2017 2 1 study area the study area is located in the southwest of the republic of niger fig 1 a it consists of a mesoscale window 1 55 3 15 e 12 85 14 15 n covering an area of 20 800 km2 included in the amma catch nos it is located in the agropastoral sahel characterized by a tropical semiarid climate with rainfall ranging from 570 mm to 470 mm along a south north gradient and with mean temperature of 30 c cappelaere et al 2009 climate is governed by the west african monsoon wam with a long dry season from november to april followed by a rainy season characterized by mesoscale convective systems the study area is approximately centered on niger s capital city of niamey and it is crossed both by the niger river western part and by the dallol bosso fossil river valley eastern part see fig 1b the main ecosystems of the area are typical of the agropastoral sahel alternating between rainfed millet crop and fallow of shrubby savannah cappelaere et al 2009 leblanc et al 2008 fig 1b remains of tiger bush are also observed especially over plateau areas irrigated orchards and gardens are scattered along the niger river nearby urban areas in particular in the outskirts of niamey regarding soils and hydrology the northern and the eastern parts of the study area are characterized by endoreic catchments with sandy soils weakly structured with sand fraction superior to 75 and even above 85 in the niger river and dallol bosso valleys the latter is characterized by intermittent seasonal flow and pounding during the rainy season and often maintaining subsurface water the rest of the year leduc et al 1997 the right bank of the niger river is characterized by loamier soils and is less prone to surface crusting the two main reference plots of the amma catch niger mesosite are located in between the two above alluvial valleys near the wankama village at about 60 km northeast of niamey 2 6 e 13 6 n fig 1c these two plots of 15 ha each have been intensively instrumented since 2005 cappelaere et al 2009 the monitored ecosystems are the two dominant ecosystems in the study area a pearl millet crop pennisetum glaucum l r br and a fallow composed of patches of a shrub layer dominated by guiera senegalensis lam annual c3 and c4 grasslands and bare soils boulain et al 2009a ramier et al 2009 no alternation between millet crop and fallow was observed during the studied ground measurements period 2005 2008 data acquired in the plots are described in the next section 2 3 1 2 2 data sets used in fusion and interpolation approaches 2 2 1 e3s e3s evaspa s sebi sahel is a contextual rs based method for daily et mapping designed to minimize the use of ancillary meteorological data and provide comprehensive epistemic uncertainty of daily et retrievals for sahelian areas allies et al 2020 it is based on the evapotranspiration assessment from space evaspa rs based modelling tool gallego elvira et al 2013 and the simplified surface energy balance index s sebi method roerink et al 2000 s sebi derives et from the evaporative fraction ef computed from surface temperature lst and surface albedo α of a given satellite scene as follows 1 ef l s t α i lst dry α i lst i lst dry α i lst wet α i where subscript i correspond to a given pixel of a the satellite scene associated with an αi albedo value and a lsti surface temperature value lstdry and lstwet correspond to fully dry ef 0 and fully wet ef 1 areas respectively between which ef is assumed to vary linearly fig 2 comparatively to s sebi e3s computes at each satellite overpass time the evaporative fraction by considering 17 methods for the determination of the edges of the lst α shape et derived using the different edges determination methods were averaged to provide an ensemble mean of et the average procedure of the 17 et estimates considered weighting coefficients that were derived according to the seasonal stage of rainfall and lai see allies et al 2020 for details the variability of et estimates was also used to derive an estimation of uncertainty in the derivation of et in this work we use daily et from 2005 to 2008 derived from e3s using lst and surface albedo from modis onboard terra and aqua as well as incoming longwave and shortwave radiations from flux towers measurements as described by allies et al 2020 e3s was already evaluated at the time of satellite overpass and at the daily scale against the data from the two eddy covariance towers before gap filling and against the sispat simulations by allies et al 2020 in average length of gaps in modis based e3s et estimates are about 10 3 13 5 days and are mainly due to cloud contamination 2 2 2 gleam gleam global land evaporation the amsterdam methodology is a global daily et product at a 0 25 resolution it is developed by the vu university of amsterdam miralles et al 2011 and it is designed to maximize the use of satellite derived observations in combination to climatic re analysis data gleam derives et at each grid cell using a priesley taylor model for computing potential evapotranspiration and several stress factors for reducing this potential evapotranspiration stress factors depend on the vegetation moisture derived from microwave emission measurements and on soil moisture simulated by a 3 layers soil module microwave information is also used for correcting the soil module through a simple data assimilation procedure the version of the product used in this work is the v3 1 a martens et al 2017 it is forced with radiation fluxes and atmospheric temperature from era interim dee et al 2011 precipitations from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation dataset mswep beck et al 2017 and microwave surface soil moisture from the esa climate change initiative soil moisture esa cci sm v2 3 data set liu et al 2012 wagner et al 2012 the version 3 1 a of gleam has been recently validated against measurements from 91 eddy covariance towers and 2325 soil moisture sensors martens et al 2017 2 2 3 pameas 2 2 3 1 description of the model pameas parametric model for evapotranspiration in the agropastoral sahel is a simple parametric model developed in the framework of this study to derive et from incoming solar radiation rg rainfall r and leaf area index lai only for typical sahelian ecosystems pameas computes separately soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t both as a multiplicative function of rg xu and singh 2000 t mm day 1 is simulated under no stressed conditions as a simple function of rg 2 t ρ 2 f cover rg λ where ρ2 is a calibrated parameter λ the latent heat of vaporization 28 4 w m 2 and fcover the fraction of vegetation cover pameas assumes that the vegetation is not facing water stress in other words pameas only provides a potential transpiration temporal variations of t are thus only due to incident solar radiation fluctuations resistance terms being negligible fcover is derived from lai according a beer lambert law 3 f cover 1 e 0 5 l a i for soil evaporation e mm day 1 pameas accounts for the fraction cover by considering the uncovered soil fraction 1 fcover and for a stress function depending on the soil water content as approximated by the antecedent precipitation index api kohler and linsley 1951 4 e ρ 1 1 f cover rg λ cos π 2 swc fc

capacity api mm the calibrated antecedent precipitation index and ρ1 a calibrated parameter the π 2 term ensures the normalization of the stress factor between 0 stressed and 1 not stressed a cosine function is used to describe a non linear evolution of the water stress with the decrease of the surface soil layer water content as proposed by merlin et al 2016 2010 fig 3 the soil water content at field capacity is derived from the sand and clay fraction according to saxton et al 1986 5 swc fc 100 1 3 a 1 b 6 a e 4 396 7 15 10 2 f clay 4 88 10 4 f sand 2 7 b 3 14 2 22 10 3 f clay 2 3 484 10 5 f sand 2 f clay where fclay and fsand are the soil fraction of clay and sand respectively api is computed according the following formulation 8 ap i d a p i d 1 e 1 ω 1 ω 2 r d with the subscript d for the considered day ω1 et ω2 parameters calibrated on field measurements of the 0 10 cm soil water content and r mm daily rainfall finally pameas computes et from the sum of soil evaporation e and canopy transpiration t appendix c describes the calibration of the pameas model against sispat simulations at field scale over the 2005 2012 period sispat model was used to develop and calibrate pameas at field scale because it allows to separate soil evaporation from canopy transpiration 2 2 3 2 spatial distribution of the model pameas was spatialized using sand and clay fractions from ecoclimap2 kaptué tchuenté et al 2011 precipitation fields derived from rain gauge data over the observational network using krigged lagrangian spatial interpolation method as for almip2 lsms vischel et al 2011 lai from modis data mcd15a3 product and incoming solar radiation from flux towers measurements considering that spatial variations were negligible over the study site allies et al 2020 rainfall and radiation fields were given at daily timescale modis lai product was a 4 days composite that was previously interpolated using a cubic spline function pameas simulations were finally released at the same resolution as modis 1 km two versions of pameas were considered in the first one pameas parameters ρ1 ρ2 ω1 ω2 were simultaneously calibrated on et time series derived with e3s over the 2005 2008 period for each pixel to this end about 104 800 simulations were performed with pameas considering a priori parameters intervals the best parameter set for each pixel was selected considering minimal root mean square error rmse alternately in the second pameas version only ρ1 and ρ2 were calibrated against e3s et maps api parameters ω1 ω2 were calibrated on soil moisture simulated by sispat at both flux tower sites see appendix c and they were considered as uniforms over the whole mesoscale study site api fields were generated for both cover types millet and fallow and then averaged to generate a single value to use in pameas this simplification allowed a strong reduction in the number of simulations and consequently in computing time as only the two flux tower sites were used for calibrating api parameters we expect that the spatial representativeness of soil evaporation simulated by pameas will be affected conversely we expect that this version will make it possible to evaluate pameas performance in more details at local scale calculation made with this second pameas version were named by adding the subscript lc for local calibration to the fusion method name e g egplc 2 2 4 incoming solar radiation rg and reference evapotranspiration et0 fields the developed fusion algorithm is compared to standard temporal interpolation techniques based on the linear interpolation of the ratio between et and rg or et0 to this end rg fields were generated using the average between measurements from both millet and fallow ec stations considering that spatial variations were negligible over the study site similarly et0 was computed as in allen et al 1998 using rg air temperature air relative humidity and wind speed from the average of millet and fallow plots measurements 9 e t 0 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 m e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 m where rn mj m 2 day 1 is the net radiation tmean c is the mean daily air temperature u2m m s 1 is the wind

evaluation data sets 2 3 1 eddy covariance measurements the two reference local plots of the amma catch nos were equipped for continuous monitoring of meteorological variables rainfall air pressure temperature and humidity wind speed and direction four component radiations and soil variables shallow ground heat flux temperature and moisture profiles down to a depth of 2 5 m eddy covariance ec systems were also implemented measuring high frequency 20 hz wind speed 3 components air temperature and water vapor to derive sensible and latent heat flux estimates see table 1 turbulent fluxes were derived as described by ramier et al 2009 using edire software r clement university of edinburgh and following carboeurope recommendations mauder and foken 2004 full details of the setup and the sensors can be found in ramier et al 2009 and velluet et al 2014 several studies already exploited the data acquired or derived from these plots boulain et al 2009b lohou et al 2014 marshall et al 2013 ramier et al 2009 sjöström et al 2013 velluet et al 2014 in our study for purpose of comparison with rs based daily et estimates gaps in eddy covariance based latent heat flux measurements were filled according to the climatological method proposed by velluet 2014 see appendix a only days with less than one third of the data being gap filled were used in this study on the overall studied period only 3 5 and 4 3 of 30 min latent heat measurements were gap filled with this method for the millet crop and the fallow respectively after this gap filling step the energy balance at the daily scale revealed a slight imbalance of 0 7 w m 2 and 13 8 w m 2 for the millet crop and the fallow respectively after gap filling we disposed of 1149 days of observation 312 days being missing 2 3 2 sispat simulations the simple soil plant atmosphere transfers sispat model is a physical based lsm able to simulate the coupled heat and water exchanges at the soil plant atmosphere interface braud et al 1995 both energy budgets from the vegetation canopy and the soil surface are solved using a classical electrical analogy in a two layer system the sispat model was previously thoroughly calibrated and validated by velluet et al 2014 for the 7 years period 2005 2012 against the energy balance and the soil moisture data acquired on the millet crop site and the fallow of shrubby savannah site model skill scores against observed half hourly energy balance components can be found in velluet et al 2014 and allies et al 2020 globally scores were very good for both ecosystems rmse 30 wm 2 for millet and rmse 40 wm 2 for fallow considering uncertainty relative to such observations this suggests that sispat simulations may be considered as reliable proxies of the local plots fluxes with the benefit of no gaps allowing more complete evaluation at pixel scale note that sispat simulations were already used to evaluate non interpolated e3s et estimates in south west niger allies et al 2020 2 3 3 almip2 land surface model simulations the amma land surface model intercomparaison project phase 2 almip2 boone et al 2009 is dedicated to identify current weaknesses in lsms representation of surface land processes among 20 models at local and mesoscale in west africa models simulations were performed at 30 min timescale on the mesoscale site with a 0 05 grid during the 2005 2008 period the 20 almip2 models are listed in appendix a all models were forced with precipitation fields derived from rain gauge data over the observational network using krigged lagrangian spatial interpolation method vischel et al 2011 incoming longwave and shortwave radiations came from the satellite application facility for land surface analysis land saf project trigo et al 2011 whereas all other meteorological forcing variables including air temperature near surface specific humidity wind speed and surface atmospheric pressure came from ecmwf era interim re analysis dee et al 2011 most of the models used the ecoclimap2 africa database kaptué tchuenté et al 2011 to derive soil and vegetation characteristics including lai nevertheless some of them had their own formulations or specific data for some variables see grippa et al 2017 for more details in this study we used the ensemble average and standard deviation of lsms simulations in term of spatial mean over our study site as a basis of comparison at mesoscale 2 4 methodology the methodology used is exposed in fig 4 and detailed in the following subsections 2 4 1 formulation of an interpolation methodology continuous estimation of et was obtained by filling the gaps between remote sensing estimations we implemented first the two most classical methods based on the linear interpolation of the ratio r of et to an interpolation support b that is either the incoming solar radiation rg or the reference evapotranspiration et0 et for a missing day t is calculated as 10 et t r t b t with 11 r t r t k r t k 1 r t k t t k t k 1 t k tk and tk 1 with tk t tk 1 corresponding to the days of the previous and the next available observations an interpolation method that more closely follow et variations is proposed in a second step it uses alternative estimation of et that are available at the daily time step either from other et products here the gleam product a parametric modeling of et here the pameas model or a combination of both the procedure is inspired by linear filtering methods considering incremental evolution of et in this case et estimation for day t is obtained by incrementing et obtained at the previous date t 1 considering the change in b from day t 1 to day t 12 e t t e t t 1 w b t b t b t 1 where wb is a scaling factor accounting for the ratio between et and b for day tk corresponding to the day with the last available observation of et et tk wb is computed as follow 13 w b t k e t t k b t k on day t wb t is obtained by interpolating linearly wb t as r t in eq 11 a mathematical safeguard is implemented when b tk tends towards 0 another formulation is proposed when considering several interpolation drivers b for two drivers b1 and b2 14 e t t e t t 1 w b 1 t b 1 t b 1 t 1 w b 2 t b 2 t b 2 t 1 gains wb1 t and wb2 t are to be defined from the evolution and or the proximity of et to b1 and b2 they are defined as weighting coefficients between the two sources of interpolation information b1 and b2 considering that et should be better interpolated by the closest interpolation driver on day tk they are written as 15 w b 1 t k 1 ε b 1 t k ε b 1 t k ε b 2 t k 16 w b 2 t k 1 ε b 2 t k ε b 1 t k ε b 2 t k with 17 ε b 1 t k e t t k b 1 t k 18 ε b 2 t k e t t k b 2 t k on day t wb1 t and wb2 t are obtained by linear interpolation between days tk and tk 1 as r t in eq 11 both wb1 t and wb2 t account for the proximity of b1 and b2 to et in cases bi is inter calibrated with et εbi tk should be small 2 4 2 implementation scheme in our study we tested the approach to interpolate et maps based on the fusion eq 14 this paragraph outlines the algorithm used and the justification of each step the different data set and models have been already presented in detail in section 2 2 2 4 2 1 calculation of et step 1 calculation of et maps with e3s see section 2 2 1 for each date tk at which land surface temperature and spectral reflectance are available from modis original products step 2 application of the fusion algorithm to generate et maps on days without e3s estimates two interpolation supports are used the gleam operational product which provides estimation of et every day at 0 25 resolution et is computed using a water balance model fed by remote sensing data and meteorological reanalysis see section 2 2 2 the advantages of gleam are its spatial resolution which allows capturing mesoscale information on rain and its heavy use of remote sensing data in particular the assimilation of microwave radiometer data that enables close monitoring of surface water status estimates of daily et at 1 km resolution using pameas see section 2 2 3 the advantage of pameas lies in its parametric form driven by the antecedent precipitation index api representing soil drying kinetics concerning the impact of vegetation on et pameas is driven by the evolution of fcover as estimated by modis data step 2 1 pameas is calibrated for each pixel at 1 km resolution p1km over the time series of et maps provided by e3s using modis data four scaling parameters one for transpiration one for evaporation and two for the soil drying curve shape are computed for each pixel see section 2 2 3 step 2 2 gleam g25km is disaggregated at 1 km resolution g1km on the basis of et spatial distribution simulated by pameas p1km p25km p25km being the aggregation of pameas at 25 km spatial resolution 19 g 1 k m t p 1 k m t p 25 k m t g 25 k m t step 2 3 eq 14 is applied at 1 km resolution with e3s et disaggregated gleam b1 g1km and calibrated pameas b2 p1km leading to the fusion between e3s gleam and pameas fusion egp as follow 20 e t t e 3 s t 1 w g t g 1 k m t g 1 k m t 1 w p t p 1 k m t p 1 k m t 1 2 4 2 2 evaluation of the fusion method three sets of data are used for the evaluation of the fusion approach ground measurements of et at one millet field and one fallow site see section 2 3 1 and simulations of the simple soil plant atmosphere transfers sispat model thoroughly calibrated and validated against field observations which both permitted an evaluation at local scale see section 2 3 2 spatially distributed

computed for interpolated days and rsmee3s is the intrinsic rmse of the e3s product which is computed during non interpolated days 3 results all the fusion and interpolation approaches were applied on the study area over the 2005 2008 period the results were analyzed both at local scale against field measurements and sispat simulations section 3 1 and at mesoscale in terms of spatial average against almip2 lsms simulations section 3 2 3 1 evaluation at local scale 3 1 1 comparison of interpolation and fusion approaches in this subsection comparison of the continuous daily et estimates obtained after each interpolation or fusion approach against in situ measurements and sispat simulations is analyzed overall skill scores of this analysis are summarized in table 2 and illustrated in fig 5 the main results provided by table 2 can be summarized as follows the performances of each method were acceptable rmse ranging between 0 59 and 0 76 mm day 1 the new interpolation method based on the fusion of e3s gleam and pameas egp provided the best agreement with ground data and sispat simulations as shown by rmse 0 59 0 68 mm day 1 nse 0 78 0 84 and r2 0 78 0 85 values in table 2 actually the three statistical metrics always provided a similar ranking of the methods so that only rmse will be used in the rest of this section the standard interpolation methods based on the interpolation of the ratio of et to rg or et0 had the lowest performance in particular in the case of et0 rmse 0 74 0 76 mm day 1 remember that these interpolation supports are mainly driven by radiation information and no direct information on precipitation events and drying dynamic were used the fusion methods using pameas as only interpolation support ep had intermediary performances rmse 0 65 0 71 mm day 1 while the use of gleam alone eg was providing performance similar as et0 rmse 0 73 0 75 mm day 1 remember that in this case gleam data were used at their native 0 25 resolution the local calibration of api parameters on sispat simulations improved the interpolations based on the fusion using pameas fusion egplc and fusion eplc in comparison to the direct calibration of api parameters on e3s estimates fusion egp and fusion ep see fig 5 all the methods except fusion eg in comparison to sispat simulations underestimated et with biases between 0 01 mm day 1 and 0 11 mm day 1 which resulted in underestimations between 4 and 45 mm year 1 no clear differences existed between the methods excepted that the local calibration of api provided lower bias than the calibration of api against e3s data and that biases for fusion ep were at least twice larger than for any other method 0 11 mm day 1 the most obvious benefits of the fusion approach between e3s gleam and or pameas compared to classical interpolation methods were observed during the first months of the rainy season may june while images frequency was low and soil drying up was fast fig 5 shows that the fusion approach is more able to reproduce surface response to the first rainfall events and consecutive drying up between two e3s estimates even if the amplitude of et variations were not always correct one can also observed that local calibration of pameas api parameters allows better depicting the impacts of rainfall events and of soil drying up in the core of the monsoon season august september most of the differences between interpolation methods on the retrieval of et was concentrated within the monsoon season during the dry season et was low and not subject to strong variations whatever the interpolation method rmse were in the order of 0 30 mm day 1 when considering the comparison to sispat simulations and in the order of 0 35 mm day 1 when considering ground observations biases were slightly positive in general lower than 0 05 mm day 1 not shown during the monsoon season the number of available images was low about 6 images per month in average compared to the dry season implying a large number of interpolated data periods of up to 20 days had sometimes to be reconstructed during this season rmse ranged between 0 84 and 1 21 mm day 1 which was significantly higher than over the entire study period note that the ranking of the methods was similar as for the entire period in table 2 negative biases were always larger than 0 1 mm day 1 and up to 0 5 mm day 1 depending on the interpolation method part of these biases came from an underestimation of et by e3s itself see table 4 and allies et al 2020 for more details 3 1 2 evaluation of interpolated et versus e3s estimates in order to evaluate the performance of the interpolation methods tables 3 and 4 and fig 6 present separated evaluations of et retrievals obtained i for days with available remote sensing data with e3s table 4 and blue points in fig 6 and ii for interpolated et between available e3s estimates table 3 and red points in fig 6 the impact of the interpolation procedure on the performance of the interpolation was evaluated through rmseint see eq 24 the differential rmse between the errors related to e3s rmsee3s and the errors calculated on interpolated data rmseint data rmsee3s 0 47 0 46 mm day 1 were strongly lower than the overall values of rmse presented in table 2 the impact of the interpolation procedure was either of similar magnitude rmseint between 0 43 and 0 58 for fusion egp and fusion egplc or larger up to 0 69 mm day 1 for interpol et0 the observation of the differences between the bias for e3s and the bias for the interpolated data indicated that the interpolation methods generally induce some underestimations in particular when the evaluation is performed against sispat simulations this underestimation was larger for fusion ep 0 13 mm day 1 and in general more limited for fusion egp and fusion eg the local calibration of api fusion egplc and fusion eplc was also reducing both bias and rmseint generated by the interpolation procedures 3 1 3 residual error analysis of et estimates residual errors εet predicted et sispat et for each fusion or interpolation method are computed at the wankama pixel scale the distributions of εet against standard deviation of sispat simulated et between two consecutive e3s estimates are shown in fig 7 the boxplots show for each approach the interquartile range of εet for the ranges of sispat standard deviation one can observe that εet interquartile range globally increases when the sispat standard deviation increases for low standard deviation 0 05 mm day 1 between two consecutive e3s estimates εet is still low 0 4 mm day 1 εet 0 9 mm day 1 for every fusion or interpolation method and no significant differences in εet distribution is observed between them all of them also show a εet slightly positively skewed for sispat standard deviation less than 0 05 mm day 1 for the range 0 05 0 5 mm day 1 of sispat standard deviation the εet distribution is quite symmetric for each interpolation and fusion method even if interpol rg and interpol et0 both show an underestimation trend for values outside the whiskers range fig 7f and g main differences in the distribution of εet between fusion and interpolation methods are observed for sispat standard deviation greater than 0 5 mm day 1 for such values both interpol rg and interpol et0 generally display a larger interquartile range than all of the fusion approaches for these interpolation methods the distribution of εet is negatively skewed for standard deviation ranges 0 5 1 and 1 1 5 mm day 1 and rather positively skewed for standard deviation greater than 1 5 mm day 1 fig 7f and g fusion eg shows a symmetric εet distribution for standard deviation range 0 5 1 mm day 1 negatively skewed for range 1 1 5 mm day 1 and slightly positively skewed for standard deviation 1 5 mm day 1 fig 7e fusion ep is characterized by a negatively skewed εet distribution for ranges 0 5 1 and 1 1 5 mm day 1 and symmetric for standard deviation 1 5 mm day 1 fig 7c fusion egp shows a negatively skewed εet distribution for ranges 0 5 1 and 1 1 5 mm day 1 and a positively skewed distribution for standard deviation 1 5 mm day 1 fig 7a one can observe that the local calibration of pameas api parameters reduces the εet interquartile range and generally also reduces the skewness of the εet distribution fig 7b and d indeed fusion egplc and fusion eplc clearly show a lower dispersion of εet as well as an average of εet close to 0 this confirms better performances of locally calibrated fusion approaches as shown in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 3 2 evaluation at mesoscale in this subsection comparison of the continuous daily et estimates obtained after each interpolation or fusion approach against ensemble average of almip2 lsms simulations is analyzed the comparison was done by considering spatial averages over the whole almip2 domain 20 800 km2 overall skill scores of this analysis are summarized in table 5 and illustrated in figs 8 and 9 many results of the mesoscale comparison were in line with those obtained at local scale on the wankama pixel table 5 the best performances were obtained with the fusion method using both gleam and pameas information egp the standard interpolation procedures rg and et0 had the lowest performances the fusion method based on pameas only had intermediary performance whereas the one based on gleam only showed quite similar results as those obtained with dual source fusion approaches main benefits of the fusion approach fusion egp and fusion egplc was observed during the first months of the rainy season fig 9 in the depiction of drying up phases between two consecutive rainfall events drying up amplitude and timing showing the interest of interpolation supports including information on either rainfall or surface soil moisture fields the main discrepancies between retrieved et and almip2 lsms occurred during the monsoon season and were characterized by a significant underestimation there were however significant differences rmse were significantly lower e g 0 46 for fusion egp to be compared to 0 64 0 68 at local scale the local calibration of pameas api parameters fusion egplc and fusion eplc had low impact on the performance see fig 8 and table 5 remember that in this case the api parameters obtained by calibration against sispat simulations over the millet field and the fallow were used all over the studied domain but tended to positively increase the bias no clear trend existed for the bias value versus the interpolation method the direct impact of the interpolation procedure rmseint table 6 was always larger than the errors generated by the application of e3s table 7 the difference was only slight when considering e3s gleam and pameas together rmsee3s 0 31 mm day 1 rmseint 0 35 0 38 mm day 1 but it increased when considering other methods and in particular standard interpolation with rg rmseint 0 56 mm day 1 and even worse for et0 0 63 mm day 1 for the latter the interpolation procedure was responsible of two thirds of the difference between rs based et estimates and almip2 lsms simulations 4 discussion in this study we introduced a new method to interpolate daily evapotranspiration between available remote sensing estimates the objective was to provide continuous estimates of et as required for many hydrological applications the method was applied to modis estimates of et at the kilometer resolution over the niamey area in niger broadly speaking our study shows that over the whole season cumulative et is fairly well represented with simple rg based or et0 based interpolation but that intra seasonal dynamics require something a little more complex in that sense the new methodology based on a data fusion algorithm provided better results than the standard methods that have been classically used for interpolating et estimates based on the interpolation of the ratio of et to rg or et0 the improvement was generally around 0 1 in terms of nse which indicates a better description of the variations of daily et this was clearly illustrated by the better depiction of the first precipitation events at the beginning of the rainy period fig 5 during the monsoon season while the number of e3s estimates was limited in reason of the low availability of modis data the improvement was also substantial the fusion method used information on soil drying up and rain events which were not available with the standard interpolation method it is difficult to compare our results to those obtained in previous studies as almost no analysis was published comparing standard methodologies based on the interpolation of simple ratio as defined by eqs 10 and 11 to methodologies introducing information on the timing of precipitations and drying kinetics when considering analysis of the interpolation of et on in situ datasets rmse ranging between 0 2 and 0 9 mm d 1 were obtained for a large range of ecosystems and climates over contiguous united states and the mediterranean delogu et al 2021 guillevic et al 2019 the lowest values were obtained under semi arid conditions over wheat crops in morocco delogu et al 2021 and woody savannahs in southwestern usa guillevic et al 2019 which were characterized by low daily et values larger rmse values above 0 4 mm d 1 were obtained in wetter conditions in particular for industrial crops grasslands and forests in our study the values of rmseint which quantify the impact of the interpolation method alone table 3 were falling in the middle of that range of performances 0 65 mm d 1 when using et0 and 0 58 mm d 1 when using rg rmseint for the fusion method was significantly lower 0 51 mm d 1 when considering evaluation of continuous estimates of daily et from satellite data combining errors on interpolation together with errors due to the estimation of et on days with remote sensing data the rmse values given in table 2 were lower than found in previous studies 0 8 mm d 1 over a dry saltmarsh scrubland interpolated et rg ratio gallego elvira et al 2013 1 1 to 1 8 mm d 1 over agricultural areas modis landsat fusion cammalleri et al 2013 0 9 mm d 1 over vineyards goes modis landsat fusion semmens et al 2016 conversely to our analysis none of these studies was using information on precipitation and drying kinetics in any situation the fusion method based on two interpolation supports fusion egp namely gleam and pameas provided better results than the use of one interpolation support at local scale the performance of fusion eg was similar to the performance of the standard interpolation methods table 2 at mesoscale vs almip2 ensemble simulations they were close to those of fusion egp table 5 on its side fusion ep based on pameas simulations had always lower performance than fusion egp at local scale vs flux tower measurements this seemed to demonstrate that both supports were providing interesting information for interpolating et estimates while at mesoscale gleam seemed to provide most of the information this may be related to the impact of the calibration of pameas over the whole domain indeed we shown at local scale that when pameas api parameters were calibrated on ground information here sispat simulations the performance of fusion methods using pameas were increased in our work it was not possible to calibrate the api formulation over different locations the possibility to use an api calibrated on ground data for different locations and in particular different land cover and soil types should be investigated in the future the differences in the performance of both mono interpolation support methods at local scale gave also an indication of the interest of using interpolation support at the finer resolution gleam in fusion eg is used at its original resolution i e 25 km while it is disaggregated at the kilometer resolution in fusion egp our results also illustrated that the interpolation process itself was usually generating larger errors in the derivation of continuous estimates of et than the direct estimation of et from remote sensing data in the best case fusion of e3s with gleam and pameas at local scale both errors had almost similar level this indicates that more efforts have to be done for improving interpolation procedures our study participated to these efforts in particular by showing that improvements can be obtained when introducing information on the kinetics of soil drying up and on the occurrence of precipitation events and probably the amount of rainfall water also compared to the number of studies proposing and analyzing et models the literature on et interpolation is reduced to a limited number of articles most of them only analyzed the results of the standard interpolation methods alfieri et al 2017 delogu et al 2021 guillevic et al 2019 lagouarde et al 2013 2010 this has maybe been related to the difficulties for obtaining accurate information on rain occurrence and amount in a distributed way over large areas while information on incoming solar radiation and on et0 have been more easily available actually various precipitation products are available nowadays they are derived from interpolation of gauge observations e g gpcc schneider et al 2014 cru chen et al 2008 satellite data e g chomps joseph et al 2009 cmorph joyce et al 2004 combination of satellite and gauge data e g chirps funk et al 2015 tmpa 3b42 huffman et al 2007 meteorological reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 or from the combination of satellite data gauge measurements and atmospheric model reanalysis e g mswep beck et al 2017 the new method developed in this study was applied for interpolating et estimated from modis data over a sahelian area one can wonder what would be the applicability of the method over other areas other climate or other sensors having different revisit characteristics concerning climate the number of available modis data for estimating et during the monsoon season is very limited implying the reconstruction of et for a very large proportion of days about 75 of et data have been interpolated in this study in this situation the new method proved to be efficient in comparison to the standard interpolation methods and we can anticipate it would perform correctly in situations with a larger density of available data this also indicates that the method could be transferred to the interpolation of et derived from sensors onboard landsat platforms with a long revisit time nonetheless in the case of a higher number of images the performance gain compared to a simpler interpolation method would probably become too low given the higher complexity of the fusion method developed in the present study one of the main advantages of the method relies on the integration of precipitation data that provide essential information on the variations of et during long period this is in line with the results obtained by delogu et al 2021 over a large number of in situ datasets however an analysis of the interest of such method over very long period up to several weeks without et data as it can happen when using landsat data still has to be investigated one can anticipate that in such situation the performance of the method would greatly depends on the quality of the calibration of an interpolation support such as pameas it should also be noticed that precipitation information is not sufficient for following the alternation of wetting drying events over irrigated areas information on irrigation calendar and amounts is very difficult to obtain in these cases the interest of using remote sensing data sensitive to surface soil moisture as microwave backscattering has to be investigated gleam is already integrating microwave data but with a spatial resolution not suitable for the detection of irrigation events the use of microwave data such as those provided by sentinel 1a and 1b with a revisit cycle of 6 days might be used for detecting at least some of the irrigation events and also for helping in the calibration of interpolation support as pameas another advantage of the methodology relies on the use of models that describe the evolution of surface water status and provide information on the kinetics of et over time in our case such information is provided either by pameas at the pixel scale and gleam at mesoscale other surface water balance models could be used such as the simpkcet model olioso et al 2019 ollivier et al 2021 which is developed from the fao56 method allen et al 1998 and can be applied to a wide range of ecosystems 5 conclusion the purpose of this work was to build a multi resolution and multi source remote sensing data fusion approach to produce continuous daily et maps at 1 km resolution in sahelian areas the proposition of such an approach appeared to be a key issue for sahelian areas given the inefficiency of standard temporal interpolation techniques for long return intervals and wam linked cloud cover during the rainy season the proposed methodology relied on the use of the gleam global et product and a parametric model named pameas as a normalized basis to fill gaps in modis based e3s et estimates between two clear sky days acquisition the fusion approach was compared to more classical temporal interpolation techniques involving the linear interpolation of the ratio between et and rg or et0 rs based et estimates were evaluated in southwest niger during the 2005 2008 period at i the pixel scale against eddy covariance measurements and simulations of a beforehand calibrated validated land surface model named sispat ii at mesoscale against simulations of the 20 regional almip2 lsms as a reference basis at pixel scale fusion based et estimates showed good skill scores compared both to sispat simulations rmse 0 68 mm day 1 nse 0 79 r2 0 80 and field measurements rmse 0 64 mm day 1 nse 0 78 r2 0 79 compared to et0 and rg based interpolation techniques the fusion approach allowed significantly reducing rsme and enhancing nse and r2 with respect to observations and sispat simulations the main benefits of the fusion algorithm are observed during the first months of the rainy season in its capacity to reproduce the alternation between et peaks and drying up phases residual error analysis showed that the fusion approach reduces the interpolated rs based et error for high values 0 5 mm day 1 of observed et standard deviation between two available estimates quite similar results are obtained at mesoscale compared to the mesoscale mean of almip2 models simulations showing the spatial consistency of the here developed fusion algorithm we also show that fusion based et estimates are in better agreement with lsms references at both local and mesoscale than those based on either gleam or pameas estimates alone showing the benefit of the multi source fusion approach the local calibration of pameas api parameters substantially improves performance of the fusion approach at local scale without modifying its performance at mesoscale this last point highlights the interest of a multi point local calibration of the model against surface soil moisture measurements for future improvements of the fusion approach it is believed that such a fusion approach is particularly appealing to take advantage of multi source and multi resolution datasets to produce consistent continuous et estimates this fusion technique will be implemented in other mesoscale areas in sahelo saharan mali and sudanian benin instrumented in the framework of the amma catch nos to evaluate the replicability of the methodology finally given the need of fine scale et estimates and the recent development of disaggregation algorithms we suggest that such a fusion approach could be used as a first stage in a disaggregation chain to ensure better consistency between continuous multi resolution et estimates funding the

appendix c local calibration of pameas against sispat reference simulations pameas was calibrated against the simulations of sispat on the 2005 2012 period calibrated values of parameters used in the formulations of api e and t are presented in table c 1 for the millet field and the fallow respectively calibration was performed to minimize root mean square error rmse and maximize nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 together to find the set of parameters providing the best trade off very good performances are observed between simulated api from pameas and simulated 0 10 cm soil water content from sispat for both ecosystems with nevertheless a slight negative bias of 0 18 and 0 05 mm for the millet crop and the fallow respectively table c 2 for both ecosystems api is very well correlated to 0 10 cm soil water content with r2 of 0 88 and 0 93 for the millet field and the fallow respectively table c 2 likewise very good skill scores are obtained for soil evaporation for both ecosystems with again a slight negative bias supposed mainly due to api underestimation table c 2 for transpiration pameas is in good agreement with sispat during the ascending phase of the transpiration cycle during this period we observed an increase of the root zone soil moisture with an infiltration from the surface to deep layers peaking at a maximum shortly after the last rainfall not shown during this period sensible heat h is relatively constant and near zero all of the available energy at the surface is thus used for et vegetation is not stressed and transpiration variations are mainly controlled by incoming solar radiation once this root zone soil moisture peak has passed transpiration is capping and supports all the et since surface water content is dried up h is increasing leading to a competition for available energy between t and the heating of the surface stomatal resistance term is more and more preponderant and vegetation is thus subject to water stress finally transpiration is rapidly decreasing less or more exponentially following the root zone soil water content depletion with very low sensitivity to incoming radiation consequently as expected during this phase pameas is significantly less correlated with sispat since it does not take into account any water stress not shown for purposes of application in a data fusion approach with modis based e3s estimates this model s drift is not critical because images frequency is high during this period allies et al 2020 and day to day et variation are slight finally adding e and t terms et simulated by pameas is in very good agreement with sispat with nse values of 0 85 and 0 90 for the millet crop and the fallow respectively table c 2 and fig c 1 
3563,thermal infrared tir remote sensing based et estimates are very appealing for a wide range of scientific applications in hydrology however they are prone to infrequency due to satellite revisit interval and cloud cover temporal interpolation techniques or multi resolution and multi frequency data fusion approach have thus recently been studied to provide continuous et estimates it has been already shown that the interest of temporal interpolation techniques is limited to short return interval that is troublesome in sahelian regions where mesoscale convective systems linked to the west african monsoon wam renders unusable most of tir images during the rainy season here we developed a data fusion approach to provide remote sensing based continuous daily et estimates at kilometric resolution in sahelian areas the proposed algorithm fill gaps in modis based et estimates from evaspa s sebi sahel e3s using the global land evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam product and or et estimates from a simple parametric model for typical sahelian ecosystems as a normalized basis the fusion algorithm is evaluated at the pixel scale against eddy covariance measurements and simulations of a locally calibrated and validated land surface model lsm on a millet crop and a fallow of shrubby savannah in the southwest of the republic of niger consistency of the fusion approach is also evaluated at mesoscale by comparing it with a set of 20 regional lsms globally both level of comparison highlight the very good agreement of et estimates based on the fusion approach with both in situ measurements and lsms simulations we also show the benefit of such a fusion approach compared to linear temporal interpolation techniques of the ratio between et and either incoming solar radiation or reference evapotranspiration the main benefits are observed during the first months of the rainy season in the depiction of the surface response to rainfall events and consecutive drying up of the surface soil layer we suggest that such a fusion approach could be later used in disaggregation chain to enhance field scaled et estimates by the combination of coarse moderate and high resolution remote sensing based et estimates keywords evapotranspiration data fusion e3s gleam modis sahel 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key variable in the coupled water and energy cycles it is involved in numerous biophysical and biochemical process katul et al 2012 its estimation in space and time is thus crucial for a wide range of scientific and operational applications fisher et al 2017 including understanding and forecasting global change in water jung et al 2010 marshall et al 2012 managing irrigation santos et al 2007 toureiro et al 2017 managing and forecasting severe drought events anderson et al 2016 2010 otkin et al 2016 regional water balance and groundwater monitoring olioso et al 2018 2015 ollivier et al 2021 ruggieri et al 2021 or constraining and calibrating distributed hydrological models kunnath poovakka et al 2016 schuurmans et al 2003 tobin and bennett 2017 as it is controlled by several biotic and abiotic factors et is highly variable spatially alfieri et al 2007 however in situ measurements acquired for example using lysimeters eddy correlation systems or scintillometers are only able to provide estimates at small scales 100 103 m these measurements still are essential for model calibration and validation and for biophysical process monitoring at fine spatiotemporal scale boulain et al 2009b ramier et al 2009 velluet et al 2014 although they cannot fulfill the need for et estimates at regional to continental scales in this respect remote sensing rs based approaches are promising zhang et al 2016 especially for the african continent where field measurements are scarce in particular the response of land surface temperature lst to the intensity of water stress through the surface energy balance makes this variable a key target for estimating et from space kalma et al 2008 nevertheless estimation of et from thermal infrared tir data still has limitations the main one is the intermittency of image acquisition at moderate and high resolutions which hinders the feasibility of continuous monitoring of et intermittent acquisition is due both to the revisit frequency of the satellite which is governed by its orbital configuration and to cloud cover occurrence alfieri et al 2017 guillevic et al 2019 lagouarde et al 2013 this last point is particularly critical in west africa where climate is governed by a monsoon regime characterized by mesoscale convective systems that make many of the tir images acquired during the rainy season not usable allies et al 2020 showed that despite having a daily return interval modis tir images availability did not exceed 6 images per month on average during the rainy season in four years of data over south west niger little studies have so far focused on the reconstruction of et between two dates with suitable acquisition in most cases a simple linear interpolation of the ratio between et and a known reference quantity is performed alfieri et al 2017 delogu et al 2021 guillevic et al 2019 lagouarde et al 2010 this quantity can be the incoming solar radiation rg gallego elvira et al 2013 the extra terrestrial solar radiation guillevic et al 2019 ryu et al 2012 or the reference evapotranspiration et0 cammalleri et al 2013 other interpolation methods were proposed e g cubic and hermite spline but proved to be less reliable than the linear method alfieri et al 2017 the interpolation supports should carry information on variations in the drivers of et between two acquisition dates et drivers are essentially related to available energy or to water availability available water for plants and soil evaporation most supports commonly used so far provide information only on energy constraints in relation to solar radiation or on atmospheric water demand in the case of et0 linear interpolation based on et0 or rg cannot account for variations in et related to other drivers than rg or et0 among unaccounted for effects are e g i the impact of re humectations related to water supplies occurring between acquisition days ii the evolution of vegetation cover iii the non linearity of the drying kinetic of soil top layers and iv the non linear responses of stomatal conductance to soil moisture and atmospheric demand this is all the more important as the time between two successive available et data is long alfieri et al 2017 and delogu et al 2021 showed that the interest of these basic temporal interpolation schemes was limited to short return intervals of less than 8 days in order to improve interpolation it may be possible to use variables that more closely follow et variations it is not required that these estimations are fully accurate but they need to respond to more et drivers than only rg or et0 and in particular to precipitation and drying kinetics delogu et al 2021 showed that the inclusion of additional information related to the timing of rainfall events may help in improving the monitoring of daily et this is particularly true in the sahel where soil drainage is fast and the response of surface is abrupt after each rainfall event lohou et al 2014 considering the limitations of temporal interpolation schemes techniques of multiple data source fusion are attractive as they take advantage of information provided by several datasets cammalleri et al 2013 gao et al 2006 li et al 2017 the use of multi resolution et products is interesting to fill gaps in moderately or highly spatially resolved products with temporal information contained in coarser ones for instance cammalleri et al 2013 adapted the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm which was originally developed for generating a synthetic daily surface reflectance product at landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm spatial resolution by gao et al 2006 to produce continuous landsat like daily et images using temporal series of modis images starfm was later applied and evaluated in various eco climatic conditions cammalleri et al 2014 gevaert and garcía haro 2015 semmens et al 2016 wang et al 2014 other algorithms have been proposed to produce fine scale et maps from landsat modis data fusion algorithms based on upstream lst disaggregation eswar et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 simple linear regression bhattarai et al 2015 or machine learning ke et al 2017 nonetheless if such data fusion techniques are engaging to produce field scale et estimates they are prone to modis data gaps due to cloud cover and data quality restricting the reconstruction of daily et maps thus in order to reconstruct continuous daily et time series modis et estimates need to be temporally interpolated in a first step generally linear interpolation of an et reference quantity ratio were used cammalleri et al 2013 ma et al 2018 a similar interpolation scheme was used by gallego elvira et al 2013 and olioso et al 2018 to reconstruct sequences of daily et from modis data as modis data are coming with a daily revisit one may think that such a simple interpolation procedure is sufficient however in many situations as the monsoon season in sahelian regions for example the cloud occurrence can significantly increase and drastically reduce the number of available et estimates allies et al 2020 the fusion of modis estimates with other information having a daily time step or finer can be proposed for improving the production of continuous et estimates it might be possible to use information such as surface variables in weather forecast model reanalysis simulations of distributed water balance model fed by remote sensing data e g gleam miralles et al 2011 or results from land data assimilation systems e g albergel et al 2017 the objective of the present study is to evaluate the capability of a new approach using multiple et data sources to fill gaps between daily et maps generated with remote sensing techniques it is based on a new fusion methodology that makes it possible to derive continuous daily evapotranspiration maps at 1 km resolution by combining intermittent et estimates from modis data to continuous et monitoring obtained at 0 25 resolution from the gleam product this method uses et interpolation supports that account for rainy events and drying kinetics both at mesoscale thanks to the gleam data and at the kilometer scale thanks to a developed simple et parametric model named pameas parametric model for evapotranspiration in the agropastoral sahel in our work the high resolution et maps were produced using the evaspa s sebi sahel e3s approach from modis tir and albedo data which has shown very good performances over south west niger allies et al 2020 however the proposed methodology could be used with any et mapping and daily mesoscale estimation of et together with a surface water balance model the benefits of the data fusion approach were evaluated against standard interpolation schemes to do so et estimates from either the fusion approach or the interpolation schemes were evaluated at field scale against in situ observations acquired on two typical ecosystems of the agropastoral sahel and at mesoscale against ensemble simulations with land surface models lsms this region is characterized by long periods without usable remote sensing optical data due to heavy cloud cover during the rainy season to our knowledge this study is the first to deal with the complex issue of the continuous estimation of daily evapotranspiration from tir images in the sahel potentially giving useful information for worldwide areas with long periods of cloudiness this paper is structured as follows materials and methods are introduced in section 2 the study area is firstly presented section 2 1 followed by the data sets used in fusion and interpolation approaches section 2 2 and the data sets used for the evaluation of the fusion and interpolation schemes section 2 3 the methodology employed is then detailed in section 2 4 results are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 a general conclusion is finally given in section 5 2 materials and methods the fusion method was applied on 4 years 2005 2008 of data at mesoscale in south west niger where surface flux observations were collected by the amma catch national observation service nos galle et al 2018 at two micrometeorological flux towers in a millet crop and a fallow of shrubby savannah the two main land cover types in the region cappelaere et al 2009 the accuracy of daily evapotranspiration retrievals using e3s was previously evaluated at the same site over the 2005 2008 period allies et al 2020 in the present study the data fusion approach is evaluated at field scale against in situ surface energy balance measurements ramier et al 2009 velluet et al 2014 and simulations with a physically based calibrated validated land surface model lsm named sispat simple soil plant atmosphere transfers velluet et al 2014 it is also evaluated at mesoscale by comparison with the simulations from a set of 20 spatially distributed lsms selected in the framework of the almip2 intercomparison exercise boone et al 2009 grippa et al 2017 2 1 study area the study area is located in the southwest of the republic of niger fig 1 a it consists of a mesoscale window 1 55 3 15 e 12 85 14 15 n covering an area of 20 800 km2 included in the amma catch nos it is located in the agropastoral sahel characterized by a tropical semiarid climate with rainfall ranging from 570 mm to 470 mm along a south north gradient and with mean temperature of 30 c cappelaere et al 2009 climate is governed by the west african monsoon wam with a long dry season from november to april followed by a rainy season characterized by mesoscale convective systems the study area is approximately centered on niger s capital city of niamey and it is crossed both by the niger river western part and by the dallol bosso fossil river valley eastern part see fig 1b the main ecosystems of the area are typical of the agropastoral sahel alternating between rainfed millet crop and fallow of shrubby savannah cappelaere et al 2009 leblanc et al 2008 fig 1b remains of tiger bush are also observed especially over plateau areas irrigated orchards and gardens are scattered along the niger river nearby urban areas in particular in the outskirts of niamey regarding soils and hydrology the northern and the eastern parts of the study area are characterized by endoreic catchments with sandy soils weakly structured with sand fraction superior to 75 and even above 85 in the niger river and dallol bosso valleys the latter is characterized by intermittent seasonal flow and pounding during the rainy season and often maintaining subsurface water the rest of the year leduc et al 1997 the right bank of the niger river is characterized by loamier soils and is less prone to surface crusting the two main reference plots of the amma catch niger mesosite are located in between the two above alluvial valleys near the wankama village at about 60 km northeast of niamey 2 6 e 13 6 n fig 1c these two plots of 15 ha each have been intensively instrumented since 2005 cappelaere et al 2009 the monitored ecosystems are the two dominant ecosystems in the study area a pearl millet crop pennisetum glaucum l r br and a fallow composed of patches of a shrub layer dominated by guiera senegalensis lam annual c3 and c4 grasslands and bare soils boulain et al 2009a ramier et al 2009 no alternation between millet crop and fallow was observed during the studied ground measurements period 2005 2008 data acquired in the plots are described in the next section 2 3 1 2 2 data sets used in fusion and interpolation approaches 2 2 1 e3s e3s evaspa s sebi sahel is a contextual rs based method for daily et mapping designed to minimize the use of ancillary meteorological data and provide comprehensive epistemic uncertainty of daily et retrievals for sahelian areas allies et al 2020 it is based on the evapotranspiration assessment from space evaspa rs based modelling tool gallego elvira et al 2013 and the simplified surface energy balance index s sebi method roerink et al 2000 s sebi derives et from the evaporative fraction ef computed from surface temperature lst and surface albedo α of a given satellite scene as follows 1 ef l s t α i lst dry α i lst i lst dry α i lst wet α i where subscript i correspond to a given pixel of a the satellite scene associated with an αi albedo value and a lsti surface temperature value lstdry and lstwet correspond to fully dry ef 0 and fully wet ef 1 areas respectively between which ef is assumed to vary linearly fig 2 comparatively to s sebi e3s computes at each satellite overpass time the evaporative fraction by considering 17 methods for the determination of the edges of the lst α shape et derived using the different edges determination methods were averaged to provide an ensemble mean of et the average procedure of the 17 et estimates considered weighting coefficients that were derived according to the seasonal stage of rainfall and lai see allies et al 2020 for details the variability of et estimates was also used to derive an estimation of uncertainty in the derivation of et in this work we use daily et from 2005 to 2008 derived from e3s using lst and surface albedo from modis onboard terra and aqua as well as incoming longwave and shortwave radiations from flux towers measurements as described by allies et al 2020 e3s was already evaluated at the time of satellite overpass and at the daily scale against the data from the two eddy covariance towers before gap filling and against the sispat simulations by allies et al 2020 in average length of gaps in modis based e3s et estimates are about 10 3 13 5 days and are mainly due to cloud contamination 2 2 2 gleam gleam global land evaporation the amsterdam methodology is a global daily et product at a 0 25 resolution it is developed by the vu university of amsterdam miralles et al 2011 and it is designed to maximize the use of satellite derived observations in combination to climatic re analysis data gleam derives et at each grid cell using a priesley taylor model for computing potential evapotranspiration and several stress factors for reducing this potential evapotranspiration stress factors depend on the vegetation moisture derived from microwave emission measurements and on soil moisture simulated by a 3 layers soil module microwave information is also used for correcting the soil module through a simple data assimilation procedure the version of the product used in this work is the v3 1 a martens et al 2017 it is forced with radiation fluxes and atmospheric temperature from era interim dee et al 2011 precipitations from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation dataset mswep beck et al 2017 and microwave surface soil moisture from the esa climate change initiative soil moisture esa cci sm v2 3 data set liu et al 2012 wagner et al 2012 the version 3 1 a of gleam has been recently validated against measurements from 91 eddy covariance towers and 2325 soil moisture sensors martens et al 2017 2 2 3 pameas 2 2 3 1 description of the model pameas parametric model for evapotranspiration in the agropastoral sahel is a simple parametric model developed in the framework of this study to derive et from incoming solar radiation rg rainfall r and leaf area index lai only for typical sahelian ecosystems pameas computes separately soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t both as a multiplicative function of rg xu and singh 2000 t mm day 1 is simulated under no stressed conditions as a simple function of rg 2 t ρ 2 f cover rg λ where ρ2 is a calibrated parameter λ the latent heat of vaporization 28 4 w m 2 and fcover the fraction of vegetation cover pameas assumes that the vegetation is not facing water stress in other words pameas only provides a potential transpiration temporal variations of t are thus only due to incident solar radiation fluctuations resistance terms being negligible fcover is derived from lai according a beer lambert law 3 f cover 1 e 0 5 l a i for soil evaporation e mm day 1 pameas accounts for the fraction cover by considering the uncovered soil fraction 1 fcover and for a stress function depending on the soil water content as approximated by the antecedent precipitation index api kohler and linsley 1951 4 e ρ 1 1 f cover rg λ cos π 2 swc fc

function is used to describe a non linear evolution of the water stress with the decrease of the surface soil layer water content as proposed by merlin et al 2016 2010 fig 3 the soil water content at field capacity is derived from the sand and clay fraction according to saxton et al 1986 5 swc fc 100 1 3 a 1 b 6 a e 4 396 7 15 10 2 f clay 4 88 10 4 f sand 2 7 b 3 14 2 22 10 3 f clay 2 3 484 10 5 f sand 2 f clay where fclay and fsand are the soil fraction of clay and sand respectively api is computed according the following formulation 8 ap i d a p i d 1 e 1 ω 1 ω 2 r d with the subscript d for the considered day ω1 et ω2 parameters calibrated on field measurements of the 0 10 cm soil water content and r mm daily rainfall finally pameas computes et from the sum of soil evaporation e and canopy transpiration t appendix c describes the calibration of the pameas model against sispat simulations at field scale over the 2005 2012 period sispat model was used to develop and calibrate pameas at field scale because it allows to separate soil evaporation from canopy transpiration 2 2 3 2 spatial distribution of the model pameas was spatialized using sand and clay fractions from ecoclimap2 kaptué tchuenté et al 2011 precipitation fields derived from rain gauge data over the observational network using krigged lagrangian spatial interpolation method as for almip2 lsms vischel et al 2011 lai from modis data mcd15a3 product and incoming solar radiation from flux towers measurements considering that spatial variations were negligible over the study site allies et al 2020 rainfall and radiation fields were given at daily timescale modis lai product was a 4 days composite that was previously interpolated using a cubic spline function pameas simulations were finally released at the same resolution as modis 1 km two versions of pameas were considered in the first one pameas parameters ρ1 ρ2 ω1 ω2 were simultaneously calibrated on et time series derived with e3s over the 2005 2008 period for each pixel to this end about 104 800 simulations were performed with pameas considering a priori parameters intervals the best parameter set for each pixel was selected considering minimal root mean square error rmse alternately in the second pameas version only ρ1 and ρ2 were calibrated against e3s et maps api parameters ω1 ω2 were calibrated on soil moisture simulated by sispat at both flux tower sites see appendix c and they were considered as uniforms over the whole mesoscale study site api fields were generated for both cover types millet and fallow and then averaged to generate a single value to use in pameas this simplification allowed a strong reduction in the number of simulations and consequently in computing time as only the two flux tower sites were used for calibrating api parameters we expect that the spatial representativeness of soil evaporation simulated by pameas will be affected conversely we expect that this version will make it possible to evaluate pameas performance in more details at local scale calculation made with this second pameas version were named by adding the subscript lc for local calibration to the fusion method name e g egplc 2 2 4 incoming solar radiation rg and reference evapotranspiration et0 fields the developed fusion algorithm is compared to standard temporal interpolation techniques based on the linear interpolation of the ratio between et and rg or et0 to this end rg fields were generated using the average between measurements from both millet and fallow ec stations considering that spatial variations were negligible over the study site similarly et0 was computed as in allen et al 1998 using rg air temperature air relative humidity and wind speed from the average of millet and fallow plots measurements 9 e t 0 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 m e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 m where rn mj m 2 day 1 is the net radiation tmean c is the mean daily air temperature u2m m s 1 is the wind

evaluation data sets 2 3 1 eddy covariance measurements the two reference local plots of the amma catch nos were equipped for continuous monitoring of meteorological variables rainfall air pressure temperature and humidity wind speed and direction four component radiations and soil variables shallow ground heat flux temperature and moisture profiles down to a depth of 2 5 m eddy covariance ec systems were also implemented measuring high frequency 20 hz wind speed 3 components air temperature and water vapor to derive sensible and latent heat flux estimates see table 1 turbulent fluxes were derived as described by ramier et al 2009 using edire software r clement university of edinburgh and following carboeurope recommendations mauder and foken 2004 full details of the setup and the sensors can be found in ramier et al 2009 and velluet et al 2014 several studies already exploited the data acquired or derived from these plots boulain et al 2009b lohou et al 2014 marshall et al 2013 ramier et al 2009 sjöström et al 2013 velluet et al 2014 in our study for purpose of comparison with rs based daily et estimates gaps in eddy covariance based latent heat flux measurements were filled according to the climatological method proposed by velluet 2014 see appendix a only days with less than one third of the data being gap filled were used in this study on the overall studied period only 3 5 and 4 3 of 30 min latent heat measurements were gap filled with this method for the millet crop and the fallow respectively after this gap filling step the energy balance at the daily scale revealed a slight imbalance of 0 7 w m 2 and 13 8 w m 2 for the millet crop and the fallow respectively after gap filling we disposed of 1149 days of observation 312 days being missing 2 3 2 sispat simulations the simple soil plant atmosphere transfers sispat model is a physical based lsm able to simulate the coupled heat and water exchanges at the soil plant atmosphere interface braud et al 1995 both energy budgets from the vegetation canopy and the soil surface are solved using a classical electrical analogy in a two layer system the sispat model was previously thoroughly calibrated and validated by velluet et al 2014 for the 7 years period 2005 2012 against the energy balance and the soil moisture data acquired on the millet crop site and the fallow of shrubby savannah site model skill scores against observed half hourly energy balance components can be found in velluet et al 2014 and allies et al 2020 globally scores were very good for both ecosystems rmse 30 wm 2 for millet and rmse 40 wm 2 for fallow considering uncertainty relative to such observations this suggests that sispat simulations may be considered as reliable proxies of the local plots fluxes with the benefit of no gaps allowing more complete evaluation at pixel scale note that sispat simulations were already used to evaluate non interpolated e3s et estimates in south west niger allies et al 2020 2 3 3 almip2 land surface model simulations the amma land surface model intercomparaison project phase 2 almip2 boone et al 2009 is dedicated to identify current weaknesses in lsms representation of surface land processes among 20 models at local and mesoscale in west africa models simulations were performed at 30 min timescale on the mesoscale site with a 0 05 grid during the 2005 2008 period the 20 almip2 models are listed in appendix a all models were forced with precipitation fields derived from rain gauge data over the observational network using krigged lagrangian spatial interpolation method vischel et al 2011 incoming longwave and shortwave radiations came from the satellite application facility for land surface analysis land saf project trigo et al 2011 whereas all other meteorological forcing variables including air temperature near surface specific humidity wind speed and surface atmospheric pressure came from ecmwf era interim re analysis dee et al 2011 most of the models used the ecoclimap2 africa database kaptué tchuenté et al 2011 to derive soil and vegetation characteristics including lai nevertheless some of them had their own formulations or specific data for some variables see grippa et al 2017 for more details in this study we used the ensemble average and standard deviation of lsms simulations in term of spatial mean over our study site as a basis of comparison at mesoscale 2 4 methodology the methodology used is exposed in fig 4 and detailed in the following subsections 2 4 1 formulation of an interpolation methodology continuous estimation of et was obtained by filling the gaps between remote sensing estimations we implemented first the two most classical methods based on the linear interpolation of the ratio r of et to an interpolation support b that is either the incoming solar radiation rg or the reference evapotranspiration et0 et for a missing day t is calculated as 10 et t r t b t with 11 r t r t k r t k 1 r t k t t k t k 1 t k tk and tk 1 with tk t tk 1 corresponding to the days of the previous and the next available observations an interpolation method that more closely follow et variations is proposed in a second step it uses alternative estimation of et that are available at the daily time step either from other et products here the gleam product a parametric modeling of et here the pameas model or a combination of both the procedure is inspired by linear filtering methods considering incremental evolution of et in this case et estimation for day t is obtained by incrementing et obtained at the previous date t 1 considering the change in b from day t 1 to day t 12 e t t e t t 1 w b t b t b t 1 where wb is a scaling factor accounting for the ratio between et and b for day tk corresponding to the day with the last available observation of et et tk wb is computed as follow 13 w b t k e t t k b t k on day t wb t is obtained by interpolating linearly wb t as r t in eq 11 a mathematical safeguard is implemented when b tk tends towards 0 another formulation is proposed when considering several interpolation drivers b for two drivers b1 and b2 14 e t t e t t 1 w b 1 t b 1 t b 1 t 1 w b 2 t b 2 t b 2 t 1 gains wb1 t and wb2 t are to be defined from the evolution and or the proximity of et to b1 and b2 they are defined as weighting coefficients between the two sources of interpolation information b1 and b2 considering that et should be better interpolated by the closest interpolation driver on day tk they are written as 15 w b 1 t k 1 ε b 1 t k ε b 1 t k ε b 2 t k 16 w b 2 t k 1 ε b 2 t k ε b 1 t k ε b 2 t k with 17 ε b 1 t k e t t k b 1 t k 18 ε b 2 t k e t t k b 2 t k on day t wb1 t and wb2 t are obtained by linear interpolation between days tk and tk 1 as r t in eq 11 both wb1 t and wb2 t account for the proximity of b1 and b2 to et in cases bi is inter calibrated with et εbi tk should be small 2 4 2 implementation scheme in our study we tested the approach to interpolate et maps based on the fusion eq 14 this paragraph outlines the algorithm used and the justification of each step the different data set and models have been already presented in detail in section 2 2 2 4 2 1 calculation of et step 1 calculation of et maps with e3s see section 2 2 1 for each date tk at which land surface temperature and spectral reflectance are available from modis original products step 2 application of the fusion algorithm to generate et maps on days without e3s estimates two interpolation supports are used the gleam operational product which provides estimation of et every day at 0 25 resolution et is computed using a water balance model fed by remote sensing data and meteorological reanalysis see section 2 2 2 the advantages of gleam are its spatial resolution which allows capturing mesoscale information on rain and its heavy use of remote sensing data in particular the assimilation of microwave radiometer data that enables close monitoring of surface water status estimates of daily et at 1 km resolution using pameas see section 2 2 3 the advantage of pameas lies in its parametric form driven by the antecedent precipitation index api representing soil drying kinetics concerning the impact of vegetation on et pameas is driven by the evolution of fcover as estimated by modis data step 2 1 pameas is calibrated for each pixel at 1 km resolution p1km over the time series of et maps provided by e3s using modis data four scaling parameters one for transpiration one for evaporation and two for the soil drying curve shape are computed for each pixel see section 2 2 3 step 2 2 gleam g25km is disaggregated at 1 km resolution g1km on the basis of et spatial distribution simulated by pameas p1km p25km p25km being the

method three sets of data are used for the evaluation of the fusion approach ground measurements of et at one millet field and one fallow site see section 2 3 1 and simulations of the simple soil plant atmosphere transfers sispat model thoroughly calibrated and validated against field observations which both permitted an evaluation at local scale see section 2 3 2 spatially distributed simulations by an ensemble of 20 lsms that were performed in the framework of the amma land surface model intercomparaison project phase 2 almip2 program see section 2 3 3 this data set is used for an evaluation at mesoscale by comparing the spatial average of interpolated daily et over the area to the spatial average of almip2 estimations et derived from the fusion of e3s gleam and pameas and denoted as fusion egp is compared to other interpolation sets fusion eg from the fusion of e3s with gleam only eq 12 in this case gleam is not disaggregated and simply super sampled at modis 1 km

computed for interpolated days and rsmee3s is the intrinsic rmse of the e3s product which is computed during non interpolated days 3 results all the fusion and interpolation approaches were applied on the study area over the 2005 2008 period the results were analyzed both at local scale against field measurements and sispat simulations section 3 1 and at mesoscale in terms of spatial average against almip2 lsms simulations section 3 2 3 1 evaluation at local scale 3 1 1 comparison of interpolation and fusion approaches in this subsection comparison of the continuous daily et estimates obtained after each interpolation or fusion approach against in situ measurements and sispat simulations is analyzed overall skill scores of this analysis are summarized in table 2 and illustrated in fig 5 the main results provided by table 2 can be summarized as follows the performances of each method were acceptable rmse ranging between 0 59 and 0 76 mm day 1 the new interpolation method based on the fusion of e3s gleam and pameas egp provided the best agreement with ground data and sispat simulations as shown by rmse 0 59 0 68 mm day 1 nse 0 78 0 84 and r2 0 78 0 85 values in table 2 actually the three statistical metrics always provided a similar ranking of the methods so that only rmse will be used in the rest of this section the standard interpolation methods based on the interpolation of the ratio of et to rg or et0 had the lowest performance in particular in the case of et0 rmse 0 74 0 76 mm day 1 remember that these interpolation supports are mainly driven by radiation information and no direct information on precipitation events and drying dynamic were used the fusion methods using pameas as only interpolation support ep had intermediary performances rmse 0 65 0 71 mm day 1 while the use of gleam alone eg was providing performance similar as et0 rmse 0 73 0 75 mm day 1 remember that in this case gleam data were used at their native 0 25 resolution the local calibration of api parameters on sispat simulations improved the interpolations based on the fusion using pameas fusion egplc and fusion eplc in comparison to the direct calibration of api parameters on e3s estimates fusion egp and fusion ep see fig 5 all the methods except fusion eg in comparison to sispat simulations underestimated et with biases between 0 01 mm day 1 and 0 11 mm day 1 which resulted in underestimations between 4 and 45 mm year 1 no clear differences existed between the methods excepted that the local calibration of api provided lower bias than the calibration of api against e3s data and that biases for fusion ep were at least twice larger than for any other method 0 11 mm day 1 the most obvious benefits of the fusion approach between e3s gleam and or pameas compared to classical interpolation methods were observed during the first months of the rainy season may june while images frequency was low and soil drying up was fast fig 5 shows that the fusion approach is more able to reproduce surface response to the first rainfall events and consecutive drying up between two e3s estimates even if the amplitude of et variations were not always correct one can also observed that local calibration of pameas api parameters allows better depicting the impacts of rainfall events and of soil drying up in the core of the monsoon season august september most of the differences between interpolation methods on the retrieval of et was concentrated within the monsoon season during the dry season et was low and not subject to strong variations whatever the interpolation method rmse were in the order of 0 30 mm day 1 when considering the comparison to sispat simulations and in the order of 0 35 mm day 1 when considering ground observations biases were slightly positive in general lower than 0 05 mm day 1 not shown during the monsoon season the number of available images was low about 6 images per month in average compared to the dry season implying a large number of interpolated data periods of up to 20 days had sometimes to be reconstructed during this season rmse ranged between 0 84 and 1 21 mm day 1 which was significantly higher than over the entire study period note that the ranking of the methods was similar as for the entire period in table 2 negative biases were always larger than 0 1 mm day 1 and up to 0 5 mm day 1 depending on the interpolation method part of these biases came from an underestimation of et by e3s itself see table 4 and allies et al 2020 for more details 3 1 2 evaluation of interpolated et versus e3s estimates in order to evaluate the performance of the interpolation methods tables 3 and 4 and fig 6 present separated evaluations of et retrievals obtained i for days with available remote sensing data with e3s table 4 and blue points in fig 6 and ii for interpolated et between available e3s estimates table 3 and red points in fig 6 the impact of the interpolation procedure on the performance of the interpolation was evaluated through rmseint see eq 24 the differential rmse between the errors related to e3s rmsee3s and the errors calculated on interpolated data rmseint data rmsee3s 0 47 0 46 mm day 1 were strongly lower than the overall values of rmse presented in table 2 the impact of the interpolation procedure was either of similar magnitude rmseint between 0 43 and 0 58 for fusion egp and fusion egplc or larger up to 0 69 mm day 1 for interpol et0 the observation of the differences between the bias for e3s and the bias for the interpolated data indicated that the interpolation methods generally induce some underestimations in particular when the evaluation is performed against sispat simulations this underestimation was larger for fusion ep 0 13 mm day 1 and in general more limited for fusion egp and fusion eg the local calibration of api fusion egplc and fusion eplc was also reducing both bias and rmseint generated by the interpolation procedures 3 1 3 residual error analysis of et estimates residual errors εet predicted et sispat et for each fusion or interpolation method are computed at the wankama pixel scale the distributions of εet against standard deviation of sispat simulated et between two consecutive e3s estimates are shown in fig 7 the boxplots show for each approach the interquartile range of εet for the ranges of sispat standard deviation one can observe that εet interquartile range globally increases when the sispat standard deviation increases for low standard deviation 0 05 mm day 1 between two consecutive e3s estimates εet is still low 0 4 mm day 1 εet 0 9 mm day 1 for every fusion or interpolation method and no significant differences in εet distribution is observed between them all of them also show a εet slightly positively skewed for sispat standard deviation less than 0 05 mm day 1 for the range 0 05 0 5 mm day 1 of sispat standard deviation the εet distribution is quite symmetric for each interpolation and fusion method even if interpol rg and interpol et0 both show an underestimation trend for values outside the whiskers range fig 7f and g main differences in the distribution of εet between fusion and interpolation methods are observed for sispat standard deviation greater than 0 5 mm day 1 for such values both interpol rg and interpol et0 generally display a larger interquartile range than all of the fusion approaches for these interpolation methods the distribution of εet is negatively skewed for standard deviation ranges 0 5 1 and 1 1 5 mm day 1 and rather positively skewed for standard deviation greater than 1 5 mm day 1 fig 7f and g fusion eg shows a symmetric εet distribution for standard deviation range 0 5 1 mm day 1 negatively skewed for range 1 1 5 mm day 1 and slightly positively skewed for standard deviation 1 5 mm day 1 fig 7e fusion ep is characterized by a negatively skewed εet distribution for ranges 0 5 1 and 1 1 5 mm day 1 and symmetric for standard deviation 1 5 mm day 1 fig 7c fusion egp shows a negatively skewed εet distribution for ranges 0 5 1 and 1 1 5 mm day 1 and a positively skewed distribution for standard deviation 1 5 mm day 1 fig 7a one can observe that the local calibration of pameas api parameters reduces the εet interquartile range and generally also reduces the skewness of the εet distribution fig 7b and d indeed fusion egplc and fusion eplc clearly show a lower dispersion of εet as well as an average of εet close to 0 this confirms better performances of locally calibrated fusion approaches as shown in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 3 2 evaluation at mesoscale in this subsection comparison of the continuous daily et estimates obtained after each interpolation or fusion approach against ensemble average of almip2 lsms simulations is analyzed the comparison was done by considering spatial averages over the whole almip2 domain 20 800 km2 overall skill scores of this analysis are summarized in table 5 and illustrated in figs 8 and 9 many results of the mesoscale comparison were in line with those obtained at local scale on the wankama pixel table 5 the best performances were obtained with the fusion method using both gleam and pameas information egp the standard interpolation procedures rg and et0 had the lowest performances the fusion method based on pameas only had intermediary performance whereas the one based on gleam only showed quite similar results as those obtained with dual source fusion approaches main benefits of the fusion approach fusion egp and fusion egplc was observed during the first months of the rainy season fig 9 in the depiction of drying up phases between two consecutive rainfall events drying up amplitude and timing showing the interest of interpolation supports including information on either rainfall or surface soil moisture fields the main discrepancies between retrieved et and almip2 lsms occurred during the monsoon season and were characterized by a significant underestimation there were however significant differences rmse were significantly lower e g 0 46 for fusion egp to be compared to 0 64 0 68 at local scale the local calibration of pameas api parameters fusion egplc and fusion eplc had low impact on the performance see fig 8 and table 5 remember that in this case the api parameters obtained by calibration against sispat simulations over the millet field and the fallow were used all over the studied domain but tended to positively increase the bias no clear trend existed for the bias value versus the interpolation method the direct impact of the interpolation procedure rmseint table 6 was always larger than the errors generated by the application of e3s table 7 the difference was only slight when considering e3s gleam and pameas together rmsee3s 0 31 mm day 1 rmseint 0 35 0 38 mm day 1 but it increased when considering other methods and in particular standard interpolation with rg rmseint 0 56 mm day 1 and even worse for et0 0 63 mm day 1 for the latter the interpolation procedure was responsible of two thirds of the difference between rs based et estimates and almip2 lsms simulations 4 discussion in this study we introduced a new method to interpolate daily evapotranspiration between available remote sensing estimates the objective was to provide continuous estimates of et as required for many hydrological applications the method was applied to modis estimates of et at the kilometer resolution over the niamey area in niger broadly speaking our study shows that over the whole season cumulative et is fairly well represented with simple rg based or et0 based interpolation but that intra seasonal dynamics require something a little more complex in that sense the new methodology based on a data fusion algorithm provided better results than the standard methods that have been classically used for interpolating et estimates based on the interpolation of the ratio of et to rg or et0 the improvement was generally around 0 1 in terms of nse which indicates a better description of the variations of daily et this was clearly illustrated by the better depiction of the first precipitation events at the beginning of the rainy period fig 5 during the monsoon season while the number of e3s estimates was limited in reason of the low availability of modis data the improvement was also substantial the fusion method used information on soil drying up and rain events which were not available with the standard interpolation method it is difficult to compare our results to those obtained in previous studies as almost no analysis was published comparing standard methodologies based on the interpolation of simple ratio as defined by eqs 10 and 11 to methodologies introducing information on the timing of precipitations and drying kinetics when considering analysis of the interpolation of et on in situ datasets rmse ranging between 0 2 and 0 9 mm d 1 were obtained for a large range of ecosystems and climates over contiguous united states and the mediterranean delogu et al 2021 guillevic et al 2019 the lowest values were obtained under semi arid conditions over wheat crops in morocco delogu et al 2021 and woody savannahs in southwestern usa guillevic et al 2019 which were characterized by low daily et values larger rmse values above 0 4 mm d 1 were obtained in wetter conditions in particular for industrial crops grasslands and forests in our study the values of rmseint which quantify the impact of the interpolation method alone table 3 were falling in the middle of that range of performances 0 65 mm d 1 when using et0 and 0 58 mm d 1 when using rg rmseint for the fusion method was significantly lower 0 51 mm d 1 when considering evaluation of continuous estimates of daily et from satellite data combining errors on interpolation together with errors due to the estimation of et on days with remote sensing data the rmse values given in table 2 were lower than found in previous studies 0 8 mm d 1 over a dry saltmarsh scrubland interpolated et rg ratio gallego elvira et al 2013 1 1 to 1 8 mm d 1 over agricultural areas modis landsat fusion cammalleri et al 2013 0 9 mm d 1 over vineyards goes modis landsat fusion semmens et al 2016 conversely to our analysis none of these studies was using information on precipitation and drying kinetics in any situation the fusion method based on two interpolation supports fusion egp namely gleam and pameas provided better results than the use of one interpolation support at local scale the performance of fusion eg was similar to the performance of the standard interpolation methods table 2 at mesoscale vs almip2 ensemble simulations they were close to those of fusion egp table 5 on its side fusion ep based on pameas simulations had always lower performance than fusion egp at local scale vs flux tower measurements this seemed to demonstrate that both supports were providing interesting information for interpolating et estimates while at mesoscale gleam seemed to provide most of the information this may be related to the impact of the calibration of pameas over the whole domain indeed we shown at local scale that when pameas api parameters were calibrated on ground information here sispat simulations the performance of fusion methods using pameas were increased in our work it was not possible to calibrate the api formulation over different locations the possibility to use an api calibrated on ground data for different locations and in particular different land cover and soil types should be investigated in the future the differences in the performance of both mono interpolation support methods at local scale gave also an indication of the interest of using interpolation support at the finer resolution gleam in fusion eg is used at its original resolution i e 25 km while it is disaggregated at the kilometer resolution in fusion egp our results also illustrated that the interpolation process itself was usually generating larger errors in the derivation of continuous estimates of et than the direct estimation of et from remote sensing data in the best case fusion of e3s with gleam and pameas at local scale both errors had almost similar level this indicates that more efforts have to be done for improving interpolation procedures our study participated to these efforts in particular by showing that improvements can be obtained when introducing information on the kinetics of soil drying up and on the occurrence of precipitation events and probably the amount of rainfall water also compared to the number of studies proposing and analyzing et models the literature on et interpolation is reduced to a limited number of articles most of them only analyzed the results of the standard interpolation methods alfieri et al 2017 delogu et al 2021 guillevic et al 2019 lagouarde et al 2013 2010 this has maybe been related to the difficulties for obtaining accurate information on rain occurrence and amount in a distributed way over large areas while information on incoming solar radiation and on et0 have been more easily available actually various precipitation products are available nowadays they are derived from interpolation of gauge observations e g gpcc schneider et al 2014 cru chen et al 2008 satellite data e g chomps joseph et al 2009 cmorph joyce et al 2004 combination of satellite and gauge data e g chirps funk et al 2015 tmpa 3b42 huffman et al 2007 meteorological reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 or from the combination of satellite data gauge measurements and atmospheric model reanalysis e g mswep beck et al 2017 the new method developed in this study was applied for interpolating et estimated from modis data over a sahelian area one can wonder what would be the applicability of the method over other areas other climate or other sensors having different revisit characteristics concerning climate the number of available modis data for estimating et during the monsoon season is very limited implying the reconstruction of et for a very large proportion of days about 75 of et data have been interpolated in this study in this situation the new method proved to be efficient in comparison to the standard interpolation methods and we can anticipate it would perform correctly in situations with a larger density of available data this also indicates that the method could be transferred to the interpolation of et derived from sensors onboard landsat platforms with a long revisit time nonetheless in the case of a higher number of images the performance gain compared to a simpler interpolation method would probably become too low given the higher complexity of the fusion method developed in the present study one of the main advantages of the method relies on the integration of precipitation data that provide essential information on the variations of et during long period this is in line with the results obtained by delogu et al 2021 over a large number of in situ datasets however an analysis of the interest of such method over very long period up to several weeks without et data as it can happen when using landsat data still has to be investigated one can anticipate that in such situation the performance of the method would greatly depends on the quality of the calibration of an interpolation support such as pameas it should also be noticed that precipitation information is not sufficient for following the alternation of wetting drying events over irrigated areas information on irrigation calendar and amounts is very difficult to obtain in these cases the interest of using remote sensing data sensitive to surface soil moisture as microwave backscattering has to be investigated gleam is already integrating microwave data but with a spatial resolution not suitable for the detection of irrigation events the use of microwave data such as those provided by sentinel 1a and 1b with a revisit cycle of 6 days might be used for detecting at least some of the irrigation events and also for helping in the calibration of interpolation support as pameas another advantage of the methodology relies on the use of models that describe the evolution of surface water status and provide information on the kinetics of et over time in our case such information is provided either by pameas at the pixel scale and gleam at mesoscale other surface water balance models could be used such as the simpkcet model olioso et al 2019 ollivier et al 2021 which is developed from the fao56 method allen et al 1998 and can be applied to a wide range of ecosystems 5 conclusion the purpose of this work was to build a multi resolution and multi source remote sensing data fusion approach to produce continuous daily et maps at 1 km resolution in sahelian areas the proposition of such an approach appeared to be a key issue for sahelian areas given the inefficiency of standard temporal interpolation techniques for long return intervals and wam linked cloud cover during the rainy season the proposed methodology relied on the use of the gleam global et product and a parametric model named pameas as a normalized basis to fill gaps in modis based e3s et estimates between two clear sky days acquisition the fusion approach was compared to more classical temporal interpolation techniques involving the linear interpolation of the ratio between et and rg or et0 rs based et estimates were evaluated in southwest niger during the 2005 2008 period at i the pixel scale against eddy covariance measurements and simulations of a beforehand calibrated validated land surface model named sispat ii at mesoscale against simulations of the 20 regional almip2 lsms as a reference basis at pixel scale fusion based et estimates showed good skill scores compared both to sispat simulations rmse 0 68 mm day 1 nse 0 79 r2 0 80 and field measurements rmse 0 64 mm day 1 nse 0 78 r2 0 79 compared to et0 and rg based interpolation techniques the fusion approach allowed significantly reducing rsme and enhancing nse and r2 with respect to observations and sispat simulations the main benefits of the fusion algorithm are observed during the first months of the rainy season in its capacity to reproduce the alternation between et peaks and drying up phases residual error analysis showed that the fusion approach reduces the interpolated rs based et error for high values 0 5 mm day 1 of observed et standard deviation between two available estimates quite similar results are obtained at mesoscale compared to the mesoscale mean of almip2 models simulations showing the spatial consistency of the here developed fusion algorithm we also show that fusion based et estimates are in better agreement with lsms references at both local and mesoscale than those based on either gleam or pameas estimates alone showing the benefit of the multi source fusion approach the local calibration of pameas api parameters substantially improves performance of the fusion approach at local scale without modifying its performance at mesoscale this last point highlights the interest of a multi point local calibration of the model against surface soil moisture measurements for future improvements of the fusion approach it is believed that such a fusion approach is particularly appealing to take advantage of multi source and multi resolution datasets to produce consistent continuous et estimates this fusion technique will be implemented in other mesoscale areas in sahelo saharan mali and sudanian benin instrumented in the framework of the amma catch nos to evaluate the replicability of the methodology finally given the need of fine scale et estimates and the recent development of disaggregation algorithms we suggest that such a fusion approach could be used as a first stage in a disaggregation chain to ensure better consistency between continuous multi resolution et estimates funding the

appendix c local calibration of pameas against sispat reference simulations pameas was calibrated against the simulations of sispat on the 2005 2012 period calibrated values of parameters used in the formulations of api e and t are presented in table c 1 for the millet field and the fallow respectively calibration was performed to minimize root mean square error rmse and maximize nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 together to find the set of parameters providing the best trade off very good performances are observed between simulated api from pameas and simulated 0 10 cm soil water content from sispat for both ecosystems with nevertheless a slight negative bias of 0 18 and 0 05 mm for the millet crop and the fallow respectively table c 2 for both ecosystems api is very well correlated to 0 10 cm soil water content with r2 of 0 88 and 0 93 for the millet field and the fallow respectively table c 2 likewise very good skill scores are obtained for soil evaporation for both ecosystems with again a slight negative bias supposed mainly due to api underestimation table c 2 for transpiration pameas is in good agreement with sispat during the ascending phase of the transpiration cycle during this period we observed an increase of the root zone soil moisture with an infiltration from the surface to deep layers peaking at a maximum shortly after the last rainfall not shown during this period sensible heat h is relatively constant and near zero all of the available energy at the surface is thus used for et vegetation is not stressed and transpiration variations are mainly controlled by incoming solar radiation once this root zone soil moisture peak has passed transpiration is capping and supports all the et since surface water content is dried up h is increasing leading to a competition for available energy between t and the heating of the surface stomatal resistance term is more and more preponderant and vegetation is thus subject to water stress finally transpiration is rapidly decreasing less or more exponentially following the root zone soil water content depletion with very low sensitivity to incoming radiation consequently as expected during this phase pameas is significantly less correlated with sispat since it does not take into account any water stress not shown for purposes of application in a data fusion approach with modis based e3s estimates this model s drift is not critical because images frequency is high during this period allies et al 2020 and day to day et variation are slight finally adding e and t terms et simulated by pameas is in very good agreement with sispat with nse values of 0 85 and 0 90 for the millet crop and the fallow respectively table c 2 and fig c 1 
3564,identifying the influence of seasonal source water on tree growth is essential to understand the effect of climate change on forest dynamics however due to the lack of available long term monitoring studies little is known on how long moisture originating from winter precipitation influences tree growth in the following growing season herein we developed a tree ring latewood oxygen isotope δ18olw chronology from the karakoram 1955 2013 in northern pakistan we investigated whether winter climate signals are incorporated in the δ18olw and how long winter precipitation through soil moisture contributed to tree growth during the growing season significant correlations were found between δ18olw with both winter to spring january may temperature r 0 43 p 0 05 and summer july august precipitation local r 0 38 p 0 05 moisture source region r 0 44 p 0 05 as shown by the cross spectrum and commonality analysis the climate signals in the δ18olw are frequency dependent winter temperature signals stored in the δ18olw variations dominate at low frequencies more than 7 years 59 variance explained while the summer precipitation signals dominate variations with higher frequencies shorter than 7 years 47 variance explained further analysis using reanalysis data shows that the growing season soil moisture at root depth 10 40 cm is more strongly related to winter precipitation than to summer rainfall winter precipitation formed as ground snow provides root zone soil moisture and tree growth via snowmelt during the growing season our study highlights that winter precipitation is the dominant water source contributing to karakoram tree growth until the late growing season given the possibility of a decrease in winter precipitation under climate change in the karakoram region local forest is potentially threatened by the declining water supply during the growing season keywords source water tree ring latewood stable oxygen isotope frequency dependence karakoram 1 introduction forests play an important role for the hydrological and carbon cycles however widespread forest mortality in recent decades has been observed at regional and global scales due to climate change induced water deficiency liu et al 2013 liang et al 2016 anderegg et al 2020 to better predict how ongoing climate change will affect forest ecosystems it is essential to understand the contribution of precipitation from different seasons and or water sources from different soil depths to tree growth however knowledge about such information is still incomplete partly due to lack of available in situ observations on the relocation of seasonal atmospheric precipitation in different soil depths and the subsequent water uptake by tree roots another important source of uncertainty is related to seasonal shifts in precipitation regimes associated with changing circulation systems e g the tibetan plateau liu et al 2016 stable oxygen isotopes are an efficient tracer for differing water sources on tree growth isotopic monitoring of xylem water and potential water pools e g seasonal precipitation soil moisture and or groundwater has been frequently used since the 1990s ehleringer et al 1991 ehleringer and dawson 1992 a clear picture about the use of source water from different soil depths of trees dai et al 2020 ripullone et al 2020 and seasonal precipitation e g szymczak et al 2020 have thus been yielded however such an approach is usually limited by the need of complex instrumentation analysis and short recurring sampling intervals which are often difficult to perpetuate for longer periods in remote study site locations such requirements often limit the capability to investigate the response of forests coping with long term climate change induced changes in water availability tree ring isotopes mainly δ18o act as an additional tool to retrieve information about long term water sources for tree growth wang et al 2021 as illustrated by the isotopic fractionation theories source water and leaf enrichment dominate tree ring δ18o variations and their relative strength depends on the investigated sites and species mccarroll and loader 2004 for some cases with constant leaf enrichment tree ring δ18o is capable to reflect the water source variations e g berkelhammer et al 2020 specifically in monsoon influenced areas detected summer precipitation signals in tree ring δ18o seem to suggest summer precipitation being the primary water source for the whole growing season grießinger et al 2011 sano et al 2013 wernicke et al 2017 fan et al 2020 muangsong et al 2020 likewise in regions with a dominant winter precipitation regime winter climate signals in tree ring δ18o indicate that winter precipitation has also been evidenced to supply tree growth in the subsequent vegetation period holzkämper et al 2008 liu et al 2009 leonelli et al 2017 huang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 despite of such inspiring progress in disentangling the influence of melt water from winter precipitation on tree growth little is known whether and how winter precipitation can influence tree growth during the late growing season e g martin et al 2018 this study aims to explore whether winter precipitation through its influence on soil water contributes to tree growth until the late growing season using a newly developed tree ring latewood oxygen isotope δ18olw series from the karakoram based on the fact that snow patches are still found at our investigated tree stand during the phase of latewood formation in early june we hypothesize that precipitation originating from the winter season can contribute to tree growth until the late growing period the obtained results will help evaluate how changes in seasonal precipitation will affect forest growth in our study region and further foster the climatic interpretation of tree ring δ18o series 2 material and methods 2 1 study area our study site is located in the bagrot valley in the northern karakoram of pakistan 74 65 e 36 02 n fig 1 a as inferred from the nearest cru ts 4 01 grid points harris et al 2014 the mean annual precipitation is 302 00 mm with 11 5 of it falling during summer july august fig 1b the coldest and warmest months are january 11 6 c and july 12 2 c respectively the dominant tree species are juniper pine and spruce with juniper growing on southern slopes and pine spruce being dominant on northern expositions asad et al 2017 as inferred from daily temperature observations wang et al 2019 from the bagrot valley and findings on the temperature thresholds for the cambial activity of conifers on the tibetan plateau minimum temperature 0 7 c li et al 2017 the timings of the beginning and the end of the cambial activity are defined as early june late august respectively fig s1 the lagrangian trajectory based dynamic recycling model was applied to reveal the dominant summer moisture source regions affecting our sampling site 74 5 75 5 e 35 5 36 5 n this model was initially proposed by dominguez et al 2006 and extended by hua et al 2017 within this model daily backward moisture trajectories originating from our sampling site was yielded and the contributions of the moisture sources along the moisture trajectories were then estimated by integrating the water vapor budget equation herein we employed 15 day backward moisture tracking for each gridded point for the spatial range of 74 5 75 5 e 35 5 36 5 n with era interim reanalysis during 1979 2015 dee et al 2011 as shown in fig 1c the july august precipitation mainly originates from neighboring regions south and west to the sampling site in northern pakistan and afghanistan such moisture source patterns may be linked with topography and atmospheric circulations based on these results we selected a spatial range spanning 69 5 75 5 e and 34 37 5 n rectangle in fig 1c as the main moisture source region for our further climatological analyses other details about the lagrangian trajectory based dynamic recycling model are given in supporting materials zhong et al 2019 and hua et al 2017 2 2 tree ring sampling and latewood δ18o chronology development we did fieldwork in early june 2014 during which snow patches were still found in the forest and surface soil appears moist fig s2 tree ring samples from 33 living and dominant pine trees were collected in a pine birch ecotone near the upper forest limit 3550 3710 m a s l fig s2 for the isotope analyses five cores from five trees spanning the period 1950 2013 were chosen fulfilling the analytical preconditions of wider rings and clear tree ring boundaries the ages of five selected trees were 388 1626 2013 346 1668 2013 234 1780 2013 349 1665 2013 387 1627 2013 respectively the tree ring width chronologies among the five selected trees showed good coherence rbar 0 452 during 1627 2013 as indicated by interannual comparison and their correlation matrix fig s3a b latewood of each year from each tree was separated visually under a microscope and α cellulose was extracted following the method by wieloch et al 2011 subsequently all α cellulose samples were homogenized using an ultrasonic system laumer et al 2009 followed by freeze drying the oxygen isotopes ratios of the cellulose samples were finally measured with a delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fischer scientific inc bremen germany coupled to a hekatech pyrolysis reactor in the tree ring laboratory of the institute of geography at friedrich alexander university of erlangen nuremberg germany the analytical precision of the isotopic measurements was better than 0 2 the resulting five individual latewood δ18o series were averaged to develop the final δ18o site chronology 2 3 identification of seasonal climate signals in latewood δ18olw to reveal the climatic signals influencing the δ18olw values we calculated pearson s correlation coefficients between δ18olw and different climate variables including monthly mean temperature and precipitation the climate data originate from the cru ts 4 01 dataset which is available in 0 5 0 5 degree resolution harris et al 2014 the reasons why we used cru instead of local meteorological data include 1 cru can provide moisture source climates which is found to influence the tree ring δ18o variability e g sano et al 2018 2 the reliability of the cru in our study area has been verified fig s4 as upstream moisture transport processes e g rainout may imprint in the δ18o signature of precipitation cai et al 2018 and tree ring cellulose sano et al 2017 both a moisture source region and a local climate region were considered for the climate proxy calibration the area of 74 5 75 5 e 35 5 36 5 n completely covering our sampling site 74 65 e 36 02 n and four closest cru grid points 74 75 e 36 25 n 75 25 e 36 25 n 74 75 e 35 75 n 75 25 e 35 75 n was defined as local climate region the spatial range of the moisture source region was defined by a moisture source detection analysis including 80 cru grid points and finally covers the area 69 5 75 5e 34 37 5n moreover since most nearby meteorological stations were installed after 1955 correlation analysis was limited to the period of 1955 2013 e g asad et al 2017 rather than using the highly interpolated cru dataset in the period 1901 1954 to identify possible frequency dependent climate signals retained in the tree ring lamarche 1974 fang et al 2009 correlations were performed for the raw and first differenced data respectively we also performed cross spectral analysis between δ18olw and mainly targeted climate variables to identify the frequency domains in δ18olw which strongly encoded climatic signals cook et al 2003 the correspondence between δ18olw and climate data was evaluated by cross coherence spectra 2 4 commonality analysis of climatic variables and δ18olw we applied a commonality analysis to quantify the effect of dominant climate variables on δ18olw in different frequency domains the respective climate variables were selected based on the correlation results and the chosen frequency domains are dependent on the cross spectral analysis details about why we chose 7 year frequency are provided in section 3 3 the commonality analysis yielded the pure and joint effects of all predictors on the response variables all the analysis was performed in r r core team 2020 using the yhat package nimon et al 2021 2 5 linkage of summer soil moisture with snowmelt and rainfall the use of land surface models can disentangle water movement processes in the soil kong et al 2019 supporting the interpretation of climate signals in δ18olw and source water for forest huang et al 2019 hence we used the global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model l4 monthly 0 25 x 0 25 v2 0 gldas noah025 m rodell et al 2004 we selected the gldas noah dataset as it performed the best as a whole against insitu observations on the tibetan plateau compared to other reanalysis datasets zhang et al 2018 based on our field observations maximum soil depths in the karakoram mountains are generally low 50 cm fig s2a consequently we mainly focus on soil moisture data at the 0 10 cm and 10 40 cm depth levels from gldas noah025 m besides soil moisture rainfall and snowmelt close to our sampling site were extracted then correlation coefficients between july august soil moisture at both soil levels and monthly rainfall as well as snowmelt were computed for the common period 1955 2013 potential effects of snowmelt and rainfall on july august soil moisture in the respective soil levels were thus investigated furthermore daily soil moisture at 0 10 cm 10 40 cm snowmelt rainfall for our sampling site from gldas noah rodell et al 2004 were also compared to explore how the winter precipitation is used for tree growth 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the δ18olw chronology the developed δ18olw chronology spans the period 1950 2013 64 years and has a mean value of 33 36 with a maximum of 37 30 in 2001 and a minimum of 28 25 in 1959 fig 2 a its standard deviation sd first order autocorrelation ac1 and mean sensitivity values are 1 76 0 31 and 0 05 respectively the mean correlation rbar of 0 72 and eps expressed populational signal of 0 93 demonstrate that the five individual δ18olw series share a strong coherency and that the δ18olw chronology is reliable to represent population variations 3 2 climatic signals in δ18olw the climate proxy relationships differ for the raw and first differenced data respectively for the raw data δ18olw exhibit pronounced linkages with local temperatures in october november january february march april and with local precipitation amounts in july and august fig 3 a as the moisture source region is only used for summer july august season attention is thus paid to linkages with summer climates of moisture source region δ18olw variations reveal significant correlations with summer precipitation amount from moisture source regions fig 3c strong seasonal linkages for the raw data exist for summer precipitation july aug local r 0 38 p 0 05 moisture source regions r 0 44 p 0 05 and local tmean jan may r 0 43 p 0 05 or tmean poct may r 0 44 p 0 05 furthermore for the first differenced data no clear relationship with temperature is apparent whereas highest correlations occur with july august precipitation amount fig 3b local r 0 60 p 0 05 fig 3d moisture source regions r 0 66 p 0 05 in summary this suggests that raw δ18olw is mainly controlled by summer precipitation jul aug at both local and moisture source region scale and with local mean winter temperatures tmean jan may or tmean poct may fig s5a c e whereas the first differenced interannual variability is dominated by summer precipitation jul aug for both local and moisture source region fig s5d f based on these results we selected local tmean jan may and precip jul aug from local and moisture source regions for the subsequent coherency spectrum and commonality analysis 3 3 frequency dependent features of dominant climate variables the coherency spectra of δ18olw with precip jul aug of local and moisture source regions and tmean jan may of local are displayed in fig 4 the chosen frequency of 1 7 is the demarcation to distinguish their relationships fig s6 specifically at frequencies higher than 1 7 7 years best coherency occurs with precip jul aug from both local and moisture source regions fig 4a b for frequencies shorter than 1 7 7 years high coherency is found with tmean jan may of local region and precip jul aug of moisture source region fig 4c summarized these results reveal that the high frequency domain 7 years of δ18olw is mainly driven by precip jul aug from both investigated areas in contrast the low frequency domains 7 years are collectively controlled by local tmean jan may and summer precip jul aug of moisture source regions 3 4 commonality analysis of dominant climate variables and δ18olw for the raw data the model explained 41 94 of the variance of δ18olw fig 5 a the strongest influence came from x1 22 16 followed by the joint effect between x2 and x3 18 53 the pure effects from x2 and x3 were much lower 0 22 5 09 than from x1 for the 7 year low pass filtered data the model accounted for 64 39 of the variance of δ18olw fig 5b with the strongest effect from pure x1 59 04 followed by the pure effect of x3 11 46 for the 7 year high pass filtered data the model accounted for 47 98 of the variance of δ18olw fig 5c the dominant influence derived from the joint effect between x2 and x3 38 42 followed by the pure effect of x3 7 49 in summary for the frequency domains shorter than 7 years δ18olw is primarily controlled by the pure and joint effects from summer precipitation jul aug from the moisture source region and summer precipitation jul aug from the local area total 46 74 x2 x3 x6 in fig 5c with the former being dominant on the frequency domains more than 7 years tmean jan may local and precip jul aug moisture source predominantly the variability of δ18olw with the former being strongest 59 04 explained variance 3 5 correlations of rainfall and snowmelt with summer soil moisture bagrot summer soil moisture at 0 10 cm level had the highest correlations with the july rainfall amount r 0 59 p 0 01 fig 6 a followed by the july august rainfall amount r 0 54 p 0 01 in contrast bagrot summer soil moisture at 10 40 cm level showed the closest linkage with april snowmelt r 0 45 p 0 01 with the highest seasonal correlation with march may r 0 54 p 0 01 fig 6b these documents that summer soil moisture at 0 10 cm level is mainly influenced by summer rainfall whereas the moisture in deeper soil layers of 10 40 cm depth mainly depends on winter spring snowmelt respectively daily comparisons among soil moisture at 0 10 cm 10 40 cm snowmelt rainfall reveal a clear picture about how winter precipitation is used for tree growth during the growing period fig 7 as air temperature begins over zero around march ground snow starts to melt and infiltrate into soil surface soil moisture at 0 10 cm is firstly supplied from snowmelt and then the deeper moisture at 10 40 cm starts to increase during late growing periods snowmelt is always larger than the directly rainfall supply therefore compared with summer rainfall snowmelt from winter precipitation i e snow provides more water supply for soil moisture and hence tree water use in the late growing period fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 continuous influence of winter precipitation on tree growth the moisture contribution from winter precipitation to tree growth can persist until the late growing season as indirectly inferred from the tmean jan may signals on the frequency domains more than 7 years tmean jan may signals are mainly transferred to δ18olw through snowmelt processes as detected by isotope enabled model and annual tree ring δ18o variations from the nearby western himalayas huang et al 2019 this study provides the isotopic evidence that winter precipitation affects latewood development by the processes of soil moisture fig s7 fig s11 besides soil depth in our sampling site is less than 50 cm fig s2 we inferred tree growth could mainly use the soil moisture less than 50 cm as shown in fig 6 july august soil moisture at 10 40 cm showed strong linkages with the snowmelt providing additional evidence that trees in the region mainly use winter precipitation derived snowmelt moreover daily comparisons among variables from gldas noah showed that snowmelt from winter precipitation i e snow provided more water supply for soil moisture at 10 40 cm and hence tree water use in the late growing period fig 7 as mentioned in the ipcc report ipcc 2021 snowfall in this region is projected to decrease in the future such snowfall decrease will lead to soil moisture drying at 10 40 cm which likely increases drought stress for trees our results are supported by findings from the western usa ehleringer et al 1991 martin et al 2018 southwestern usa kerhoulas et al 2017 and eastern england robertson et al 2001 with same persisting effect from winter precipitation on tree growth during the late growing season similar effect of winter precipitation on vascular plant growth until the late growing season has also been evidenced in the altai mountains shi et al 2019 however such results are in contrast with studies from the central himalayas an et al 2019 the southeastern tibetan plateau zeng et al 2014 southeastern china an et al 2012 liu et al 2012 fu et al 2017 eastern austria haupt et al 2011 the southwestern usa szejner et al 2016 roden and ehleringer 2007 for these sites no evidence of winter precipitation effect on the tree growth is observed during the late growing season which leads to dominant summer climatic signals reflected by δ18olw e g figs s8 s10 as exemplified by sites from the central himalayas and the southern tibetan plateau 4 2 summer precipitation amount effect in the higher frequency variability of δ18olw the summer precipitation amount from local and moisture source regions mainly influences the δ18olw variations on the frequency domains shorter than 7 years fig 4 and fig 5 we suggest two reasons being responsible for these findings first as indicated by the monthly climate diagram fig 1b fig s11 soil moisture from summer rainfall is evaporating much faster in the karakoram due to less rainfall and high evaporation during summer this leads to the fact that summer rainfall dominantly contributes to surface soil moisture at 0 10 cm depths fig 6a second summer surface soil moisture at 0 10 cm is much lower than at 10 40 cm 63 mm month vs 210 mm month bagrot site from gldas noah 2 0 dataset the amount of summer precipitation is only moisturizing the upper surface soil 0 10 cm and is therefore too limited to overprint the stored winter precipitation moisture in the deeper soil levels 10 40 cm a corresponding limited influence of summer precipitation amount on surface soil moisture and forest has also been reported in a study from the western usa martin et al 2018 notably tree physiological influences on δ18olw seem to be limited in our case as indicated by the weak linkage of δ18olw with the july august relative humidity r 0 01 p 0 05 and vapor pressure deficit r 0 025 p 0 05 such weak effects of physiological processes on tree ring δ18o are in line with findings from the western himalayas huang et al 2019 amazon basin brienen et al 2012 and south africa van der sleen et al 2015 in contrast pronounced physiological effects on δ18o have been found for sites in hawaii kahmen et al 2011 and for floodplains of the amazon river cintra et al 2019 highly differing local climates especially regarding humidity may explain differences in the physiological influence on tree ring δ18o e g cintra et al 2019 further studies using process based models with empirical observations are urgently needed to quantify such physiological effects and source water influences on tree ring δ18o e g song et al 2014 li et al 2021 4 3 comparison with regional tree ring δ18o studies the relative ratio of summer to winter precipitation amount likely triggers the relative strengths of winter and summer climatic signals in tree ring δ18o specifically for our bagrot site with a low ratio of summer to winter precipitation amount winter precipitation and summer precipitation amounts can highly affect the moisture of soil levels differently in time fig 6a b this results in obtained winter climatic signals at the low frequency more than 7 years and summer precipitation amount signals on the high frequency less than 7 years for δ18olw from a regional scale perspective ratios of summer to winter precipitation are increasing from northwest to southeast e g from the karakoram to the western himalayas the central himalayas the eastern himalayas the southern tibetan plateau fig 1 accordingly winter climatic signals in tree ring δ18o become weaker from bagrot zhada to keylong and manali sano et al 2017 managave et al 2020 and even finally disappear in the core monsoon regions bhutan sano et al 2013 mimei wernicke et al 2017 in contrast from southeast to northwest summer climatic signals are weakening from mimei and bhutan to manali keylong zhada sano et al 2013 2017 wernicke et al 2017 huang et al 2019 managave et al 2020 and are finally only found for high frequency domains at our sampling sites bagrot such patterns are also detectable for the western usa with a clear winter summer precipitation gradient williams and ehleringer 2000 szejner et al 2016 consequently more systematic research efforts should be undertaken to quantify how the ratios of winter to summer precipitation influence the climatic interpretation of tree ring δ18o 5 conclusions the contribution of winter precipitation to tree growth can persist into the late growing season in the karakoram as suggested by the winter temperature signals of tree ring δ18olw on the frequencies more than 7 years such results are caused by the dominant contribution of winter spring snowmelt to the summer soil moisture at 10 40 cm as inferred from the nearby gridded data of gldas noah output besides summer precipitation amount is also utilized for forest growth during the late growing season as induced from summer precipitation amount signals of tree ring δ18olw however summer precipitation mainly plays a role on tree ring δ18olw in the high frequencies shorter than 7 years which likely results from the primary contribution of summer precipitation on the summer soil moisture at 0 10 cm this study implies that there may be increasing risks of drought stress for tree growth in the

3564,identifying the influence of seasonal source water on tree growth is essential to understand the effect of climate change on forest dynamics however due to the lack of available long term monitoring studies little is known on how long moisture originating from winter precipitation influences tree growth in the following growing season herein we developed a tree ring latewood oxygen isotope δ18olw chronology from the karakoram 1955 2013 in northern pakistan we investigated whether winter climate signals are incorporated in the δ18olw and how long winter precipitation through soil moisture contributed to tree growth during the growing season significant correlations were found between δ18olw with both winter to spring january may temperature r 0 43 p 0 05 and summer july august precipitation local r 0 38 p 0 05 moisture source region r 0 44 p 0 05 as shown by the cross spectrum and commonality analysis the climate signals in the δ18olw are frequency dependent winter temperature signals stored in the δ18olw variations dominate at low frequencies more than 7 years 59 variance explained while the summer precipitation signals dominate variations with higher frequencies shorter than 7 years 47 variance explained further analysis using reanalysis data shows that the growing season soil moisture at root depth 10 40 cm is more strongly related to winter precipitation than to summer rainfall winter precipitation formed as ground snow provides root zone soil moisture and tree growth via snowmelt during the growing season our study highlights that winter precipitation is the dominant water source contributing to karakoram tree growth until the late growing season given the possibility of a decrease in winter precipitation under climate change in the karakoram region local forest is potentially threatened by the declining water supply during the growing season keywords source water tree ring latewood stable oxygen isotope frequency dependence karakoram 1 introduction forests play an important role for the hydrological and carbon cycles however widespread forest mortality in recent decades has been observed at regional and global scales due to climate change induced water deficiency liu et al 2013 liang et al 2016 anderegg et al 2020 to better predict how ongoing climate change will affect forest ecosystems it is essential to understand the contribution of precipitation from different seasons and or water sources from different soil depths to tree growth however knowledge about such information is still incomplete partly due to lack of available in situ observations on the relocation of seasonal atmospheric precipitation in different soil depths and the subsequent water uptake by tree roots another important source of uncertainty is related to seasonal shifts in precipitation regimes associated with changing circulation systems e g the tibetan plateau liu et al 2016 stable oxygen isotopes are an efficient tracer for differing water sources on tree growth isotopic monitoring of xylem water and potential water pools e g seasonal precipitation soil moisture and or groundwater has been frequently used since the 1990s ehleringer et al 1991 ehleringer and dawson 1992 a clear picture about the use of source water from different soil depths of trees dai et al 2020 ripullone et al 2020 and seasonal precipitation e g szymczak et al 2020 have thus been yielded however such an approach is usually limited by the need of complex instrumentation analysis and short recurring sampling intervals which are often difficult to perpetuate for longer periods in remote study site locations such requirements often limit the capability to investigate the response of forests coping with long term climate change induced changes in water availability tree ring isotopes mainly δ18o act as an additional tool to retrieve information about long term water sources for tree growth wang et al 2021 as illustrated by the isotopic fractionation theories source water and leaf enrichment dominate tree ring δ18o variations and their relative strength depends on the investigated sites and species mccarroll and loader 2004 for some cases with constant leaf enrichment tree ring δ18o is capable to reflect the water source variations e g berkelhammer et al 2020 specifically in monsoon influenced areas detected summer precipitation signals in tree ring δ18o seem to suggest summer precipitation being the primary water source for the whole growing season grießinger et al 2011 sano et al 2013 wernicke et al 2017 fan et al 2020 muangsong et al 2020 likewise in regions with a dominant winter precipitation regime winter climate signals in tree ring δ18o indicate that winter precipitation has also been evidenced to supply tree growth in the subsequent vegetation period holzkämper et al 2008 liu et al 2009 leonelli et al 2017 huang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 despite of such inspiring progress in disentangling the influence of melt water from winter precipitation on tree growth little is known whether and how winter precipitation can influence tree growth during the late growing season e g martin et al 2018 this study aims to explore whether winter precipitation through its influence on soil water contributes to tree growth until the late growing season using a newly developed tree ring latewood oxygen isotope δ18olw series from the karakoram based on the fact that snow patches are still found at our investigated tree stand during the phase of latewood formation in early june we hypothesize that precipitation originating from the winter season can contribute to tree growth until the late growing period the obtained results will help evaluate how changes in seasonal precipitation will affect forest growth in our study region and further foster the climatic interpretation of tree ring δ18o series 2 material and methods 2 1 study area our study site is located in the bagrot valley in the northern karakoram of pakistan 74 65 e 36 02 n fig 1 a as inferred from the nearest cru ts 4 01 grid points harris et al 2014 the mean annual precipitation is 302 00 mm with 11 5 of it falling during summer july august fig 1b the coldest and warmest months are january 11 6 c and july 12 2 c respectively the dominant tree species are juniper pine and spruce with juniper growing on southern slopes and pine spruce being dominant on northern expositions asad et al 2017 as inferred from daily temperature observations wang et al 2019 from the bagrot valley and findings on the temperature thresholds for the cambial activity of conifers on the tibetan plateau minimum temperature 0 7 c li et al 2017 the timings of the beginning and the end of the cambial activity are defined as early june late august respectively fig s1 the lagrangian trajectory based dynamic recycling model was applied to reveal the dominant summer moisture source regions affecting our sampling site 74 5 75 5 e 35 5 36 5 n this model was initially proposed by dominguez et al 2006 and extended by hua et al 2017 within this model daily backward moisture trajectories originating from our sampling site was yielded and the contributions of the moisture sources along the moisture trajectories were then estimated by integrating the water vapor budget equation herein we employed 15 day backward moisture tracking for each gridded point for the spatial range of 74 5 75 5 e 35 5 36 5 n with era interim reanalysis during 1979 2015 dee et al 2011 as shown in fig 1c the july august precipitation mainly originates from neighboring regions south and west to the sampling site in northern pakistan and afghanistan such moisture source patterns may be linked with topography and atmospheric circulations based on these results we selected a spatial range spanning 69 5 75 5 e and 34 37 5 n rectangle in fig 1c as the main moisture source region for our further climatological analyses other details about the lagrangian trajectory based dynamic recycling model are given in supporting materials zhong et al 2019 and hua et al 2017 2 2 tree ring sampling and latewood δ18o chronology development we did fieldwork in early june 2014 during which snow patches were still found in the forest and surface soil appears moist fig s2 tree ring samples from 33 living and dominant pine trees were collected in a pine birch ecotone near the upper forest limit 3550 3710 m a s l fig s2 for the isotope analyses five cores from five trees spanning the period 1950 2013 were chosen fulfilling the analytical preconditions of wider rings and clear tree ring boundaries the ages of five selected trees were 388 1626 2013 346 1668 2013 234 1780 2013 349 1665 2013 387 1627 2013 respectively the tree ring width chronologies among the five selected trees showed good coherence rbar 0 452 during 1627 2013 as indicated by interannual comparison and their correlation matrix fig s3a b latewood of each year from each tree was separated visually under a microscope and α cellulose was extracted following the method by wieloch et al 2011 subsequently all α cellulose samples were homogenized using an ultrasonic system laumer et al 2009 followed by freeze drying the oxygen isotopes ratios of the cellulose samples were finally measured with a delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fischer scientific inc bremen germany coupled to a hekatech pyrolysis reactor in the tree ring laboratory of the institute of geography at friedrich alexander university of erlangen nuremberg germany the analytical precision of the isotopic measurements was better than 0 2 the resulting five individual latewood δ18o series were averaged to develop the final δ18o site chronology 2 3 identification of seasonal climate signals in latewood δ18olw to reveal the climatic signals influencing the δ18olw values we calculated pearson s correlation coefficients between δ18olw and different climate variables including monthly mean temperature and precipitation the climate data originate from the cru ts 4 01 dataset which is available in 0 5 0 5 degree resolution harris et al 2014 the reasons why we used cru instead of local meteorological data include 1 cru can provide moisture source climates which is found to influence the tree ring δ18o variability e g sano et al 2018 2 the reliability of the cru in our study area has been verified fig s4 as upstream moisture transport processes e g rainout may imprint in the δ18o signature of precipitation cai et al 2018 and tree ring cellulose sano et al 2017 both a moisture source region and a local climate region were considered for the climate proxy calibration the area of 74 5 75 5 e 35 5 36 5 n completely covering our sampling site 74 65 e 36 02 n and four closest cru grid points 74 75 e 36 25 n 75 25 e 36 25 n 74 75 e 35 75 n 75 25 e 35 75 n was defined as local climate region the spatial range of the moisture source region was defined by a moisture source detection analysis including 80 cru grid points and finally covers the area 69 5 75 5e 34 37 5n moreover since most nearby meteorological stations were installed after 1955 correlation analysis was limited to the period of 1955 2013 e g asad et al 2017 rather than using the highly interpolated cru dataset in the period 1901 1954 to identify possible frequency dependent climate signals retained in the tree ring lamarche 1974 fang et al 2009 correlations were performed for the raw and first differenced data respectively we also performed cross spectral analysis between δ18olw and mainly targeted climate variables to identify the frequency domains in δ18olw which strongly encoded climatic signals cook et al 2003 the correspondence between δ18olw and climate data was evaluated by cross coherence spectra 2 4 commonality analysis of climatic variables and δ18olw we applied a commonality analysis to quantify the effect of dominant climate variables on δ18olw in different frequency domains the respective climate variables were selected based on the correlation results and the chosen frequency domains are dependent on the cross spectral analysis details about why we chose 7 year frequency are provided in section 3 3 the commonality analysis yielded the pure and joint effects of all predictors on the response variables all the analysis was performed in r r core team 2020 using the yhat package nimon et al 2021 2 5 linkage of summer soil moisture with snowmelt and rainfall the use of land surface models can disentangle water movement processes in the soil kong et al 2019 supporting the interpretation of climate signals in δ18olw and source water for forest huang et al 2019 hence we used the global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model l4 monthly 0 25 x 0 25 v2 0 gldas noah025 m rodell et al 2004 we selected the gldas noah dataset as it performed the best as a whole against insitu observations on the tibetan plateau compared to other reanalysis datasets zhang et al 2018 based on our field observations maximum soil depths in the karakoram mountains are generally low 50 cm fig s2a consequently we mainly focus on soil moisture data at the 0 10 cm and 10 40 cm depth levels from gldas noah025 m besides soil moisture rainfall and snowmelt close to our sampling site were extracted then correlation coefficients between july august soil moisture at both soil levels and monthly rainfall as well as snowmelt were computed for the common period 1955 2013 potential effects of snowmelt and rainfall on july august soil moisture in the respective soil levels were thus investigated furthermore daily soil moisture at 0 10 cm 10 40 cm snowmelt rainfall for our sampling site from gldas noah rodell et al 2004 were also compared to explore how the winter precipitation is used for tree growth 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the δ18olw chronology the developed δ18olw chronology spans the period 1950 2013 64 years and has a mean value of 33 36 with a maximum of 37 30 in 2001 and a minimum of 28 25 in 1959 fig 2 a its standard deviation sd first order autocorrelation ac1 and mean sensitivity values are 1 76 0 31 and 0 05 respectively the mean correlation rbar of 0 72 and eps expressed populational signal of 0 93 demonstrate that the five individual δ18olw series share a strong coherency and that the δ18olw chronology is reliable to represent population variations 3 2 climatic signals in δ18olw the climate proxy relationships differ for the raw and first differenced data respectively for the raw data δ18olw exhibit pronounced linkages with local temperatures in october november january february march april and with local precipitation amounts in july and august fig 3 a as the moisture source region is only used for summer july august season attention is thus paid to linkages with summer climates of moisture source region δ18olw variations reveal significant correlations with summer precipitation amount from moisture source regions fig 3c strong seasonal linkages for the raw data exist for summer precipitation july aug local r 0 38 p 0 05 moisture source regions r 0 44 p 0 05 and local tmean jan may r 0 43 p 0 05 or tmean poct may r 0 44 p 0 05 furthermore for the first differenced data no clear relationship with temperature is apparent whereas highest correlations occur with july august precipitation amount fig 3b local r 0 60 p 0 05 fig 3d moisture source regions r 0 66 p 0 05 in summary this suggests that raw δ18olw is mainly controlled by summer precipitation jul aug at both local and moisture source region scale and with local mean winter temperatures tmean jan may or tmean poct may fig s5a c e whereas the first differenced interannual variability is dominated by summer precipitation jul aug for both local and moisture source region fig s5d f based on these results we selected local tmean jan may and precip jul aug from local and moisture source regions for the subsequent coherency spectrum and commonality analysis 3 3 frequency dependent features of dominant climate variables the coherency spectra of δ18olw with precip jul aug of local and moisture source regions and tmean jan may of local are displayed in fig 4 the chosen frequency of 1 7 is the demarcation to distinguish their relationships fig s6 specifically at frequencies higher than 1 7 7 years best coherency occurs with precip jul aug from both local and moisture source regions fig 4a b for frequencies shorter than 1 7 7 years high coherency is found with tmean jan may of local region and precip jul aug of moisture source region fig 4c summarized these results reveal that the high frequency domain 7 years of δ18olw is mainly driven by precip jul aug from both investigated areas in contrast the low frequency domains 7 years are collectively controlled by local tmean jan may and summer precip jul aug of moisture source regions 3 4 commonality analysis of dominant climate variables and δ18olw for the raw data the model explained 41 94 of the variance of δ18olw fig 5 a the strongest influence came from x1 22 16 followed by the joint effect between x2 and x3 18 53 the pure effects from x2 and x3 were much lower 0 22 5 09 than from x1 for the 7 year low pass filtered data the model accounted for 64 39 of the variance of δ18olw fig 5b with the strongest effect from pure x1 59 04 followed by the pure effect of x3 11 46 for the 7 year high pass filtered data the model accounted for 47 98 of the variance of δ18olw fig 5c the dominant influence derived from the joint effect between x2 and x3 38 42 followed by the pure effect of x3 7 49 in summary for the frequency domains shorter than 7 years δ18olw is primarily controlled by the pure and joint effects from summer precipitation jul aug from the moisture source region and summer precipitation jul aug from the local area total 46 74 x2 x3 x6 in fig 5c with the former being dominant on the frequency domains more than 7 years tmean jan may local and precip jul aug moisture source predominantly the variability of δ18olw with the former being strongest 59 04 explained variance 3 5 correlations of rainfall and snowmelt with summer soil moisture bagrot summer soil moisture at 0 10 cm level had the highest correlations with the july rainfall amount r 0 59 p 0 01 fig 6 a followed by the july august rainfall amount r 0 54 p 0 01 in contrast bagrot summer soil moisture at 10 40 cm level showed the closest linkage with april snowmelt r 0 45 p 0 01 with the highest seasonal correlation with march may r 0 54 p 0 01 fig 6b these documents that summer soil moisture at 0 10 cm level is mainly influenced by summer rainfall whereas the moisture in deeper soil layers of 10 40 cm depth mainly depends on winter spring snowmelt respectively daily comparisons among soil moisture at 0 10 cm 10 40 cm snowmelt rainfall reveal a clear picture about how winter precipitation is used for tree growth during the growing period fig 7 as air temperature begins over zero around march ground snow starts to melt and infiltrate into soil surface soil moisture at 0 10 cm is firstly supplied from snowmelt and then the deeper moisture at 10 40 cm starts to increase during late growing periods snowmelt is always larger than the directly rainfall supply therefore compared with summer rainfall snowmelt from winter precipitation i e snow provides more water supply for soil moisture and hence tree water use in the late growing period fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 continuous influence of winter precipitation on tree growth the moisture contribution from winter precipitation to tree growth can persist until the late growing season as indirectly inferred from the tmean jan may signals on the frequency domains more than 7 years tmean jan may signals are mainly transferred to δ18olw through snowmelt processes as detected by isotope enabled model and annual tree ring δ18o variations from the nearby western himalayas huang et al 2019 this study provides the isotopic evidence that winter precipitation affects latewood development by the processes of soil moisture fig s7 fig s11 besides soil depth in our sampling site is less than 50 cm fig s2 we inferred tree growth could mainly use the soil moisture less than 50 cm as shown in fig 6 july august soil moisture at 10 40 cm showed strong linkages with the snowmelt providing additional evidence that trees in the region mainly use winter precipitation derived snowmelt moreover daily comparisons among variables from gldas noah showed that snowmelt from winter precipitation i e snow provided more water supply for soil moisture at 10 40 cm and hence tree water use in the late growing period fig 7 as mentioned in the ipcc report ipcc 2021 snowfall in this region is projected to decrease in the future such snowfall decrease will lead to soil moisture drying at 10 40 cm which likely increases drought stress for trees our results are supported by findings from the western usa ehleringer et al 1991 martin et al 2018 southwestern usa kerhoulas et al 2017 and eastern england robertson et al 2001 with same persisting effect from winter precipitation on tree growth during the late growing season similar effect of winter precipitation on vascular plant growth until the late growing season has also been evidenced in the altai mountains shi et al 2019 however such results are in contrast with studies from the central himalayas an et al 2019 the southeastern tibetan plateau zeng et al 2014 southeastern china an et al 2012 liu et al 2012 fu et al 2017 eastern austria haupt et al 2011 the southwestern usa szejner et al 2016 roden and ehleringer 2007 for these sites no evidence of winter precipitation effect on the tree growth is observed during the late growing season which leads to dominant summer climatic signals reflected by δ18olw e g figs s8 s10 as exemplified by sites from the central himalayas and the southern tibetan plateau 4 2 summer precipitation amount effect in the higher frequency variability of δ18olw the summer precipitation amount from local and moisture source regions mainly influences the δ18olw variations on the frequency domains shorter than 7 years fig 4 and fig 5 we suggest two reasons being responsible for these findings first as indicated by the monthly climate diagram fig 1b fig s11 soil moisture from summer rainfall is evaporating much faster in the karakoram due to less rainfall and high evaporation during summer this leads to the fact that summer rainfall dominantly contributes to surface soil moisture at 0 10 cm depths fig 6a second summer surface soil moisture at 0 10 cm is much lower than at 10 40 cm 63 mm month vs 210 mm month bagrot site from gldas noah 2 0 dataset the amount of summer precipitation is only moisturizing the upper surface soil 0 10 cm and is therefore too limited to overprint the stored winter precipitation moisture in the deeper soil levels 10 40 cm a corresponding limited influence of summer precipitation amount on surface soil moisture and forest has also been reported in a study from the western usa martin et al 2018 notably tree physiological influences on δ18olw seem to be limited in our case as indicated by the weak linkage of δ18olw with the july august relative humidity r 0 01 p 0 05 and vapor pressure deficit r 0 025 p 0 05 such weak effects of physiological processes on tree ring δ18o are in line with findings from the western himalayas huang et al 2019 amazon basin brienen et al 2012 and south africa van der sleen et al 2015 in contrast pronounced physiological effects on δ18o have been found for sites in hawaii kahmen et al 2011 and for floodplains of the amazon river cintra et al 2019 highly differing local climates especially regarding humidity may explain differences in the physiological influence on tree ring δ18o e g cintra et al 2019 further studies using process based models with empirical observations are urgently needed to quantify such physiological effects and source water influences on tree ring δ18o e g song et al 2014 li et al 2021 4 3 comparison with regional tree ring δ18o studies the relative ratio of summer to winter precipitation amount likely triggers the relative strengths of winter and summer climatic signals in tree ring δ18o specifically for our bagrot site with a low ratio of summer to winter precipitation amount winter precipitation and summer precipitation amounts can highly affect the moisture of soil levels differently in time fig 6a b this results in obtained winter climatic signals at the low frequency more than 7 years and summer precipitation amount signals on the high frequency less than 7 years for δ18olw from a regional scale perspective ratios of summer to winter precipitation are increasing from northwest to southeast e g from the karakoram to the western himalayas the central himalayas the eastern himalayas the southern tibetan plateau fig 1 accordingly winter climatic signals in tree ring δ18o become weaker from bagrot zhada to keylong and manali sano et al 2017 managave et al 2020 and even finally disappear in the core monsoon regions bhutan sano et al 2013 mimei wernicke et al 2017 in contrast from southeast to northwest summer climatic signals are weakening from mimei and bhutan to manali keylong zhada sano et al 2013 2017 wernicke et al 2017 huang et al 2019 managave et al 2020 and are finally only found for high frequency domains at our sampling sites bagrot such patterns are also detectable for the western usa with a clear winter summer precipitation gradient williams and ehleringer 2000 szejner et al 2016 consequently more systematic research efforts should be undertaken to quantify how the ratios of winter to summer precipitation influence the climatic interpretation of tree ring δ18o 5 conclusions the contribution of winter precipitation to tree growth can persist into the late growing season in the karakoram as suggested by the winter temperature signals of tree ring δ18olw on the frequencies more than 7 years such results are caused by the dominant contribution of winter spring snowmelt to the summer soil moisture at 10 40 cm as inferred from the nearby gridded data of gldas noah output besides summer precipitation amount is also utilized for forest growth during the late growing season as induced from summer precipitation amount signals of tree ring δ18olw however summer precipitation mainly plays a role on tree ring δ18olw in the high frequencies shorter than 7 years which likely results from the primary contribution of summer precipitation on the summer soil moisture at 0 10 cm this study implies that there may be increasing risks of drought stress for tree growth in the
