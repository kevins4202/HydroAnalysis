8990,improper management practices lead to the reduction of phosphorus availability by rice and an increase in the risk of phosphorus release to the environment in paddy fields this study aims at exploring the effects of biochar with the applicated rate of 0 20 40 t ha 1 under controlled or flooding irrigation on utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer and phosphorus leaching loss from fields by observing the dynamics of phosphorus in paddy fields throughout the rice growing period the results indicated that biochar application lessened the tp and drp leaching loss by 6 77 17 62 and 6 22 10 28 respectively it was also found that biochar improved the phosphorus efficiency of rice by 5 33 10 33 and reduced the soil phosphorus surplus by 3 45 6 66 for the increased soil olsen p concentration and soil solution dissolved reactive p concentration in comparison with flooding irrigation controlled irrigation apparently decreased p leaching loss by 34 64 55 15 by controlling the downward migration of phosphorus in soil solution although biochar addition in the field increased production cost it was proved increasing net economic benefit by 2558 4655 yuan ha 1 y 1 which attributes to the increased rice yield in biochar applicated treatment in order to improve phosphorus efficiency of rice and reduce the risk of phosphorus release to the environment a combination of biochar and water saving irrigation applied in rice fields can provide cleaner production of rice with a promising option thus bringing both environmental and economic benefits graphical abstract ga1 keywords biochar controlled irrigation p leaching p availability p efficiency rice field data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the necessary macronutrient elements during plant growing wang et al 2021b wang et al 2021c p is included in base fertilizer in advance of rice transplanting under normal conditions according to traditional agriculture yuan et al 2021 for less absorption of p by rice at the seedling p is partially absorbed in the soil and partially lost from paddy fields after fertilization wang et al 2019 nevertheless a large amount of p is needed for rice during flowing and ripening stages while available p content is limited at that time macdonald et al 2011 hence the high input of p fertilizers and low utilization of that by rice increase the risk of p loss into surrounding water bodies zhuang et al 2019 according to the bulletin of the state of ecological environment in china 2021 tp pollution has become a major pollutant in taihu lake region a developed region in china relevant research reports that annual p loss from paddy fields to taihu lake water body is up to 1 49 2 86 kg ha 1 min et al 2020 therefore it is necessary for cleaner production in rice cultivation to establish a balance between crop demand for p and effective use of p by crop to reduce p loss by optimizing the management of water and fertilizer in rice fields a large number of scientific reports have proved the positive effectiveness of optimizing irrigation management in increasing rice yield ishfaq et al 2020 and water use efficiency as well as reducing dispersion pollution water saving irrigation wsi effectively alleviates the contradiction between water supply and demand and affects the transformation of nutrients by changing soil properties studies have found that flooded irrigation fi promoted p leaching losses in comparison with wsi in paddy fields chen et al 2018 however the decomposition of organic matter is observed in wsi paddy fields which indicated that wsi is likely to accelerate soil degradation in the long run in paddy fields shang et al 2021 for this reason wsi paddy fields need to combine certain carbon management technologies and researches on the effects of joint regulation of different carbon management and wsi on rice growth p use efficiency and p loss needs to be done straw returning and organic fertilizer application as traditional soil carbon management technologies can significantly increase soil organic carbon and fertility but also lead to a surge in soil carbon emissions biochar a pyrolysis product derived from organic matter kumar et al 2021 has received extensive attention for its outstanding performance in carbon sequestration emission reduction soil improvement lan et al 2012 raza et al 2021 and environmental remediation tu et al 2020 at present researches on the impact of biochar application ba on the available p content and p loss from paddy soil are with different results some studies have shown that the higher amount of ba the greater the available p content wang et al 2018 while other studies indicated that soil available p content among treatments with different rate of ba shows no significant difference chen et al 2015 conflicting results can be attributable to multiple influencing factors such as properties of biochar and applicated method among them research reports on the impact of ba on available p content and p loss in paddy fields are abound sun et al 2019 discovered that the increase of microbial biomass p of paddy soils applied to biochar was greater than the decrease of available p content to some extent which suggests that microorganisms both assimilated soil available p hu et al 2018 and stimulated the transformation of p from unstable states to microbiological state a process that would weaken the ability of soil to lose p however excessive ba will improve adsorption capacity for available p of paddy soil so that the bioavailability of p will be limited zhang et al 2014 researches also demonstrated that ba can enhance the capacity of soil to adsorb and retain p which results in increased soil inorganic p content under the conditions of incubation laird et al 2010 however published studies on soil available p and its leaching in biochar applicated fields are mostly aimed at flooded irrigation or short term alternating wet and dry and studies aimed at wsi technology applied in paddy fields in the whole growth period are rare in this study based on a 6 year successive combination application of biochar and wsi in a paddy field in the taihu lake basin soil available p content and its leaching loss were measured and the related mechanism was identified our objectives were to 1 investigate the p leaching loss soil available p content change law and its influence mechanism in paddy fields with a combination of ba and wsi 2 evaluate the economic and environmental impact of ba on wsi paddy fields in combination with the water and p use efficiency of rice and to put forward a suitable rice field mode combined irrigation and carbon management the research results are significant for reducing water pollution and achieving sustainable agricultural development theoretically and practically 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description as the experiment site kunshan drainage and

volume was set 3 mm d 1 for ci and 5 mm d 1 for fi peng et al 2011 the key properties of biochar and specific irrigation systems in this case are described in details in study of jiang et al 2021 as the experiments focused on the long term effect of ba biochar derived from rice straw was only applied before rice transplanting in 2016 in 0 20 cm soil layer and no additional biochar was added anymore in the following years the rice straw biochar used in this study was produced at the maximum heating temperature of 600 c and a heating rate of 15 c min 1 the rice used in this experiment was nanjing 46 japonica and was transplanted with row spacing of 13 0 cm and plant spacing of 25 0 cm on july 3 in 2020 and june 26 in 2021 respectively and harvested on october 25 in 2020 and 2021 local agronomic measures such as fertilization and pesticide spraying were adopted in the experiment details of fertilizer application are shown in table 1 date of fertilizer applied was showed in brackets

in situ soil sampler by three point mixing method and then soil was mixed thoroughly after removing plants roots and small stones manually to form a homogenous subsample subsequently the soil collected was naturally air dried and subsequently ground for a 60 mesh sieving to measure chemical properties molybdenum blue method was adopted to measure the p content in soil murphy and riley 1986 concentration of olsen p op and total p tp in soil were determined after being extracted by 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 and after hclo4 h2so4 digestion respectively measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity alp in soil samples adopted disodium phosphate colorimetry method 2 4 soil solution sampling and analysis as showed in fig 1 before rice transplanting four soil solution samplers which consisted of a permeable hollow clay head 20 mm inner diameter and 70 mm length and an impermeable plastic pipe 40 mm outer diameter and 0 30 1 00 m length were embedded in each plot at the depths of 10 20 40 and 60 cm bottom most position the day before sampling a vacuum pump was used to evacuate the samplers and then clamps were used to seal the outlet pipe the sampling frequency depended on fertilization soil solution sampling was conducted every 2 days for a total of 4 times and thereafter every 5 7 days until the next fertilization or the solution p concentration is low collected samples were transferred to the laboratory for storage at 4 c and were measured within 48 h the concentration of dissolved reactive p drp was determined after filtering through 0 45 µm filters and concentration of tp in soil solution was measured after persulfate digestion p leaching loss refers to the p loss caused by p migration below the root active layer which can not be intercepted by rice roots the 60 cm soil layer as deep as rice roots can reach is considered as the critical surface of p leakage following eq 1 shows the calculation of cumulative p leaching losses kg p ha 1 1 l i 1 n 0 01 c i s i where l is the cumulative p leaching losses kg ha 1 n is the total numbers of samples collected c i is the p concentrations for the ith sampling mg l 1 s i is the deep seepage mm during the ith sampling 2 5 rice plants sampling and analysis after harvest representative rice plants were selected and broken down by organ stems leaves and grains after being killed green and dried the dry matter of each part was weighed and afterwards ground for a 60 mesh sieving tp concentration was measured by the molybdenum blue method after hclo4 h2so4 digestion the irrigation water use efficiency ywue represented the

measured data was expressed by mean values and standard error s e of triplicated samples the two tailed pearson test was used to analyze the correlation between op and alp spss 19 0 software was used for analyzing statistics 3 results 3 1 variation of p content in soil with changes in time and soil depth the soil tp and op concentration varied with time and depth under the influence of water carbon management figs 2 3 affected by irrigation water total p accumulated variously at different soil depths after 5 years of p fertilizer input the dynamics of soil tp concentration in 2021 showed a similar pattern to that in 2020 from the perspective of spatial scale fig 2 and the tp concentration of each treated soil showed a decreasing trend from the top to the bottom of the soil that is the average tp concentration of each treatment in 0 10 cm depth was the highest and that at a depth of 40 60 cm was the lowest from the perspective of inter annual changes across all treatments the soil tp concentration in 2021 was lower than that in 2020 at each depth the average tp concentrations under ca cb cc and fc in 2021 decreased by 12 26 14 00 13 21 and 14 10 respectively compared with that in 2020 the difference was probably attributed to the p absorption by rice and wheat in 2020 tp concentration showed no significant difference in different seasons only a slight fluctuation was observed in soil tp concentration over the rice season until harvest within two years of trial in general ba reduced soil tp concentration in wsi paddy fields and the reduction degree in cb treatment was more obvious than that in cc treatment taking ca as the baseline soil tp concentrations in cb and cc treatments decreased by 5 79 and 1 51 in 2020 and 7 66 and 2 58 in 2021 respectively for cb treatment the effect of reducing soil p concentration was more prominent at the depths of 40 60 cm the soil p concentration under cb treatment at 40 60 cm depth showed an average value of 0 50 g kg 1 and 0 45 g kg 1 in 2020 and 2021 which were 10 21 and 16 07 lower than that under ca treatment 0 56 g kg 1 of 2020 and 0 53 g kg 1 of 2021 respectively under the ba rate of 40 t ha 1 soil tp concentration in ci paddy fields was higher than that in fi paddy fields average tp concentration under cc treatment increased by 2 57 in 2020 and 3 63 in 2021 respectively compared with that under fc treatment op concentration was consistent with the variation of soil tp concentration with the changes of time and soil depths fig 3 compared with average soil op concentration at four soil depths in 2020 soil op concentration of ca cb cc fc treatment in 2021 reduced by 41 82 42 78 43 55 and 52 06 p 0 05 respectively op concentration in each treatment decreased with the increase of soil depth in two years and the ratio of op concentration in 0 20 cm soil layer to the total op concentration in 0 60 cm soil layer in each treatment was up to 56 08 79 13 this meant that topsoil has a high nutrient content due to fertilization irrigation tillage etc in addition over the full rice growth period ba significantly increased the op concentration at each soil depth for cb and cc treatments the average op concentration increased by 14 41 and 15 68 in 2020 compared with ca treatment and by 19 04 and 1 65 in 2021 different with effects of ba on soil tp concentration ba significantly increased the op concentration in 0 10 cm soil layer during the two year trial period compared with ca treatment the op concentration of cb and cc at 0 10 cm depth increased by 35 31 and 24 89 in 2020 and 15 67 and 10 58 in 2021 in addition difference between cc and fc treatment was observed in several key growth periods in 2020 at the soil depth of 10 40 cm significant higher op concentration in cc treatment was noticed in comparison with fc treatment at the stage of re t jb and hf p 0 05 in general compared with fc treatment average op concentration of cc treatment was 17 95 higher in 2020 while in 2021 it was only 4 76 higher 3 2 variation of p content in soil solution with changes in time and soil depth due to the change in biochar application rate and irrigation water amount tp and drp concentration in cb cc paddies were quite different from those in ca fc paddies figs 4 5 obvious peaks in tp concentration were noticed within several days after base fertilization application in 2020 while was observed after panicle fertilization application in 2021 peak tp concentration rates ranged from 0 083 to 0 197 mg l 1 in 2020 and from 0 051 to 0 196 mg l 1 in 2021 although the p input was only conducted in the base fertilization application the occurrence of peak tp concentration after panicle fertilization application indicated that n application has a stimulating effect on p in paddy fields after the peak tp concentration in the soil solution gradually decreased and then kept at a low level in the following stage until harvest it was also noted that the tp concentration in all treatments showed a trend of decreasing increasing decreasing from topsoil to subsoil in 2021 the highest tp concentration was found at 0 10 cm depth followed by 20 40 cm depth and the lowest at 40 60 cm depth for cb and cc treatments the peaks in tp concentrations of soil solution induced by fertilization events peaks mainly occurred after base fertilization and panicle fertilization were higher than that under the ca treatment at the depth of 0 10 cm but the results were opposite at 20 60 cm depth compared with ca cb and cc treatments increased the peak tp concentration by 62 69 and 51 84 in 2020 and 3 63 and 25 41 in 2021 at 0 10 cm depth while decreased by 4 76 20 69 and 9 48 33 33 in 2020 and 15 48 23 96 and 2 32 51 95 in 2021 at 20 60 cm depths respectively furthermore average tp concentration in cb and cc treatments at each depth except for 0 10 cm depth was lower than that in ca treatment differences between the cc and fc treatment were also reflected by the dynamics of soil solution tp concentration at each depth for cc treatment the peak and mean values of tp concentration at each depth except for 0 10 cm were lower than those in fc treatment significantly compared with fc average tp at 0 10 cm depth in cc increased by 0 94 in 2021 but decreased by 15 54 in 2020 and 10 96 in 2021 at 20 60 cm depth the results illustrated that the vertical migration of tp in soil solution was well controlled by controlled irrigation management in two years the drp concentration of the soil solution of each treatment showed the same pattern as that of tp with the change of soil depth by analyzing the average drp concentration in two years it was found that the average drp concentration of cb and cc treatment is slightly higher than that of ca treatment in 2020 but the result was the opposite in 2021 compared with ca treatment average drp concentration in cb and cc treatment increased by 2 03 and 9 46 respectively in 2020 but decreased by 3 70 and 8 43 respectively in 2021 this was attributed to the significant increase in drp concentration of cb and cc in a period of time after applying tillering fertilizer in 2020 the drp concentration in paddy fields with a biochar application rate of 20 t ha 1 and 40 t ha 1 was 30 27 and 24 63 higher than that in paddy fields with no biochar application from the beginning of the application of tillering fertilization to the beginning of the application of panicle fertilization besides the effect of ci management on the drp concentration in soil solution was found in accordance with that on tp concentration in 2020 and 2021 compared with fc treatment the average drp concentration of soil solution at 0 10 cm depth in cc treatment increased by 16 32 and 2 39 but decreased by 9 06 and 7 16 at 20 60 cm depth respectively 3 3 p leaching daily and cumulative leaching loss of tp and drp across the whole rice growth period are shown in figs 6 7 tp and drp were largely leached in all treatments in the initial period of rice seedling growth mainly because of the large amount of p input in base fertilizer and the existence of a thin water layer during the re greening period during the two years of trial changes in leaching loss of drp were similar to that of tp leaching loss mainly took place in the first half period of rice growth while it was small in the second half of rice growth period the main component of p leaching loss in each treatment was drp respectively accounting for 70 52 97 63 and 57 56 92 16 of tp leaching loss in 2020 and 2021 difference among the treatments was also reflected by the amount of p leaching compared with ca cb significantly reduced tp and drp leaching compared with ca treatment tp and drp cumulative leaching loss in cb treatment decreased by 8 56 and 6 22 in 2020 and 6 77 and 6 45 respectively in 2021 in 2021 tp and drp cumulative leaching loss in cc treatment was 17 62 and 10 28 lower than that in ca treatment respectively based on fc tp and drp cumulative leaching loss treated by cc decreased by 35 19 and 34 64 in 2020 and 55 12 and 49 70 respectively in 2021 3 4 rice yield p and water use efficiency mean annual rice yield of each treatment during experimental period was shown in table 2 the yield of cb and cc treatment improved to a certain extent compared with ca treatment in contrast to ca the yields in cb and cc treatment increased by 25 58 and 33 73 in 2020 and 17 44 and 22 83 in 2021 under the wsi pattern water consumption in paddy fields with different ba rates showed no significant difference but results of ywue was opposite with it due to the significant difference in yields among treatments the ywue of cb and cc was respectively 22 00 and 43 89 23 61 and 33 52 higher than that of ca in 2020 and 2021 in addition the pe in paddy fields with ba had also been improved by 5 33 10 33 when the pb had been reduced by 3 45 6 66 moreover ywue between cc and fc treatment showed a significant difference p 0 05 whereas the fc and cc treatment had similar rice yield ywue in cc increased by 39 42 and 26 60 respectively in 2020 and 2021 this was due to the reduction of water consumption caused by ci however control of water volume by ci restricted the migration of p with water making the rice root in cc treatment unable to obtain more available p thus reducing the pe and increasing pb different letters among treatments in the same row represent significant differences p 0 05 ca no biochar addition under controlled irrigation cb 20 t ha 1 biochar addition under controlled irrigation cc 40 t ha 1 biochar addition under controlled irrigation fc 40 t ha 1 biochar addition under flooding irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of p leaching under different water and carbon management many scholars all over the world have reported the positive effects of ba and wsi on reducing p leaching loss for instance liu et al 2022 showed that the ba improved the water pollution caused by straw and reduced the leaching of p and discovered that the higher of ba rates the less total p leaching losses xiao et al 2017 also reported that p leaching in ba paddy fields decreased by 6 8 12 86 compared with the that in no biochar applicated paddy field in general ba reduces p leaching mainly through adsorbing p dari et al 2016 as a highly effective adsorbent in soil fei et al 2019 biochar has the characteristics of high surface charge density large surface area and high internal porosity which contribute to its adsorption of p thus reducing mobile p concentration in soil additionally reduction of soil bulk density and the improvement of soil agglomeration after ba have indirectly improved the soil water holding capacity batista et al 2018 and thus reduce p leaching different from the mechanism of ba on p leaching wsi technology mainly reduces the leaching loss by changing the p activity wang et al 2012 increasing the fixation of soil on p wang et al 2012 and weakening the driving force of p infiltration with water liu et al 2019 for example sun et al 2021 showed that the average p leaching losses in soil column under wsi irrigation was reduced by 65 5 compared with that under conventional drip irrigation in this case studies focus on effects of a combination of ba and wsi on p leaching loss results showed that ba reduced p concentration in soil solution at 20 60 cm depth and ultimately reduced the p leaching loss tp leaching loss was maintained at the level of 0 047 0 130 kg ha 1 in each treatment rice straw ba at the rate of 20 t ha 1 and 40 t ha 1 reduced the total tp leaching loss by 6 77 8 56 and 17 62 compared with that without ba based on the ba rate of 40 t ha 1 total tp leaching loss was reduced by 35 19 55 12 under ci compared with that under fi in our study the tp and drp concentration in the soil solution of 0 10 cm under cc treatment was increased compared with that under fc treatment while the concentrations were significantly decreased in the 20 60 cm soil layer therefore we determine that controlled irrigation can reduce phosphorus leaching loss by concentrating phosphorus at the depth of 0 10 cm and controlling phosphorus migration to the deep layer increased tp concentration in 0 10 cm soil solution in cc treatment was inconsistent with the results of wang et al 2012 whose study illustrated that the anaerobic condition caused by flooding water under fi promoted conversion of insoluble p to active p in soil thus improving the solubility of p and promoting the higher p concentration in fi field conversely the study of zhang et al 2007 showed that the redox conditions formed by wsi promoted the activation of organophosphates thus increasing the p concentration in field water differences in irrigation methods soil physical and chemical properties and field management methods could be responsible for the inconsistence 4 2 biochar improves soil p availability and p use efficiency by rice op concentration in soil refers to the p that can be utilized by plants which can relatively indicate the p supply level of soil it is reported that ba increases the op concentration in farmland soil gao et al 2019 carried out an integrated analysis of 124 published researches and found that ba significantly increased the available p content of topsoil by about 45 liu et al 2017 expressed that biochar derived from rice hull significantly increased op concentration in different types of soil through a 9 week incubation experiment in our case soil op concentration of cb and cc treatment was significantly increased compared with ca treatment especially at the depth of 0 10 cm soil layer this was in agreement with their findings several recent review articles tesfaye et al 2021 summarized the mechanism of biochar to increase available p in soil 1 biochar itself releasing p zhai et al 2015 2 promoting p desorbing and dissolving by changing soil ph cui et al 2011 and 3 increased phosphatase activity driven by biochar stimulating mineralization of organic p in soil jin et al 2016 in agreement with the result of jin et al 2016 in our research op content and alp were significantly positively correlated fig 8 as described by wang et al 2021a soil phod harboring microbes in soil are easy to produce and activate phosphatases in the process of utilizing phosphorylated compounds thus mineralizing organophosphorus on the other hand decrease in correlation coefficient of op and alp with the increase of biochar amount was also observed in our case ghodszad et al 2021 also reported that changes in enzyme activity driven by biochar may take the responsibility for the increased soil available p but depending on the ba amount the review was supported by wang et al 2022 who claimed that low amount of ba increased alp activity by 6 1 69 4 while high amount of ba significantly decreased alp activity by 14 3 and 34 3 meanwhile a negative correlation between soil phosphatase activity and amount of ba was found in the study of silva et al 2020 additionally increased soil ph driven by biochar may be another reason for increasing alp activities and finally promoting the increase of available p content ghodszad et al 2021 judging from this soil phosphatase activity may be considered as an important predictor of p availability in rice p efficiency in rice fields was affected by the soil p content yan et al 2022 diffusion ability of p in soil solution suriyagoda et al 2014 the capacity of p release from solid chen et al 2022 and the growth of the root system chen et al 2022 for example song et al 2020 showed that biochar can effectively increase the content of soil available p thus promoting the absorption of phosphorus by plants and achieving the purpose of increasing yield and p use efficiency this study showed that ba significantly increased pe of rice degryse et al 2009 demonstrated that p uptake by rice have a strong correlation with soluble active p in pore water and weakly bound p in soil solids if diffusive transport of p from soil solution to plant roots was not limited in this case items including up olsen p pe and drp were all found increased because of ba in 2020 compared with ca treatment pe in cb and fc treatment increased by 5 32 and 10 33 respectively and pb also decreased by 3 45 and 6 66 increased up and pe and decreased pb can be ascribed to the increase of drp concentration in soil solution and the increase of op content in soil due to ba in this study other research results showed that ali et al 2020 ba promoted p absorbing ability of rice by promoting their root growth increasing their root and surface area researches on how biochar affects rice root thus affecting p uptake in rice can be carried out in the future 4 3 economic and environmental benefit of biochar combined with water saving irrigation as an important area of rice production in china taihu lake region is covered an area of 12373 km2 by paddy fields our research team has reported on the impact of combined ba and wsi on the ecological environment of rice fields in taihu lake region for many times in the past six years jiang et al 2021 focused on the greenhouse gas emissions in rice fields indicating that ba increased the soil respiration rate in wsi rice fields by 23 81 41 45 and decreased the global warming trend by 25 85 37 84 chen et al 2021 conducted the research in terms of n loss and found that combined ba and wsi reduced no3 n leaching loss by 29 98 38 63 and tn leaching loss by 12 77 13 36 qi et al 2022 mainly focused on ammonia volatilization loss and showed that combination of the two reduced ammonia volatilization sun et al 2021 also confirmed the positive effect of the two on co2 exchange in paddy fields this study mainly focused on the response of dynamics of p to the combination of the two and results showed that it increased p availability and reduced p leaching loss this study further confirmed the positive effect of ba and wsi technology on improving ecological environment from the perspective of p cycling in paddy fields taking the paddy fields in taihu lake region as an example ba of 20 t ha 1 and 40 t ha 1 improved rice yield by 1278 1852 kt and 1674 2441 kt as well as decreased tp leaching loss by 7 2 7 6 t and 18 7 t compared with wsi paddy fields without ba for farmers more attention is paid to the economic benefits after the combined application of the two and it is also the key factor affecting their large scale promotion and application therefore increased production cost of biochar input and the increased income from the increased rice yield after application was analyzed in this paper since biochar can be effective for over 20 years as supported by researchers dumortier et al 2020 khan et al 2022 lychuk et al 2015 we conservatively choose 20 years as the effective period of biochar and distribute the production cost caused by biochar to 20 years that is for cb cc treatment annual production cost in fields will increase by 800 and 1600yuan ha 1 y 1 average biochar price is 800yuan t 1 respectively in this study cb and cc benefit from the increased yield of 4744 and 6255yuan ha 1 in 2020 and 3358 and 4398yuan ha 1 in 2021 respectively average rice price in 2020 and 2021 is 3 17 and 3 25yuan kg 1 respectively derived from the china yearbook of agricultural price survey 2022 hence cb and cc increased net economic benefit by 2558 3944yuan ha 1 y 1and 2798 4655yuan ha 1 y 1 respectively in conclusion combined application of ba and wsi in paddy fields can bring both economic and environmental benefit and it also makes waste straw resources recycled in agricultural production which is of great significance to develop green agriculture 5 conclusions responses of rice yield p efficiency of rice and p dynamic changes in soil and soil solution to the combination of ba and wsi technology were studied the results showed that controlled irrigation reduced the tp and drp leaching loss by 35 19 55 12 and 34 64 49 70 as a result of controlling the downward migration of phosphorus in soil solution it was also found that biochar increased the pe of rice by 5 33 10 33 and reduced the pb by 3 45 6 66 due to the increased soil olsen p concentration and soil solution drp concentration additionally cb and cc were found increasing net economic benefit by 2558 3944 yuan ha 1 y 1and 2798 4655 yuan ha 1 y 1 respectively in all the study further explained the positive impact of biochar and controlled irrigation on the ecological environment in paddy fields from the perspective of p cycle and proved that the combined application of ba and wsi is a cleaner production strategy for both reducing p loss and improving productivity considering both environmental and economic benefits controlled irrigation coupling with biochar at a rate of 40 t ha 1 is recommended in this study credit authorship contribution

8990,improper management practices lead to the reduction of phosphorus availability by rice and an increase in the risk of phosphorus release to the environment in paddy fields this study aims at exploring the effects of biochar with the applicated rate of 0 20 40 t ha 1 under controlled or flooding irrigation on utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer and phosphorus leaching loss from fields by observing the dynamics of phosphorus in paddy fields throughout the rice growing period the results indicated that biochar application lessened the tp and drp leaching loss by 6 77 17 62 and 6 22 10 28 respectively it was also found that biochar improved the phosphorus efficiency of rice by 5 33 10 33 and reduced the soil phosphorus surplus by 3 45 6 66 for the increased soil olsen p concentration and soil solution dissolved reactive p concentration in comparison with flooding irrigation controlled irrigation apparently decreased p leaching loss by 34 64 55 15 by controlling the downward migration of phosphorus in soil solution although biochar addition in the field increased production cost it was proved increasing net economic benefit by 2558 4655 yuan ha 1 y 1 which attributes to the increased rice yield in biochar applicated treatment in order to improve phosphorus efficiency of rice and reduce the risk of phosphorus release to the environment a combination of biochar and water saving irrigation applied in rice fields can provide cleaner production of rice with a promising option thus bringing both environmental and economic benefits graphical abstract ga1 keywords biochar controlled irrigation p leaching p availability p efficiency rice field data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the necessary macronutrient elements during plant growing wang et al 2021b wang et al 2021c p is included in base fertilizer in advance of rice transplanting under normal conditions according to traditional agriculture yuan et al 2021 for less absorption of p by rice at the seedling p is partially absorbed in the soil and partially lost from paddy fields after fertilization wang et al 2019 nevertheless a large amount of p is needed for rice during flowing and ripening stages while available p content is limited at that time macdonald et al 2011 hence the high input of p fertilizers and low utilization of that by rice increase the risk of p loss into surrounding water bodies zhuang et al 2019 according to the bulletin of the state of ecological environment in china 2021 tp pollution has become a major pollutant in taihu lake region a developed region in china relevant research reports that annual p loss from paddy fields to taihu lake water body is up to 1 49 2 86 kg ha 1 min et al 2020 therefore it is necessary for cleaner production in rice cultivation to establish a balance between crop demand for p and effective use of p by crop to reduce p loss by optimizing the management of water and fertilizer in rice fields a large number of scientific reports have proved the positive effectiveness of optimizing irrigation management in increasing rice yield ishfaq et al 2020 and water use efficiency as well as reducing dispersion pollution water saving irrigation wsi effectively alleviates the contradiction between water supply and demand and affects the transformation of nutrients by changing soil properties studies have found that flooded irrigation fi promoted p leaching losses in comparison with wsi in paddy fields chen et al 2018 however the decomposition of organic matter is observed in wsi paddy fields which indicated that wsi is likely to accelerate soil degradation in the long run in paddy fields shang et al 2021 for this reason wsi paddy fields need to combine certain carbon management technologies and researches on the effects of joint regulation of different carbon management and wsi on rice growth p use efficiency and p loss needs to be done straw returning and organic fertilizer application as traditional soil carbon management technologies can significantly increase soil organic carbon and fertility but also lead to a surge in soil carbon emissions biochar a pyrolysis product derived from organic matter kumar et al 2021 has received extensive attention for its outstanding performance in carbon sequestration emission reduction soil improvement lan et al 2012 raza et al 2021 and environmental remediation tu et al 2020 at present researches on the impact of biochar application ba on the available p content and p loss from paddy soil are with different results some studies have shown that the higher amount of ba the greater the available p content wang et al 2018 while other studies indicated that soil available p content among treatments with different rate of ba shows no significant difference chen et al 2015 conflicting results can be attributable to multiple influencing factors such as properties of biochar and applicated method among them research reports on the impact of ba on available p content and p loss in paddy fields are abound sun et al 2019 discovered that the increase of microbial biomass p of paddy soils applied to biochar was greater than the decrease of available p content to some extent which suggests that microorganisms both assimilated soil available p hu et al 2018 and stimulated the transformation of p from unstable states to microbiological state a process that would weaken the ability of soil to lose p however excessive ba will improve adsorption capacity for available p of paddy soil so that the bioavailability of p will be limited zhang et al 2014 researches also demonstrated that ba can enhance the capacity of soil to adsorb and retain p which results in increased soil inorganic p content under the conditions of incubation laird et al 2010 however published studies on soil available p and its leaching in biochar applicated fields are mostly aimed at flooded irrigation or short term alternating wet and dry and studies aimed at wsi technology applied in paddy fields in the whole growth period are rare in this study based on a 6 year successive combination application of biochar and wsi in a paddy field in the taihu lake basin soil available p content and its leaching loss were measured and the related mechanism was identified our objectives were to 1 investigate the p leaching loss soil available p content change law and its influence mechanism in paddy fields with a combination of ba and wsi 2 evaluate the economic and environmental impact of ba on wsi paddy fields in combination with the water and p use efficiency of rice and to put forward a suitable rice field mode combined irrigation and carbon management the research results are significant for reducing water pollution and achieving sustainable agricultural development theoretically and practically 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description as the experiment site kunshan drainage and

experiment ba with the rate of 0 20 40 t ha 1 under controlled irrigation ci namely ca cb and cc respectively and the rate of 40 t ha 1 under flooding irrigation fi namely fc for ci soil moisture content of soil in depth of rice roots reside was used as an irrigation indicator while water layer was always maintained 3 5 cm during most of the period of rice growth of fi treatments the drainage volume was set 3 mm d 1 for ci and 5 mm d 1 for fi peng et al 2011 the key properties of biochar and specific irrigation systems in this case are described in details in study of jiang et al 2021 as the experiments focused on the long term effect of ba biochar derived from rice straw was only applied before rice transplanting in 2016 in 0 20 cm soil layer and no additional biochar was added anymore in the following years the rice straw biochar used in this study was produced at the maximum heating temperature of 600 c and a heating rate of 15 c min 1 the rice used in this experiment was nanjing 46 japonica and was transplanted with row spacing of 13 0 cm and plant spacing of 25 0 cm on july 3 in 2020 and june 26 in 2021 respectively and harvested on october 25 in 2020 and 2021 local agronomic measures such as fertilization and pesticide spraying were adopted in the experiment details of fertilizer application are shown in table 1 date of fertilizer applied was showed in brackets

in situ soil sampler by three point mixing method and then soil was mixed thoroughly after removing plants roots and small stones manually to form a homogenous subsample subsequently the soil collected was naturally air dried and subsequently ground for a 60 mesh sieving to measure chemical properties molybdenum blue method was adopted to measure the p content in soil murphy and riley 1986 concentration of olsen p op and total p tp in soil were determined after being extracted by 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 and after hclo4 h2so4 digestion respectively measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity alp in soil samples adopted disodium phosphate colorimetry method 2 4 soil solution sampling and analysis as showed in fig 1 before rice transplanting four soil solution samplers which consisted of a permeable hollow clay head 20 mm inner diameter and 70 mm length and an impermeable plastic pipe 40 mm outer diameter and 0 30 1 00 m length were embedded in each plot at the depths of 10 20 40 and 60 cm bottom most position the day before sampling a vacuum pump was used to evacuate the samplers and then clamps were used to seal the outlet pipe the sampling frequency depended on fertilization soil solution sampling was conducted every 2 days for a total of 4 times and thereafter every 5 7 days until the next fertilization or the solution p concentration is low collected samples were transferred to the laboratory for storage at 4 c and were measured within 48 h the concentration of dissolved reactive p drp was determined after filtering through 0 45 µm filters and concentration of tp in soil solution was measured after persulfate digestion p leaching loss refers to the p loss caused by p migration below the root active layer which can not be intercepted by rice roots the 60 cm soil layer as deep as rice roots can reach is considered as the critical surface of p leakage following eq 1 shows the calculation of cumulative p leaching losses kg p ha 1 1 l i 1 n 0 01 c i s i where l is the cumulative p leaching losses kg ha 1 n is the total numbers of samples collected c i is the p concentrations for the ith sampling mg l 1 s i is the deep seepage mm during the ith sampling 2 5 rice plants sampling and analysis after harvest representative rice plants were selected and broken down by organ stems leaves and grains after being killed green and dried the dry matter of each part was weighed and afterwards ground for a 60 mesh sieving tp concentration was measured by the molybdenum blue method after hclo4 h2so4 digestion the irrigation water use efficiency ywue represented the

measured data was expressed by mean values and standard error s e of triplicated samples the two tailed pearson test was used to analyze the correlation between op and alp spss 19 0 software was used for analyzing statistics 3 results 3 1 variation of p content in soil with changes in time and soil depth the soil tp and op concentration varied with time and depth under the influence of water carbon management figs 2 3 affected by irrigation water total p accumulated variously at different soil depths after 5 years of p fertilizer input the dynamics of soil tp concentration in 2021 showed a similar pattern to that in 2020 from the perspective of spatial scale fig 2 and the tp concentration of each treated soil showed a decreasing trend from the top to the bottom of the soil that is the average tp concentration of each treatment in 0 10 cm depth was the highest and that at a depth of 40 60 cm was the lowest from the perspective of inter annual changes across all treatments the soil tp concentration in 2021 was lower than that in 2020 at each depth the average tp concentrations under ca cb cc and fc in 2021 decreased by 12 26 14 00 13 21 and 14 10 respectively compared with that in 2020 the difference was probably attributed to the p absorption by rice and wheat in 2020 tp concentration showed no significant difference in different seasons only a slight fluctuation was observed in soil tp concentration over the rice season until harvest within two years of trial in general ba reduced soil tp concentration in wsi paddy fields and the reduction degree in cb treatment was more obvious than that in cc treatment taking ca as the baseline soil tp concentrations in cb and cc treatments decreased by 5 79 and 1 51 in 2020 and 7 66 and 2 58 in 2021 respectively for cb treatment the effect of reducing soil p concentration was more prominent at the depths of 40 60 cm the soil p concentration under cb treatment at 40 60 cm depth showed an average value of 0 50 g kg 1 and 0 45 g kg 1 in 2020 and 2021 which were 10 21 and 16 07 lower than that under ca treatment 0 56 g kg 1 of 2020 and 0 53 g kg 1 of 2021 respectively under the ba rate of 40 t ha 1 soil tp concentration in ci paddy fields was higher than that in fi paddy fields average tp concentration under cc treatment increased by 2 57 in 2020 and 3 63 in 2021 respectively compared with that under fc treatment op concentration was consistent with the variation of soil tp concentration with the changes of time and soil depths fig 3 compared with average soil op concentration at four soil depths in 2020 soil op concentration of ca cb cc fc treatment in 2021 reduced by 41 82 42 78 43 55 and 52 06 p 0 05 respectively op concentration in each treatment decreased with the increase of soil depth in two years and the ratio of op concentration in 0 20 cm soil layer to the total op concentration in 0 60 cm soil layer in each treatment was up to 56 08 79 13 this meant that topsoil has a high nutrient content due to fertilization irrigation tillage etc in addition over the full rice growth period ba significantly increased the op concentration at each soil depth for cb and cc treatments the average op concentration increased by 14 41 and 15 68 in 2020 compared with ca treatment and by 19 04 and 1 65 in 2021 different with effects of ba on soil tp concentration ba significantly increased the op concentration in 0 10 cm soil layer during the two year trial period compared with ca treatment the op concentration of cb and cc at 0 10 cm depth increased by 35 31 and 24 89 in 2020 and 15 67 and 10 58 in 2021 in addition difference between cc and fc treatment was observed in several key growth periods in 2020 at the soil depth of 10 40 cm significant higher op concentration in cc treatment was noticed in comparison with fc treatment at the stage of re t jb and hf p 0 05 in general compared with fc treatment average op concentration of cc treatment was 17 95 higher in 2020 while in 2021 it was only 4 76 higher 3 2 variation of p content in soil solution with changes in time and soil depth due to the change in biochar application rate and irrigation water amount tp and drp concentration in cb cc paddies were quite different from those in ca fc paddies figs 4 5 obvious peaks in tp concentration were noticed within several days after base fertilization application in 2020 while was observed after panicle fertilization application in 2021 peak tp concentration rates ranged from 0 083 to 0 197 mg l 1 in 2020 and from 0 051 to 0 196 mg l 1 in 2021 although the p input was only conducted in the base fertilization application the occurrence of peak tp concentration after panicle fertilization application indicated that n application has a stimulating effect on p in paddy fields after the peak tp concentration in the soil solution gradually decreased and then kept at a low level in the following stage until harvest it was also noted that the tp concentration in all treatments showed a trend of decreasing increasing decreasing from topsoil to subsoil in 2021 the highest tp concentration was found at 0 10 cm depth followed by 20 40 cm depth and the lowest at 40 60 cm depth for cb and cc treatments the peaks in tp concentrations of soil solution induced by fertilization events peaks mainly occurred after base fertilization and panicle fertilization were higher than that under the ca treatment at the depth of 0 10 cm but the results were opposite at 20 60 cm depth compared with ca cb and cc treatments increased the peak tp concentration by 62 69 and 51 84 in 2020 and 3 63 and 25 41 in 2021 at 0 10 cm depth while decreased by 4 76 20 69 and 9 48 33 33 in 2020 and 15 48 23 96 and 2 32 51 95 in 2021 at 20 60 cm depths respectively furthermore average tp concentration in cb and cc treatments at each depth except for 0 10 cm depth was lower than that in ca treatment differences between the cc and fc treatment were also reflected by the dynamics of soil solution tp concentration at each depth for cc treatment the peak and mean values of tp concentration at each depth except for 0 10 cm were lower than those in fc treatment significantly compared with fc average tp at 0 10 cm depth in cc increased by 0 94 in 2021 but decreased by 15 54 in 2020 and 10 96 in 2021 at 20 60 cm depth the results illustrated that the vertical migration of tp in soil solution was well controlled by controlled irrigation management in two years the drp concentration of the soil solution of each treatment showed the same pattern as that of tp with the change of soil depth by analyzing the average drp concentration in two years it was found that the average drp concentration of cb and cc treatment is slightly higher than that of ca treatment in 2020 but the result was the opposite in 2021 compared with ca treatment average drp concentration in cb and cc treatment increased by 2 03 and 9 46 respectively in 2020 but decreased by 3 70 and 8 43 respectively in 2021 this was attributed to the significant increase in drp concentration of cb and cc in a period of time after applying tillering fertilizer in 2020 the drp concentration in paddy fields with a biochar application rate of 20 t ha 1 and 40 t ha 1 was 30 27 and 24 63 higher than that in paddy fields with no biochar application from the beginning of the application of tillering fertilization to the beginning of the application of panicle fertilization besides the effect of ci management on the drp concentration in soil solution was found in accordance with that on tp concentration in 2020 and 2021 compared with fc treatment the average drp concentration of soil solution at 0 10 cm depth in cc treatment increased by 16 32 and 2 39 but decreased by 9 06 and 7 16 at 20 60 cm depth respectively 3 3 p leaching daily and cumulative leaching loss of tp and drp across the whole rice growth period are shown in figs 6 7 tp and drp were largely leached in all treatments in the initial period of rice seedling growth mainly because of the large amount of p input in base fertilizer and the existence of a thin water layer during the re greening period during the two years of trial changes in leaching loss of drp were similar to that of tp leaching loss mainly took place in the first half period of rice growth while it was small in the second half of rice growth period the main component of p leaching loss in each treatment was drp respectively accounting for 70 52 97 63 and 57 56 92 16 of tp leaching loss in 2020 and 2021 difference among the treatments was also reflected by the amount of p leaching compared with ca cb significantly reduced tp and drp leaching compared with ca treatment tp and drp cumulative leaching loss in cb treatment decreased by 8 56 and 6 22 in 2020 and 6 77 and 6 45 respectively in 2021 in 2021 tp and drp cumulative leaching loss in cc treatment was 17 62 and 10 28 lower than that in ca treatment respectively based on fc tp and drp cumulative leaching loss treated by cc decreased by 35 19 and 34 64 in 2020 and 55 12 and 49 70 respectively in 2021 3 4 rice yield p and water use efficiency mean annual rice yield of each treatment during experimental period was shown in table 2 the yield of cb and cc treatment improved to a certain extent compared with ca treatment in contrast to ca the yields in cb and cc treatment increased by 25 58 and 33 73 in 2020 and 17 44 and 22 83 in 2021 under the wsi pattern water consumption in paddy fields with different ba rates showed no significant difference but results of ywue was opposite with it due to the significant difference in yields among treatments the ywue of cb and cc was respectively 22 00 and 43 89 23 61 and 33 52 higher than that of ca in 2020 and 2021 in addition the pe in paddy fields with ba had also been improved by 5 33 10 33 when the pb had been reduced by 3 45 6 66 moreover ywue between cc and fc treatment showed a significant difference p 0 05 whereas the fc and cc treatment had similar rice yield ywue in cc increased by 39 42 and 26 60 respectively in 2020 and 2021 this was due to the reduction of water consumption caused by ci however control of water volume by ci restricted the migration of p with water making the rice root in cc treatment unable to obtain more available p thus reducing the pe and increasing pb different letters among treatments in the same row represent significant differences p 0 05 ca no biochar addition under controlled irrigation cb 20 t ha 1 biochar addition under controlled irrigation cc 40 t ha 1 biochar addition under controlled irrigation fc 40 t ha 1 biochar addition under flooding irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of p leaching under different water and carbon management many scholars all over the world have reported the positive effects of ba and wsi on reducing p leaching loss for instance liu et al 2022 showed that the ba improved the water pollution caused by straw and reduced the leaching of p and discovered that the higher of ba rates the less total p leaching losses xiao et al 2017 also reported that p leaching in ba paddy fields decreased by 6 8 12 86 compared with the that in no biochar applicated paddy field in general ba reduces p leaching mainly through adsorbing p dari et al 2016 as a highly effective adsorbent in soil fei et al 2019 biochar has the characteristics of high surface charge density large surface area and high internal porosity which contribute to its adsorption of p thus reducing mobile p concentration in soil additionally reduction of soil bulk density and the improvement of soil agglomeration after ba have indirectly improved the soil water holding capacity batista et al 2018 and thus reduce p leaching different from the mechanism of ba on p leaching wsi technology mainly reduces the leaching loss by changing the p activity wang et al 2012 increasing the fixation of soil on p wang et al 2012 and weakening the driving force of p infiltration with water liu et al 2019 for example sun et al 2021 showed that the average p leaching losses in soil column under wsi irrigation was reduced by 65 5 compared with that under conventional drip irrigation in this case studies focus on effects of a combination of ba and wsi on p leaching loss results showed that ba reduced p concentration in soil solution at 20 60 cm depth and ultimately reduced the p leaching loss tp leaching loss was maintained at the level of 0 047 0 130 kg ha 1 in each treatment rice straw ba at the rate of 20 t ha 1 and 40 t ha 1 reduced the total tp leaching loss by 6 77 8 56 and 17 62 compared with that without ba based on the ba rate of 40 t ha 1 total tp leaching loss was reduced by 35 19 55 12 under ci compared with that under fi in our study the tp and drp concentration in the soil solution of 0 10 cm under cc treatment was increased compared with that under fc treatment while the concentrations were significantly decreased in the 20 60 cm soil layer therefore we determine that controlled irrigation can reduce phosphorus leaching loss by concentrating phosphorus at the depth of 0 10 cm and controlling phosphorus migration to the deep layer increased tp concentration in 0 10 cm soil solution in cc treatment was inconsistent with the results of wang et al 2012 whose study illustrated that the anaerobic condition caused by flooding water under fi promoted conversion of insoluble p to active p in soil thus improving the solubility of p and promoting the higher p concentration in fi field conversely the study of zhang et al 2007 showed that the redox conditions formed by wsi promoted the activation of organophosphates thus increasing the p concentration in field water differences in irrigation methods soil physical and chemical properties and field management methods could be responsible for the inconsistence 4 2 biochar improves soil p availability and p use efficiency by rice op concentration in soil refers to the p that can be utilized by plants which can relatively indicate the p supply level of soil it is reported that ba increases the op concentration in farmland soil gao et al 2019 carried out an integrated analysis of 124 published researches and found that ba significantly increased the available p content of topsoil by about 45 liu et al 2017 expressed that biochar derived from rice hull significantly increased op concentration in different types of soil through a 9 week incubation experiment in our case soil op concentration of cb and cc treatment was significantly increased compared with ca treatment especially at the depth of 0 10 cm soil layer this was in agreement with their findings several recent review articles tesfaye et al 2021 summarized the mechanism of biochar to increase available p in soil 1 biochar itself releasing p zhai et al 2015 2 promoting p desorbing and dissolving by changing soil ph cui et al 2011 and 3 increased phosphatase activity driven by biochar stimulating mineralization of organic p in soil jin et al 2016 in agreement with the result of jin et al 2016 in our research op content and alp were significantly positively correlated fig 8 as described by wang et al 2021a soil phod harboring microbes in soil are easy to produce and activate phosphatases in the process of utilizing phosphorylated compounds thus mineralizing organophosphorus on the other hand decrease in correlation coefficient of op and alp with the increase of biochar amount was also observed in our case ghodszad et al 2021 also reported that changes in enzyme activity driven by biochar may take the responsibility for the increased soil available p but depending on the ba amount the review was supported by wang et al 2022 who claimed that low amount of ba increased alp activity by 6 1 69 4 while high amount of ba significantly decreased alp activity by 14 3 and 34 3 meanwhile a negative correlation between soil phosphatase activity and amount of ba was found in the study of silva et al 2020 additionally increased soil ph driven by biochar may be another reason for increasing alp activities and finally promoting the increase of available p content ghodszad et al 2021 judging from this soil phosphatase activity may be considered as an important predictor of p availability in rice p efficiency in rice fields was affected by the soil p content yan et al 2022 diffusion ability of p in soil solution suriyagoda et al 2014 the capacity of p release from solid chen et al 2022 and the growth of the root system chen et al 2022 for example song et al 2020 showed that biochar can effectively increase the content of soil available p thus promoting the absorption of phosphorus by plants and achieving the purpose of increasing yield and p use efficiency this study showed that ba significantly increased pe of rice degryse et al 2009 demonstrated that p uptake by rice have a strong correlation with soluble active p in pore water and weakly bound p in soil solids if diffusive transport of p from soil solution to plant roots was not limited in this case items including up olsen p pe and drp were all found increased because of ba in 2020 compared with ca treatment pe in cb and fc treatment increased by 5 32 and 10 33 respectively and pb also decreased by 3 45 and 6 66 increased up and pe and decreased pb can be ascribed to the increase of drp concentration in soil solution and the increase of op content in soil due to ba in this study other research results showed that ali et al 2020 ba promoted p absorbing ability of rice by promoting their root growth increasing their root and surface area researches on how biochar affects rice root thus affecting p uptake in rice can be carried out in the future 4 3 economic and environmental benefit of biochar combined with water saving irrigation as an important area of rice production in china taihu lake region is covered an area of 12373 km2 by paddy fields our research team has reported on the impact of combined ba and wsi on the ecological environment of rice fields in taihu lake region for many times in the past six years jiang et al 2021 focused on the greenhouse gas emissions in rice fields indicating that ba increased the soil respiration rate in wsi rice fields by 23 81 41 45 and decreased the global warming trend by 25 85 37 84 chen et al 2021 conducted the research in terms of n loss and found that combined ba and wsi reduced no3 n leaching loss by 29 98 38 63 and tn leaching loss by 12 77 13 36 qi et al 2022 mainly focused on ammonia volatilization loss and showed that combination of the two reduced ammonia volatilization sun et al 2021 also confirmed the positive effect of the two on co2 exchange in paddy fields this study mainly focused on the response of dynamics of p to the combination of the two and results showed that it increased p availability and reduced p leaching loss this study further confirmed the positive effect of ba and wsi technology on improving ecological environment from the perspective of p cycling in paddy fields taking the paddy fields in taihu lake region as an example ba of 20 t ha 1 and 40 t ha 1 improved rice yield by 1278 1852 kt and 1674 2441 kt as well as decreased tp leaching loss by 7 2 7 6 t and 18 7 t compared with wsi paddy fields without ba for farmers more attention is paid to the economic benefits after the combined application of the two and it is also the key factor affecting their large scale promotion and application therefore increased production cost of biochar input and the increased income from the increased rice yield after application was analyzed in this paper since biochar can be effective for over 20 years as supported by researchers dumortier et al 2020 khan et al 2022 lychuk et al 2015 we conservatively choose 20 years as the effective period of biochar and distribute the production cost caused by biochar to 20 years that is for cb cc treatment annual production cost in fields will increase by 800 and 1600yuan ha 1 y 1 average biochar price is 800yuan t 1 respectively in this study cb and cc benefit from the increased yield of 4744 and 6255yuan ha 1 in 2020 and 3358 and 4398yuan ha 1 in 2021 respectively average rice price in 2020 and 2021 is 3 17 and 3 25yuan kg 1 respectively derived from the china yearbook of agricultural price survey 2022 hence cb and cc increased net economic benefit by 2558 3944yuan ha 1 y 1and 2798 4655yuan ha 1 y 1 respectively in conclusion combined application of ba and wsi in paddy fields can bring both economic and environmental benefit and it also makes waste straw resources recycled in agricultural production which is of great significance to develop green agriculture 5 conclusions responses of rice yield p efficiency of rice and p dynamic changes in soil and soil solution to the combination of ba and wsi technology were studied the results showed that controlled irrigation reduced the tp and drp leaching loss by 35 19 55 12 and 34 64 49 70 as a result of controlling the downward migration of phosphorus in soil solution it was also found that biochar increased the pe of rice by 5 33 10 33 and reduced the pb by 3 45 6 66 due to the increased soil olsen p concentration and soil solution drp concentration additionally cb and cc were found increasing net economic benefit by 2558 3944 yuan ha 1 y 1and 2798 4655 yuan ha 1 y 1 respectively in all the study further explained the positive impact of biochar and controlled irrigation on the ecological environment in paddy fields from the perspective of p cycle and proved that the combined application of ba and wsi is a cleaner production strategy for both reducing p loss and improving productivity considering both environmental and economic benefits controlled irrigation coupling with biochar at a rate of 40 t ha 1 is recommended in this study credit authorship contribution

8991,early detection of water stress is essential for orchard management however existing methods are unable to accurately monitor individual plant water status over large areas and the shaded nature of kiwifruit orchards further complicates the monitoring of root soil moisture content rsmc in this study we used multilayer perceptron mlp and canopy vegetation indices estimated by unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing to predict rsmc at a depth of 40 cm during the fruit expansion stage in kiwi orchards august 2021 and 2022 using artificial intelligence algorithms we assessed the effect of image sampling size and model input combinations on estimation accuracy in the inversion model building process 247 mlp models were built based on a combination of eight vegetation indices and trained with 18 datasets according to different sampling widths to compare model evaluation parameters to reduce the amount of input parameters we selected parameters based on the pearson correlation between the input individual vegetation indices and output rsmc and finally compared the coefficients of determination of the models for different combinations of vegetation indices we found that the coefficient of determination and explained variance score increased and the root mean square error decreased as the model inputs increased the coefficient of determination and root mean square error had a strong positive correlation with sampling width r 0 7082 and 0 7273 respectively when training a model with green index green normalized difference vegetation index optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi or modified savi msavi as inputs the accuracy of the model remained approximately 0 7447 which did not vary significantly from models with eight vegetation indices as inputs but presented a simplified network structure this study provides a model building framework for the analysis of soil moisture conditions in shaded orchards keywords artificial neural network canopy cover multilayer perceptron multiparameter optical remote sensing unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is an essential resource in agriculture and soil moisture content smc the water available to crop roots is a key determinant of plant growth luo et al 2019 accurate estimates of the smc can provide a reliable reference for effective irrigation cheng et al 2020 gago et al 2015 current methods for measuring smc include weighing soil before and after drying estimation of conductivity using the soil dielectric constant active heated distributed temperature sensing agliata et al 2019 gps interferometric reflectometry larson 2016 and cosmic ray soil moisture sensors evans et al 2016 however these methods are limited by cost and measurement frequency and are thus not suited for regional smc estimation remote sensing inversion techniques are useful in the estimation of plant physiological status and smc at high spatial and temporal resolutions a et al 2022 blatchford et al 2019 virnodkar et al 2020 remote sensing data can be divided into three types optical thermal infrared and microwave data optical remote sensing consists mainly of visible and near infrared bands which contain information on surface reflectance and solar shortwave radiation corresponding to the spectral properties of landscape features serrano et al 2019 plant physiological status and smc can be estimated using numerous vegetation indices including predicting plant water status bellvert et al 2021 dong et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 and merely estimating smc from surface soil spectral characteristics sharma et al 2021 remote sensing using thermal infrared sensors can be used to monitor the thermodynamic characteristics of soils with different moisture contents and the canopy temperature of crops in different states of development and to estimate smc or plant moisture status through thermal inertia functions or by calculating the crop water stress index cwsi garcía tejero et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 but the spatial resolution of this approach is very limited mammatt et al 2014 because microwaves can detect the dielectric properties of soil microwave remote sensing is increasingly used to estimate smc dong et al 2020 smc data products generated from microwave remote sensing are widely used and include soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e karthikeyan et al 2019 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 however these datasets are discontinuous for sites with dense vegetation cover seneviratne et al 2010 constrained by data resolution satellite remote sensing is not necessarily suitable for small study sites such as kiwifruit orchards and may not provide sufficient data owing to fixed revisit intervals and weather interference as an emerging low altitude remote sensing platform unmanned aerial vehicles uavs have great potential for smc monitoring because they provide high resolution imagery and allow for flexible deployment according to weather varela et al 2018 several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of root smc rsmc estimation by uav remote sensing for example zhang et al 2021 estimated winter rsmc from wheat canopy spectral data collected by a multispectral camera with the coefficient of determination r² of 0 739 and root mean square error rmse of 2 0 ge et al 2019 combined uav hyperspectral imagery and machine learning to estimate field smc in xinjiang china with an r² of 0 91 bai et al 2021 estimated the smc of bare ground surfaces from multispectral data collected by uavs combined with a back propagation neural network algorithm uav based microwave radar has also been used for smc monitoring acevo herrera et al 2010 guo et al 2022 however this method is often used only on bare soil to avoid interference by vegetation uav based optical sensing rgb multispectral and hyperspectral is the main method used in smc monitoring research hassan esfahani et al 2015 lu et al 2020 optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not capture the smc under conditions of dense vegetation cover because of poor penetration therefore smc is usually estimated using proxies of vegetation condition e g leaf curling under conditions of low soil moisture chandel et al 2021 for winter wheat studies have shown that canopy spectral data corresponds well to smc at certain depths ren et al 2022 smc under maize canopy cover can also be estimated with high accuracy using multimodal data and machine learning algorithms cheng et al 2022 in contrast few studies have considered the effects of smc on the spectral characteristics of perennial woody plants e g vines which have greater canopy cover mixed old and new foliage and reflectance patterns that can be influenced by canopy structure liu et al 2022 manja and aoun 2019 therefore the potential of uav optical remote sensing in the rsmc estimation of fruit trees remains unclear although vegetation conditions have some correlation with smc these correlations may be nonlinear however this limitation can be overcome using machine learning algorithms which are well suited to deal with nonlinear problems and can be used for data mining holloway and mengersen 2018 romero et al 2018 combined high resolution images obtained by uav mounted hyperspectral equipment with an artificial neural network ann to establish a leaf water potential inversion model for vineyards zhou et al 2021 extracted canopy characteristics of different soybean seed lines under drought stress using a convolutional neural network cnn algorithm to successfully estimate yield yu et al 2021 used a hybrid cnn gated recurrent unit model to estimate the soil moisture of maize roots in shandong province china from meteorological data the multilayer perceptron mlp is a typical ann algorithm mlp consists of an input layer an arbitrary number of hidden layers and an output layer the variables are passed through the first layer of input and passed in the hidden layer using a non linear activation function the model contains 2 parameters weight and bias the input value of the neuron in the hidden layer is multiplied by the weight and then the bias is processed by the activation function to provide this value as input to the next layer where the bias and the weight are unknowns estimated by the optimization algorithm this model can handle complex nonlinear problems and has been successfully used for nonlinear modeling in agriculture chlorophyll content is an important factor affecting canopy reflectance compared with field crops the canopy of trees is larger and more complex and the chlorophyll content of leaves at different locations in the tree canopy can vary significantly zhuang et al 2021 thus affecting the reflection absorption and transmission of incident light from the canopy and changing the reflectance pattern of its own canopy sun et al 2020 the above reasons may result in different locations of the same canopy exhibiting different spectral characteristics and this variation has the potential to affect the accuracy of plant physiological parameter estimation in this study we used uav remote sensing to obtain canopy multispectral data of a kiwifruit orchard during the fruit expansion stage and estimated the rsmc at a soil depth of 40 cm using machine learning algorithms the main objectives of this study were to 1 assess the accuracy of rsmc estimation for individual kiwifruit plants using machine learning algorithms 2 explore the effect of the combination of sampling window size and vegetation index on prediction model accuracy and 3 determine how sampling window size affects the accuracy of rsmc estimation the proposed modeling approach can be applied to similar shaded orchards for the estimation of soil water content 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and setup the experiments were conducted august 2021 and 2022 at the kiwifruit experiment station of the northwest agriculture and forestry university baoji city china 107 59 31 4 n 34 7 27 9 e 643 22 m above sea level fig 1 this region has a warm temperate continental semi mesic climate average annual temperature 12 9 c average annual precipitation 609 5 mm average cumulative daylight hours 2015 2 h and frost free days 218 autumn is affected by cold air currents with a pronounced temperature difference between day and night making it one of the areas with the most autumn rains in the guanzhong region from march to may each year winter is broken with a rapid increase in temperature for these reasons this region is particularly suitable for kiwifruit though manual irrigation is still required the orchard was planted with various varieties of kiwifruit the model plant in this study was the xuxiang cultivar fruit expansion for this cultivar occurs during august while the plant has a high water demand we selected 12 plants with the same irrigation and fertilization treatments with 3 m spacing between plants and 4 m between rows 2 2 data collection data were collected between 12 00 and 14 00 on august 5 and 22 2021 and 2022 when kiwifruit were more susceptible to water stress and fewer orthophoto shadows were obtained li et al 2020 salinero et al 2009 remote sensing data were collected simultaneously with ground data using a dji phantom 4 v2 0 uav equipped with a survy3 multispectral camera mapir san diego usa at an altitude of 15 m and resolution of 0 007 m the multispectral camera has three bands red 660 nm green 550 nm and near infrared 850 nm the remote sensing equipment is shown in fig 2 the raw images were corrected using the mapir camera controller and multispectral calibration plates and orthoimages were constructed using pix4mapper software pix4d prilly switzerland based on the structure from motion and bundle block adjustment algorithms grados et al 2020 the experimental area was segmented according to the plant spacing of the orchard at 600 400 px approximately 4 3 m and used as the initial sampling window to calculate the vegetation index fig 3 soil water content was determined at a depth of 40 cm in the water active layer 20 80 cm which is less influenced by the atmosphere but still active and comprises the main growth depth of the kiwifruit root system tao et al 1993 soil profiles were collected 40 cm around the main stem of kiwifruit after irrigation and the average of three samples using a pr 3001 trrec n01 soil moisture tester renji measurement control china was considered as the rsmc per plant while collecting soil data the upper middle and lower parts of three randomly selected mature or new leaves were measured three times using a soil plant analysis development spad 502 chlorophyll meter konica minolta japan the average was used as the leaf chlorophyll concentration hawkins et al 2009 the data acquisition site is shown in fig 4 2 3 construction of vegetation index a total of 1035 raw images were collected in 2021 and 2022 after processing 180 canopy orthophotos were obtained and the specific parameters of the images are shown in table 1 these images will be used to calculate the mean values of various vegetation indices of the canopy for the assessment of the vegetation indices of kiwifruit rsmc as shown in table 2 2 4 model construction the multilayer perceptron mlp is a multilayer feedforward neural network commonly used for data estimation and mining in agriculture khalifani et al 2022 singh et al 2012 the hidden node of the mlp uses the inner product of the input and weight vectors as the independent variable of the activation function and the activation function uses the relu function rynkiewicz 2019 each parameter has an equal influence on the output of the network therefore the mlp is a global approximation of the nonlinear mapping to investigate the effect of sample size on the model the sampling window was transformed with the image center as the origin eq 1 and the transformation distribution is shown in fig 5 1 b i b 1 0 2 i i 1 2 11 here b denotes the width of the initial sampling window i denotes the scale factor and b i denotes the width of the sampling area after cropping with scale factor i using the eight parameters 247 mlp networks were established to compare the effects of different parameter numbers on model results table 3 the inputs of the 247 mlp networks are different combinations of 8 vegetation indices and the structures of both the hidden and output layers are the same after sampling at different sizes 18 sets of training data were obtained these 18 data sets were used to train 247 mlp models and the accuracy of each model was counted for a total of 4446 results the model training set consisted of 60 of all the data and the remaining 40 was used as the test set each set of data in the training set consisted of multiple vegetation indices with corresponding smc for neural network model training the test set consisted of vegetation indices with unknown labels to evaluate the model prediction effect the model construction and training tools are shown in table 4 2 5 model evaluation to assess the accuracy of each model we used the coefficient of determination r² eq 2 root mean square error rmse eq 3 and explained variance score evs eq 4 of the predicted and true values which were counted and plotted according to sampling size and number of parameters yue et al 2019 2 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 r m s e i 1 n y i y 2 n 4 e v s 1 v a r y y ˆ v a r y here y is the measured soil water content ŷ is the predicted soil water content and n is the number of samples using the sample size of different model datasets as horizontal coordinates and the coefficient of determination and root mean square error of the model as vertical coordinates a scatter plot of sampling size versus model evaluation metrics was plotted and a cubic fitting curve was calculated to evaluate the relationship between the sample size and model performance which was limited by the initial sampling window size of the image the maximum horizontal coordinate of the fitting curve was 600 px the combinations of vegetation indices selected after correlation analysis were evaluated using determination coefficients 2 6 correlation analysis of vegetation indices after determining the optimal sampling window size pearson correlation analysis was performed using ibm spss chicago il usa between the vegetation indices and rsmc to remove redundant parameters and optimize the model inputs vegetation indices showing a strong correlation with rsmc but weak correlation with renormalized difference vi rdvi were selected to preserve as much relevant information as possible while reducing the autocorrelation of different parameters 3 results 3 1 model accuracy with different sampling window size datasets the 247 model evaluation parameters trained using 18 datasets were counted and box line plots were constructed for the sampling widths of 125 272 and 500 px fig 6 during training of the model using different sampling window datasets we found that the evaluation parameters maintained a certain relationship with the model with different input quantities regardless of the variation in the sampling window size this indicates that the model fit was stronger when the input variables were more complex for the sampling width of 272 px the model coefficient of determination increased as the vegetation index increased from 2 to 8 as follows 0 091 range 0 062 0 352 0 158 0 092 0 395 0 373 0 111 0 458 0 415 0 367 0 703 0 558 0 411 0 7024 0 699 0 579 0 701 and 0 752 respectively the root mean square error of the model decreased as the number of vegetation indices increased from 2 to 8 as follows 4 53 3 38 5 51 3 92 2 89 4 58 to 3 04 2 75 4 35 2 87 1 59 3 11 2 11 1 57 2 92 1 38 1 08 2 28 and 1 43 respectively fig 6 the model explained variance scores showed the same trend therefore using additional input variables can improve the prediction accuracy of the mlp model different sampling window sizes were found to limit model accuracy as the model input parameters increased the median coefficients of determination were 0 121 0 284 0 348 0 466 0 475 0 560 0 491 for the sampling width of 125 px 0 101 0 187 0 415 and 0 415 for the sampling width of 500 px and 0 415 0 440 0 442 0 593 0 628 for the sampling width of 272 which showed the highest coefficient of determination the root mean square error showed the opposite trend whereas the difference in the explained variance score of the models was not significant therefore the existence of an optimal sampling range within the initial sampling range allows the model to achieve a higher accuracy when trained using more variables to analyze the effect of sample size on the accuracy of each model we screened the optimal sampling window using the coefficient of determination root mean square error and explained variance score for the eight vegetation index models as input table 5 for the sampling width of 125 600 px the coefficient of determination of the model varied from 0 376 to 0 752 root mean square error from 0 994 to 3 903 and explained variance score from 0 462 to 0 953 the maximum explained variance score was observed with the sampling width of 187 px when the diagonal length of the sampling window was 224 75 px and the number of pixels in the sampling area was 23 313 the maximum value of the coefficient of determination and minimum value of the root mean square error were observed at the sampling width of 272 px when the diagonal length of the sampling window was 326 90 px and the number of pixels in the sampling area was 49 322 corresponding to an explained variance score of 0 844 the minimum coefficient of determination was observed at the sampling width of 150 px with which the root mean square error reached a maximum of 3 903 as the initial sampling width of each plant was 600 px the maximum value of the horizontal coordinate was 600 px the distribution of the coefficient of determination in the horizontal coordinate showed that the model coefficient of determination changed in the same direction as the sampling width fig 7 the absolute value of the slope of the decreasing interval was greater than that of the increasing interval whereas the root mean square error changed in the opposite direction of the sampling width the cubic fitting curves of the sampling width and model coefficient of determination are shown in fig 7 a whose fitted coefficient of determination was 0 7082 and the cubic fitting curves of the sampling width and root mean square error are shown in fig 7 b whose fitted coefficient of determination was 0 7273 these results indicate that model accuracy had a strong correlation with sample size and that there was an optimal sampling window to achieve maximum accuracy during the sampling size change based on the changes in the coefficient of determination and root mean square error with sampling width at 250 300 px the models had the greatest prediction accuracy for rsmc the model trained using a sampling width of 272 px had the best prediction accuracy for smc when the height of the sampling window was 181 px because the ground resolution was 0 007 m the actual sampling window width height and area were 1 904 m 1 267 m and 2 412 m² respectively we therefore selected 272 px as the optimal sampling window width to further investigate the effect of parameter combinations on model accuracy we assessed the performance of the model with all samples n 151 and found that the trends of the predicted and true values were comparable fig 8 a which indicates good model fit for each sample point the coefficient of determination of the distribution of true and predicted values was 0 781 however the model tended to underestimate for larger true values rsmc 39 which can also be seen in the distribution of the true and predicted values in fig 8 b where most of the scatter points for rsmc 39 are in the lower half this may be due to insufficient data for higher rsmc however in actual production rsmc in this range should not affect plant water stress status 3 2 correlation analysis of vegetation indices pearson correlations were performed to screen the eight vegetation indices and rsmc according to their contribution to the model table 6 the pearson correlation coefficient between greenness index gi and rsmc was 0 indicating that it was negatively correlated with rsmc and the absolute value of the correlation coefficient was 0 19 the other seven vegetation indices were positively correlated with rsmc and the correlation coefficient between rdvi and rsmc was the largest at 0 72 the correlation coefficients of soil adjusted vi savi ndvi optimized savi osavi modified savi msavi and simple ration sr with rsmc were all around 0 6 second only to the correlation coefficient of rdvi with rsmc finally the correlation coefficient of green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi with rsmc was 0 5 the pearson correlation coefficients of savi ndvi osavi msavi and sr with rdvi ranged from 0 85 to 0 90 table 7 indicating that these vegetation indices were strongly correlated with rdvi and were redundant variables in the modeling process the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the gi and rdvi was 0 15 and that between gndvi and rdvi was 0 21 indicating weak correlations in summary among the eight vegetation indices rdvi was the best parameter for estimating rsmc however the evaluation parameters obtained from the models of different vegetation index combinations indicated that it is difficult to obtain better estimation results for a single parameter therefore it is necessary to screen a combination of vegetation indices that correspond to improved evaluation parameters while including as few vegetation indices as possible 3 3 effect of different vegetation index combinations on model accuracy to investigate the effect of specific vegetation index combinations on model prediction accuracy we selected rdvi which had the highest correlation with rsmc and gi and gndvi the two parameters with the lowest correlation with rdvi these vegetation indices can be combined to obtain six combinations where the single index combinations means that in the multi vegetation index model only one index of gi gndvi and rdvi but not the other two indices are included and the double and triple indices combinations are the same the training data for these models were sampled at widths of 125 272 and 500 px the distribution of the coefficient of determination of the model containing only a single index was similar to the pearson vegetation index rsmc correlation coefficient rdvi gndvi gi fig 9 taking a model with input parameters of 3 as an example the median coefficients of determination for models with only a single index were 0 362 0 073 and 0 159 respectively the coefficients of determination for models with the double or triple index were significantly higher than those with only the single index some models with the double index performed better than those with the triple index the median coefficients of the models with input parameters of 3 and containing the double and triple indices were 0 409 0 429 0 572 and 0 576 respectively whereas that of the other combined model was only 0 088 the distribution of model determination coefficients for the input parameters of three to seven vegetation indices was similar indicating that all the six vegetation index combinations had the same effect on different models and could be used as a condition for screening vegetation index combinations the model determination coefficients for the third parameter using different vegetation indices are shown in table 8 the maximum coefficient of determination achieved on the training set was 0 7398 the coefficients of determination for the third parameter selection osavi and msavi were 0 7398 and 0 7392 respectively this indicated that selecting osavi or msavi as the third parameter in the models with three vegetation indices as inputs resulted in better predictions the rsmc inversion model using gi gndvi and msavi was constructed with a sampling width of 272 px the trends in the distribution of the predicted and true values were comparable indicating good model fit with each sample point fig 10 a b the coefficient of determination of the true and predicted values of all samples was 0 7447 and the rmse was 2 422 which differed by 0 0363 from that of the model with the input parameter of 8 the difference in accuracy was therefore minimal while the number of input parameters was reduced 3 4 canopy vegetation index and chlorophyll distribution the ndvi values of the kiwifruit canopy were not uniformly distributed fig 11 a b the vegetation index at the top and center of the canopy was generally greater than that at the edges the ndvi values of entangled vines and overlapping canopy were higher than those of non overlapping sections though it was impossible to distinguish between plants fig 11 c we observed large differences in color and texture between mature and new leaves which was reflected in the spad values the mean spad values ranged from 35 to 58 90 between plants and the maximum difference in the mean spad values between different leaves of a single plant was 14 13 table 9 4 discussion 4 1 causes of variation in the spectral characteristics of kiwifruit canopies kiwifruit has a much higher water requirement than other fruits suitable areas for kiwifruit cultivation have a rainfall of 800 1200 mm however the rainfall in the guanzhong region of shaanxi does not meet this requirement under natural conditions kiwifruit plants are gradually exposed to water stress a phenomenon particularly evident during fruit expansion salinero et al 2009 plant water stress can be assessed by plant leaf water potential or stomatal conductance plant leaf water potential at midday also reflects the maximum water deficit yan et al 2013 when soil moisture decreases stomata respond mainly to chemical signals e g aba generated by root dehydration and close to limit water loss which leads to a decrease in chlorophyll content while maintaining stable leaf water status although the mechanism by which changes in stomatal conductance trigger chlorophyll content is unclear water stress is known to induce photochemical changes immediately after stomatal closure carter 1991 chaves et al 2002 external stress such as drought can damage chlorophyll pigments and decrease photosynthetic efficiency resulting in changes to the spectral characteristics of the leaf de jong et al 2012 which affects the pattern of reflection absorption and transmission of incident light by the crop canopy and thus the vegetation index sun et al 2020 4 2 sample size affects model accuracy changes in the sampling window directly affect data collection from the canopy to leaf level and can impact the spectral data and vegetation index estimate siegmann et al 2021 to investigate why window size variation affects model accuracy we assessed changes in leaf spad and ndvi over the same period similar to the findings of zisong et al 2013 and zhuang et al 2021 plants under the same conditions had clear differences in spad values and the values of leaves at different locations on the same plant also differed significantly which is likely due to the complex structure of the canopy this variation in spad values between leaves correspond with the heterogeneity observed for the canopy ndvi distribution based on the ndvi and leaf spad results we hypothesized that sample size influences model accuracy as follows 1 the difference in reflectance and canopy distribution between new and mature leaves led to an uneven distribution of vegetation indices additionally with plant stress changes in the spectral characteristics are expected to vary between these leaves which could affect the vegetation indices collected from different sampling windows 2 with some kiwifruit canopies not fully covering the soil surface their mean vegetation indices would be lower compared to those of full canopy plants however less surface soil is exposed closer to the center of the canopy thus attenuating the effect of soil elements on the vegetation indices of the canopy 3 the spectral characteristics of the canopy are influenced by the canopy structure verrelst et al 2016 yang and van der tol 2018 overlapping of kiwifruit vines and canopy via trellises caused an abrupt change in canopy structure and ndvi which could affect model outcomes 4 when the sample size is too small the vegetation index only represents a few leaves at the top center of the canopy thus the state of the leaves themselves e g pests and diseases etc would affect the overall vegetation index jiang et al 2022 which is why the model performance decreases after the sampling window is reduced past a certain level using the final inversion model for rsmc estimation we found that the vegetation index sample area during the fruit expansion stage was more suitable at approximately 2 412 m² which corresponded to a coefficient of determination and root mean square error of 0 7447 and 2 422 respectively for all samples however this study only considered the effects of different combinations of sampling window sizes and vegetation indices on rsmc inversions at 40 cm soil depths in xuxiang kiwifruit during the fruit expansion stage further studies on other varieties of plants and phenological stages of kiwifruit would aid in establishing robust models for rsmc estimation 5 conclusions in this study we established an inversion model to estimate soil moisture content up to 40 cm for individual fruiting xuxiang kiwifruit plants using an unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral images which was parameterized based on the results of different sampling window sizes and vegetation indices we found that the accuracy and root mean square error of the soil water content inversion model were strongly correlated with the sampling window of remote sensing images with coefficients of 0 7082 and 0 7273 respectively this is because the sampling window change process is actually the sampling process of the vegetation index from canopy to leaf level and this structural gradient change can affect the spectral data due to soil background leaf distribution and chlorophyll content thus affecting the model accuracy a maximum accuracy of 0 7810 was achieved when the multilayer perceptron inversion model was trained with a sampling width of 1 904 m and area of 2 412 m2 estimation using different combinations of vegetation indices showed that the inverse model accuracy increased with the number of inputs but the simplified model with greenness index green normalized difference vegetation index modified soil adjusted vegetation index or optimized soil adjusted vegetation index could still

8991,early detection of water stress is essential for orchard management however existing methods are unable to accurately monitor individual plant water status over large areas and the shaded nature of kiwifruit orchards further complicates the monitoring of root soil moisture content rsmc in this study we used multilayer perceptron mlp and canopy vegetation indices estimated by unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing to predict rsmc at a depth of 40 cm during the fruit expansion stage in kiwi orchards august 2021 and 2022 using artificial intelligence algorithms we assessed the effect of image sampling size and model input combinations on estimation accuracy in the inversion model building process 247 mlp models were built based on a combination of eight vegetation indices and trained with 18 datasets according to different sampling widths to compare model evaluation parameters to reduce the amount of input parameters we selected parameters based on the pearson correlation between the input individual vegetation indices and output rsmc and finally compared the coefficients of determination of the models for different combinations of vegetation indices we found that the coefficient of determination and explained variance score increased and the root mean square error decreased as the model inputs increased the coefficient of determination and root mean square error had a strong positive correlation with sampling width r 0 7082 and 0 7273 respectively when training a model with green index green normalized difference vegetation index optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi or modified savi msavi as inputs the accuracy of the model remained approximately 0 7447 which did not vary significantly from models with eight vegetation indices as inputs but presented a simplified network structure this study provides a model building framework for the analysis of soil moisture conditions in shaded orchards keywords artificial neural network canopy cover multilayer perceptron multiparameter optical remote sensing unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is an essential resource in agriculture and soil moisture content smc the water available to crop roots is a key determinant of plant growth luo et al 2019 accurate estimates of the smc can provide a reliable reference for effective irrigation cheng et al 2020 gago et al 2015 current methods for measuring smc include weighing soil before and after drying estimation of conductivity using the soil dielectric constant active heated distributed temperature sensing agliata et al 2019 gps interferometric reflectometry larson 2016 and cosmic ray soil moisture sensors evans et al 2016 however these methods are limited by cost and measurement frequency and are thus not suited for regional smc estimation remote sensing inversion techniques are useful in the estimation of plant physiological status and smc at high spatial and temporal resolutions a et al 2022 blatchford et al 2019 virnodkar et al 2020 remote sensing data can be divided into three types optical thermal infrared and microwave data optical remote sensing consists mainly of visible and near infrared bands which contain information on surface reflectance and solar shortwave radiation corresponding to the spectral properties of landscape features serrano et al 2019 plant physiological status and smc can be estimated using numerous vegetation indices including predicting plant water status bellvert et al 2021 dong et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 and merely estimating smc from surface soil spectral characteristics sharma et al 2021 remote sensing using thermal infrared sensors can be used to monitor the thermodynamic characteristics of soils with different moisture contents and the canopy temperature of crops in different states of development and to estimate smc or plant moisture status through thermal inertia functions or by calculating the crop water stress index cwsi garcía tejero et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 but the spatial resolution of this approach is very limited mammatt et al 2014 because microwaves can detect the dielectric properties of soil microwave remote sensing is increasingly used to estimate smc dong et al 2020 smc data products generated from microwave remote sensing are widely used and include soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e karthikeyan et al 2019 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 however these datasets are discontinuous for sites with dense vegetation cover seneviratne et al 2010 constrained by data resolution satellite remote sensing is not necessarily suitable for small study sites such as kiwifruit orchards and may not provide sufficient data owing to fixed revisit intervals and weather interference as an emerging low altitude remote sensing platform unmanned aerial vehicles uavs have great potential for smc monitoring because they provide high resolution imagery and allow for flexible deployment according to weather varela et al 2018 several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of root smc rsmc estimation by uav remote sensing for example zhang et al 2021 estimated winter rsmc from wheat canopy spectral data collected by a multispectral camera with the coefficient of determination r² of 0 739 and root mean square error rmse of 2 0 ge et al 2019 combined uav hyperspectral imagery and machine learning to estimate field smc in xinjiang china with an r² of 0 91 bai et al 2021 estimated the smc of bare ground surfaces from multispectral data collected by uavs combined with a back propagation neural network algorithm uav based microwave radar has also been used for smc monitoring acevo herrera et al 2010 guo et al 2022 however this method is often used only on bare soil to avoid interference by vegetation uav based optical sensing rgb multispectral and hyperspectral is the main method used in smc monitoring research hassan esfahani et al 2015 lu et al 2020 optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not capture the smc under conditions of dense vegetation cover because of poor penetration therefore smc is usually estimated using proxies of vegetation condition e g leaf curling under conditions of low soil moisture chandel et al 2021 for winter wheat studies have shown that canopy spectral data corresponds well to smc at certain depths ren et al 2022 smc under maize canopy cover can also be estimated with high accuracy using multimodal data and machine learning algorithms cheng et al 2022 in contrast few studies have considered the effects of smc on the spectral characteristics of perennial woody plants e g vines which have greater canopy cover mixed old and new foliage and reflectance patterns that can be influenced by canopy structure liu et al 2022 manja and aoun 2019 therefore the potential of uav optical remote sensing in the rsmc estimation of fruit trees remains unclear although vegetation conditions have some correlation with smc these correlations may be nonlinear however this limitation can be overcome using machine learning algorithms which are well suited to deal with nonlinear problems and can be used for data mining holloway and mengersen 2018 romero et al 2018 combined high resolution images obtained by uav mounted hyperspectral equipment with an artificial neural network ann to establish a leaf water potential inversion model for vineyards zhou et al 2021 extracted canopy characteristics of different soybean seed lines under drought stress using a convolutional neural network cnn algorithm to successfully estimate yield yu et al 2021 used a hybrid cnn gated recurrent unit model to estimate the soil moisture of maize roots in shandong province china from meteorological data the multilayer perceptron mlp is a typical ann algorithm mlp consists of an input layer an arbitrary number of hidden layers and an output layer the variables are passed through the first layer of input and passed in the hidden layer using a non linear activation function the model contains 2 parameters weight and bias the input value of the neuron in the hidden layer is multiplied by the weight and then the bias is processed by the activation function to provide this value as input to the next layer where the bias and the weight are unknowns estimated by the optimization algorithm this model can handle complex nonlinear problems and has been successfully used for nonlinear modeling in agriculture chlorophyll content is an important factor affecting canopy reflectance compared with field crops the canopy of trees is larger and more complex and the chlorophyll content of leaves at different locations in the tree canopy can vary significantly zhuang et al 2021 thus affecting the reflection absorption and transmission of incident light from the canopy and changing the reflectance pattern of its own canopy sun et al 2020 the above reasons may result in different locations of the same canopy exhibiting different spectral characteristics and this variation has the potential to affect the accuracy of plant physiological parameter estimation in this study we used uav remote sensing to obtain canopy multispectral data of a kiwifruit orchard during the fruit expansion stage and estimated the rsmc at a soil depth of 40 cm using machine learning algorithms the main objectives of this study were to 1 assess the accuracy of rsmc estimation for individual kiwifruit plants using machine learning algorithms 2 explore the effect of the combination of sampling window size and vegetation index on prediction model accuracy and 3 determine how sampling window size affects the accuracy of rsmc estimation the proposed modeling approach can be applied to similar shaded orchards for the estimation of soil water content 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and setup the experiments were conducted august 2021 and 2022 at the kiwifruit experiment station of the northwest agriculture and forestry university baoji city china 107 59 31 4 n 34 7 27 9 e 643 22 m above sea level fig 1 this region has a warm temperate continental semi mesic climate average annual temperature 12 9 c average annual precipitation 609 5 mm average cumulative daylight hours 2015 2 h and frost free days 218 autumn is affected by cold air currents with a pronounced temperature difference between day and night making it one of the areas with the most autumn rains in the guanzhong region from march to may each year winter is broken with a rapid increase in temperature for these reasons this region is particularly suitable for kiwifruit though manual irrigation is still required the orchard was planted with various varieties of kiwifruit the model plant in this study was the xuxiang cultivar fruit expansion for this cultivar occurs during august while the plant has a high water demand we selected 12 plants with the same irrigation and fertilization treatments with 3 m spacing between plants and 4 m between rows 2 2 data collection data were collected between 12 00 and 14 00 on august 5 and 22 2021 and 2022 when kiwifruit were more susceptible to water stress and fewer orthophoto shadows were obtained li et al 2020 salinero et al 2009 remote sensing data were collected simultaneously with ground data using a dji phantom 4 v2 0 uav equipped with a survy3 multispectral camera mapir san diego usa at an altitude of 15 m and resolution of 0 007 m the multispectral camera has three bands red 660 nm green 550 nm and near infrared 850 nm the remote sensing equipment is shown in fig 2 the raw images were corrected using the mapir camera controller and multispectral calibration plates and orthoimages were constructed using pix4mapper software pix4d prilly switzerland based on the structure from motion and bundle block adjustment algorithms grados et al 2020 the experimental area was segmented according to the plant spacing of the orchard at 600 400 px approximately 4 3 m and used as the initial sampling window to calculate the vegetation index fig 3 soil water content was determined at a depth of 40 cm in the water active layer 20 80 cm which is less influenced by the atmosphere but still active and comprises the main growth depth of the kiwifruit root system tao et al 1993 soil profiles were collected 40 cm around the main stem of kiwifruit after irrigation and the average of three samples using a pr 3001 trrec n01 soil moisture tester renji measurement control china was considered as the rsmc per plant while collecting soil data the upper middle and lower parts of three randomly selected mature or new leaves were measured three times using a soil plant analysis development spad 502 chlorophyll meter konica minolta japan the average was used as the leaf chlorophyll concentration hawkins et al 2009 the data acquisition site is shown in fig 4 2 3 construction of vegetation index a total of 1035 raw images were collected in 2021 and 2022 after processing 180 canopy orthophotos were obtained and the specific parameters of the images are shown in table 1 these images will be used to calculate the mean values of various vegetation indices of the canopy for the assessment of the vegetation indices of kiwifruit rsmc as shown in table 2 2 4 model construction the multilayer perceptron mlp is a multilayer feedforward neural network commonly used for data estimation and mining in agriculture khalifani et al 2022 singh et al 2012 the hidden node of the mlp uses the inner product of the input and weight vectors as the independent variable of the activation function and the activation function uses the relu function rynkiewicz 2019 each parameter has an equal influence on the output of the network therefore the mlp is a global approximation of the nonlinear mapping to investigate the effect of sample size on the model the sampling window was transformed with the image center as the origin eq 1 and the transformation distribution is shown in fig 5 1 b i b 1 0 2 i i 1 2 11 here b denotes the width of the initial sampling window i denotes the scale factor and b i denotes the width of the sampling area after cropping with scale factor i using the eight parameters 247 mlp networks were established to compare the effects of different parameter numbers on model results table 3 the inputs of the 247 mlp networks are different combinations of 8 vegetation indices and the structures of both the hidden and output layers are the same after sampling at different sizes 18 sets of training data were obtained these 18 data sets were used to train 247 mlp models and the accuracy of each model was counted for a total of 4446 results the model training set consisted of 60 of all the data and the remaining 40 was used as the test set each set of data in the training set consisted of multiple vegetation indices with corresponding smc for neural network model training the test set consisted of vegetation indices with unknown labels to evaluate the model prediction effect the model construction and training tools are shown in table 4 2 5 model evaluation to assess the accuracy of each model we used the coefficient of determination r² eq 2 root mean square error rmse eq 3 and explained variance score evs eq 4 of the predicted and true values which were counted and plotted according to sampling size and number of parameters yue et al 2019 2 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 r m s e i 1 n y i y 2 n 4 e v s 1 v a r y y ˆ v a r y here y is the measured soil water content ŷ is the predicted soil water content and n is the number of samples using the sample size of different model datasets as horizontal coordinates and the coefficient of determination and root mean square error of the model as vertical coordinates a scatter plot of sampling size versus model evaluation metrics was plotted and a cubic fitting curve was calculated to evaluate the relationship between the sample size and model performance which was limited by the initial sampling window size of the image the maximum horizontal coordinate of the fitting curve was 600 px the combinations of vegetation indices selected after correlation analysis were evaluated using determination coefficients 2 6 correlation analysis of vegetation indices after determining the optimal sampling window size pearson correlation analysis was performed using ibm spss chicago il usa between the vegetation indices and rsmc to remove redundant parameters and optimize the model inputs vegetation indices showing a strong correlation with rsmc but weak correlation with renormalized difference vi rdvi were selected to preserve as much relevant information as possible while reducing the autocorrelation of different parameters 3 results 3 1 model accuracy with different sampling window size datasets the 247 model evaluation parameters trained using 18 datasets were counted and box line plots were constructed for the sampling widths of 125 272 and 500 px fig 6 during training of the model using different sampling window datasets we found that the evaluation parameters maintained a certain relationship with the model with different input quantities regardless of the variation in the sampling window size this indicates that the model fit was stronger when the input variables were more complex for the sampling width of 272 px the model coefficient of determination increased as the vegetation index increased from 2 to 8 as follows 0 091 range 0 062 0 352 0 158 0 092 0 395 0 373 0 111 0 458 0 415 0 367 0 703 0 558 0 411 0 7024 0 699 0 579 0 701 and 0 752 respectively the root mean square error of the model decreased as the number of vegetation indices increased from 2 to 8 as follows 4 53 3 38 5 51 3 92 2 89 4 58 to 3 04 2 75 4 35 2 87 1 59 3 11 2 11 1 57 2 92 1 38 1 08 2 28 and 1 43 respectively fig 6 the model explained variance scores showed the same trend therefore using additional input variables can improve the prediction accuracy of the mlp model different sampling window sizes were found to limit model accuracy as the model input parameters increased the median coefficients of determination were 0 121 0 284 0 348 0 466 0 475 0 560 0 491 for the sampling width of 125 px 0 101 0 187 0 415 and 0 415 for the sampling width of 500 px and 0 415 0 440 0 442 0 593 0 628 for the sampling width of 272 which showed the highest coefficient of determination the root mean square error showed the opposite trend whereas the difference in the explained variance score of the models was not significant therefore the existence of an optimal sampling range within the initial sampling range allows the model to achieve a higher accuracy when trained using more variables to analyze the effect of sample size on the accuracy of each model we screened the optimal sampling window using the coefficient of determination root mean square error and explained variance score for the eight vegetation index models as input table 5 for the sampling width of 125 600 px the coefficient of determination of the model varied from 0 376 to 0 752 root mean square error from 0 994 to 3 903 and explained variance score from 0 462 to 0 953 the maximum explained variance score was observed with the sampling width of 187 px when the diagonal length of the sampling window was 224 75 px and the number of pixels in the sampling area was 23 313 the maximum value of the coefficient of determination and minimum value of the root mean square error were observed at the sampling width of 272 px when the diagonal length of the sampling window was 326 90 px and the number of pixels in the sampling area was 49 322 corresponding to an explained variance score of 0 844 the minimum coefficient of determination was observed at the sampling width of 150 px with which the root mean square error reached a maximum of 3 903 as the initial sampling width of each plant was 600 px the maximum value of the horizontal coordinate was 600 px the distribution of the coefficient of determination in the horizontal coordinate showed that the model coefficient of determination changed in the same direction as the sampling width fig 7 the absolute value of the slope of the decreasing interval was greater than that of the increasing interval whereas the root mean square error changed in the opposite direction of the sampling width the cubic fitting curves of the sampling width and model coefficient of determination are shown in fig 7 a whose fitted coefficient of determination was 0 7082 and the cubic fitting curves of the sampling width and root mean square error are shown in fig 7 b whose fitted coefficient of determination was 0 7273 these results indicate that model accuracy had a strong correlation with sample size and that there was an optimal sampling window to achieve maximum accuracy during the sampling size change based on the changes in the coefficient of determination and root mean square error with sampling width at 250 300 px the models had the greatest prediction accuracy for rsmc the model trained using a sampling width of 272 px had the best prediction accuracy for smc when the height of the sampling window was 181 px because the ground resolution was 0 007 m the actual sampling window width height and area were 1 904 m 1 267 m and 2 412 m² respectively we therefore selected 272 px as the optimal sampling window width to further investigate the effect of parameter combinations on model accuracy we assessed the performance of the model with all samples n 151 and found that the trends of the predicted and true values were comparable fig 8 a which indicates good model fit for each sample point the coefficient of determination of the distribution of true and predicted values was 0 781 however the model tended to underestimate for larger true values rsmc 39 which can also be seen in the distribution of the true and predicted values in fig 8 b where most of the scatter points for rsmc 39 are in the lower half this may be due to insufficient data for higher rsmc however in actual production rsmc in this range should not affect plant water stress status 3 2 correlation analysis of vegetation indices pearson correlations were performed to screen the eight vegetation indices and rsmc according to their contribution to the model table 6 the pearson correlation coefficient between greenness index gi and rsmc was 0 indicating that it was negatively correlated with rsmc and the absolute value of the correlation coefficient was 0 19 the other seven vegetation indices were positively correlated with rsmc and the correlation coefficient between rdvi and rsmc was the largest at 0 72 the correlation coefficients of soil adjusted vi savi ndvi optimized savi osavi modified savi msavi and simple ration sr with rsmc were all around 0 6 second only to the correlation coefficient of rdvi with rsmc finally the correlation coefficient of green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi with rsmc was 0 5 the pearson correlation coefficients of savi ndvi osavi msavi and sr with rdvi ranged from 0 85 to 0 90 table 7 indicating that these vegetation indices were strongly correlated with rdvi and were redundant variables in the modeling process the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the gi and rdvi was 0 15 and that between gndvi and rdvi was 0 21 indicating weak correlations in summary among the eight vegetation indices rdvi was the best parameter for estimating rsmc however the evaluation parameters obtained from the models of different vegetation index combinations indicated that it is difficult to obtain better estimation results for a single parameter therefore it is necessary to screen a combination of vegetation indices that correspond to improved evaluation parameters while including as few vegetation indices as possible 3 3 effect of different vegetation index combinations on model accuracy to investigate the effect of specific vegetation index combinations on model prediction accuracy we selected rdvi which had the highest correlation with rsmc and gi and gndvi the two parameters with the lowest correlation with rdvi these vegetation indices can be combined to obtain six combinations where the single index combinations means that in the multi vegetation index model only one index of gi gndvi and rdvi but not the other two indices are included and the double and triple indices combinations are the same the training data for these models were sampled at widths of 125 272 and 500 px the distribution of the coefficient of determination of the model containing only a single index was similar to the pearson vegetation index rsmc correlation coefficient rdvi gndvi gi fig 9 taking a model with input parameters of 3 as an example the median coefficients of determination for models with only a single index were 0 362 0 073 and 0 159 respectively the coefficients of determination for models with the double or triple index were significantly higher than those with only the single index some models with the double index performed better than those with the triple index the median coefficients of the models with input parameters of 3 and containing the double and triple indices were 0 409 0 429 0 572 and 0 576 respectively whereas that of the other combined model was only 0 088 the distribution of model determination coefficients for the input parameters of three to seven vegetation indices was similar indicating that all the six vegetation index combinations had the same effect on different models and could be used as a condition for screening vegetation index combinations the model determination coefficients for the third parameter using different vegetation indices are shown in table 8 the maximum coefficient of determination achieved on the training set was 0 7398 the coefficients of determination for the third parameter selection osavi and msavi were 0 7398 and 0 7392 respectively this indicated that selecting osavi or msavi as the third parameter in the models with three vegetation indices as inputs resulted in better predictions the rsmc inversion model using gi gndvi and msavi was constructed with a sampling width of 272 px the trends in the distribution of the predicted and true values were comparable indicating good model fit with each sample point fig 10 a b the coefficient of determination of the true and predicted values of all samples was 0 7447 and the rmse was 2 422 which differed by 0 0363 from that of the model with the input parameter of 8 the difference in accuracy was therefore minimal while the number of input parameters was reduced 3 4 canopy vegetation index and chlorophyll distribution the ndvi values of the kiwifruit canopy were not uniformly distributed fig 11 a b the vegetation index at the top and center of the canopy was generally greater than that at the edges the ndvi values of entangled vines and overlapping canopy were higher than those of non overlapping sections though it was impossible to distinguish between plants fig 11 c we observed large differences in color and texture between mature and new leaves which was reflected in the spad values the mean spad values ranged from 35 to 58 90 between plants and the maximum difference in the mean spad values between different leaves of a single plant was 14 13 table 9 4 discussion 4 1 causes of variation in the spectral characteristics of kiwifruit canopies kiwifruit has a much higher water requirement than other fruits suitable areas for kiwifruit cultivation have a rainfall of 800 1200 mm however the rainfall in the guanzhong region of shaanxi does not meet this requirement under natural conditions kiwifruit plants are gradually exposed to water stress a phenomenon particularly evident during fruit expansion salinero et al 2009 plant water stress can be assessed by plant leaf water potential or stomatal conductance plant leaf water potential at midday also reflects the maximum water deficit yan et al 2013 when soil moisture decreases stomata respond mainly to chemical signals e g aba generated by root dehydration and close to limit water loss which leads to a decrease in chlorophyll content while maintaining stable leaf water status although the mechanism by which changes in stomatal conductance trigger chlorophyll content is unclear water stress is known to induce photochemical changes immediately after stomatal closure carter 1991 chaves et al 2002 external stress such as drought can damage chlorophyll pigments and decrease photosynthetic efficiency resulting in changes to the spectral characteristics of the leaf de jong et al 2012 which affects the pattern of reflection absorption and transmission of incident light by the crop canopy and thus the vegetation index sun et al 2020 4 2 sample size affects model accuracy changes in the sampling window directly affect data collection from the canopy to leaf level and can impact the spectral data and vegetation index estimate siegmann et al 2021 to investigate why window size variation affects model accuracy we assessed changes in leaf spad and ndvi over the same period similar to the findings of zisong et al 2013 and zhuang et al 2021 plants under the same conditions had clear differences in spad values and the values of leaves at different locations on the same plant also differed significantly which is likely due to the complex structure of the canopy this variation in spad values between leaves correspond with the heterogeneity observed for the canopy ndvi distribution based on the ndvi and leaf spad results we hypothesized that sample size influences model accuracy as follows 1 the difference in reflectance and canopy distribution between new and mature leaves led to an uneven distribution of vegetation indices additionally with plant stress changes in the spectral characteristics are expected to vary between these leaves which could affect the vegetation indices collected from different sampling windows 2 with some kiwifruit canopies not fully covering the soil surface their mean vegetation indices would be lower compared to those of full canopy plants however less surface soil is exposed closer to the center of the canopy thus attenuating the effect of soil elements on the vegetation indices of the canopy 3 the spectral characteristics of the canopy are influenced by the canopy structure verrelst et al 2016 yang and van der tol 2018 overlapping of kiwifruit vines and canopy via trellises caused an abrupt change in canopy structure and ndvi which could affect model outcomes 4 when the sample size is too small the vegetation index only represents a few leaves at the top center of the canopy thus the state of the leaves themselves e g pests and diseases etc would affect the overall vegetation index jiang et al 2022 which is why the model performance decreases after the sampling window is reduced past a certain level using the final inversion model for rsmc estimation we found that the vegetation index sample area during the fruit expansion stage was more suitable at approximately 2 412 m² which corresponded to a coefficient of determination and root mean square error of 0 7447 and 2 422 respectively for all samples however this study only considered the effects of different combinations of sampling window sizes and vegetation indices on rsmc inversions at 40 cm soil depths in xuxiang kiwifruit during the fruit expansion stage further studies on other varieties of plants and phenological stages of kiwifruit would aid in establishing robust models for rsmc estimation 5 conclusions in this study we established an inversion model to estimate soil moisture content up to 40 cm for individual fruiting xuxiang kiwifruit plants using an unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral images which was parameterized based on the results of different sampling window sizes and vegetation indices we found that the accuracy and root mean square error of the soil water content inversion model were strongly correlated with the sampling window of remote sensing images with coefficients of 0 7082 and 0 7273 respectively this is because the sampling window change process is actually the sampling process of the vegetation index from canopy to leaf level and this structural gradient change can affect the spectral data due to soil background leaf distribution and chlorophyll content thus affecting the model accuracy a maximum accuracy of 0 7810 was achieved when the multilayer perceptron inversion model was trained with a sampling width of 1 904 m and area of 2 412 m2 estimation using different combinations of vegetation indices showed that the inverse model accuracy increased with the number of inputs but the simplified model with greenness index green normalized difference vegetation index modified soil adjusted vegetation index or optimized soil adjusted vegetation index could still maintain a high estimation accuracy with a coefficient of determination and root mean square error of 0 7447 and 2 422 respectively our study provided a modeling approach for the estimation of soil

recharge of 85 89 and 84 of the applied irrigation water during the winter period a significant contribution to groundwater aquifers mid summer deficit irrigation treatments followed by winter recharge resulted in net groundwater recharge of 1337 1498 and 1272 mm for 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively amounting to 78 79 and 76 of the applied irrigation water during winter flooding periods hydrus simulation model predicted groundwater recharge potential in these experiments successfully with a coefficient of determination r 2 values of 0 91 and 0 89 for the groundwater recharge during

niswonger et al 2017 using high quality surface water ag mar could also decrease groundwater salinity over time in addition to decreasing pumping costs due to the rise in the water table bachand et al 2014 the benefits and limitations of implementing ag mar projects have been summarized by levintal et al 2022 alfalfa is grown on about 240 000 ha of 461 000 ha of total hay crops including grasses in the san joaquin valley over the past 5 years national agricultural statistics service nass 2022 given that a large percentage 80 of california alfalfa is flood irrigated utilizing gravity fed systems alfalfa is an important candidate for ag mar flooding putnam et al 2021 on farm groundwater recharge on alfalfa fields utilizing the existing surface irrigation infrastructures and excess surface water during high winter flows could be a promising water saving practice for the longevity and sustainability of groundwater resources unlike the potential risks of leaching of residual pesticides or fertilizer in annual crops or fallow fields alfalfa may be an ideal crop for ag mar projects since it does not require any nitrogen fertilizer after establishment obtaining all n needs from biological n2 fixation or root uptake putnam et al 2015 its deep rooted system typically prevents movement of nitrates beyond the root zone and into the groundwater putnam and lin 2016 it should be noted that alfalfa is not considered to be highly flooding tolerant and sustained flooding on established stands especially under hot conditions can kill plants and damage stands primarily due to lack of soil oxygen but also soil pathogens damage is primarily a function of length of the flooding season whether the crop is dormant temperature soil physical properties alfalfa varieties and other factors tolerance to several weeks of flooding by pastures has been observed redfearn and beckman 2019 moreover recent studies on ag mar on alfalfa have shown no significant negative impact on root health in soils with high percolation rates provided soil oxygen deficits are avoided dahlke et al 2018 there are many soil and agronomic parameters to be considered for successful implementation of ag mar recharge projects so ideally flooding for ag mar is preferably done on fallow fields or during crop dormancy periods when agricultural fields have the potential to serve as percolation basins for

and highest irrigation application efficiency while meeting crop evapotranspiration needs with minimal deep percolation and surface runoff however during winter flooding existing surface irrigation systems could be utilized to achieve pre irrigation for crop production as well as higher groundwater recharge efficiency while eliminating surface runoff and providing minimal crop damage due to poor soil aeration accurate predictions of groundwater recharge could help stakeholders and policymakers in making sustainable water resources management decisions thus the objective of this study was to experimentally and numerically quantify the amount of applied water going to groundwater recharge on an alfalfa field utilizing an intermittent irrigation regime one or two irrigation events per week for ag mar in the winter this strategy was assessed under the combination of two summer irrigation treatments full irrigation and mid summer deficit irrigation using the soil water balance and hydrus

beginning of the experiment the experiment was conducted on a 1 51 hectare field that was divided into 12 checks plots winter flood treatments were implemented on 50 of the total area checks 1 4 5 8 9 and 12 fig 1 while the other half of the field was not exposed to winter flooding checks 2 3 6 7 10 and 11 two irrigation treatments were applied during the growing season full season long irrigation march through november and mid summer deficit irrigation treatment irrigated only march through august the fully irrigated plots received two flood irrigation events per cut during the whole growing season march november and the mid summer deficit irrigation plots were fully irrigated until early august and then irrigation was terminated after the august cutting the irrigation treatments were replicated in three blocks and were designed to study the carry over effect of the mid summer deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation in summer on the net amount of groundwater recharge 2 2

october 2022 were installed in each plot check at four depths 30 60 90 and 120 cm to monitor soil matric potential the soil matric potential smp in kpa was chosen and measured using the watermark sensors since it represents the relative availability of the amount of water held in the soil profile for plant uptake rather than using the volumetric soil water content swc which indicates the quantity of the water in the soil but does not directly indicate the availability of this water to plants in the winters of 2020 2021 and 2022 water was applied for groundwater recharge in the winter flooding treatments fig 3 table 1 the winter flooding of 2020 occurred from 20th february until 2nd april resulting in 43 days of 10 intermittent flooding events with approximately one flooding event per week in 2021 the winter flooding events occurred over 53 days from 9th february to 2nd april and consisted of 16 flooding events approximately two flooding events week the third winter flooding in 2022 was conducted from 20th january to 7th april with 12 flooding events applied over 78 days approximately one flooding event week water for groundwater recharge was applied in addition to winter precipitation soil samples were collected before and after flooding events to develop the soil moisture retention curve fig 4 in general there is no specific trendline of the relation between the soil matric potential and the volumetric water content throughout the whole range of the volumetric water contents in the last segment of the trendline at the lower values of volumetric soil water content near or below the wilting point the relation is linear which is similar to the trends shown in the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 the r 2 of the generated polynomial equation equals 0 95 and the equation was then used to calculate the volumetric water contents from the measured soil water potentials fig 5a f later in the simulation van genuchten mualem model was selected as a single porosity model for defining soil hydraulic model without hysteresis however in practice selecting the preferential flow model and fitting a perfect link between laboratory or theoretical model and field conditions is relatively difficult šimůnek et al 2003 2 3 numerical simulation model 2 3 1 governing equations hydrus is a finite element model for simulating the movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated media šimůnek et al 2005 water flow is simulated using richards equation šimůnek et al 1996 which allows incorporating a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots feddes et al 1978 hydrus can handle flow regions delineated by irregular boundaries the flow region itself may be composed of nonuniform soils having an arbitrary degree of local anisotropy wang et al 1997 flow and transport can occur in a horizontal or vertical plane or a three dimensional region the water flows part of the model can deal with constant or time varying prescribed head and flux boundaries as well as boundaries controlled by atmospheric conditions soil surface boundary conditions may change during the simulation from prescribed flux to head type conditions and vice versa in this study we used hydrus 2d to numerically solve richards equation for the transient water flow through a homogeneous isotopic soil šimůnek et al 2008 1 θ t x k h h x z k

and initial conditions hydrus 2d simulation requires setting boundary conditions along all the outer edges of the flow domain in our study the simulated domain has dimensions of 100 cm width and 120 cm depth fig 6a a 5 cm mesh size was selected and the ratio of the sizes of two neighboring elements was restricted not to exceed 1 5 the vertical boundaries were assigned as no flux boundary where one of them is due to symmetry and the other due to the large extent of the computational domain the top surface boundary was assigned as atmospheric pressure which allows for evaporation and transpiration to take place tule technologies provided the daily eta that was used as an input in the hydrus model and considered as potential root water uptake rwu for model simulation then obtained the actual rwu a variable flux var fl1 cm day 1 was assigned along the top width 100 cm of the domain on days when water was applied and the flux was set to zero on the day after to swiftly change between the start and the end of the flooding event so that numerical coverage could be achieved without errors transpiration was assigned along the 100 cm top width groundwater was relatively deep about 26 m away from the bottom boundary of the model domain thus the bottom boundary was assigned as free drainage along the whole bottom width 100 cm thus the calculated flux in cm2 day 1 would be divided by the 100 cm and multiplied by 10 to obtain how much water in mm per day seeped down for groundwater recharge root distribution parameters are shown in fig 6b the default iteration criteria and time discretization of hydrus 2d were used except for the smaller initial time step 10 4 days to overcome any potential convergence issues during infiltration from the continuous monitoring of soil matric potential using watermark sensors volumetric water contents were calculated using the soil moisture retention equation discussed earlier the initial soil moisture at the beginning of simulation period of each year was clearly defined and in this case a warmup period was not assigned in the model simulation initial soil moisture contents θ i were calculated by converting soil matric potential and kpa reading from watermark sensors to volumetric water contents cm3 cm 3 along the soil profile during a precedent period a week to ten days before starting the winter flooding events for the two cases of the full fig 5a c and summer deficit irrigation treatments fig 5d f for each year 2020 2021 and 2022 for the case of winter flooding after the full irrigation treatment the soil moisture content was almost uniform along the soil depth where it ranged from 0 270 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 280 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom from 0 300 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 310 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom and from 0 258 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 289 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom for 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively fig 7a c there were considerable spatial differences in the initial soil moisture values along the soil depth for the winter flooding treatments following the mid summer deficit irrigation treatment values range from 0 180 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 060 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom from 0 295 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 059 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom and from 0 298 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 059 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom for the year 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively fig 7d f 2 3 3 soil and root water uptake parameters soil hydraulic parameters are required to be assigned in hydrus for the selected material either using the van genuchten mualem relationships van genuchten 1980 for the predefined soil types or using the neural network prediction functions table 2 shows the soil hydraulic parameters and root distribution parameters in addition to feddes parameters used for the model simulation where α n and l in hydrus are considered to be merely empirical coefficients affecting the shape of the hydraulic functions root distribution directly affects the water uptake and therefore the soil moisture distribution hao et al 2005 although crop water requirements were relatively small during the winter evapotranspiration et a is relatively small in winter and during the groundwater recharge period the variation of root distribution parameters did not considerably affect the root water uptake especially in winter flooding simulation thus the growth of roots was not considered during the winter flooding period assuming that half growth is achieved before flooding simulations were executed for the winter flooding of 2020 2021 and 2022 twice for each year for the case of full and mid summer deficit irrigation treatments six in total the time variable boundary conditions were the same for the full and deficit irrigation scenarios for each year while the initial moisture contents were different previously shown in fig 7a f forty three fifty three and seventy eight days were assigned as a final time for the winter flooding season of year 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively a daily time interval was assigned to differentiate the values of drainage after each flooding event irrigation applications for each flooding season separately the following water balance components soil water content root water uptake and boundary fluxes the variable flux at the top boundary representing the applied winter water and the bottom flux for the free drainage to groundwater were quantified within the model to estimate annual and seasonal effects of the winter ag mar and summer irrigation treatments on the overall water balance and the amount of groundwater recharge 2 3 4 water balance calculation a water balance model in hydrus 3x was used to calculate the fraction of applied winter water moving to deep percolation or groundwater recharge which is quantified as the flux through the bottom boundary of the domain free drainage deep percolation was estimated at a daily time step previous research used hydrus for mass balance estimates and proved its accuracy of calculations e g han et al 2015 tonkul et al 2019 er raki et al 2021 in this study groundwater recharge gwr was also calculated using the following soil water balance equation 5 gwr t i t p t et a δs t r t where i t is the amount of winter applied water mm at time t p t is precipitation rainfall mm et a is actual evapotranspiration mm δs the change in soil storage mm dependent on the available water capacity awc of the soil and r t is surface runoff mm which was considered to be negligible since all applied water infiltrated downward no surface runoff for each time step i was calculated from the difference in flowmeter readings at the beginning and end of the flooding event divided by the application area check s area the mass balance for groundwater recharge was calculated on a daily time step based on the change in soil water content storage δs and the amount of free drainage that occurred at the bottom of the domain 120 cm depth finally the total average contributions of applied water for groundwater recharge were calculated and compared between the three winter flooding seasons 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of summer treatments before winter flooding treatments before presenting the results from hydrus simulations and water balance calculations of the two different winter flooding treatments the previous summer treatments were discussed to interpret the difference in soil moisture and storage before winter flooding treatments either starting the flooding or no flooding table 3 summarizes the irrigation data and duration of the full and mid summer deficit summer treatments and how much water was saved as a result of the mid summer deficit irrigation treatments results showed that 44 41 and 37 of irrigation water was saved when the mid summer deficit irrigation was implemented in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively alfalfa experienced water stress during the 2019 growing season before the implementation of the mid summer deficit treatment in august 2019 until the day of the groundwater recharge on 19th february 2020 while the applied water of the full treatment during summer was enough to meet the crop water requirements of 1397 mm the applied irrigation water during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons up to the implementation of mid summer deficit irrigation treatment was adequate to meet the crop s water requirements while the full irrigation treatments received more water than the actual evapotranspiration 1019 and 1064 mm of water was applied while et a was 1026 and 1048 mm during the 2020 and 2021 seasons respectively the applied water during the full irrigation treatments in summer from 12th may to 2nd nov 2020 and from 23rd april to 19th oct 2021 was over the et a by 698 and 641 mm respectively cumulative et a from 3rd april 2020 to the date of the last irrigation event of full treatment 2nd nov 2020 was 940 mm while from 3rd april 2020 19 th oct 2021 was 975 mm this means that the over irrigation during these two summer seasons for the full treatment provided water in advance which was not fully stored in the root zone and was available for the plant for the upcoming uptake some water was released down below the root zone when soil moisture was over the field capacity thus the soil moisture content the initial before the upcoming winter treatments either flooded or without flooding was much higher almost equal to the field capacity than those following the deficit treatment in summer evapotranspiration et a was calculated for the period between the date of the day just after the last day of applying the previous winter flooding to the day before the first day of applying the next winter flooding in the following year for et a during summer of 2019 before winter treatments of 2020 the starting date of the period where the evapotranspiration was calculated was on 1st january when there was no previous winter treatment 3 2 root water uptake and cumulative fluxes after the hydrus model was set up for the two summer irrigation treatments full and mid summer deficit and the winter flooding for 2020 2022 results of the spatial distribution of moisture content were first evaluated and compared with the moisture records from the soil matric potential measurements using the watermark sensors in each plot and treatment winter flooding plots that were fully irrigated in the summer before the winter recharge experiment checks 1 8 and 9 had high initial soil moisture contents fig 7a c volumetric water content ranges from 0 26 to 0 31 cm3 cm 3 in contrast the previous mid summer deficit irrigation treatment in checks 4 5 and 12 had a marked effect on the initial soil moisture conditions before imposing the winter flooding treatments fig 5d f thus initial moisture content of winter flooding plots after the mid summer deficit was almost close to the residual moisture of the sandy loam 0 041 cm3 cm 3 fig 7d f irrespective of the recharge or irrigation treatment the actual root water uptake was nearly similar to the potential root water uptake indicating the crop had no stress the winter flooding plots received the same amount of applied water in winter regardless of whether they were deficit or fully irrigated treatments table 1 the actual root water uptakes in the winter flooding deficit irrigation treatments were similar to the flooding treatments that were fully irrigated partially reflecting crops semi dormancy and overall lower water use however they fluctuated from one year to another root water uptakes are shown in fig 8a c for the winter flooding after mid summer deficit irrigation and full irrigation treatments for all three years where the x axis represents the dates of the winter seasons and the y axis represents the root water uptake mm generally an upward increase in flux was observed over time during the winter flooding towards april where evapotranspiration increases fig 9a c shows the cumulative root water uptake during the winter flooding season of 2020 2021 and 2022 in all three seasons almost all the applied water drained out of the bottom of the domain the cumulative root water uptake recorded 66 85 and 89 mm during the winter flooding of years 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively for both the full and deficit irrigated treatments reflecting the expected minimal root water uptake due to minimal plant growth activity and hence large flux of water towards the groundwater aquifer the cumulative root water uptake was only 3 9 4 5 and 5 3 of the cumulative applied water during the winter flooding periods in 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively cumulative applied water during the winter flooding periods of 2020 2021 and 2022 were 1715 1896 and 1682 mm respectively in 2020 cumulative deep percolation of applied winter water was 1537 and 1366 mm for the full and mid summer deficit irrigation treatments respectively in 2021 deep percolation of winter recharge was 1707 and 1577 mm for the full and mid summer deficit treatments respectively and 1467 and 1391 mm in 2022 for the full and mid summer deficit treatments respectively 3 3 winter flooding following full summer irrigation treatments free drainages for recharging groundwater were compared for the winter flooding seasons of 2020 2021 and 2022 for the full irrigation treatment in summer 2020 and 2022 have the same irrigation frequency one irrigation event per week and 2021 has two irrigation events per week the comparison between the flooding frequency and the contribution to groundwater recharge was assessed over the three years then the pattern of the free drainage was compared with the applied water events for each year fig 10 a c when winter flooding events were more frequent more groundwater recharge was obtained while the total applied winter water was almost the same over the three years thus the highest contribution to groundwater recharge was obtained in 2021 which was equal to 90 1 of the applied winter water when one winter event per week was practiced for 2020 and 2022 the groundwater recharge was slightly lower where it counted for 89 6 and 87 2 of the applied winter water respectively table 4 summarizes the drainage and the applied water contribution to groundwater recharge for each flooding season further drainage pattern is associated with the winter events where drainage occurred after the application of each event which is clearly shown as a sudden increase in the graph fig 10 a c the number of drainage fluxes pulses shown in fig 10 a c was equal to the number of winter irrigation events ten sixteen and twelve drainage fluxes were obtained during the flooding of 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively which are identical to the number of winter events that means from the first applied irrigation event drainage was observed across the bottom boundary this is because the initial moisture content right before applying the first flooding event was close to the field capacity of the soil and this additional water brings the soil moisture to levels that exceeded its saturated capacity and then drainage started to occur 3 4 winter flooding following mid summer deficit irrigation treatment drainage fluxes of winter flooding after the mid summer deficit irrigation treatments in 2020 2021 and 2022 are shown in fig 11 a c similar to winter flooding after the full irrigation treatment in summer the highest contribution to groundwater recharge occurred when winter water was more frequent two events per week than one event per week the contribution of the applied winter water to groundwater recharge was 79 6 83 2 and 82 7 for years 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively table 5 regarding the drainage patterns for each year of flooding it is clear that groundwater recharge did not occur from the beginning of the winter water application fig 11 a c the first winter flooding event on the plots 4 5 and 12 that were previously deficit irrigated during the summer had zero groundwater recharge that means soil needs one full flooding event to bring the soil water content back to the field capacity or close to saturation the drainage started to recharge the groundwater after the second winter event where it contributed to 86 4 96 7 from the second event of winter season of 2020 and 2022 while it counted for only 59 9 of the second water application for the frequently flooded events season of 2021 interestingly for the third application event of the winter flooding season of 2021 the year with the more frequent applications the contribution to groundwater recharge increased to 96 4 around the values of the contribution from other consequent application events this indicates that growers who implement such practices need to monitor the initial soil moisture content before starting the first flooding event to accurately estimate how much water is needed to bring the soil to saturation 3 5 water balance the water balance was calculated from daily soil moisture data and compared with hydrus simulation results for each winter flooding period table 6 summarizes these values and the contribution of applied water to the groundwater recharge after each flooding season the total amount of groundwater recharge is mostly determined by the applied water through flooding events it accounted for 85 89 and 84 during the flooding seasons of 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively after plots received the full irrigation treatment in summer while for the winter flooding applied after deficit irrigation in summer groundwater recharge accounted for only 78 79 and 76 of the total applied water during winter flooding season of 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively since the experimental site had no significant precipitation during the flooding events and alfalfa was semi dormant during winter flooding with minimal growth activity resulting in evapotranspiration amounting to 135 150 and 186 mm during the winter flooding periods these periods were from 20th february to 2nd april 2020 from 9th february to 2nd april 2021 and from 20th january to 7th april 2022 the total change in soil moisture storage during the three winter flooding seasons was considerably high when a previous deficit irrigation treatment was applied in summer compared to the full irrigation treatment this indicates that initial soil moisture content was relatively low near residual moisture content θ r and more water was needed to fill soil storage in the deficit irrigated plots when applying winter water for ag mar generally rainfall did not affect the total soil moisture in the entire soil profile before start of the winter seasons the highest rainfall event prior to winter flooding which started on 20th february occurred on 16th january 2020 and accounted for 11 mm a 31 mm of rainfall occurred on 28th january 2021 eleven days before the start of 2021 winter flooding season on 9th february small intermittent rainfall events took place between 1st january and 19th january 2022 2 mm in total before starting winter flooding season of 2022 on 20th january the correlations between the observed values of the groundwater recharge mm and the calculated values from hydrus simulation after each flooding event of the three flooding periods 10 16 and 12 events in 2020 2021 and 2022 are shown in fig 12 a and b a very good agreement between hydrus results and the calculated values of groundwater recharge was obtained for the full and mid summer deficit irrigation scenarios with r 2 values of 0 91 and 0 89 respectively 4 conclusion the impact of different winter flooding and summer full and deficit irrigation treatments were investigated to quantify the potential of using alfalfa fields for groundwater recharge also known as ag mar using field experimental data and hydrus 2d the recharge was directly dependent on initial soil moisture content at the beginning of each winter flooding season as well as the water applied during the flooding season hydrus simulated recharge root water uptake evapotranspiration and soil moisture dynamics well during winter flooding periods for the winter flooding treatments that followed a full irrigation season groundwater recharge amounts of 1537 1707 and 1467 mm which is equivalent to 90 90 and 87 of the applied water were achieved in 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively recharge amounts during winter flooding following the mid summer deficit irrigation treatment were 1366 1577 and 1391 mm or 80 83 and 83 of the applied water for years 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively hydrus simulations agreed well with r 2 values of 0 91 and 0 89 for winter flooding following full irrigation treatments and winter flooding following deficit irrigation treatments respectively with calculated soil water balance estimates from field measurements results from this work demonstrate the importance of considering the initial soil moisture content prior to winter flooding for groundwater recharge as well as the benefits of starting the growing season with a full soil profile utilizing alfalfa fields and existing surface irrigation infrastructure could provide enough net recharge to meet the seasonal crop water requirements of alfalfa or other major crops in the san joaquin valley while such groundwater recharge scenarios are possible during wet years partial implementation of such practices could be utilized during most years when flooding events occur early in the year when most crops including alfalfa are dormant the findings from this work could help

agricultural fields can be used to recharge depleted aquifers using excess precipitation during winter however there is little information on the amount of ag mar that can be applied to crops such as alfalfa hydrus 2d was used to estimate the net recharge in an alfalfa field grown on a sandy loam soil in a mediterranean climate at parlier california usa in 2020 2022 the alfalfa field had four irrigation treatments full irrigation during summer growing season march through november mid summer deficit irrigation treatment march to august and complete irrigation cutoff after august cutting winter flooding treatment and no winter flooding recharge evapotranspiration et a soil moisture dynamics and root water uptake were simulated during the recharge period in winter previously fully irrigated treatments in summer followed by winter recharge led to cumulative groundwater recharge of 1459 1687 and 1415 mm for 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively these applications resulted in a net recharge of 85 89 and 84 of the applied irrigation water during the winter period a significant contribution to groundwater aquifers mid summer deficit irrigation treatments followed by winter recharge resulted in net groundwater recharge of 1337 1498 and 1272 mm for 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively amounting to 78 79 and 76 of the applied irrigation water during winter flooding periods hydrus simulation model predicted groundwater recharge potential in these experiments successfully with a coefficient of determination r 2 values of 0 91 and 0 89 for the groundwater recharge during

groundwater kocis and dahlke 2017 dahlke et al 2018 ag mar has been proposed for ca and could be an effective and potentially sustainable practice to bank excess water for long term health of aquifers niswonger et al 2017 using high quality surface water ag mar could also decrease groundwater salinity over time in addition to decreasing pumping costs due to the rise in the water table bachand et al 2014 the benefits and limitations of implementing ag mar projects have been summarized by levintal et al 2022 alfalfa is grown on about 240 000 ha of 461 000 ha of total hay crops including grasses in the san joaquin valley over the past 5 years national agricultural statistics service nass 2022 given that a large percentage 80 of california alfalfa is flood irrigated utilizing gravity fed systems alfalfa is an important candidate for ag mar flooding putnam et al 2021 on farm groundwater recharge on alfalfa fields utilizing the existing surface irrigation infrastructures and excess surface water during high winter flows could be a promising water saving practice for the longevity and sustainability of groundwater resources unlike the potential risks of leaching of residual pesticides or fertilizer in annual crops or fallow fields alfalfa may be an ideal crop for ag mar projects since it does not require any nitrogen fertilizer after establishment obtaining all n needs from biological n2 fixation or root uptake putnam et al 2015 its deep rooted system typically prevents movement of nitrates beyond the root zone and into the groundwater putnam and lin 2016 it should be noted that alfalfa is not considered to be highly flooding tolerant and sustained flooding on established stands especially under hot conditions can kill plants and damage stands primarily due to lack of soil oxygen but also soil pathogens damage is primarily a function of length of the flooding season whether the crop is dormant temperature soil physical properties alfalfa varieties and other factors tolerance to several weeks of flooding by pastures has been observed redfearn and beckman 2019 moreover recent studies on ag mar on alfalfa have shown no significant negative impact on root health in soils with high percolation rates provided soil oxygen deficits are avoided dahlke et al 2018 there are many soil and agronomic parameters to be considered for successful implementation of ag mar recharge projects so ideally flooding for ag mar is preferably done on fallow fields or during crop dormancy periods when agricultural fields have the potential to serve as percolation basins for

and highest irrigation application efficiency while meeting crop evapotranspiration needs with minimal deep percolation and surface runoff however during winter flooding existing surface irrigation systems could be utilized to achieve pre irrigation for crop production as well as higher groundwater recharge efficiency while eliminating surface runoff and providing minimal crop damage due to poor soil aeration accurate predictions of groundwater recharge could help stakeholders and policymakers in making sustainable water resources management decisions thus the objective of this study was to experimentally and numerically quantify the amount of applied water going to groundwater recharge on an alfalfa field utilizing an intermittent irrigation regime one or two irrigation events per week for ag mar in the winter this strategy was assessed under the combination of two summer irrigation treatments full irrigation and mid summer deficit irrigation using the soil water balance and hydrus 2d model the results of this research could help in assessing the potential of utilizing ag mar in the san joaquin valley of california for maintaining a sustainable management plan for groundwater

beginning of the experiment the experiment was conducted on a 1 51 hectare field that was divided into 12 checks plots winter flood treatments were implemented on 50 of the total area checks 1 4 5 8 9 and 12 fig 1 while the other half of the field was not exposed to winter flooding checks 2 3 6 7 10 and 11 two irrigation treatments were applied during the growing season full season long irrigation march through november and mid summer deficit irrigation treatment irrigated only march through august the fully irrigated plots received two flood irrigation events per cut during the whole growing season march november and the mid summer deficit irrigation plots were fully irrigated until early august and then irrigation was terminated after the august cutting the irrigation treatments were replicated in three blocks and were designed to study the carry over effect of the mid summer deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation in summer on the net amount of groundwater recharge 2 2

october 2022 were installed in each plot check at four depths 30 60 90 and 120 cm to monitor soil matric potential the soil matric potential smp in kpa was chosen and measured using the watermark sensors since it represents the relative availability of the amount of water held in the soil profile for plant uptake rather than using the volumetric soil water content swc which indicates the quantity of the water in the soil but does not directly indicate the availability of this water to plants in the winters of 2020 2021 and 2022 water was applied for groundwater recharge in the winter flooding treatments fig 3 table 1 the winter flooding of 2020 occurred from 20th february until 2nd april resulting in 43 days of 10 intermittent flooding events with approximately one flooding event per week in 2021 the winter flooding events occurred over 53 days from 9th february to 2nd april and consisted of 16 flooding events approximately two flooding events week the third winter flooding in 2022 was conducted from 20th january to 7th april with 12 flooding events applied over 78 days approximately one flooding event week water for groundwater recharge was applied in addition to winter precipitation soil samples were collected before and after flooding events to develop the soil moisture retention curve fig 4 in general there is no specific trendline of the relation between the soil matric potential and the volumetric water content throughout the whole range of the volumetric water contents in the last segment of the trendline at the lower values of volumetric soil water content near or below the wilting point the relation is linear which is similar to the trends shown in the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 the r 2 of the generated polynomial equation equals 0 95 and the equation was then used to calculate the volumetric water contents from the measured soil water potentials fig 5a f later in the simulation van genuchten mualem model was selected as a single porosity model for defining soil hydraulic model without hysteresis however in practice selecting the preferential flow model and fitting a perfect link between laboratory or theoretical model and field conditions is relatively difficult šimůnek et al 2003 2 3 numerical simulation model 2 3 1 governing equations hydrus is a finite element model for simulating the movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated media šimůnek et al 2005 water flow is simulated using richards equation šimůnek et al 1996 which allows incorporating a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots feddes et al 1978 hydrus can handle flow regions delineated by irregular boundaries the flow region itself may be composed of nonuniform soils having an arbitrary degree of local anisotropy wang et al 1997 flow and transport can occur in a horizontal or vertical plane or a three dimensional region the water flows part of the model can deal with constant or time varying prescribed head and flux boundaries as well as boundaries controlled by atmospheric conditions soil surface boundary conditions may change during the simulation from prescribed flux to head type conditions and vice versa in this study we used hydrus 2d to numerically solve richards equation for the transient water flow through a homogeneous isotopic soil šimůnek et al 2008 1 θ t x k h h x z k

and initial conditions hydrus 2d simulation requires setting boundary conditions along all the outer edges of the flow domain in our study the simulated domain has dimensions of 100 cm width and 120 cm depth fig 6a a 5 cm mesh size was selected and the ratio of the sizes of two neighboring elements was restricted not to exceed 1 5 the vertical boundaries were assigned as no flux boundary where one of them is due to symmetry and the other due to the large extent of the computational domain the top surface boundary was assigned as atmospheric pressure which allows for evaporation and transpiration to take place tule technologies provided the daily eta that was used as an input in the hydrus model and considered as potential root water uptake rwu for model simulation then obtained the actual rwu a variable flux var fl1 cm day 1 was assigned along the top width 100 cm of the domain on days when water was applied and the flux was set to zero on the day after to swiftly change between the start and the end of the flooding event so that numerical coverage could be achieved without errors transpiration was assigned along the 100 cm top width groundwater was relatively deep about 26 m away from the bottom boundary of the model domain thus the bottom boundary was assigned as free drainage along the whole bottom width 100 cm thus the calculated flux in cm2 day 1 would be divided by the 100 cm and multiplied by 10 to obtain how much water in mm per day seeped down for groundwater recharge root distribution parameters are shown in fig 6b the default iteration criteria and time discretization of hydrus 2d were used except for the smaller initial time step 10 4 days to overcome any potential convergence issues during infiltration from the continuous monitoring of soil matric potential using watermark sensors volumetric water contents were calculated using the soil moisture retention equation discussed earlier the initial soil moisture at the beginning of simulation period of each year was clearly defined and in this case a warmup period was not assigned in the model simulation initial soil moisture contents θ i were calculated by converting soil matric potential and kpa reading from watermark sensors to volumetric water contents cm3 cm 3 along the soil profile during a precedent period a week to ten days before starting the winter flooding events for the two cases of the full fig 5a c and summer deficit irrigation treatments fig 5d f for each year 2020 2021 and 2022 for the case of winter flooding after the full irrigation treatment the soil moisture content was almost uniform along the soil depth where it ranged from 0 270 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 280 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom from 0 300 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 310 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom and from 0 258 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 289 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom for 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively fig 7a c there were considerable spatial differences in the initial soil moisture values along the soil depth for the winter flooding treatments following the mid summer deficit irrigation treatment values range from 0 180 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 060 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom from 0 295 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 059 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom and from 0 298 cm3 cm 3 at the top to 0 059 cm3 cm 3 at the bottom for the year 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively fig 7d f 2 3 3 soil and root water uptake parameters soil hydraulic parameters are required to be assigned in hydrus for the selected material either using the van genuchten mualem relationships van genuchten 1980 for the predefined soil types or using the neural network prediction functions table 2 shows the soil hydraulic parameters and root distribution parameters in addition to feddes parameters used for the model simulation where α n and l in hydrus are considered to be merely empirical coefficients affecting the shape of the hydraulic functions root distribution directly affects the water uptake and therefore the soil moisture distribution hao et al 2005 although crop water requirements were relatively small during the winter evapotranspiration et a is relatively small in winter and during the groundwater recharge period the variation of root distribution parameters did not considerably affect the root water uptake especially in winter flooding simulation thus the growth of roots was not considered during the winter flooding period assuming that half growth is achieved before flooding simulations were executed for the winter flooding of 2020 2021 and 2022 twice for each year for the case of full and mid summer deficit irrigation treatments six in total the time variable boundary conditions were the same for the full and deficit irrigation scenarios for each year while the initial moisture contents were different previously shown in fig 7a f forty three fifty three and seventy eight days were assigned as a final time for the winter flooding season of year 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively a daily time interval was assigned to differentiate the values of drainage after each flooding event irrigation applications for each flooding season separately the following water balance components soil water content root water uptake and boundary fluxes the variable flux at the top boundary representing the applied winter water and the bottom flux for the free drainage to groundwater were quantified within the model to estimate annual and seasonal effects of the winter ag mar and summer irrigation treatments on the overall water balance and the amount of groundwater recharge 2 3 4 water balance calculation a water balance model in hydrus 3x was used to calculate the fraction of applied winter water moving to deep percolation or groundwater recharge which is quantified as the flux through the bottom boundary of the domain free drainage deep percolation was estimated at a daily time step previous research used hydrus for mass balance estimates and proved its accuracy of calculations e g han et al 2015 tonkul et al 2019 er raki et al 2021 in this study groundwater recharge gwr was also calculated using the following soil water balance equation 5 gwr t i t p t et a δs t r t where i t is the amount of winter applied water mm at time t p t is precipitation rainfall mm et a is actual evapotranspiration mm δs the change in soil storage mm dependent on the available water capacity awc of the soil and r t is surface runoff mm which was considered to be negligible since all applied water infiltrated downward no surface runoff for each time step i was calculated from the difference in flowmeter readings at the beginning and end of the flooding event divided by the application area check s area the mass balance for groundwater recharge was calculated on a daily time step based on the change in soil water content storage δs and the amount of free drainage that occurred at the bottom of the domain 120 cm depth finally the total average contributions of applied water for groundwater recharge were calculated and compared between the three winter flooding seasons 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of summer treatments before winter flooding treatments before presenting the results from hydrus simulations and water balance calculations of the two different winter flooding treatments the previous summer treatments were discussed to interpret the difference in soil moisture and storage before winter flooding treatments either starting the flooding or no flooding table 3 summarizes the irrigation data and duration of the full and mid summer deficit summer treatments and how much water was saved as a result of the mid summer deficit irrigation treatments results showed that 44 41 and 37 of irrigation water was saved when the mid summer deficit irrigation was implemented in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively alfalfa experienced water stress during the 2019 growing season before the implementation of the mid summer deficit treatment in august 2019 until the day of the groundwater recharge on 19th february 2020 while the applied water of the full treatment during summer was enough to meet the crop water requirements of 1397 mm the applied irrigation water during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons up to the implementation of mid summer deficit irrigation treatment was adequate to meet the crop s water requirements while the full irrigation treatments received more water than the actual evapotranspiration 1019 and 1064 mm of water was applied while et a was 1026 and 1048 mm during the 2020 and 2021 seasons respectively the applied water during the full irrigation treatments in summer from 12th may to 2nd nov 2020 and from 23rd april to 19th oct 2021 was over the et a by 698 and 641 mm respectively cumulative et a from 3rd april 2020 to the date of the last irrigation event of full treatment 2nd nov 2020 was 940 mm while from 3rd april 2020 19 th oct 2021 was 975 mm this means that the over irrigation during these two summer seasons for the full treatment provided water in advance which was not fully stored in the root zone and was available for the plant for the upcoming uptake some water was released down below the root zone when soil moisture was over the field capacity thus the soil moisture content the initial before the upcoming winter treatments either flooded or without flooding was much higher almost equal to the field capacity than those following the deficit treatment in summer evapotranspiration et a was calculated for the period between the date of the day just after the last day of applying the previous winter flooding to the day before the first day of applying the next winter flooding in the following year for et a during summer of 2019 before winter treatments of 2020 the starting date of the period where the evapotranspiration was calculated was on 1st january when there was no previous winter treatment 3 2 root water uptake and cumulative fluxes after the hydrus model was set up for the two summer irrigation treatments full and mid summer deficit and the winter flooding for 2020 2022 results of the spatial distribution of moisture content were first evaluated and compared with the moisture records from the soil matric potential measurements using the watermark sensors in each plot and treatment winter flooding plots that were fully irrigated in the summer before the winter recharge experiment checks 1 8 and 9 had high initial soil moisture contents fig 7a c volumetric water content ranges from 0 26 to 0 31 cm3 cm 3 in contrast the previous mid summer deficit irrigation treatment in checks 4 5 and 12 had a marked effect on the initial soil moisture conditions before imposing the winter flooding treatments fig 5d f thus initial moisture content of winter flooding plots after the mid summer deficit was almost close to the residual moisture of the sandy loam 0 041 cm3 cm 3 fig 7d f irrespective of the recharge or irrigation treatment the actual root water uptake was nearly similar to the potential root water uptake indicating the crop had no stress the winter flooding plots received the same amount of applied water in winter regardless of whether they were deficit or fully irrigated treatments table 1 the actual root water uptakes in the winter flooding deficit irrigation treatments were similar to the flooding treatments that were fully irrigated partially reflecting crops semi dormancy and overall lower water use however they fluctuated from one year to another root water uptakes are shown in fig 8a c for the winter flooding after mid summer deficit irrigation and full irrigation treatments for all three years where the x axis represents the dates of the winter seasons and the y axis represents the root water uptake mm generally an upward increase in flux was observed over time during the winter flooding towards april where evapotranspiration increases fig 9a c shows the cumulative root water uptake during the winter flooding season of 2020 2021 and 2022 in all three seasons almost all the applied water drained out of the bottom of the domain the cumulative root water uptake recorded 66 85 and 89 mm during the winter flooding of years 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively for both the full and deficit irrigated treatments reflecting the expected minimal root water uptake due to minimal plant growth activity and hence large flux of water towards the groundwater aquifer the cumulative root water uptake was only 3 9 4 5 and 5 3 of the cumulative applied water during the winter flooding periods in 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively cumulative applied water during the winter flooding periods of 2020 2021 and 2022 were 1715 1896 and 1682 mm respectively in 2020 cumulative deep percolation of applied winter water was 1537 and 1366 mm for the full and mid summer deficit irrigation treatments respectively in 2021 deep percolation of winter recharge was 1707 and 1577 mm for the full and mid summer deficit treatments respectively and 1467 and 1391 mm in 2022 for the full and mid summer deficit treatments respectively 3 3 winter flooding following full summer irrigation treatments free drainages for recharging groundwater were compared for the winter flooding seasons of 2020 2021 and 2022 for the full irrigation treatment in summer 2020 and 2022 have the same irrigation frequency one irrigation event per week and 2021 has two irrigation events per week the comparison between the flooding frequency and the contribution to groundwater recharge was assessed over the three years then the pattern of the free drainage was compared with the applied water events for each year fig 10 a c when winter flooding events were more frequent more groundwater recharge was obtained while the total applied winter water was almost the same over the three years thus the highest contribution to groundwater recharge was obtained in 2021 which was equal to 90 1 of the applied winter water when one winter event per week was practiced for 2020 and 2022 the groundwater recharge was slightly lower where it counted for 89 6 and 87 2 of the applied winter water respectively table 4 summarizes the drainage and the applied water contribution to groundwater recharge for each flooding season further drainage pattern is associated with the winter events where drainage occurred after the application of each event which is clearly shown as a sudden increase in the graph fig 10 a c the number of drainage fluxes pulses shown in fig 10 a c was equal to the number of winter irrigation events ten sixteen and twelve drainage fluxes were obtained during the flooding of 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively which are identical to the number of winter events that means from the first applied irrigation event drainage was observed across the bottom boundary this is because the initial moisture content right before applying the first flooding event was close to the field capacity of the soil and this additional water brings the soil moisture to levels that exceeded its saturated capacity and then drainage started to occur 3 4 winter flooding following mid summer deficit irrigation treatment drainage fluxes of winter flooding after the mid summer deficit irrigation treatments in 2020 2021 and 2022 are shown in fig 11 a c similar to winter flooding after the full irrigation treatment in summer the highest contribution to groundwater recharge occurred when winter water was more frequent two events per week than one event per week the contribution of the applied winter water to groundwater recharge was 79 6 83 2 and 82 7 for years 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively table 5 regarding the drainage patterns for each year of flooding it is clear that groundwater recharge did not occur from the beginning of the winter water application fig 11 a c the first winter flooding event on the plots 4 5 and 12 that were previously deficit irrigated during the summer had zero groundwater recharge that means soil needs one full flooding event to bring the soil water content back to the field capacity or close to saturation the drainage started to recharge the groundwater after the second winter event where it contributed to 86 4 96 7 from the second event of winter season of 2020 and 2022 while it counted for only 59 9 of the second water application for the frequently flooded events season of 2021 interestingly for the third application event of the winter flooding season of 2021 the year with the more frequent applications the contribution to groundwater recharge increased to 96 4 around the values of the contribution from other consequent application events this indicates that growers who implement such practices need to monitor the initial soil moisture content before starting the first flooding event to accurately estimate how much water is needed to bring the soil to saturation 3 5 water balance the water balance was calculated from daily soil moisture data and compared with hydrus simulation results for each winter flooding period table 6 summarizes these values and the contribution of applied water to the groundwater recharge after each flooding season the total amount of groundwater recharge is mostly determined by the applied water through flooding events it accounted for 85 89 and 84 during the flooding seasons of 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively after plots received the full irrigation treatment in summer while for the winter flooding applied after deficit irrigation in summer groundwater recharge accounted for only 78 79 and 76 of the total applied water during winter flooding season of 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively since the experimental site had no significant precipitation during the flooding events and alfalfa was semi dormant during winter flooding with minimal growth activity resulting in evapotranspiration amounting to 135 150 and 186 mm during the winter flooding periods these periods were from 20th february to 2nd april 2020 from 9th february to 2nd april 2021 and from 20th january to 7th april 2022 the total change in soil moisture storage during the three winter flooding seasons was considerably high when a previous deficit irrigation treatment was applied in summer compared to the full irrigation treatment this indicates that initial soil moisture content was relatively low near residual moisture content θ r and more water was needed to fill soil storage in the deficit irrigated plots when applying winter water for ag mar generally rainfall did not affect the total soil moisture in the entire soil profile before start of the winter seasons the highest rainfall event prior to winter flooding which started on 20th february occurred on 16th january 2020 and accounted for 11 mm a 31 mm of rainfall occurred on 28th january 2021 eleven days before the start of 2021 winter flooding season on 9th february small intermittent rainfall events took place between 1st january and 19th january 2022 2 mm in total before starting winter flooding season of 2022 on 20th january the correlations between the observed values of the groundwater recharge mm and the calculated values from hydrus simulation after each flooding event of the three flooding periods 10 16 and 12 events in 2020 2021 and 2022 are shown in fig 12 a and b a very good agreement between hydrus results and the calculated values of groundwater recharge was obtained for the full and mid summer deficit irrigation scenarios with r 2 values of 0 91 and 0 89 respectively 4 conclusion the impact of different winter flooding and summer full and deficit irrigation treatments were investigated to quantify the potential of using alfalfa fields for groundwater recharge also known as ag mar using field experimental data and hydrus 2d the recharge was directly dependent on initial soil moisture content at the beginning of each winter flooding season as well as the water applied during the flooding season hydrus simulated recharge root water uptake evapotranspiration and soil moisture dynamics well during winter flooding periods for the winter flooding treatments that followed a full irrigation season groundwater recharge amounts of 1537 1707 and 1467 mm which is equivalent to 90 90 and 87 of the applied water were achieved in 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively recharge amounts during winter flooding following the mid summer deficit irrigation treatment were 1366 1577 and 1391 mm or 80 83 and 83 of the applied water for years 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively hydrus simulations agreed well with r 2 values of 0 91 and 0 89 for winter flooding following full irrigation treatments and winter flooding following deficit irrigation treatments respectively with calculated soil water balance estimates from field measurements results from this work demonstrate the importance of considering the initial soil moisture content prior to winter flooding for groundwater recharge as well as the benefits of starting the growing season with a full soil profile utilizing alfalfa fields and existing surface irrigation infrastructure could provide enough net recharge to meet the seasonal crop water requirements of alfalfa or other major crops in the san joaquin valley while such groundwater recharge scenarios are possible during wet years partial implementation of such practices could be utilized during most years when flooding events occur early in the year when most crops including alfalfa are dormant the findings from this work could help

8993,the trend of yield losses to drought in united states u s agriculture has increased over the years in spite of financial investments and technological development to alleviate drought impacts as climate change threatens to worsen future drought conditions it is crucial to evaluate drought impacts on crop production for efficient yet robust decision making at the regional level this study evaluated the robustness of modified standardized precipitation indices spis using effective precipitation ep and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in assessing drought impacts on county level maize and soybean yields in the southeastern u s during 1979 2019 the results showed that the modified spi using the cropwat ep formula can be as effective as spei in assessing drought impacts on crop production assessment of drought impacts on crop yield year to year variability was then assessed by fitting linear regression through the yield drought time series probability of yield loss due to drought in the region was estimated by using a copula based probabilistic model results show that drought events occurring during the critical development growth stage had significantly negative impacts on year to year yield variability in over 50 of the counties in the study region though the impact magnitude varied across the region due to different characteristics historical climatic condition and irrigation infrastructure on average an extremely dry event occurring during the critical development growth stage resulted in a region wide average yield reduction between 42 7 and 31 9 for maize and between 25 4 and 23 4 for soybean moderately wet conditions may increase crop yield but excessively wet conditions may diminish the benefits for both crops the average probability of yield loss of the study region under the extremely dry condition is more than 80 irrigation may help to reduce the impacts of drought on crop production maize producing irrigated counties on average were found to be 50 less sensitive to drought than non irrigated counties though this effect is smaller for soybean as crop production in the region is highly vulnerable to drought adaptation interventions under are required to adapt to warming climate scenarios keywords drought maize soybean yield spi spei effective precipitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction amongst all economic sectors agriculture is particularly vulnerable to drought agricultural drought is the result of precipitation deficiency during the growing season of crops coupled with possible increase in temperature low humidity and strong wind leading to higher evapotranspiration over an extended time vergni 2004 it is further characterized by reduced soil moisture and diminished surface and underground water supplies wilhite and glantz 1985 the average annual crop losses associated with drought in the great plains in the united states u s in 1975 were reported to be us 700 million white and haas 1975 in 1995 the estimated drought induced losses in agriculture by the us federal emergency management agency fema were between us 6 8 billion wilhite 2000 whereas in 2018 this number was us 10 14 billion kuwayama 2019 this reveals the alarming vulnerability of us agriculture to drought despite increasing financial investments and technological advances with the possibility of a warmer climate and changes in precipitation patterns in the future droughts are predicted to become more severe and frequent thus increasing the costs and damages in agriculture ipcc 2014 the impacts of drought on agriculture in particular crop production depend not only on severity but also the timing of the drought event drought occurrence at the beginning of the growing season may have little effect on crop growth but occurrence during the critical development stage can increase the chance of yield loss or even crop failure goldblum 2009 lesk et al 2016 during this stage crop requirements for water nutrients and carbon dioxide co2 increase and drought stresses during this period usually result in crop growth disruption hasanuzzaman et al 2013 ihsan et al 2016 tuteja and singh gill 2013 since drought is a constant feature of almost every climate regime it is crucial for farmers and policy makers especially in dominantly rainfed regions to be able to make informed decisions regarding the severity and timing of drought to effectively develop strategies to adapt to and alleviate the damages of drought methods to assess and monitor drought severity have been categorized into two groups quantitative drought indices based on climate observational records hao and singh 2015 heim 2002 lu et al 2017 yihdego et al 2019 and indices that combine multiple metrics to capture different aspects of drought conditions such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi peters et al 1991 vegetation condition index vci kogan 1995 scaled drought condition index sdci rhee et al 2010 etc the latter however are limited by availability of data and computational capacity especially over a large area therefore single element indices such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are still widely popular in large scale assessment studies thanks to their simplicity standardized calculation method and ease in interpretation and comparison leng and hall 2019 zipper et al 2016 one disadvantage of the use of spi in agricultural drought assessment is that it does not include important components in crop growth such as soil moisture to address this some studies modified spi by using effective precipitation ep in place of the original precipitation as the former is expressed as the portion of precipitation that is available for crop use ebrahimpour et al 2015 tigkas et al 2019 zarei and moghimi 2019 these modified indices have not been frequently applied in the u s and to the best of our knowledge there has not been a comprehensive comparison of the performances of these indices with respect to crop yield this study aims to address this gap by evaluating performances of modified spis and spei for drought impact assessment in the southeastern u s by using these drought indices this study provides a comprehensive spatio temporal assessment of historical drought in the study region and highlights the impacts of drought on crop yield year to year variability most studies quantify yield loss as deviation from long term yield average deterministically in response to droughts leng and hall 2019 lu et al 2017 matiu et al 2017 peña gallardo et al 2019 zipper et al 2016 this study however adopted a probabilistic approach to measure the probability of yield loss with respect to different drought severity levels leng and hall 2019 the study region is the southeastern u s which has been experiencing increased temperatures and decreased water availability melillo et al 2014 however unlike the western region drought impacts on crop production in this region have been less extensively studied though the southeast is home to large population and lucrative agricultural sector usda econimic research service 2022 2 methodology 2 1 study region the study region is located in the southeastern u s spanning from 91 39 n to 75 27 n and from 29 37 w to 40 40 w comprising 1175 counties from 19 states see fig 1 the climate of the study region is sub humid the major food crops in the region include maize and soybean both of which are typically grown between april and september over the historical period 1979 2019 the average growing season cumulative precipitation p was 648 218 mm while average reference evapotranspiration eto was 914 100 mm daily maximum temperature tx during the growing season was 30 7 2 1 c while the minimum temperature tn was 18 6 2 1 c daily vapor pressure deficit vpd averaged 1 06 0 26 kpa temperature increases from north to south in the study region but the southern area is characterized by a high amount of annual precipitation approximately 900 mm year low vpd and eto see fig s1 in the supplementary index si the average maize yield during 1979 2019 was 6 51 mg ha 1 2 03 and the average soybean yield was 2 54 mg ha 1 0 54 maize and soybean yields have increased over the years with maize increasing by 0 13 mg ha year 1 p 0 01 and soybean 0 03 mg ha year 1 p 0 01 between 1979 and 2019 see fig 2 spatial variation of yield across the region can be found in fig s2 in the si maize and soybean in this region are dominantly rainfed see fig s3 in the si which makes the region more vulnerable to potential changes in drought in the future climate change may also lead to higher energy demand thus putting further stress on water management and allocation in the region ralston fonseca et al 2019 2 2 crop yield detrending the increasing non linear trend in the u s maize and soybean yield time series have been driven mainly by technological advances and management practices lu et al 2017 assessment of drought impacts on year to year crop yield variability therefore requires removing the non climate induced trend from the original data or detrending detrending yield consists of two steps first fitting a trend model through the observational time series and second removing the trend through a decomposition model trend fitting methods vary in their complexity and applicability lu et al 2017 compared the effectiveness of various detrending models for crop yields at the county and state level in the u s and found that locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess is more effective at detecting yield trends than the other models especially for county level data with short time lengths and non linear non stationary patterns cleveland 1979 cleveland and devlin 1988 since the length of most county yield time series in this study is between 15 and 41 years lowess was chosen as the detrending method an r package called fancova which contains a collection of r functions to perform nonparametric analysis of covariance for regression curves was used to conduct the lowess fitting the function loess as in this package performs lowess fitting for the datasets with automatic selection of the smoothing parameter using bias corrected akaike information criterion aic for more detail see section s2 1 in the si after the trend was fitted the yield time series was detrended using i additive method where the trend line is subtracted from the original time series and ii multiplicative method where the detrended time series is computed as the ratio of the original data to the values of the trend line lu et al 2017 in this study both methods resulted in a detrended time series that satisfies the stationarity assumption data variance remains constant over time which were tested by applying the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss test to the detrended time series see section s2 2 in the si 2 3 effective precipitation in agriculture effective precipitation ep is defined as the portion of precipitation that is stored in the rootzone to be used effectively by plants martin and gilley 1993 various processes and factors are involved in determining the effectiveness of precipitation including climate soil properties antecedent soil moisture vegetation cover runoff groundwater levels topography etc martin and gilley 1993 to properly measure all these processes however is not practical thus simplified methods have been developed to estimate ep most widely used are the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao equation brouwer and heibloem 1986 the cropwat model equation smith 1992 the usda soil conservation service usda scs equation and its simplified version usda scs simplified martin and gilley 1993 see table 1 all these methods require monthly total precipitation p mm a climate variable that is available in most regions these methods were selected for this study as they are applicable in different climatic conditions in the u s adnan and khan 2009 ali and mubarak 2017 2 4 drought indices 2 4 1 original drought indices spi was introduced by mckee et al 1993 to serve as a versatile tool in drought monitoring and analysis this index standardizes the precipitation deficit by considering the time series of cumulative precipitation for various timescales 1 48 months fitting a statistical distribution to the time series and transforming it into a normal distribution the average spi value for an area over a reference period is zero and non zero values indicate wet positive values and dry negative values periods mckee et al 1993 proposed the use of the gamma distribution for spi calculation with two parameters while other researchers have used the log normal distribution with similar results tigkas et al 2018 spei mckee et al 1993 is similar to spi but it is produced by standardizing the difference between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration p eto since the values of the time series can be negative vicente serrano et al 2010 proposed to use the log logistic distribution to account for negative values in the p eto series at different time scales in this study spi and spei were computed using the r package spei using gamma distribution for spi and log logistic distribution for spei mckee et al 1993 stated that the period over which precipitation deficits accumulate becomes significant to assessing and monitoring drought events in a particular sector in agriculture studies show that crops are more sensitive to shorter term droughts 1 3 months lu et al 2017 zipper et al 2016 in this study drought indices at the 3 month timescale were computed as this timescale is reasonable to account for impact of drought on crop yields county level time series of monthly cumulative precipitation were computed using backwards moving sum over a three month interval e g precipitation data for august is the sum of monthly total precipitation of june july and august drought severity levels are categorized in table 2 2 4 2 modified spi with effective precipitation since the original spi only uses precipitation and does not account for the absence of important variables to drought such as temperature or soil moisture a set of modified spis were computed with effective precipitation calculated with eq 1 5 instead of the original precipitation as these ep equations were developed based on observations of soil water balance the modified spis incorporate the components in agricultural drought for which spi may not account for tigkas et al 2019 the modified spis are referred to as spi fao using the fao equation spi cropwat using the cropwat equation spi usda simplified using the simplified usda equation and spi usda corn spi usda soybean using the crop specific usda eq 3 for maize and soybean respectively 2 4 3 drought index comparison the different drought indices were evaluated based on the strength of their correlation to the maize and soybean detrended yields at the county level during the historical growing season the pearson correlation coefficient r was used and the significance p value of the correlation was tested using a two tailed t test then the percentage of counties with significantly strong correlation r 0 5 and p value 0 05 between crop yield and the drought index was estimated indices that show the strongest correlation with the crop were chosen for further analysis 2 5 assessment of drought impact on crop yield 2 5 1 year to year yield sensitivity to drought to examine the impacts of drought on crop yield variability over the years a linear regression was fitted through the additive detrended yield δy a and the drought index i time series for each county 6 y a c t β c α c i c t ϵ c t where c and t indicate county and year β c is the intercept α is the slope of the linear regression and ϵ c t is the residual the slope measures how much the year to year crop yield variability responds to drought severity and a positive slope suggests that drought severity has a negative impact on crop yield the coefficient of determination r2 extracted from the linear regression eq 6 indicates how much drought is responsible for yield year to year variability to determine whether areas with a high level of irrigation may experience drought impacts the values of α and r2 from the linear regression of each county were compared for counties with low and high level of irrigation cover using the analysis of variance anova method counties with at least 10 of the total area irrigated are defined as having a high level of irrigation coverage 2 5 2 change in year to year yield in response to drought severity the deviation of the yield of a particular county year from the long term yield trend of that county is thought to reflect crop yield response to the drought condition therefore detrended yield data for each county and year were grouped by different categories of drought severity table 2 for each drought severity group all county year multiplicative detrended yield δy m which is the percentage of yield deviating from expected trend of the group was averaged by their weight with the weight being the county crop area w c 7 y m y m c w c a bootstrap method was applied by randomly sampling 1000 times with replacement in each detrended time series in eq 7 to obtain the 95th confidence level of the yield change results 2 5 3 probability of yield loss due to drought probability of yield loss due to drought in the region is an indication of the crop production vulnerability to drought as it measures the risk of changing drought severity in the future a copula based probabilistic model was applied to estimate the probability copulas are functions that couple a multivariate joint distribution function to the marginal distribution of each variable nelson 2000 two advantages of copulas are they allow modeling dependency between variables that do not follow the same distribution including non normal distribution thus avoiding prior assumptions about the relationship between the variables and they can properly treat the tails of distributions which is important for extreme drought assessment leng and hall 2019 for more information see section s3 in the si a copula function was fit through the δy m and drought index time series to estimate the probability of yield falling below the expected yield defined by the yield trend fitting process δy m 0 for a given drought condition in this study the fitting of the copula function was conducted with the r package copula and vc2copula which enables the selection of the best fit distribution function optimal parameters and estimation of conditional density distribution 2 6 data description county level crop yield data were extracted from the national agricultural statistics service nass under the u s agricultural department usda https www nass usda gov for the period of 1979 2019 maize and soybean crop land areas in each county were derived from the crop data layers cdl https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape using r package raster county level climate data mean temperature precipitation and reference evapotranspiration were aggregated from gridmet a dataset of daily high spatial resolution 1 24th degree surface meteorological data covering the contiguous u s from 1979 to 2019 abatzoglou 2013 to ensure that climate data were specific to the crops the percentage of crop area of maize and soybean in each climate grid was estimated by overlaying the cdl and the climate data grid raster county level climate data for drought analysis was then calculated as the weighted average of all the climate grids within the county boundary with the weight as the crop area percentage in each grid in the county county crop area was also derived from the cdl and the weight w c values in eq 7 were estimated by dividing the county crop area to the total crop area in the study region soil available storage water aws in eq 4 were extracted from ssurgo database https sdmdataaccess sc egov usda gov and aggregated to the 1 24th degree grid cell using the r package raster irrigation data were extracted from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis irrigated agriculture dataset for the united states mirad us pervez and brown 2010 3 results 3 1 detrended yields the detrended yield time series from 1979 to 2019 for county level maize and soybean are shown in fig 3 kpss test results showed that the detrended time series by both decomposition methods are stationary not shown approximately 90 of maize yield difference over the period ranges between 2 21 and 1 79 mg ha 1 while 90 of soybean yield fluctuates between 0 58 and 0 48 mg ha 1 these are equivalent to 41 3 31 6 of yield deviation from the average yield in maize and 33 27 in soybean see fig 3 the highest yield loss for maize 86 occurred in 2012 while the highest soybean yield loss 96 occurred in 2005 3 2 comparison of drought indices time series of the region wide average drought severity from the six indices during the growing season april to september show strong agreement in the drought temporal pattern across the region see fig 4 the historical period in this study covers several historical drought events 1980 1988 2002 2011 and 2012 in the months of july august and september of 2012 spei indicated a higher level of drought condition compared to the spi based indices the divergence can be explained by the high temperature during those months in 2012 which lead to the higher climatic evaporative demand eto component in spei drought indices were evaluated based on the percentage of counties across the study region that exhibit a significantly strong correlation r 0 5 and p value 0 05 between the index and crop detrended yield time series all indices have the highest correlation with crop yields during the critical months of the growing season see fig 5 the critical months for maize are usually june and july thus indices for august which is the aggregation of drought condition of june to august show the highest correlation for soybean indices for both august and september show similar correlation with yield as the development stage of soybean normally lasts longer from june to august the results show that spei and spi cropwat have a stronger correlation with both maize and soybean yields across all months of the growing season while the original spi had the lowest correlation see fig 5 spi usda simplified has better performance compared to the modified spi using the crop specific usda equation for ep this is due to uncertainty in the estimation of the crop specific water requirement etc in eq 3 such as using a fixed planting date and growing season length based on the performances spei and spi cropwat for august maize and september soybean were chosen for further analyses of drought impact on crop yield 3 3 drought impacts on year to year yield variability the sensitivity of year to year yield variability to drought during the critical months is estimated as the slope of the linear regression in eq 6 the spatial pattern of the slope across the study region is similar between spei and spi cropwat see fig 6 drought has negative impact on yield for most counties indicated by a positive slope except for a few southernmost and coastal counties in the region where historically precipitation has been greater than the rest of the region see fig s1 in the si on average increase in a unit of spei spi cropwat leads to an average year to year yield reduction of 0 62 0 60 mg ha 1 for maize and 0 30 0 28 mg ha 1 for soybean respectively spei spi cropwat is responsible for 29 28 of year to year variability ranging from 0 to 80 75 for maize and 30 28 ranging from 0 to 85 78 for soybean as expressed by the coefficient of determination r2 from the linear regression see fig 7 the differences in crop yield response to drought between irrigated and non irrigated counties were tested by anova see table 6 there are 74 counties in the study area where at least 10 of the county area is known to be irrigated most of these counties are along the mississippi delta see fig s3 in si on average maize grown in irrigated counties is significantly less sensitive to drought p value 0 001 with the yield change due to drought half of that of non irrigated counties the difference in soybean yield response between irrigated and non irrigated counties is much smaller albeit significant see table 3 the year to year yield change in response to drought severity are shown in fig 8 and table 4 spei and spi cropwat show overall similar results in terms of crop yield loss estimation spei and spi cropwat both show that there was a significant yield loss under dry conditions at 95th confidence level with percentage of yield loss increasing with increases in drought severity see fig 8 average yield loss was 41 73 31 96 for maize and 25 39 23 43 for soybean see table 4 when an extremely dry event occurred based on spei spi cropwat respectively as the condition becomes wetter yield change starts to become positive showcasing the beneficial effects of precipitation on crop production for both maize and soybean in the region maize and soybean yield experience the greatest increase under moderately wet conditions defined by spei spi cropwat with 8 20 8 38 for maize and 9 11 7 56 for soybean however when the condition becomes extremely wet the benefit of precipitation diminishes for both crops the highest probability of yield reduction for maize is under the extremely dry condition 84 86 followed by the very dry 67 71 and moderately dry conditions 55 56 see fig 9 and table 5 these probabilities for soybean are similar under the same conditions probabilities estimated using spei are slightly higher than spi cropwat in both crops shifting from the normal dry conditions to the extremely dry conditions would increase the risk of yield reduction by over 40 for both crops even a shift from the normal dry condition to moderately drought condition would increase the risk of yield loss by 11 12 this suggests that climate change induced temperature rise would pose a greater threat to maize while changes in precipitation would be more responsible for yield loss in soybean in the future 4 discussion time efficient and robust assessment of drought severity and impacts on crop yields is crucial to planning and adapting to climate change in agriculture at the regional level the use of standardized indices such as spi is popular in drought assessment studies due to their simplicity and efficiency in quantifying drought impacts however assessing agricultural drought by using the original spi is limited as this index omits agriculturally relevant components this study evaluated the performance of modified spis with ep by comparing their correlation with the detrended yield time series of maize and soybean at the county level this study showed that the modified spi index using the cropwat equation for ep spi cropwat has the best performances comparable to that of spei followed by the spi index using uscs simplified equation for ep spi usda simplified see fig 5 on the contrary the modified spi with fao and crop specific usda ep equations did not improve performance over the original spi the cropwat equation used in this study is derived from a usda soil conservation service scs study of water balance calculations based on 50 years of weather data from 22 stations within the u s while the fao equation was developed based on the global average condition tigkas et al 2019 the crop specific usda ep equation is limited by the assumptions regarding the calculation of etc including assuming a fixed planting date and length of growing season each year and the values of crop coefficient k c incorporating actual planting dates and k c may increase the accuracy of the estimation of eq 3 at the field level however these data are not always available over a large area the results of drought impact assessment based on spi cropwat and spei generally show that both crops are highly sensitive to drought and give some insight into the driving climatic factors for yield change in both crops the significant difference between irrigated and non irrigated crop yield response to drought shows that both crops benefit from increase in water supply table 3 however the irrigation effect is much smaller for soybean yield than maize yield showing that maize yield is more sensitive to water shortages than that of soybean in addition the region wide estimated average year to year yield losses of maize under very dry and extremely dry events identified by spei are more severe compared to those of spi cropwat while soybean yield losses estimated by using these indices under the same conditions show little difference this may be because spei incorporates precipitation temperature and vapor pressure deficit via evapotranspiration thus the index captures the interaction between temperature and precipitation in relation to crop yield while spi cropwat considers soil moisture through effective precipitation and largely ignores the temperature effect this result reveals maize yield is more susceptible to the interaction of high temperature and precipitation deficit referred to as heat stress compared to soybean yield previous studies have established the importance of the interaction of t and p to maize yield lobell et al 2013 lobell and field 2007 the southeastern u s crop production is highly vulnerable to drought on average drought is responsible for approximately 30 of year to year yield change in maize and soybean in the southeastern u s which is more than two times higher than the national average 12 6 for maize and 12 8 for soybean reported by zipper et al 2016 the risk of reduction in crop yield in the region increases from more than 50 to more than 80 as drought conditions change from moderately dry to extremely dry apart from a small number of counties with historically higher precipitation near the coastal line see fig s1 in si drought has negative impacts on year to year variability of maize and soybean yield of most counties in the study region see fig 6 counties where crop yield is negatively impacted by drought generally have higher yearly average temperature vapor pressure deficit and reference evapotranspiration in addition to low yearly average precipitation by contrast counties with high amount of annual rainfall have little sometimes even positive impact of drought as drier conditions may abate the detrimental impact of excessive rainfall li et al 2019 with the possibility of increase in drought severity and frequency due to climate change actions for adaptation and mitigation must be considered to alleviate the negative impacts irrigation may help to reduce the costs of drought on crop yield as counties with irrigation have significantly lower sensitivity to drought especially for maize however increase in the use of water for irrigation may put a burden on the water budget in the region thus other adaptive methods such as increasing drought tolerance in species and change in planting date must also be considered to ensure the productivity level and food security of the region 5 conclusions timely and robust assessment of impacts of drought on crop growth is crucial to planning for agricultural management and ensuring food security this study evaluated performances of a group of drought indices and demonstrated that a modified spi with ep estimation using the cropwat equation can provide robust evaluation of drought impacts and risks on maize and soybean comparable to that of spei both 3 month spi cropwat and spei indices are strongly correlated with year to year yield variability of more than 50 of the counties in the study region during the critical growth stage of maize june july and soybean july august the modified spi using cropwat equation for ep is particularly useful in areas where data are lacking for calculation of evapotranspiration as its calculation relies on monthly precipitation data that is available in most places this study demonstrated that drought has had significantly negative impacts on and will continue to pose high risks to crop production the southeastern u s drought is responsible for about 27 30 of year to year yield variability over the historical period of 1979 2019 crop yields are highly sensitive to drought during the development stage of the growing season as an extremely dry event occurring at this stage will result in an average yield loss between 42 7 to 31 9 for maize and 25 4 and 23 4 for soybean drought impacts on yields vary across the region due to differences in physical characteristics soil topography etc historical climate condition and irrigation infrastructure historically wet counties and irrigated areas are less sensitive to drought moderately wet conditions may lead to an increase for both crops but are only one third to a half of what could be lost due to drought in addition the positive effects of precipitation for both crops decrease as the condition becomes extremely wet the average probability of yield loss due to extreme drought for both crops is more than 80 across the region indicating that if drought severity and frequency increases under warming climate scenarios crop production is at high risk of yield loss the vulnerability of crop production in the region to drought requires strategic approaches to planning especially in the context of climate change irrigation may help to reduce crop yield vulnerability to drought especially for maize producing counties as irrigated counties on average are 50 less sensitive to drought than non irrigated counties at the present the irrigated area covers only about 15 in the total crop land area therefore further studies are required to quantify future water needs for the crops for the development of irrigation infrastructure that is sufficient to meet the need of crop growth while taking into account other water users such as energy and recreation other approaches to alleviate drought impacts on crop growth include growing drought tolerant cultivars enhancing efficiency in irrigation infrastructure improving crop management practices etc this study

8993,the trend of yield losses to drought in united states u s agriculture has increased over the years in spite of financial investments and technological development to alleviate drought impacts as climate change threatens to worsen future drought conditions it is crucial to evaluate drought impacts on crop production for efficient yet robust decision making at the regional level this study evaluated the robustness of modified standardized precipitation indices spis using effective precipitation ep and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in assessing drought impacts on county level maize and soybean yields in the southeastern u s during 1979 2019 the results showed that the modified spi using the cropwat ep formula can be as effective as spei in assessing drought impacts on crop production assessment of drought impacts on crop yield year to year variability was then assessed by fitting linear regression through the yield drought time series probability of yield loss due to drought in the region was estimated by using a copula based probabilistic model results show that drought events occurring during the critical development growth stage had significantly negative impacts on year to year yield variability in over 50 of the counties in the study region though the impact magnitude varied across the region due to different characteristics historical climatic condition and irrigation infrastructure on average an extremely dry event occurring during the critical development growth stage resulted in a region wide average yield reduction between 42 7 and 31 9 for maize and between 25 4 and 23 4 for soybean moderately wet conditions may increase crop yield but excessively wet conditions may diminish the benefits for both crops the average probability of yield loss of the study region under the extremely dry condition is more than 80 irrigation may help to reduce the impacts of drought on crop production maize producing irrigated counties on average were found to be 50 less sensitive to drought than non irrigated counties though this effect is smaller for soybean as crop production in the region is highly vulnerable to drought adaptation interventions under are required to adapt to warming climate scenarios keywords drought maize soybean yield spi spei effective precipitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction amongst all economic sectors agriculture is particularly vulnerable to drought agricultural drought is the result of precipitation deficiency during the growing season of crops coupled with possible increase in temperature low humidity and strong wind leading to higher evapotranspiration over an extended time vergni 2004 it is further characterized by reduced soil moisture and diminished surface and underground water supplies wilhite and glantz 1985 the average annual crop losses associated with drought in the great plains in the united states u s in 1975 were reported to be us 700 million white and haas 1975 in 1995 the estimated drought induced losses in agriculture by the us federal emergency management agency fema were between us 6 8 billion wilhite 2000 whereas in 2018 this number was us 10 14 billion kuwayama 2019 this reveals the alarming vulnerability of us agriculture to drought despite increasing financial investments and technological advances with the possibility of a warmer climate and changes in precipitation patterns in the future droughts are predicted to become more severe and frequent thus increasing the costs and damages in agriculture ipcc 2014 the impacts of drought on agriculture in particular crop production depend not only on severity but also the timing of the drought event drought occurrence at the beginning of the growing season may have little effect on crop growth but occurrence during the critical development stage can increase the chance of yield loss or even crop failure goldblum 2009 lesk et al 2016 during this stage crop requirements for water nutrients and carbon dioxide co2 increase and drought stresses during this period usually result in crop growth disruption hasanuzzaman et al 2013 ihsan et al 2016 tuteja and singh gill 2013 since drought is a constant feature of almost every climate regime it is crucial for farmers and policy makers especially in dominantly rainfed regions to be able to make informed decisions regarding the severity and timing of drought to effectively develop strategies to adapt to and alleviate the damages of drought methods to assess and monitor drought severity have been categorized into two groups quantitative drought indices based on climate observational records hao and singh 2015 heim 2002 lu et al 2017 yihdego et al 2019 and indices that combine multiple metrics to capture different aspects of drought conditions such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi peters et al 1991 vegetation condition index vci kogan 1995 scaled drought condition index sdci rhee et al 2010 etc the latter however are limited by availability of data and computational capacity especially over a large area therefore single element indices such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are still widely popular in large scale assessment studies thanks to their simplicity standardized calculation method and ease in interpretation and comparison leng and hall 2019 zipper et al 2016 one disadvantage of the use of spi in agricultural drought assessment is that it does not include important components in crop growth such as soil moisture to address this some studies modified spi by using effective precipitation ep in place of the original precipitation as the former is expressed as the portion of precipitation that is available for crop use ebrahimpour et al 2015 tigkas et al 2019 zarei and moghimi 2019 these modified indices have not been frequently applied in the u s and to the best of our knowledge there has not been a comprehensive comparison of the performances of these indices with respect to crop yield this study aims to address this gap by evaluating performances of modified spis and spei for drought impact assessment in the southeastern u s by using these drought indices this study provides a comprehensive spatio temporal assessment of historical drought in the study region and highlights the impacts of drought on crop yield year to year variability most studies quantify yield loss as deviation from long term yield average deterministically in response to droughts leng and hall 2019 lu et al 2017 matiu et al 2017 peña gallardo et al 2019 zipper et al 2016 this study however adopted a probabilistic approach to measure the probability of yield loss with respect to different drought severity levels leng and hall 2019 the study region is the southeastern u s which has been experiencing increased temperatures and decreased water availability melillo et al 2014 however unlike the western region drought impacts on crop production in this region have been less extensively studied though the southeast is home to large population and lucrative agricultural sector usda econimic research service 2022 2 methodology 2 1 study region the study region is located in the southeastern u s spanning from 91 39 n to 75 27 n and from 29 37 w to 40 40 w comprising 1175 counties from 19 states see fig 1 the climate of the study region is sub humid the major food crops in the region include maize and soybean both of which are typically grown between april and september over the historical period 1979 2019 the average growing season cumulative precipitation p was 648 218 mm while average reference evapotranspiration eto was 914 100 mm daily maximum temperature tx during the growing season was 30 7 2 1 c while the minimum temperature tn was 18 6 2 1 c daily vapor pressure deficit vpd averaged 1 06 0 26 kpa temperature increases from north to south in the study region but the southern area is characterized by a high amount of annual precipitation approximately 900 mm year low vpd and eto see fig s1 in the supplementary index si the average maize yield during 1979 2019 was 6 51 mg ha 1 2 03 and the average soybean yield was 2 54 mg ha 1 0 54 maize and soybean yields have increased over the years with maize increasing by 0 13 mg ha year 1 p 0 01 and soybean 0 03 mg ha year 1 p 0 01 between 1979 and 2019 see fig 2 spatial variation of yield across the region can be found in fig s2 in the si maize and soybean in this region are dominantly rainfed see fig s3 in the si which makes the region more vulnerable to potential changes in drought in the future climate change may also lead to higher energy demand thus putting further stress on water management and allocation in the region ralston fonseca et al 2019 2 2 crop yield detrending the increasing non linear trend in the u s maize and soybean yield time series have been driven mainly by technological advances and management practices lu et al 2017 assessment of drought impacts on year to year crop yield variability therefore requires removing the non climate induced trend from the original data or detrending detrending yield consists of two steps first fitting a trend model through the observational time series and second removing the trend through a decomposition model trend fitting methods vary in their complexity and applicability lu et al 2017 compared the effectiveness of various detrending models for crop yields at the county and state level in the u s and found that locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess is more effective at detecting yield trends than the other models especially for county level data with short time lengths and non linear non stationary patterns cleveland 1979 cleveland and devlin 1988 since the length of most county yield time series in this study is between 15 and 41 years lowess was chosen as the detrending method an r package called fancova which contains a collection of r functions to perform nonparametric analysis of covariance for regression curves was used to conduct the lowess fitting the function loess as in this package performs lowess fitting for the datasets with automatic selection of the smoothing parameter using bias corrected akaike information criterion aic for more detail see section s2 1 in the si after the trend was fitted the yield time series was detrended using i additive method where the trend line is subtracted from the original time series and ii multiplicative method where the detrended time series is computed as the ratio of the original data to the values of the trend line lu et al 2017 in this study both methods resulted in a detrended time series that satisfies the stationarity assumption data variance remains constant over time which were tested by applying the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss test to the detrended time series see section s2 2 in the si 2 3 effective precipitation in agriculture effective precipitation ep is defined as the portion of precipitation that is stored in the rootzone to be used effectively by plants martin and gilley 1993 various processes and factors are involved in determining the effectiveness of precipitation including climate soil properties antecedent soil moisture vegetation cover runoff groundwater levels topography etc martin and gilley 1993 to properly measure all these processes however is not practical thus simplified methods have been developed to estimate ep most widely used are the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao equation brouwer and heibloem 1986 the cropwat model equation smith 1992 the usda soil conservation service usda scs equation and its simplified version usda scs simplified martin and gilley 1993 see table 1 all these methods require monthly total precipitation p mm a climate variable that is available in most regions these methods were selected for this study as they are applicable in different climatic conditions in the u s adnan and khan 2009 ali and mubarak 2017 2 4 drought indices 2 4 1 original drought indices spi was introduced by mckee et al 1993 to serve as a versatile tool in drought monitoring and analysis this index standardizes the precipitation deficit by considering the time series of cumulative precipitation for various timescales 1 48 months fitting a statistical distribution to the time series and transforming it into a normal distribution the average spi value for an area over a reference period is zero and non zero values indicate wet positive values and dry negative values periods mckee et al 1993 proposed the use of the gamma distribution for spi calculation with two parameters while other researchers have used the log normal distribution with similar results tigkas et al 2018 spei mckee et al 1993 is similar to spi but it is produced by standardizing the difference between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration p eto since the values of the time series can be negative vicente serrano et al 2010 proposed to use the log logistic distribution to account for negative values in the p eto series at different time scales in this study spi and spei were computed using the r package spei using gamma distribution for spi and log logistic distribution for spei mckee et al 1993 stated that the period over which precipitation deficits accumulate becomes significant to assessing and monitoring drought events in a particular sector in agriculture studies show that crops are more sensitive to shorter term droughts 1 3 months lu et al 2017 zipper et al 2016 in this study drought indices at the 3 month timescale were computed as this timescale is reasonable to account for impact of drought on crop yields county level time series of monthly cumulative precipitation were computed using backwards moving sum over a three month interval e g precipitation data for august is the sum of monthly total precipitation of june july and august drought severity levels are categorized in table 2 2 4 2 modified spi with effective precipitation since the original spi only uses precipitation and does not account for the absence of important variables to drought such as temperature or soil moisture a set of modified spis were computed with effective precipitation calculated with eq 1 5 instead of the original precipitation as these ep equations were developed based on observations of soil water balance the modified spis incorporate the components in agricultural drought for which spi may not account for tigkas et al 2019 the modified spis are referred to as spi fao using the fao equation spi cropwat using the cropwat equation spi usda simplified using the simplified usda equation and spi usda corn spi usda soybean using the crop specific usda eq 3 for maize and soybean respectively 2 4 3 drought index comparison the different drought indices were evaluated based on the strength of their correlation to the maize and soybean detrended yields at the county level during the historical growing season the pearson correlation coefficient r was used and the significance p value of the correlation was tested using a two tailed t test then the percentage of counties with significantly strong correlation r 0 5 and p value 0 05 between crop yield and the drought index was estimated indices that show the strongest correlation with the crop were chosen for further analysis 2 5 assessment of drought impact on crop yield 2 5 1 year to year yield sensitivity to drought to examine the impacts of drought on crop yield variability over the years a linear regression was fitted through the additive detrended yield δy a and the drought index i time series for each county 6 y a c t β c α c i c t ϵ c t where c and t indicate county and year β c is the intercept α is the slope of the linear regression and ϵ c t is the residual the slope measures how much the year to year crop yield variability responds to drought severity and a positive slope suggests that drought severity has a negative impact on crop yield the coefficient of determination r2 extracted from the linear regression eq 6 indicates how much drought is responsible for yield year to year variability to determine whether areas with a high level of irrigation may experience drought impacts the values of α and r2 from the linear regression of each county were compared for counties with low and high level of irrigation cover using the analysis of variance anova method counties with at least 10 of the total area irrigated are defined as having a high level of irrigation coverage 2 5 2 change in year to year yield in response to drought severity the deviation of the yield of a particular county year from the long term yield trend of that county is thought to reflect crop yield response to the drought condition therefore detrended yield data for each county and year were grouped by different categories of drought severity table 2 for each drought severity group all county year multiplicative detrended yield δy m which is the percentage of yield deviating from expected trend of the group was averaged by their weight with the weight being the county crop area w c 7 y m y m c w c a bootstrap method was applied by randomly sampling 1000 times with replacement in each detrended time series in eq 7 to obtain the 95th confidence level of the yield change results 2 5 3 probability of yield loss due to drought probability of yield loss due to drought in the region is an indication of the crop production vulnerability to drought as it measures the risk of changing drought severity in the future a copula based probabilistic model was applied to estimate the probability copulas are functions that couple a multivariate joint distribution function to the marginal distribution of each variable nelson 2000 two advantages of copulas are they allow modeling dependency between variables that do not follow the same distribution including non normal distribution thus avoiding prior assumptions about the relationship between the variables and they can properly treat the tails of distributions which is important for extreme drought assessment leng and hall 2019 for more information see section s3 in the si a copula function was fit through the δy m and drought index time series to estimate the probability of yield falling below the expected yield defined by the yield trend fitting process δy m 0 for a given drought condition in this study the fitting of the copula function was conducted with the r package copula and vc2copula which enables the selection of the best fit distribution function optimal parameters and estimation of conditional density distribution 2 6 data description county level crop yield data were extracted from the national agricultural statistics service nass under the u s agricultural department usda https www nass usda gov for the period of 1979 2019 maize and soybean crop land areas in each county were derived from the crop data layers cdl https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape using r package raster county level climate data mean temperature precipitation and reference evapotranspiration were aggregated from gridmet a dataset of daily high spatial resolution 1 24th degree surface meteorological data covering the contiguous u s from 1979 to 2019 abatzoglou 2013 to ensure that climate data were specific to the crops the percentage of crop area of maize and soybean in each climate grid was estimated by overlaying the cdl and the climate data grid raster county level climate data for drought analysis was then calculated as the weighted average of all the climate grids within the county boundary with the weight as the crop area percentage in each grid in the county county crop area was also derived from the cdl and the weight w c values in eq 7 were estimated by dividing the county crop area to the total crop area in the study region soil available storage water aws in eq 4 were extracted from ssurgo database https sdmdataaccess sc egov usda gov and aggregated to the 1 24th degree grid cell using the r package raster irrigation data were extracted from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis irrigated agriculture dataset for the united states mirad us pervez and brown 2010 3 results 3 1 detrended yields the detrended yield time series from 1979 to 2019 for county level maize and soybean are shown in fig 3 kpss test results showed that the detrended time series by both decomposition methods are stationary not shown approximately 90 of maize yield difference over the period ranges between 2 21 and 1 79 mg ha 1 while 90 of soybean yield fluctuates between 0 58 and 0 48 mg ha 1 these are equivalent to 41 3 31 6 of yield deviation from the average yield in maize and 33 27 in soybean see fig 3 the highest yield loss for maize 86 occurred in 2012 while the highest soybean yield loss 96 occurred in 2005 3 2 comparison of drought indices time series of the region wide average drought severity from the six indices during the growing season april to september show strong agreement in the drought temporal pattern across the region see fig 4 the historical period in this study covers several historical drought events 1980 1988 2002 2011 and 2012 in the months of july august and september of 2012 spei indicated a higher level of drought condition compared to the spi based indices the divergence can be explained by the high temperature during those months in 2012 which lead to the higher climatic evaporative demand eto component in spei drought indices were evaluated based on the percentage of counties across the study region that exhibit a significantly strong correlation r 0 5 and p value 0 05 between the index and crop detrended yield time series all indices have the highest correlation with crop yields during the critical months of the growing season see fig 5 the critical months for maize are usually june and july thus indices for august which is the aggregation of drought condition of june to august show the highest correlation for soybean indices for both august and september show similar correlation with yield as the development stage of soybean normally lasts longer from june to august the results show that spei and spi cropwat have a stronger correlation with both maize and soybean yields across all months of the growing season while the original spi had the lowest correlation see fig 5 spi usda simplified has better performance compared to the modified spi using the crop specific usda equation for ep this is due to uncertainty in the estimation of the crop specific water requirement etc in eq 3 such as using a fixed planting date and growing season length based on the performances spei and spi cropwat for august maize and september soybean were chosen for further analyses of drought impact on crop yield 3 3 drought impacts on year to year yield variability the sensitivity of year to year yield variability to drought during the critical months is estimated as the slope of the linear regression in eq 6 the spatial pattern of the slope across the study region is similar between spei and spi cropwat see fig 6 drought has negative impact on yield for most counties indicated by a positive slope except for a few southernmost and coastal counties in the region where historically precipitation has been greater than the rest of the region see fig s1 in the si on average increase in a unit of spei spi cropwat leads to an average year to year yield reduction of 0 62 0 60 mg ha 1 for maize and 0 30 0 28 mg ha 1 for soybean respectively spei spi cropwat is responsible for 29 28 of year to year variability ranging from 0 to 80 75 for maize and 30 28 ranging from 0 to 85 78 for soybean as expressed by the coefficient of determination r2 from the linear regression see fig 7 the differences in crop yield response to drought between irrigated and non irrigated counties were tested by anova see table 6 there are 74 counties in the study area where at least 10 of the county area is known to be irrigated most of these counties are along the mississippi delta see fig s3 in si on average maize grown in irrigated counties is significantly less sensitive to drought p value 0 001 with the yield change due to drought half of that of non irrigated counties the difference in soybean yield response between irrigated and non irrigated counties is much smaller albeit significant see table 3 the year to year yield change in response to drought severity are shown in fig 8 and table 4 spei and spi cropwat show overall similar results in terms of crop yield loss estimation spei and spi cropwat both show that there was a significant yield loss under dry conditions at 95th confidence level with percentage of yield loss increasing with increases in drought severity see fig 8 average yield loss was 41 73 31 96 for maize and 25 39 23 43 for soybean see table 4 when an extremely dry event occurred based on spei spi cropwat respectively as the condition becomes wetter yield change starts to become positive showcasing the beneficial effects of precipitation on crop production for both maize and soybean in the region maize and soybean yield experience the greatest increase under moderately wet conditions defined by spei spi cropwat with 8 20 8 38 for maize and 9 11 7 56 for soybean however when the condition becomes extremely wet the benefit of precipitation diminishes for both crops the highest probability of yield reduction for maize is under the extremely dry condition 84 86 followed by the very dry 67 71 and moderately dry conditions 55 56 see fig 9 and table 5 these probabilities for soybean are similar under the same conditions probabilities estimated using spei are slightly higher than spi cropwat in both crops shifting from the normal dry conditions to the extremely dry conditions would increase the risk of yield reduction by over 40 for both crops even a shift from the normal dry condition to moderately drought condition would increase the risk of yield loss by 11 12 this suggests that climate change induced temperature rise would pose a greater threat to maize while changes in precipitation would be more responsible for yield loss in soybean in the future 4 discussion time efficient and robust assessment of drought severity and impacts on crop yields is crucial to planning and adapting to climate change in agriculture at the regional level the use of standardized indices such as spi is popular in drought assessment studies due to their simplicity and efficiency in quantifying drought impacts however assessing agricultural drought by using the original spi is limited as this index omits agriculturally relevant components this study evaluated the performance of modified spis with ep by comparing their correlation with the detrended yield time series of maize and soybean at the county level this study showed that the modified spi index using the cropwat equation for ep spi cropwat has the best performances comparable to that of spei followed by the spi index using uscs simplified equation for ep spi usda simplified see fig 5 on the contrary the modified spi with fao and crop specific usda ep equations did not improve performance over the original spi the cropwat equation used in this study is derived from a usda soil conservation service scs study of water balance calculations based on 50 years of weather data from 22 stations within the u s while the fao equation was developed based on the global average condition tigkas et al 2019 the crop specific usda ep equation is limited by the assumptions regarding the calculation of etc including assuming a fixed planting date and length of growing season each year and the values of crop coefficient k c incorporating actual planting dates and k c may increase the accuracy of the estimation of eq 3 at the field level however these data are not always available over a large area the results of drought impact assessment based on spi cropwat and spei generally show that both crops are highly sensitive to drought and give some insight into the driving climatic factors for yield change in both crops the significant difference between irrigated and non irrigated crop yield response to drought shows that both crops benefit from increase in water supply table 3 however the irrigation effect is much smaller for soybean yield than maize yield showing that maize yield is more sensitive to water shortages than that of soybean in addition the region wide estimated average year to year yield losses of maize under very dry and extremely dry events identified by spei are more severe compared to those of spi cropwat while soybean yield losses estimated by using these indices under the same conditions show little difference this may be because spei incorporates precipitation temperature and vapor pressure deficit via evapotranspiration thus the index captures the interaction between temperature and precipitation in relation to crop yield while spi cropwat considers soil moisture through effective precipitation and largely ignores the temperature effect this result reveals maize yield is more susceptible to the interaction of high temperature and precipitation deficit referred to as heat stress compared to soybean yield previous studies have established the importance of the interaction of t and p to maize yield lobell et al 2013 lobell and field 2007 the southeastern u s crop production is highly vulnerable to drought on average drought is responsible for approximately 30 of year to year yield change in maize and soybean in the southeastern u s which is more than two times higher than the national average 12 6 for maize and 12 8 for soybean reported by zipper et al 2016 the risk of reduction in crop yield in the region increases from more than 50 to more than 80 as drought conditions change from moderately dry to extremely dry apart from a small number of counties with historically higher precipitation near the coastal line see fig s1 in si drought has negative impacts on year to year variability of maize and soybean yield of most counties in the study region see fig 6 counties where crop yield is negatively impacted by drought generally have higher yearly average temperature vapor pressure deficit and reference evapotranspiration in addition to low yearly average precipitation by contrast counties with high amount of annual rainfall have little sometimes even positive impact of drought as drier conditions may abate the detrimental impact of excessive rainfall li et al 2019 with the possibility of increase in drought severity and frequency due to climate change actions for adaptation and mitigation must be considered to alleviate the negative impacts irrigation may help to reduce the costs of drought on crop yield as counties with irrigation have significantly lower sensitivity to drought especially for maize however increase in the use of water for irrigation may put a burden on the water budget in the region thus other adaptive methods such as increasing drought tolerance in species and change in planting date must also be considered to ensure the productivity level and food security of the region 5 conclusions timely and robust assessment of impacts of drought on crop growth is crucial to planning for agricultural management and ensuring food security this study evaluated performances of a group of drought indices and demonstrated that a modified spi with ep estimation using the cropwat equation can provide robust evaluation of drought impacts and risks on maize and soybean comparable to that of spei both 3 month spi cropwat and spei indices are strongly correlated with year to year yield variability of more than 50 of the counties in the study region during the critical growth stage of maize june july and soybean july august the modified spi using cropwat equation for ep is particularly useful in areas where data are lacking for calculation of evapotranspiration as its calculation relies on monthly precipitation data that is available in most places this study demonstrated that drought has had significantly negative impacts on and will continue to pose high risks to crop production the southeastern u s drought is responsible for about 27 30 of year to year yield variability over the historical period of 1979 2019 crop yields are highly sensitive to drought during the development stage of the growing season as an extremely dry event occurring at this stage will result in an average yield loss between 42 7 to 31 9 for maize and 25 4 and 23 4 for soybean drought impacts on yields vary across the region due to differences in physical characteristics soil topography etc historical climate condition and irrigation infrastructure historically wet counties and irrigated areas are less sensitive to drought moderately wet conditions may lead to an increase for both crops but are only one third to a half of what could be lost due to drought in addition the positive effects of precipitation for both crops decrease as the condition becomes extremely wet the average probability of yield loss due to extreme drought for both crops is more than 80 across the region indicating that if drought severity and frequency increases under warming climate scenarios crop production is at high risk of yield loss the vulnerability of crop production in the region to drought requires strategic approaches to planning especially in the context of climate change irrigation may help to reduce crop yield vulnerability to drought especially for maize producing counties as irrigated counties on average are 50 less sensitive to drought than non irrigated counties at the present the irrigated area covers only about 15 in the total crop land area therefore further studies are required to quantify future water needs for the crops for the development of irrigation infrastructure that is sufficient to meet the need of crop growth while taking into account other water users such as energy and recreation other approaches to alleviate drought impacts on crop growth include growing drought tolerant cultivars enhancing efficiency in irrigation infrastructure improving crop management practices etc this study

8994,agricultural irrigation water is essential for global food production climate change may significantly increase future atmosphere evaporative demand which can further intensify local water stress particularly in arid and semi arid regions in this study we investigate climate change impacts on future irrigation water use iwu change with a focus on a semi arid zhangye region in northwest china specifically this approach estimates crop water demand using penman monteith co2 equation which is modified to account for atmospheric co2 concentration impacts the iwu is then calculated as the difference between crop water demand and effective precipitation this approach is validated using observed iwu combined with climate projections from eight earth system models esms future up to 2100 iwu changes under different co2 emission scenarios are evaluated results demonstrate that our penman monteith co2 approach is robust in iwu estimation with a relative error of 2 4 during the validation period of 2015 2020 in the medium emission scenario ssp245 iwu has a significant increasing trend of 1 4 105 m3 yr during 2021 2100 which is mainly attributed to the increased future atmospheric evaporation demand interestingly iwu presents a decreasing trend of 1 3 105 m3 yr for the high emission scenario ssp585 this is because strongly elevated co2 concentration levels can substantially increase crop water use efficiency leading to reduced iwu and this impact outweighs the increased atmospheric evaporation demand in the ssp585 scenario therefore our study suggests that

climate change impacts on iwu have been intensively investigated in the past decades for instance based on global hydrological models wada et al 2013 show that iwu will increase substantially by the end of this century which will be particularly noticeable for the high end climate change scenario ssp585 however elliott et al 2014 find that hydrological models and crop models may predict contrasting iwu trends due to their difference in the crop stomatal pore change with increased co2 concentration as such global iwu may decline significantly with future elevated co2 conditions konzmann et al 2013 in addition to the uncertainties in the plant physiological mechanisms irrigation modeling itself is also highly uncertain even under relatively constant co2 conditions for example lawston et al 2015 compared four different irrigation modeling approaches which parameterize irrigation by adding a constant rainfall or increasing soil moisture to a certain level their results show that iwu estimated by the four approaches varies significantly finally modeled iwu is also complicated by model errors in soil moisture et coupling strength as demonstrated by dong et al 2022 modeled et water stress is positively biased for a given soil moisture content level in the central us meaning unrealistically more water or iwu will be required to remove the overestimated et water stress therefore xu et al 2019 suggest that site specific calibration of the key irrigation parameters would be required for robust irrigation modeling in addition to the methods that involve complex soil moisture et relationship food and agriculture organization fao provides a crop water demand approach which estimates iwu with potential et and effective precipitation allen et al 1998 de rosnay et al

elevation of the zhangye irrigation area is shown in fig 1b in addition the study region is characterized as continental temperate arid and semi arid climate with et substantially exceeding precipitation during all seasons fig 1d meaning irrigation is essential for local food production and any increase of iwu will further intensify local water stress 2 2 data 2 2 1 data in this study

supplementary fig s1 and fig s2 3 method in the crop water demand method iwu was calculated using the well established penman monteith method with co2 correction denoted as pm co2 and the local water balance section 3 1 combined with cmip6 projected 2021 2100 meteorological data climate change impacts and potential adaptive strategies for irrigation water saving were subsequently explored in section 3 2 3 1 estimating iwu based on pm co2 in this approach pm was first used to calculate the reference crop et according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation the reference crop et can be expressed as 1 λ et 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where λ et is the reference crop et mm day which captures the crop water demand r n is net solar radiation in mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux in mj m2 day t is the mean air temperature at 2 m height u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s e s e a is air vapour pressure deficit kpa is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure temperature relationship kpa γ is the psychrometric constant kpa respectively note that vegetation stomatal conductance decreases with increased co2 which can significantly affect future iwu trends to account for such co2 impacts we adopt the method of yang et al 2019 and eq 1 can be rewritten as see supplementary text s1 for derivation 2 λ et 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 u 2 208 70 dr s d co 2 co 2 300 where dr s d co 2 is the relative sensitivity of crop stomal conductance to the change in atmospheric co2 which is 0 05 s m ppm according to yang et al 2019 the reference crop water demand obtained from eq 2 is adjusted by a crop specific coefficient k c to obtain the actual crop water demand 3 et k c λ et where et is the actual crop water demand mm mon k c is a dimensionless crop coefficient obtained from fao and wcmi which is temporally adjusted according to the crop dynamics therefore the k c used in this study reflects both the temporal and spatial irrigation water demand of the study area clearly irrigation has to be applied when precipitation cannot meet the crop water demand therefore the iwu can be estimated as 4 iwu i 1 n et i β p i where iwu is the actual irrigation water amount entering into the field mm mon et i is the et on pixel i from crop map mm mon β is the effective utilization coefficient of precipitation and a constant value of 0 76 was used in this study obtained from wcmi p i is the precipitation on the irrigation unit i from crop map mm mon as mentioned above this study aims to investigate the controlling factors of future iwu trends for a meteorological variable y we calculated iwu based on the original and the detrended versions of y and the resulting iwu difference captures the impact of y trends on future iwu the meteorological variable y is detrended as 5 detren d y y y fitted y mean where detren d y is the detrended y y fitted is the long term trend of y estimated by linear regression y mean is the temporal mean of y 3 2 iwu saving with different crop pattern mixing strategies as shown in table 2 the iwu varies with crop types given their k c values are different therefore changing the pattern of crop types may reduce crop water demand and hence iwu under elevated co2 conditions to investigate this possibility we investigate the iwu change based on the crop area and location in 2020 by switching the other common crop types in zhangye the difference of iwu calculated based on the new crop type is used to quantify the irrigation water saving potential 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the pm co2 based iwu estimation approach to start we first validate the pm co2 based iwu estimates against the observation based wcmi iwu data from 2015 to 2020 fig 2 the estimated and observed iwu are consistent both in temporal dynamics and the annual mean for instance iwu is theoretically anti correlated to the annual variations of p see eq 4 and this tendency is confirmed by fig 2 in addition to p iwu has also been affected by cultivated areas for example precipitation in 2016 p 50 92 mm is approximately 40 lower than that in 2018 p 82 08 mm however the estimated iwu of 2016 170 106 m3 is lower than that of 2018 193 106 m3 this is related to the expansion of irrigated areas in 2018 see table 3 although some mismatches between wcmi and pm co2 estimated iwu are observed it should be noted that wcmi may also contain measurement errors nonetheless as validated against the wcmi data the relative error of the pm co2 approach is 2 4 these results suggest that the pm co2 approach can generally capture the climate and land use impacts on iwu temporal variations 4 2 climate change impacts on iwu to evaluate the iwu variability in the context of climate change fig 3 shows the pm co2 estimated iwu under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios from 2021 to 2100 simulations based on eight cmip6 esms are used to capture the inter model uncertainties see the shaded area in fig 3 fig 3a demonstrates a strong positive iwu trend significant at p 0 95 confidence level for the ssp245 scenario this is expected since future climate warming is likely to enhance atmospheric evaporation water demand su et al 2015 novick et al 2016 which will subsequently increase iwu this point is further discussed in the section below in contrast the ssp585 scenario representing substantially higher co2 and air temperature increment levels yields a significant at p 0 95 confidence level negative iwu trend the decreasing trend of iwu under ssp585 is similar to findings shown in elliott et al 2014 and konzmann et al 2013 this is likely because the substantially increased co2 concentration can significantly increase the crop water use efficiency deryng et al 2016 keenan et al 2013 in addition under the ssp585 scenario we find that precipitation in the study area is also increased supplementary fig s4 these impacts eventually yield a declining trend of iwu under the ssp585 scenario in addition to the long term the 95th percentile of iwu is changed from 243 106 m3 2021 2050 to 253 106 m3 2050 2100 during the two periods fig 4 the increased temporal variability and the 95th percentiles suggest that future iwu is less predictable which also means that the risks of excessive iwu e g induced by droughts are likely to be higher in the future in contrast to ssp245 the 95th percentile of the future iwu is slightly decreased in the ssp585 scenario see fig 4 as mentioned above crop water use efficiency and the precipitation of the study area are both increased therefore less iwu is required to meet the crop water demand under the ssp585 scenario these two factors also suppress the variability of future iwu which may alleviate the local water stress particularly for extreme years 4 3 climate factors affecting future iwu trend the analyses above demonstrate that both the climate change and the crop physiology responses to co2 have significant impacts on future iwu changes this section investigates the relative contributions of each meteorological variable to the future iwu change according to the pm co2 equation climate change affects iwu via the available energy rn g the slope of the saturation vapour pressure versus temperature relationship vapour pressure deficit vpd precipitation p and co2 to investigate the relative contributions of these variations to future iwu trends we compare the iwu differences when a particular variable is detrended see eq 5 as for the ssp245 scenario co2 plays the most important role in controlling the future iwu trend which negatively affects the iwu by 1 8 105 m3 yr fig 5a with further increased co2 the importance of co2 increases significantly with a net impact on the iwu trend of 3 6 105 m3 yr fig 5b eq 4 demonstrates that p directly determines the regional water supply and is linearly related to iwu however fig 5a and b shows that co2 has even greater impacts on the iwu trend which regulates iwu via stomatal conductance such strong co2 impacts can be directly seen in the comparison of iwu trends shown in fig 3 and fig 6 it is consistent with a previous study which shows that co2 impacts on crop stomatal closure may even determine the sign of future iwu trends elliott et al 2014 as such our analysis further confirms that accurately quantifying the plant s physiological responses to co2 is essential for capturing future iwu trends particularly for high emission scenarios likewise with further increased co2 the relative importance of and vpd increases significantly see fig 5a and b note that vpd is a function of air temperature therefore the control of vpd on future iwu is at least partly induced by the elevated air temperature fig 5c and d 4 4 iwu water saving potential with crop types adjustments as shown in eq 4 and 5 the agricultural water demand varies with different crop types according to their k c values therefore adjusting crop types may potentially reduce iwu and alleviate future water stress luyssaert et al 2014 to test this possibility we replace the current high water consuming crop types i e corn and wheat with cereals and tubers which are common in the zhangye region but with lower k c values the projected iwu of the zhangye region based on current and newly proposed crop types are shown as the red and grey histograms respectively in fig 7 as expected the iwu saving potential via crop type adjustment the difference of the red and grey histograms in fig 7a and b shows a strong inter model variability however for all the eight esms they all demonstrate a significant at p 0 95 confidence level reduction of iwu via crop type adjustment for both scenarios more importantly cropping pattern changes can also significantly reduce future iwu trends for both ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios see fig 7c and d for instance the iwu trend of the ssp245 scenario is 1 4 105 m3 yr and 1 3 105 m3 yr for the cases with and without cropping pattern changes respectively likewise a strong reduction of iwu under the ssp585 scenario 1 3 105 m3 yr is also observed in addition to the mean and the trends fig 8 demonstrates that cropping pattern changes also reduce the 95th percentiles of future iwu which is particularly noticeable for the latter half of the century this means that changing the cropping patterns can also alleviate future iwu and by extension the local water stress for extremely dry years note that discussions above are mainly based on one possible cropping pattern scenario clearly it is difficult if possible to include all the possible cropping patterns and distribution scenarios relative to the baseline remaining current crop types and distributions the upper bound of iwu water saving potential is to use crop types with the lowest k c values this extreme case is shown in supplementary fig s7 despite the expected absolute differences in the irrigation water saving potential these results are qualitatively consistent with fig 7 therefore fig 7 and fig 8 are representative of the general benefit of cropping pattern adjustments for future irrigation water saving finally previous studies show that k c decreases with increased co2 shimono et al 2013 kumar et al 2017 however a robust relationship between k c and co2 is currently unavailable therefore the potential long term decreasing trends of future k c are not considered in our analysis such crop responses to co2 may further highlight the importance of plant physiology to accurately quantify future iwu trends and variations 5 limitations our analyses demonstrate that co2 impacts on potential et see eq 2 and yang et al 2019 are crucial for quantifying future iwu changes under elevated co2 conditions specifically increased co2 tends to increase water use efficiency and reduce potential et the uncertainty of co2 impacts on potential et proposed by yang et al 2019 is tested which yields qualitatively consistent results supplementary fig s3 fig s5 and fig s6 these results suggest the general robustness of our conclusions however the uncertainty ranges of future iwu can be higher than our estimates when complex crop physiological responses and human adaption strategies to elevated co2 are considered additionally the study area is dominated by a semi arid climate and has strong inter annual precipitation variability the cmip6 precipitation can be an order of magnitude higher than observations and has strong inter model variabilities therefore an iwu uncertainty range of 34 remains in cmip6 projections even after bias correction however it should be noted that 87 5 of the eight esms are consistent in the sign of projected iwu trends therefore although the absolute iwu projections are uncertain our findings are qualitatively robust finally this study only focuses on water saving instead of water productivity this means that the water saving strategies via crop mixing pattern change may reduce grain yields however future chinese population is likely to decrease chen et al 2020 therefore future food security is less a concern than water stress in some extreme cases regional water saving can be also achieved by simply reducing irrigated agriculture these scenarios are not considered in our analysis but are unlikely to change our conclusions that adjusting crop patterns or land cover can significantly alleviate future local water stress 6 conclusion at the global scale most of the fresh water is consumed by irrigation and increases in iwu may intensify local water stress particularly in arid and semi arid regions however future iwu changes under elevated co2 conditions remain unclear here we use a physically based framework to investigate future climate change impacts on iwu our analysis demonstrates contrast iwu trends under different co2 emission scenarios as for the medium emission scenario ssp245 a strong positive iwu trend is observed during the 2021 2100 period this is because elevated co2 increases air temperature which in turn enhances local atmospheric evaporation demand and iwu in contrast future iwu over the zhangye region decreases under the high emission scenario ssp585 this is because the projected precipitation over the study area is slightly increased under this scenario additionally the strongly increased co2 levels will also substantially increase crop water use efficiency these two factors eventually led to a declining trend of iwu under the ssp585 scenario in addition we also demonstrate that cropping pattern adjustments i e replacing high iwu demand crops with low iwu ones can significantly reduce future iwu trends and 95th percentiles for both ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios therefore adjusting the crop types can significantly alleviate future local water stress particularly during drought years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

8994,agricultural irrigation water is essential for global food production climate change may significantly increase future atmosphere evaporative demand which can further intensify local water stress particularly in arid and semi arid regions in this study we investigate climate change impacts on future irrigation water use iwu change with a focus on a semi arid zhangye region in northwest china specifically this approach estimates crop water demand using penman monteith co2 equation which is modified to account for atmospheric co2 concentration impacts the iwu is then calculated as the difference between crop water demand and effective precipitation this approach is validated using observed iwu combined with climate projections from eight earth system models esms future up to 2100 iwu changes under different co2 emission scenarios are evaluated results demonstrate that our penman monteith co2 approach is robust in iwu estimation with a relative error of 2 4 during the validation period of 2015 2020 in the medium emission scenario ssp245 iwu has a significant increasing trend of 1 4 105 m3 yr during 2021 2100 which is mainly attributed to the increased future atmospheric evaporation demand interestingly iwu presents a decreasing trend of 1 3 105 m3 yr for the high emission scenario ssp585 this is because strongly elevated co2 concentration levels can substantially increase crop water use efficiency leading to reduced iwu and this impact outweighs the increased atmospheric evaporation demand in the ssp585 scenario therefore our study suggests that future iwu change is determined by both climate change and crop responses to atmospheric co2 concentration finally we highlight that adjusting crop patterns can reduce both the iwu mean and variation

shows the pm co2 estimated iwu under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios from 2021 to 2100 simulations based on eight cmip6 esms are used to capture the inter model uncertainties see the shaded area in fig 3 fig 3a demonstrates a strong positive iwu trend significant at p 0 95 confidence level for the ssp245 scenario this is expected since future climate warming is likely to enhance atmospheric evaporation water demand su et al 2015 novick et al 2016 which will subsequently increase iwu this point is further discussed in the section below in contrast the ssp585 scenario representing substantially higher co2 and air temperature increment levels yields a significant at p 0 95 confidence level negative iwu trend the decreasing trend of iwu under ssp585 is similar to findings shown in elliott et al 2014 and konzmann et al 2013 this is likely because the substantially increased co2 concentration can significantly increase the crop water use efficiency deryng et al 2016 keenan et al 2013 in addition under the ssp585 scenario we find that precipitation in the study area is also increased supplementary fig s4 these impacts eventually yield a declining trend of iwu under the ssp585 scenario in addition to the long term the 95th percentile of iwu is changed from 243 106 m3 2021 2050 to 253 106 m3 2050 2100 during the two periods fig 4 the increased temporal variability and the 95th percentiles suggest that future iwu is less predictable which also means that the risks of excessive iwu e g induced by droughts are likely to be higher in the future in contrast to ssp245 the 95th percentile of the future iwu is slightly decreased in the ssp585 scenario see fig 4 as mentioned above crop water use efficiency and the precipitation of the study area are both increased therefore less iwu is required to meet the crop water demand under the ssp585 scenario these two factors also suppress the variability of future iwu which may alleviate the local water stress particularly for extreme years 4 3 climate factors affecting future iwu trend the analyses above demonstrate that both the climate change and the crop physiology responses to co2 have significant impacts on future iwu changes this section investigates the relative contributions of each meteorological variable to the future iwu change according to the pm co2 equation climate change affects iwu via the available energy rn g the slope of the saturation vapour pressure versus temperature relationship vapour pressure deficit vpd precipitation p and co2 to investigate the relative contributions of these variations to future iwu trends we compare the iwu differences when a particular variable is detrended see eq 5 as for the ssp245 scenario co2 plays the most important role in controlling the future iwu trend which negatively affects the iwu by 1 8 105 m3 yr fig 5a with further increased co2 the importance of co2 increases significantly with a net impact on the iwu trend of 3 6 105 m3 yr fig 5b eq 4 demonstrates that p directly determines the regional water supply and is linearly related to iwu however fig 5a and b shows that co2 has even greater impacts on the iwu trend which regulates iwu via stomatal conductance such strong co2 impacts can be directly seen in the comparison of iwu trends shown in fig 3 and fig 6 it is consistent with a previous study which shows that co2 impacts on crop stomatal closure may even determine the sign of future iwu trends elliott et al 2014 as such our analysis further confirms that accurately quantifying the plant s physiological responses to co2 is essential for capturing future iwu trends particularly for high emission scenarios likewise with further increased co2 the relative importance of and vpd increases significantly see fig 5a and b note that vpd is a function of air temperature therefore the control of vpd on future iwu is at least partly induced by the elevated air temperature fig 5c and d 4 4 iwu water saving potential with crop types adjustments as shown in eq 4 and 5 the agricultural water demand varies with different crop types according to their k c values therefore adjusting crop types may potentially reduce iwu and alleviate future water stress luyssaert et al 2014 to test this possibility we replace the current high water consuming crop types i e corn and wheat with cereals and tubers which are common in the zhangye region but with lower k c values the projected iwu of the zhangye region based on current and newly proposed crop types are shown as the red and grey histograms respectively in fig 7 as expected the iwu saving potential via crop type adjustment the difference of the red and grey histograms in fig 7a and b shows a strong inter model variability however for all the eight esms they all demonstrate a significant at p 0 95 confidence level reduction of iwu via crop type adjustment for both scenarios more importantly cropping pattern changes can also significantly reduce future iwu trends for both ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios see fig 7c and d for instance the iwu trend of the ssp245 scenario is 1 4 105 m3 yr and 1 3 105 m3 yr for the cases with and without cropping pattern changes respectively likewise a strong reduction of iwu under the ssp585 scenario 1 3 105 m3 yr is also observed in addition to the mean and the trends fig 8 demonstrates that cropping pattern changes also reduce the 95th percentiles of future iwu which is particularly noticeable for the latter half of the century this means that changing the cropping patterns can also alleviate future iwu and by extension the local water stress for extremely dry years note that discussions above are mainly based on one possible cropping pattern scenario clearly it is difficult if possible to include all the possible cropping patterns and distribution scenarios relative to the baseline remaining current crop types and distributions the upper bound of iwu water saving potential is to use crop types with the lowest k c values this extreme case is shown in supplementary fig s7 despite the expected absolute differences in the irrigation water saving potential these results are qualitatively consistent with fig 7 therefore fig 7 and fig 8 are representative of the general benefit of cropping pattern adjustments for future irrigation water saving finally previous studies show that k c decreases with increased co2 shimono et al 2013 kumar et al 2017 however a robust relationship between k c and co2 is currently unavailable therefore the potential long term decreasing trends of future k c are not considered in our analysis such crop responses to co2 may further highlight the importance of plant physiology to accurately quantify future iwu trends and variations 5 limitations our analyses demonstrate that co2 impacts on potential et see eq 2 and yang et al 2019 are crucial for quantifying future iwu changes under elevated co2 conditions specifically increased co2 tends to increase water use efficiency and reduce potential et the uncertainty of co2 impacts on potential et proposed by yang et al 2019 is tested which yields qualitatively consistent results supplementary fig s3 fig s5 and fig s6 these results suggest the general robustness of our conclusions however the uncertainty ranges of future iwu can be higher than our estimates when complex crop physiological responses and human adaption strategies to elevated co2 are considered additionally the study area is dominated by a semi arid climate and has strong inter annual precipitation variability the cmip6 precipitation can be an order of magnitude higher than observations and has strong inter model variabilities therefore an iwu uncertainty range of 34 remains in cmip6 projections even after bias correction however it should be noted that 87 5 of the eight esms are consistent in the sign of projected iwu trends therefore although the absolute iwu projections are uncertain our findings are qualitatively robust finally this study only focuses on water saving instead of water productivity this means that the water saving strategies via crop mixing pattern change may reduce grain yields however future chinese population is likely to decrease chen et al 2020 therefore future food security is less a concern than water stress in some extreme cases regional water saving can be also achieved by simply reducing irrigated agriculture these scenarios are not considered in our analysis but are unlikely to change our conclusions that adjusting crop patterns or land cover can significantly alleviate future local water stress 6 conclusion at the global scale most of the fresh water is consumed by irrigation and increases in iwu may intensify local water stress particularly in arid and semi arid regions however future iwu changes under elevated co2 conditions remain unclear here we use a physically based framework to investigate future climate change impacts on iwu our analysis demonstrates contrast iwu trends under different co2 emission scenarios as for the medium emission scenario ssp245 a strong positive iwu trend is observed during the 2021 2100 period this is because elevated co2 increases air temperature which in turn enhances local atmospheric evaporation demand and iwu in contrast future iwu over the zhangye region decreases under the high emission scenario ssp585 this is because the projected precipitation over the study area is slightly increased under this scenario additionally the strongly increased co2 levels will also substantially increase crop water use efficiency these two factors eventually led to a declining trend of iwu under the ssp585 scenario in addition we also demonstrate that cropping pattern adjustments i e replacing high iwu demand crops with low iwu ones can significantly reduce future iwu trends and 95th percentiles for both ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios therefore adjusting the crop types can significantly alleviate future local water stress particularly during drought years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
