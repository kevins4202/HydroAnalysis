23400,this paper deals with the numerical simulation of low reynolds number flow around a freely vibrating circular cylinder in two degrees of freedom the governing equations are written in a non inertial system fixed to the moving cylinder and solved using finite difference method the natural frequency of the cylinder is chosen to be constant agreeing with the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder at reynolds number re0 systematic computations are carried out for re0 80 100 140 and 180 keeping the mass ratio and structural damping coefficient at m 10 and ζ 0 the effect of re0 on the root mean square rms values of cylinder displacements and drag coefficients is analyzed plotting the data set belonging to different re0 values against u st0 makes comparison easier local extreme values are found in the rms of streamwise displacement and drag coefficient in the range u st0 0 4 0 65 in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 the rms of drag approaches zero and the phase angle between the x component of the motion and drag changes abruptly from 0 to 180 the pressure drag coefficient seems to be responsible for the sudden change the cylinder follows a distorted figure eight path in

a stationary cylinder re0 st0 1 introduction flow around a circular cylinder is extensively studied due to its practical importance using both experimental and numerical approaches the flows are usually classified using reynolds number based on free stream velocity u cylinder diameter d and fluid viscosity ν for stationary cylinders the flow is steady below re 47 and twin vortices are attached to the body at around re 47 hopf bifurcation occurs resulting in an unsteady flow of periodic vortex shedding thompson and le gal 2004 risers pipes and underwater structures are good examples of this phenomenon periodic vortex shedding from the body can induce high amplitude oscillations which can cause serious damage to the structure this phenomenon played an important role in the collapse of tacoma narrows bridge in 1940 damage to thermometer cases at the monju fast breeder nuclear power plant in 1995 leading to a major shutdown of the entire facility was also due to periodic vortex shedding nishihara et al 2005 on the other hand mechanical energy transferred between the fluid and the moving body can also be beneficial possibilities of energy harvesting have been studied e g by bernitsas et al 2008 2009 and mehmood et al 2013 barkley and henderson 1996 applying linear stability analysis showed that the flow around a stationary cylinder is two dimensional 2d up to re 189 three dimensional 3d instability occurs at re 189 mode a and at re 259 mode b thus the application of a 2d computational code above re 189 is not justified for a stationary cylinder for vibrating cylinders however experiments by bearman and obasaju 1982 and koide et al 2002 and numerical simulations by poncet 2002 showed that synchronization or lock in between vortex shedding and cylinder motion increases the two dimensionality of the flow compared to the case of a stationary cylinder the upper limit of the two dimensionality has not been determined due to the large number of influencing parameters for the prediction of aerodynamic forces acting on a freely vibrating cylinder researchers often use a forced or controlled oscillation model this approach is a simplifying model and is often chosen because no equations need to be solved for the cylinder motion a large number of papers deal with forced oscillation in one degree of freedom 1dof cylinder motion where the cylinder is typically restricted to move only in transverse direction e g williamson and roshko 1988 lu and dalton 1996 meneghini and bearman 1997 kaiktsis et al 2007 baranyi and daróczy 2013 tang et al 2017 or in streamwise direction e g okajima et al 2004 al mdallal et al 2007 mureithi et al 2010 there are relatively few papers dealing with two degree of freedom 2dof forced motion e g jeon and gharib 2001 stansby and rainey 2001 baranyi 2008 peppa et al 2016 another approach to the investigation of vortex induced vibrations viv involves an elastically supported cylinder model where cylinder displacement is caused by lift and drag forces acting on the body a large number of studies have dealt with this model including bishop and hassan 1964 bearman 1984 2011 sarpkaya 1995 2004 jauvtis and williamson 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 blevins 1990 moe and wu 1990 and nakamura et al 2013 cylinder response is highly influenced by free stream velocity u natural frequency of the body f n structural damping b and the mass of the body m vibrations due to vortex shedding are often modeled with 1dof transverse only motion khalak and williamson 1999 investigated the viv of a transversely oscillating cylinder and showed that the mass damping parameter m ζ strongly influences the peak amplitude where m is the mass ratio the ratio of the mass of the vibrating body and that of the displaced fluid and ζ is the structural damping coefficient it was shown that at low m ζ three branches of cylinder response occur namely initial upper and lower branches where the upper branch is associated with the highest oscillation amplitude feng 1968 studied high mass damping cases where only two branches an initial branch with low cylinder displacements and lower branch with high vibration amplitudes are observed brika and laneville 1993 and govardhan and williamson 2000 distinguished between the different branches based on their vortex shedding modes the initial branch is associated with 2s mode two single vortices are shed in each motion cycle while 2p mode two vortex pairs shed in each motion cycle belongs to the lower and upper branches brika and laneville 1993 found that the transition between upper and lower branches is hysteretic and the flow is quite sensitive to incremental changes in the reduced velocity klamo et al 2006 investigated how the system transitions between two branch and three branch responses in their study reynolds number and the structural damping were varied it was concluded that m ζ alone is insufficient to predict the type of response reynolds number is also an important influencing parameter for small damping and high re cases a three branch response was observed while a two branch response was found for high damping and low re cases naturally structures are not restricted to move only in one direction in most cases two degrees of freedom 2dof oscillations are found jauvtis and williamson 2004 using an elastically supported cylinder kept the natural frequencies identical in the two directions f n x f n y f n and investigated a wide mass ratio range m 25 using an experimental approach it was found that at high m cases m 6 25 in line oscillation has only a tiny effect on transverse vibration which was also found by zhou et al 1999 at low reynolds numbers using numerical techniques jauvtis and williamson 2004 found that a three branch response occurs as in 1dof cylinder oscillation upon decreasing the mass ratio below m 6 dramatic changes were observed the existence of a super upper branch was reported where the vortex shedding mode was 2t type two triple vortices shed in each vibration period however in general the natural frequencies in streamwise and transverse directions are not identical f n x f n y sarpkaya 1995 experimentally investigated 2dof vortex induced vibrations varying the natural frequency ratio f nx f ny between 1 and 2 these results were compared with 1dof cylinder oscillation results for f nx f ny and a 19 increase was observed in the transverse oscillation amplitude in addition two obvious peaks were identified at f nx 2f ny dahl et al 2006 showed that by increasing the ratio of streamwise and transverse frequencies in the range of f nx f ny 1 1 9 the phase angle between x and y component of the motion decreases and the peak amplitude shifts to higher reduced velocities u u f n d where f n f ny is the transverse natural frequency sanchis 2009 extended the frequency ratio range where the natural frequency in transverse direction was greater than in streamwise direction f nx f ny 0 42 0 87 the amplitude and frequency responses were very similar to those for f nx f ny 1 the only difference was that the transition between upper and lower branch shifted from intermittency to lag kang et al 2016 investigated three different circular cylinders with distinct aspect ratios l d 6 10 91 and 24 it was shown that with high aspect ratios l d 24 different moving trajectories occur d shaped egg shaped raindrop shaped and figure eight but with sufficiently low aspect ratios such as l d 6 only figure eight or rather distorted figure eight motion is found most of the experimental studies are carried out at the medium range of reynolds numbers re 103 104 numerical studies at this regime are very limited because of the high computational cost therefore most computations are carried out for low re govardhan and williamson 2006 and klamo et al 2006 showed that besides the mass ratio and structural damping reynolds number also strongly influences the oscillation amplitude and fluid forces although reynolds number and reduced velocity are not completely independent variables it is convenient to investigate their effect separately leontini et al 2006 investigated numerically the branching behavior of viv at re 200 with m 10 and ζ 0 01 for transverse only cylinder motion a two branch response was shown where the vortex shedding mode was 2s in all cases investigated at the reduced velocity range of u 4 7 6 4 large amplitude oscillation occurs where positive and negative vortices coalesce using the notations introduced by williamson and roshko 1988 this vortex configuration is referred to as c 2s mode singh and mittal 2005 carried out two sets of computations for 2dof cylinder motion 1 at re 100 with varying u and 2 at u 4 92 and varying re a two branch cylinder response was identified with the maximum dimensionless transverse oscillation amplitude of y 0max 0 6 in the first set of computations 2s vortex configuration was observed for high amplitude transverse oscillations c 2s mode was presented similar to the results obtained by leontini et al 2006 the transition at the lower and higher end of the flow is hysteretic this was also found by brika and laneville 1993 at medium reynolds numbers for transverse only motion in the second case investigated by singh and mittal 2005 when the reduced velocity was fixed at u 4 92 and reynolds number was varied 2s mode was observed below re 300 and p s mode above re 300 there are a few numerical studies dealing with constant natural frequencies in this case a linear function exists between reynolds number and reduced velocity re ku where k f n d 2 ν willden and graham 2006 carried out a numerical study for re 20u in which the body was restricted to move only in transverse direction the flow characteristics are investigated for five different mass ratios of m 1 2 5 10 50 primary secondary and tertiary responses were identified the primary response occurred around lock in which is always associated with vortex induced vibration the secondary response is found to occur only for high mass ratios m 5 and in the tertiary response regime an approximately constant oscillation amplitude can be maintained bahmani and akbari 2010 investigated numerically the separate effects of mass ratio and structural damping for re 17 9u considering 1dof cylinder motion it was found that increasing m or ζ has almost the same effect both the oscillation amplitude and the size of the lock in domain decrease in the following numerical studies carried out for 2dof cylinder motion the natural frequencies in both streamwise and transverse direction are identical f nx f ny f n const prasanth et al 2006 carried out two sets of computations 1 at fixed u 4 92 with varying re and 2 with constant natural frequencies where both reynolds number and reduced velocity was varied using re 16 6u hysteretic loops were also found at the lower and higher end of lock in it was shown that by reducing the blockage ratio b the ratio of cylinder diameter and the height of the computational domain to b 1 hysteresis loops disappear prasanth and mittal 2008 investigated additional blockage ratios using re 16 6u and concluded that as the blockage is reduced the size of hysteresis loops decreases and hysteresis completely disappears at b 2 5 the phase shift between lift coefficient and transverse cylinder displacement jumps abruptly from 0 to 180 at re 110 decomposing the total lift into two components of pressure lift and viscous lift the authors concluded that the jump is caused by the pressure lift since the viscous lift remains in phase with the cylinder motion in all of the investigated re cases mittal and singh 2005 investigated mainly subcritical reynolds numbers re 47 where re was varied with the reduced velocity re 3 1875u they found that self excited motion occurs as low as re 20 which is a steady state regime for a stationary cylinder at low mass ratio m 4 73 the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency st does not agree with reduced natural frequency which was observed also by williamson and govardhan 2004 however when increasing the mass ratio to m 50 st and f n curves almost overlap at re 33 f n is approximately identical to st and the oscillation amplitude was low compared to the re 25 case where f n st and the vibration amplitude was high the reason is that at re 33 the lift force and transverse displacement are in antiphase therefore the energy transferred between the moving cylinder and the fluid is low compared to that of the re 25 case where lift and transverse displacement are in phase meaning that the mechanical energy transfer is higher the present numerical study deals with low reynolds number flow around a circular cylinder free to vibrate in both streamwise and transverse directions the mass ratio is fixed at m 10 and the structural damping coefficient is set to zero as can be seen from the literature review only low natural frequency values have been investigated for 1dof and 2dof free vibrations the coefficient between reynolds number and reduced velocity k is in the range of 3 20 only systematic computations are carried out for constant natural frequencies agreeing with the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder at the reynolds number of re0 to the best knowledge of the authors most of the articles investigating the 2dof cylinder motion are dealing with re0 100 and systematic computations analyzing the effect of re0 have not yet been carried out the aim of this paper is to expand the re0 and with this the natural frequency domain by investigating the flow characteristics at re0 80 100 140 and 180 cylinder response aerodynamic force coefficients cylinder path and phase angle between the x component of the motion and the total drag pressure drag and viscous drag coefficients are investigated in this study the outline of the current paper is as follows in section 2 the governing equations the boundary and initial conditions are introduced and the computational methodology are presented in section 3 first the independence studies are detailed and then the results obtained here are compared with those in the literature finally section 4 shows the new computational results and in section 5 conclusions are drawn 2 governing equations and computational method in this study two dimensional constant property incompressible newtonian fluid flow around a circular cylinder undergoing two degree of freedom 2dof free vibration is investigated the non dimensional governing equations for this problem are the two components of the navier stokes equations written in a non inertial system fixed to the moving cylinder the continuity equation and the pressure poisson equation these equations in primitive variables are written as follows 1 u t u u x v u y p x 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 d 2 x 0 d t 2 2 v t u v x v v y p y 1 re 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 d 2 y 0 d t 2 3 d u x v y 0 4 2 p 2 u x v y u y v x d t in these equations u v are the non dimensional velocity components in x and y directions t is the non dimensional time p is the dimensionless pressure d2 x 0 dt 2 and d2 y 0 dt 2 are the non dimensional streamwise and transverse acceleration components of the cylinder and d is the dilation in eqs 1 and 2 re u d ν is the reynolds number where u is the free stream velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid although dilation is zero for incompressible fluids in eq 4 d t is kept to avoid numerical inaccuracies harlow and welch 1965 fig 1 shows the layout of the computations the figure shows a circular cylinder with a dimensionless radius r 1 and with mass per unit length m placed into a uniform free stream with velocity u the outer boundary of the physical domain where the flow is assumed to be undisturbed is represented by dimensionless radius r 2 the rigid cylinder is elastically supported in both streamwise and transverse directions in this study springs are supposed to be linear and the spring constants are chosen to be identical in the two directions k x k y k as are the damping values b x b y b the non dimensional structural equations that are used to determine the cylinder displacements x 0 y 0 khalak and williamson 1999 are written as follows 5 x 0 4 π ζ u x 0 2 π u 2 x 0 2 c d t π m 6 y 0 4 π ζ u y 0 2 π u 2 y 0 2 c l t π m where dots and double dots mean first and second time derivatives in these equations x 0 x 0 x 0 are the dimensionless streamwise displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylinder respectively and y 0 y 0 y 0 are the same quantities for the transverse direction in eqs 5 and 6 m 4 m d 2 π ρ is the mass ratio where ρ is the fluid density u u f n d is the reduced velocity where f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder and ζ b 2 k m is the structural damping coefficient the lift and drag coefficients are defined as 8 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 d c d 2 f d ρ u 2 d where f l and f d are the dimensional lift and drag forces per unit length which are computed from the pressure and shear stress distributions on the cylinder surface therefore c l and c d can be divided into two parts 9 c l c l p c l v c d c d p c d v where subscripts p and v refer to pressure and viscous parts respectively the boundary conditions are written as follows cylinder surface r 1 10 u v 0 11 p n 1 re 2 v n x 0 n y 0 n outer surface r 2 12 u u p o t x 0 v v p o t y 0 13 p n p n p o t 0 where subscript n refers to the outer normal of the circular cylinder on the cylinder surface r r 1 no slip boundary conditions are applied to the two velocity components u v and neumann type boundary condition is used for pressure p potential flow referred to as subscript pot in eq 13 is assumed in the far field r 2 160r 1 it has been shown that this simplification causes only a small distortion in the velocity fields baranyi 2008 posdziech and grundmann 2007 initial conditions for the cylinder displacement and velocity are chosen to be 14 x 0 t 0 y 0 t 0 0 x 0 t 0 y 0 t 0 0 potential flow is assumed around the cylinder at t 0 hence force coefficients are c d t 0 c l t 0 0 which combined with eqs 5 6 and 14 yields zero initial cylinder acceleration x 0 t 0 y 0 t 0 0 in this study boundary fitted coordinates are used in order to impose boundary conditions accurately the physical domain is mapped into a rectangular computational domain see fig 2 applying linear mapping functions baranyi 2008 due to the properties of the mapping functions the computational grid on the physical domain is very fine in the vicinity of the cylinder and coarse in the far field but the grid is equidistant in the computational domain the transformed governing equations with the transformed boundary and initial conditions are solved using an in house code based on the finite difference method baranyi 2008 space derivatives are approximated using fourth order difference schemes except for the convective terms where third order modified upwind difference scheme was applied kawamura et al 1986 the equations of motion and structural equations are integrated explicitly pressure poisson equation is solved using successive over relaxation sor method and the continuity equation is satisfied in each time step 3 validation procedure in this section results of independence studies used to determine the optimal combination of computational parameters are shown using this set of parameters the obtained stationary and elastically supported cylinder results are compared with those available in the literature 3 1 independence studies radius ratio r 2 r 1 grid resolution ξ max η max grid points in the peripheral and radial direction respectively and dimensionless time step δt characterize the computational setup independence studies have to be carried out in order to find the optimal combination of the parameters which is the best compromise between high accuracy and computational cost during these investigations reynolds number and reduced velocity are set to be constant values re 150 and u 5 8837 root mean square rms values of the dimensionless streamwise transverse displacements and lift and drag coefficients are presented for investigating the effect of the radius ratio the number of grid points around the cylinder surface is fixed at ξ max 360 and the dimensionless time step is kept at δt 0 0005 three radius ratio values are considered r 2 r 1 120 160 and 200 in order to make the grid equidistant in the computational domain the number of grid points in the radial direction belonging to the three radius ratio values are chosen to be η max 274 291 and 304 the results are given in table 1 the relative difference between x 0rms y 0rms c drms obtained from the results for r 2 r 1 120 and those for r 2 r 1 200 is less than 0 7 however the relative difference between the values at the radius ratio r 2 r 1 160 and 200 decreases to 0 15 or below c lrms shows higher differences but the corresponding value is less than 1 for r 2 r 1 160 and 200 hence the radius ratio of 160 seems to be appropriate for the computations for the investigation of grid independence the number of peripheral points is chosen to be ξ max 300 360 and 420 while the radius ratio and dimensionless time step are fixed at r 2 r 1 160 and δt 0 0005 respectively in order to generate an equidistant grid on the computational domain η max is chosen to be η max 242 291 and 339 results are shown in table 2 the highest relative differences are observed in c lrms 0 65 and 0 18 between the results for ξ max 300 and 420 and for 360 and 420 respectively in the values of x 0rms and c drms the relative difference for ξ max 300 and 420 is approximately 0 32 which decreases to 0 09 for ξ max 360 and 420 y 0rms shows the least relative differences which are 0 15 and 0 04 for the coarsest and the medium grid resolution respectively see table 2 thus ξ m a x 360 is chosen for further computations finally the effect of dimensionless time step is studied the grid and radius ratio are fixed at 360 291 and r 2 r 1 160 respectively for this investigation computations are carried out for the dimensionless time step values of 0 001 δt 1 0 0005 δt 2 and 0 00025 δt 3 here also c lrms shows the highest relative differences 1 4 for δt 1 and δt 3 and 0 5 for δt 2 and δt 3 see table 3 in the values of x 0rms and c drms the corresponding difference is around 0 3 for δt 1 and 0 09 for δt 2 as was observed in the grid dependence study the relative difference is the least for y 0rms 0 1 for δt 1 and 0 03 for δt 2 thus the time step value of δt 0 0005 seems to be adequate for further computations 3 2 code validation for stationary and elastically supported cylinders the in house code applied for the computations has been extensively tested in order to prove its accuracy see e g baranyi 2008 for further testing first the flow around a stationary cylinder is investigated reynolds number was varied in the range of re 80 180 where the flow is two dimensional barkley and henderson 1996 and periodic vortex shedding occurs in fig 3 a rms values of lift coefficient c lrms are shown against re good agreement is found between our results and those of baranyi and lewis 2006 and golani and dhiman 2014 the variation of strouhal number st0 which is the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder is shown in fig 3b as can be seen the current results compare well with the numerical studies of silva et al 2003 baranyi and lewis 2006 and posdziech and grundmann 2007 and with the experimental studies of norberg 2003 computational results for a freely vibrating cylinder in 2dof are shown in fig 4 prasanth and mittal 2008 and he and zhang 2016 carried out computations where the natural frequency was kept at a constant value which agreed with the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder at reynolds number re0 100 in this case the relationship between re and u is re 16 6u the mass ratio was fixed at m 10 and the structural damping coefficient was set to zero ζ 0 in fig 4 rms values of transverse and streamwise displacements are shown against re the agreement between the current results and those obtained by prasanth and mittal 2008 and he and zhang 2016 is excellent except for the lower and higher threshold of flow synchronization at the vicinity of re 90 and 130 the flow is very sensitive to changes in the reynolds number and also in the reduced velocity which explains the higher discrepancies between the results reassuringly 2s vortex shedding mode occurs for low transverse oscillation amplitude cases e g at the initial branch and c 2s mode of vortex shedding is observed for high transverse cylinder displacements similar to results obtained by prasanth and mittal 2008 and he and zhang 2016 4 results and discussion in this study flow around a circular cylinder undergoing two degrees of freedom free vibration is investigated the mass ratio is fixed at m 10 and the structural damping is chosen to be zero ζ 0 to ensure high amplitude cylinder displacement as mentioned in section 1 reynolds number and reduced velocity are not independent parameters if the natural frequency of the oscillating cylinder f n is constant the relationship between re and u is linear re ku where k f n d 2 ν const mittal and singh 2005 assuming that the reduced natural frequency f n 1 u is identical to the strouhal number for a stationary cylinder st0 at reynolds number re0 k can be determined as k re0 st0 it was found in the literature review that earlier investigations had been limited to low natural frequency values for 2dof motion only re0 100 was investigated prasanth and mittal 2008 in order to fill this gap systematic computations are carried out for four different re0 values st0 re0 and the computed k values are given in table 4 4 1 cylinder response and aerodynamic force coefficients the root mean square rms values of the transverse cylinder displacement y 0rms for the investigated re0 are shown in fig 5 as can be seen the cylinder response for a given re0 value consists of three different regimes at the initial branch the cylinder oscillation amplitude is low in both streamwise and transverse directions and the transverse vibration frequency f y is approximately equal to the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder st0 in fig 6 the variation of st0 f n and f y is shown for re0 140 where f y st0 at the initial branch can be clearly seen with increasing re and u cylinder response switches to the lower branch where the oscillation frequency synchronizes with the natural frequency of the cylinder resulting in high amplitude oscillations beyond the lock in domain the oscillation amplitude becomes small again and f y locks in to st0 as was observed in the initial branch the reynolds number range in which the oscillation frequency synchronizes with the natural frequency i e lock in strongly depends on re0 see fig 5 therefore comparison of data is difficult khalak and williamson 1999 showed that the cylinder responses for different mass damping parameters m ζ can collapse into a single curve by using true reduced velocity u f where f is the ratio of the transverse oscillation frequency and the natural frequency of the cylinder as an independent variable instead of reduced velocity due to ζ 0 mass damping parameter is zero in all the cases investigated in this study singh and mittal 2005 used u st0 as an independent variable for the cases where either re or u was kept constant using the definitions of reduced velocity and strouhal number it can be seen that u st0 is the ratio of the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder f v and the natural frequency of the oscillating body f n u st 0 u f n d f v d u f v f n to the best knowledge of the authors u st0 has not previously been applied as an independent variable for constant natural frequency cases however it can be seen in fig 7 that by plotting y 0rms against u st0 the curves belonging to different re0 values can be represented in the same range strouhal number values in the range of re 50 250 are obtained from posdziech and grundmann 2007 as can be seen in fig 7 the curves shift to higher y 0rms with increasing re0 a larger difference in y 0rms values is found between re0 80 and 100 than between re0 140 180 it can also be seen that the lower branch is significantly wider for lower re0 values previous researchers e g prasanth and mittal 2008 showed that in the transition between the initial and the lower branch where the oscillation amplitude varies strongly the flow is chaotic the width of this transition range also depends on re0 in the case of re0 80 and 100 y 0rms jumps abruptly between the two branches in contrast to re0 140 and 180 where the rms value of the transverse vibration component changes gradually in fig 8 the rms of lift coefficient c lrms is plotted against u st0 it can be seen that in the initial branch and beyond the lower branch c lrms shifts to higher values with increasing re0 besides at the transition regime between initial and lower branches c lrms increases significantly up to a peak value which increases with re0 in the lower branch c lrms drops to a near zero value in figs 9 and 10 the rms value of the streamwise displacement x 0rms and drag coefficient c drms are shown against u st0 as expected the amplitude of oscillation in streamwise direction is significantly smaller than that in transverse direction similar characteristics are observed as were seen for y 0rms in fig 7 the curves belonging to increasing re0 shift to higher values for both x 0rms and c drms on the other hand the rms values of streamwise cylinder displacement show an increase in the range of u st0 0 4 0 65 which becomes more significant for higher re0 see fig 9 c drms shows similar behavior fig 10 but the difference is less than that observed in x 0rms note that this phenomenon is not observed for re0 80 because the flow is steady below u st0 0 5 in fig 11 the domain u st0 0 4 0 65 is shown at higher resolution it can be seen that x 0rms increases continuously until it reaches its local maximum value at around u st0 0 47 see fig 11a as expected with decreasing re0 the peak value diminishes and almost disappears at re0 100 in addition to the peak a local minimum point is identified for c drms at u st0 0 5 where it approaches zero see fig 11b after the local minimum point c drms starts to increase with the slope of the curve increasing with re0 to check the significance of the local maximum values of x 0rms and c drms and local minimum values of c drms the domain u st0 0 4 0 65 is further investigated 4 2 investigating the vicinity of u st0 0 5 in order to investigate the significance of local maximum points identified in x 0rms and c drms and local minimum point found in c drms the phase angle φ between x 0 and c d is computed fig 12 shows c drms against u st0 for re0 180 fig 12c and time histories of drag coefficient and streamwise cylinder displacement fig 12a b d e for different u st0 values it can be seen in the figure that there is an irregular change in the phase difference between x 0 and c d at around u st0 0 5 at u st0 0 5 x 0 and c d are in phase so the phase angle between the signals is φ 0 and in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 when c drms approaches zero the phase angle jumps to φ 180 the phase angle φ computed using hilbert transformation is shown in fig 13 against u st0 for the investigated re0 values the jump in the phase between 0 and 180 can be clearly seen the total drag coefficient is composed of two parts one is due to pressure c dp and another part originating from friction on the cylinder wall c dv as stated by eq 9 the rms values of c dp and c dv in the range u st0 0 4 0 65 show different behaviors as can be seen in fig 14 although both quantities have maximum and minimum values in this range the variation of c dprms is similar to c drms fig 11b while the change in c dvrms is similar to the characteristics of x 0rms fig 11a for this reason φ v phase angle between c dv and x 0 and φ p phase angle between c dp and x 0 are computed and shown for the investigated re0 values in fig 15 as expected the changes in φ v and φ p are different in the range of u st0 0 4 0 5 there is a φ v 35 phase shift between c dv and x 0 after this period φ v changes gradually until it reaches approximately 180 see fig 15b in contrast c dp and x 0 are approximately in phase between u st0 0 4 and 0 5 while in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 the phase angle changes abruptly to φ p 180 see fig 15a the tendencies of φ p and φ are very similar see figs 15a and 13 therefore pressure distribution around the cylinder surface influences the flow structure more strongly than friction does this behavior is similar to that observed by prasanth and mittal 2008 for re0 100 who found an abrupt jump in the phase between the lift coefficient and transverse displacement from φ 0 180 between re 110 and 115 decomposing lift into pressure lift c lp and viscous lift c lv they showed that the pressure component is responsible for the jump since the viscous component remains in phase with the displacement in fig 16 limit cycle curves time histories of viscous drag versus those of pressure drag are shown for the vicinity of u st0 0 5 for re0 140 it can be seen that below u st0 0 4904 the orientation of the curves is clockwise indicated by filled arrows see fig 16 at u st0 0 4904 the orientation switches abruptly to counterclockwise direction shown by empty arrows in fig 16 which means that pressure and viscous drag become nearly antiphase this substantial change is mainly caused by pressure drag since φ v increases gradually in this regime fig 15b in contrast to φ p which jumps abruptly between φ p 0 and 180 at around u st0 0 5 fig 15a the amplitudes of signals c dp and c dv not shown here are almost identical in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 these two features antiphase and equal signal amplitudes nearly cancel each other out resulting in an approximately zero value of c drms shown in fig 11b the abrupt change in the limit cycle curves shown in fig 16 suggests that the path of the cylinder also changes strongly in this domain fig 17 shows the power spectra fft of the x and y components of the cylinder displacement for u st0 0 9246 and re0 180 the intensity value i on the vertical axis is normalized by its maximum value i max it can be seen in the figure that the vibration frequency in the streamwise direction is double that in the transverse direction f x 2 f y which is true for all of the investigated cases except in the chaotic flow regime these peak values result in a distorted figure eight or lissajous curve cylinder path that can be written mathematically as follows 15 x 0 t x 0 m a x cos 4 π f y t θ 16 y 0 t y 0 m a x sin 2 π f y t where θ is the phase angle between x and y vibration components phase angle θ determines both the shape and the orientation of the moving trajectory in case of θ 0 the orbit is clockwise cw in the upper loop of the cylinder path while with θ 0 values counterclockwise ccw cylinder paths are obtained eqs 15 and 16 do not satisfy in the transition regime between initial and lower branches where the cylinder motion is not quasi periodic in fig 18 the direction of cylinder orbit is shown for cw filled arrows and ccw empty arrows for the intersection of a distorted figure eight path phase angles between the two oscillation components are computed and plotted against u st0 for the investigated re0 values in fig 19 it can be seen that cw cylinder motion occurs in the approximate range of u st0 0 4 0 5 and ccw orbits are found above u st0 0 5 it is obvious from the figure that θ varies strongly at the vicinity of u st0 0 5 in fig 20 cylinder trajectories are shown for various u st0 values for re0 180 it can be seen that by increasing u st0 the phase angle sharply decreases approaching zero at u st0 0 487 at the same value at which the local minimum value was identified in c drms see also fig 11b 5 conclusions the present study deals with the numerical simulation of low reynolds number flow around an elastically supported circular cylinder free to move in two directions the mass ratio is fixed at m 10 and the structural damping coefficient is set to zero the natural frequency of the structure f n is kept at a constant value agreeing with the vortex shedding frequency from a stationary cylinder at reynolds numbers re0 80 100 140 and 180 in order to keep f n constant both re and reduced velocity u are varied the main findings are as follows a two branch cylinder response is observed similarly to the previously published numerical and experimental results for low reynolds number flows the reynolds number range where synchronization or lock in takes place strongly depends on re0 making comparison of results belonging to different natural frequencies more difficult by plotting the results belonging to different re0 against u st0 the data series can be represented in the same range making comparison easier with increasing re0 the root mean square rms values of cylinder displacement and drag coefficient shift to higher values and the lock in domain becomes narrower in the initial branch local extreme values are observed in the rms of streamwise displacement x 0rms maximum and drag coefficient c drms maximum and minimum in the range of u st0 0 4 0 65 at u st0 0 5 c drms approaches zero at this point the phase angle between streamwise displacement and drag coefficient changes abruptly from 0 to 180 from in phase to antiphase phase angles between the x component of the cylinder motion and pressure and viscous drag coefficients φ p and φ v are also computed although φ p shows a sudden shift between 0 and 180 φ v gradually varies between φ v 35 and 180 this result indicates that pressure drag may be responsible for the abrupt phase change and switch in orientation of the cylinder path due to the abrupt change in φ p the limit cycle curves c dv c dp switch from clockwise to anticlockwise orientation in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 the cylinder follows a distorted figure eight path in all of the investigated cases except within the chaotic flow regime the phase angle between x and y components of the motion is computed and used to identify the orientation of the path it is found that at u st0 0 5 the orientation of the cylinder path changes from a clockwise to a counterclockwise orbit it is seen from the current study that higher re0 values cause noticeable changes in x 0rms and c drms we plan to investigate the effect of mass ratio at the range of m 0 1 25 on the cylinder response for higher re0 values re0 180 acknowledgements

23400,this paper deals with the numerical simulation of low reynolds number flow around a freely vibrating circular cylinder in two degrees of freedom the governing equations are written in a non inertial system fixed to the moving cylinder and solved using finite difference method the natural frequency of the cylinder is chosen to be constant agreeing with the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder at reynolds number re0 systematic computations are carried out for re0 80 100 140 and 180 keeping the mass ratio and structural damping coefficient at m 10 and ζ 0 the effect of re0 on the root mean square rms values of cylinder displacements and drag coefficients is analyzed plotting the data set belonging to different re0 values against u st0 makes comparison easier local extreme values are found in the rms of streamwise displacement and drag coefficient in the range u st0 0 4 0 65 in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 the rms of drag approaches zero and the phase angle between the x component of the motion and drag changes abruptly from 0 to 180 the pressure drag coefficient seems to be responsible for the sudden change the cylinder follows a distorted figure eight path in

a stationary cylinder re0 st0 1 introduction flow around a circular cylinder is extensively studied due to its practical importance using both experimental and numerical approaches the flows are usually classified using reynolds number based on free stream velocity u cylinder diameter d and fluid viscosity ν for stationary cylinders the flow is steady below re 47 and twin vortices are attached to the body at around re 47 hopf bifurcation occurs resulting in an unsteady flow of periodic vortex shedding thompson and le gal 2004 risers pipes and underwater structures are good examples of this phenomenon periodic vortex shedding from the body can induce high amplitude oscillations which can cause serious damage to the structure this phenomenon played an important role in the collapse of tacoma narrows bridge in 1940 damage to thermometer cases at the monju fast breeder nuclear power plant in 1995 leading to a major shutdown of the entire facility was also due to periodic vortex shedding nishihara et al 2005 on the other hand mechanical energy transferred between the fluid and the moving body can also be beneficial possibilities of energy harvesting have been studied e g by bernitsas et al 2008 2009 and mehmood et al 2013 barkley and henderson 1996 applying linear stability analysis showed that the flow around a stationary cylinder is two dimensional 2d up to re 189 three dimensional 3d instability occurs at re 189 mode a and at re 259 mode b thus the application of a 2d computational code above re 189 is not justified for a stationary cylinder for vibrating cylinders however experiments by bearman and obasaju 1982 and koide et al 2002 and numerical simulations by poncet 2002 showed that synchronization or lock in between vortex shedding and cylinder motion increases the two dimensionality of the flow compared to the case of a stationary cylinder the upper limit of the two dimensionality has not been determined due to the large number of influencing parameters for the prediction of aerodynamic forces acting on a freely vibrating cylinder researchers often use a forced or controlled oscillation model this approach is a simplifying model and is often chosen because no equations need to be solved for the cylinder motion a large number of papers deal with forced oscillation in one degree of freedom 1dof cylinder motion where the cylinder is typically restricted to move only in transverse direction e g williamson and roshko 1988 lu and dalton 1996 meneghini and bearman 1997 kaiktsis et al 2007 baranyi and daróczy 2013 tang et al 2017 or in streamwise direction e g okajima et al 2004 al mdallal et al 2007 mureithi et al 2010 there are relatively few papers dealing with two degree of freedom 2dof forced motion e g jeon and gharib 2001 stansby and rainey 2001 baranyi 2008 peppa et al 2016 another approach to the investigation of vortex induced vibrations viv involves an elastically supported cylinder model where cylinder displacement is caused by lift and drag forces acting on the body a large number of studies have dealt with this model including bishop and hassan 1964 bearman 1984 2011 sarpkaya 1995 2004 jauvtis and williamson 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 blevins 1990 moe and wu 1990 and nakamura et al 2013 cylinder response is highly influenced by free stream velocity u natural frequency of the body f n structural damping b and the mass of the body m vibrations due to vortex shedding are often modeled with 1dof transverse only motion khalak and williamson 1999 investigated the viv of a transversely oscillating cylinder and showed that the mass damping parameter m ζ strongly influences the peak amplitude where m is the mass ratio the ratio of the mass of the vibrating body and that of the displaced fluid and ζ is the structural damping coefficient it was shown that at low m ζ three branches of cylinder response occur namely initial upper and lower branches where the upper branch is associated with the highest oscillation amplitude feng 1968 studied high mass damping cases where only two branches an initial branch with low cylinder displacements and lower branch with high vibration amplitudes are observed brika and laneville 1993 and govardhan and williamson 2000 distinguished between the different branches based on their vortex shedding modes the initial branch is associated with 2s mode two single vortices are shed in each motion cycle while 2p mode two vortex pairs shed in each motion cycle belongs to the lower and upper branches brika and laneville 1993 found that the transition between upper and lower branches is hysteretic and the flow is quite sensitive to incremental changes in the reduced velocity klamo et al 2006 investigated how the system transitions between two branch and three branch responses in their study reynolds number and the structural damping were varied it was concluded that m ζ alone is insufficient to predict the type of response reynolds number is also an important influencing parameter for small damping and high re cases a three branch response was observed while a two branch response was found for high damping and low re cases naturally structures are not restricted to move only in one direction in most cases two degrees of freedom 2dof oscillations are found jauvtis and williamson 2004 using an elastically supported cylinder kept the natural frequencies identical in the two directions f n x f n y f n and investigated a wide mass ratio range m 25 using an experimental approach it was found that at high m cases m 6 25 in line oscillation has only a tiny effect on transverse vibration which was also found by zhou et al 1999 at low reynolds numbers using numerical techniques jauvtis and williamson 2004 found that a three branch response occurs as in 1dof cylinder oscillation upon decreasing the mass ratio below m 6 dramatic changes were observed the existence of a super upper branch was reported where the vortex shedding mode was 2t type two triple vortices shed in each vibration period however in general the natural frequencies in streamwise and transverse directions are not identical f n x f n y sarpkaya 1995 experimentally investigated 2dof vortex induced vibrations varying the natural frequency ratio f nx f ny between 1 and 2 these results were compared with 1dof cylinder oscillation results for f nx f ny and a 19 increase was observed in the transverse oscillation amplitude in addition two obvious peaks were identified at f nx 2f ny dahl et al 2006 showed that by increasing the ratio of streamwise and transverse frequencies in the range of f nx f ny 1 1 9 the phase angle between x and y component of the motion decreases and the peak amplitude shifts to higher reduced velocities u u f n d where f n f ny is the transverse natural frequency sanchis 2009 extended the frequency ratio range where the natural frequency in transverse direction was greater than in streamwise direction f nx f ny 0 42 0 87 the amplitude and frequency responses were very similar to those for f nx f ny 1 the only difference was that the transition between upper and lower branch shifted from intermittency to lag kang et al 2016 investigated three different circular cylinders with distinct aspect ratios l d 6 10 91 and 24 it was shown that with high aspect ratios l d 24 different moving trajectories occur d shaped egg shaped raindrop shaped and figure eight but with sufficiently low aspect ratios such as l d 6 only figure eight or rather distorted figure eight motion is found most of the experimental studies are carried out at the medium range of reynolds numbers re 103 104 numerical studies at this regime are very limited because of the high computational cost therefore most computations are carried out for low re govardhan and williamson 2006 and klamo et al 2006 showed that besides the mass ratio and structural damping reynolds number also strongly influences the oscillation amplitude and fluid forces although reynolds number and reduced velocity are not completely independent variables it is convenient to investigate their effect separately leontini et al 2006 investigated numerically the branching behavior of viv at re 200 with m 10 and ζ 0 01 for transverse only cylinder motion a two branch response was shown where the vortex shedding mode was 2s in all cases investigated at the reduced velocity range of u 4 7 6 4 large amplitude oscillation occurs where positive and negative vortices coalesce using the notations introduced by williamson and roshko 1988 this vortex configuration is referred to as c 2s mode singh and mittal 2005 carried out two sets of computations for 2dof cylinder motion 1 at re 100 with varying u and 2 at u 4 92 and varying re a two branch cylinder response was identified with the maximum dimensionless transverse oscillation amplitude of y 0max 0 6 in the first set of computations 2s vortex configuration was observed for high amplitude transverse oscillations c 2s mode was presented similar to the results obtained by leontini et al 2006 the transition at the lower and higher end of the flow is hysteretic this was also found by brika and laneville 1993 at medium reynolds numbers for transverse only motion in the second case investigated by singh and mittal 2005 when the reduced velocity was fixed at u 4 92 and reynolds number was varied 2s mode was observed below re 300 and p s mode above re 300 there are a few numerical studies dealing with constant natural frequencies in this case a linear function exists between reynolds number and reduced velocity re ku where k f n d 2 ν willden and graham 2006 carried out a numerical study for re 20u in which the body was restricted to move only in transverse direction the flow characteristics are investigated for five different mass ratios of m 1 2 5 10 50 primary secondary and tertiary responses were identified the primary response occurred around lock in which is always associated with vortex induced vibration the secondary response is found to occur only for high mass ratios m 5 and in the tertiary response regime an approximately constant oscillation amplitude can be maintained bahmani and akbari 2010 investigated numerically the separate effects of mass ratio and structural damping for re 17 9u considering 1dof cylinder motion it was found that increasing m or ζ has almost the same effect both the oscillation amplitude and the size of the lock in domain decrease in the following numerical studies carried out for 2dof cylinder motion the natural frequencies in both streamwise and transverse direction are identical f nx f ny f n const prasanth et al 2006 carried out two sets of computations 1 at fixed u 4 92 with varying re and 2 with constant natural frequencies where both reynolds number and reduced velocity was varied using re 16 6u hysteretic loops were also found at the lower and higher end of lock in it was shown that by reducing the blockage ratio b the ratio of cylinder diameter and the height of the computational domain to b 1 hysteresis loops disappear prasanth and mittal 2008 investigated additional blockage ratios using re 16 6u and concluded that as the blockage is reduced the size of hysteresis loops decreases and hysteresis completely disappears at b 2 5 the phase shift between lift coefficient and transverse cylinder displacement jumps abruptly from 0 to 180 at re 110 decomposing the total lift into two components of pressure lift and viscous lift the authors concluded that the jump is caused by the pressure lift since the viscous lift remains in phase with the cylinder motion in all of the investigated re cases mittal and singh 2005 investigated mainly subcritical reynolds numbers re 47 where re was varied with the reduced velocity re 3 1875u they found that self excited motion occurs as low as re 20 which is a steady state regime for a stationary cylinder at low mass ratio m 4 73 the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency st does not agree with reduced natural frequency which was observed also by williamson and govardhan 2004 however when increasing the mass ratio to m 50 st and f n curves almost overlap at re 33 f n is approximately identical to st and the oscillation amplitude was low compared to the re 25 case where f n st and the vibration amplitude was high the reason is that at re 33 the lift force and transverse displacement are in antiphase therefore the energy transferred between the moving cylinder and the fluid is low compared to that of the re 25 case where lift and transverse displacement are in phase meaning that the mechanical energy transfer is higher the present numerical study deals with low reynolds number flow around a circular cylinder free to vibrate in both streamwise and transverse directions the mass ratio is fixed at m 10 and the structural damping coefficient is set to zero as can be seen from the literature review only low natural frequency values have been investigated for 1dof and 2dof free vibrations the coefficient between reynolds number and reduced velocity k is in the range of 3 20 only systematic computations are carried out for constant natural frequencies agreeing with the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder at the reynolds number of re0 to the best knowledge of the authors most of the articles investigating the 2dof cylinder motion are dealing with re0 100 and systematic computations analyzing the effect of re0 have not yet been carried out the aim of this paper is to expand the re0 and with this the natural frequency domain by investigating the flow characteristics at re0 80 100 140 and 180 cylinder response aerodynamic force coefficients cylinder path and phase angle between the x component of the motion and the total drag pressure drag and viscous drag coefficients are investigated in this study the outline of the current paper is as follows in section 2 the governing equations the boundary and initial conditions are introduced and the computational methodology are presented in section 3 first the independence studies are detailed and then the results obtained here are compared with those in the literature finally section 4 shows the new computational results and in section 5 conclusions are drawn 2 governing equations and computational method in this study two dimensional constant property incompressible newtonian fluid flow around a circular cylinder undergoing two degree of freedom 2dof free vibration is investigated the non dimensional governing equations for this problem are the two components of the navier stokes equations written in a non inertial system fixed to the moving cylinder the continuity equation and the pressure poisson equation these equations in primitive variables are written as follows 1 u t u u x v u y p x 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 d 2 x 0 d t 2 2 v t u v x v v y p y 1 re 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 d 2 y 0 d t 2 3 d u x v y 0 4 2 p 2 u x v y u y v x d t in these equations u v are the non dimensional velocity components in x and y directions t is the non dimensional

is the reynolds number where u is the free stream velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid although dilation is zero for incompressible fluids in eq 4 d t is kept to avoid numerical inaccuracies harlow and welch 1965 fig 1 shows the layout of the computations the figure shows a circular cylinder with a dimensionless radius r 1 and with mass per unit length m placed into a uniform free stream with velocity u the outer boundary of the physical domain where the flow is assumed to be undisturbed is represented by dimensionless radius r 2 the rigid cylinder is elastically supported in both streamwise and transverse directions in this study springs are supposed to be linear and the spring constants are chosen to be identical in the two directions k x k y k as are the damping values b x b y b the non dimensional structural equations that are used to determine the cylinder displacements x 0 y 0 khalak and williamson 1999 are written as follows 5 x 0 4 π ζ u x 0 2 π u 2 x 0 2 c d t π m 6 y 0 4 π ζ u y 0 2 π u 2 y 0 2 c l t π m where dots and double dots mean first and second time derivatives in these equations x 0 x 0 x 0 are the dimensionless streamwise displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylinder respectively and y 0 y 0 y 0 are the same quantities for the transverse direction in eqs 5 and 6 m 4 m d 2 π ρ is the mass ratio where ρ is the fluid density u u f n d is the reduced velocity where f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder and ζ b 2 k m is the structural damping coefficient the lift and drag coefficients are defined as 8 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 d c d 2 f d ρ u 2 d where f l and f d are the dimensional lift and drag forces per unit length which are computed from the pressure and shear stress distributions on the cylinder surface therefore c l and c d can be divided into two parts 9 c l c l p c l v c d c d p c d v where subscripts p and v refer to pressure and viscous parts respectively the boundary conditions are written as follows cylinder surface r 1 10 u v 0 11 p n 1 re 2 v n x 0 n y 0 n outer surface r 2 12 u u p o t x 0 v v p o t y 0 13 p n p n p o t 0 where subscript n refers to the outer normal of

referred to as subscript pot in eq 13 is assumed in the far field r 2 160r 1 it has been shown that this simplification causes only a small distortion in the velocity fields baranyi 2008 posdziech and grundmann 2007 initial conditions for the cylinder displacement and velocity are chosen to be 14 x 0 t 0 y 0 t 0 0 x 0 t 0 y 0 t 0 0 potential flow is assumed around the cylinder at t 0 hence force coefficients are c d t 0 c l t 0 0 which combined with eqs 5 6 and 14 yields zero initial cylinder acceleration x 0 t 0 y 0 t 0 0 in this study boundary fitted coordinates are used in order to impose boundary conditions accurately the physical domain is mapped into a rectangular computational domain see fig 2 applying linear mapping functions baranyi 2008 due to the properties of the mapping functions the computational grid on the physical domain is very fine in the vicinity of the cylinder and coarse in the far field but the grid is equidistant in the computational domain the transformed governing equations with the transformed boundary and initial conditions are solved using an in house code based on the finite difference method baranyi 2008 space derivatives are approximated using fourth order difference schemes except for the convective terms where third order modified upwind difference scheme was applied kawamura et al 1986 the equations of motion and structural equations are integrated explicitly pressure poisson equation is solved using successive over relaxation sor method and the continuity equation is satisfied in each time step 3 validation procedure in this section results of independence studies used to determine the optimal combination of computational parameters are shown using this set of parameters the obtained stationary and elastically supported cylinder results are compared with those available in the literature 3 1 independence studies radius ratio r 2 r 1 grid resolution ξ max η max grid points in the peripheral and radial direction respectively and dimensionless time step δt characterize the computational setup independence studies have to be carried out in order to find the optimal combination of the parameters which is the best compromise between high accuracy and computational cost during these investigations reynolds number and reduced velocity are set to be constant values re 150 and u 5 8837 root mean square rms values of the dimensionless streamwise transverse displacements and lift and drag coefficients are presented for investigating the effect of the radius ratio the number of grid points around the cylinder surface is fixed at ξ max 360 and the dimensionless time step is kept at δt 0 0005 three radius ratio values are considered r 2 r 1 120 160 and 200 in order to make the grid equidistant in the computational domain the number of grid points in the radial direction belonging to the three radius ratio values are chosen to be η max 274 291 and 304 the results are given in table 1 the relative difference between x 0rms y 0rms c drms obtained from the results for r 2 r 1 120 and those for r 2 r 1 200 is less than 0 7 however the relative difference between the values at the radius ratio r 2 r 1 160 and 200 decreases to 0 15 or below c lrms shows higher differences but the corresponding value is less than 1 for r 2 r 1 160 and 200 hence the radius ratio of 160 seems to be appropriate for the computations for the investigation of grid independence the number of peripheral points is chosen to be ξ max 300 360 and 420 while the radius ratio and dimensionless time step are fixed at r 2 r 1 160 and δt 0 0005 respectively in order to generate an equidistant grid on the computational domain η max is chosen to be η max 242 291 and 339 results are shown in table 2 the highest relative differences are observed in c lrms 0 65 and 0 18 between the results for ξ max 300 and 420 and for 360 and 420 respectively in the values of x 0rms and c drms the relative difference for ξ max 300 and 420 is approximately 0 32 which decreases to 0 09 for ξ max 360 and 420 y 0rms shows the least relative differences which are 0 15 and 0 04 for the coarsest and the medium grid resolution respectively see table 2 thus ξ m a x 360 is chosen for further computations finally the effect of dimensionless time step is studied the grid and radius ratio are fixed at 360 291 and r 2 r 1 160 respectively for this investigation computations are carried out for the dimensionless time step values of 0 001 δt 1 0 0005 δt 2 and 0 00025 δt 3 here also c lrms shows the highest relative differences 1 4 for δt 1 and δt 3 and 0 5 for δt 2 and δt 3 see table 3 in the values of x 0rms and c drms the corresponding difference is around 0 3 for δt 1 and 0 09 for δt 2 as was observed in the grid dependence study the relative difference is the least for y 0rms 0 1 for δt 1 and 0 03 for δt 2 thus the time step value of δt 0 0005 seems to be adequate for further computations 3 2 code validation for stationary and elastically supported cylinders the in house code applied for the computations has been extensively tested in order to prove its accuracy see e g baranyi 2008 for further testing first the flow around a stationary cylinder is investigated reynolds number was varied in the range of re 80 180 where the flow is two dimensional barkley and henderson 1996 and periodic vortex shedding occurs in fig 3 a rms values of lift coefficient c lrms are shown against re good agreement is found between our results and those of baranyi and lewis 2006 and golani and dhiman 2014 the variation of strouhal number st0 which is the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder is shown in fig 3b as can be seen the current results compare well with the numerical studies of silva et al 2003 baranyi and lewis 2006 and posdziech and grundmann 2007 and with the experimental studies of norberg 2003 computational results for a freely vibrating cylinder in 2dof are shown in fig 4 prasanth and mittal 2008 and he and zhang 2016 carried out computations where the natural frequency was kept at a constant value which agreed with the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder at reynolds number re0 100 in this case the relationship between re and u is re 16 6u the mass ratio was fixed at m 10 and the structural damping coefficient was set to zero ζ 0 in fig 4 rms values of transverse and streamwise displacements are shown against re the agreement between the current results and those obtained by prasanth and mittal 2008 and he and zhang 2016 is excellent except for the lower and higher threshold of flow synchronization at the vicinity of re 90 and 130 the flow is very sensitive to changes in the reynolds number and also in the reduced velocity which explains the higher discrepancies between the results reassuringly 2s vortex shedding mode occurs for low transverse oscillation amplitude cases e g at the initial branch and c 2s mode of vortex shedding is observed for high transverse cylinder displacements similar to results obtained by prasanth and mittal 2008 and he and zhang 2016 4 results and discussion in this study flow around a circular cylinder undergoing two degrees of freedom free vibration is investigated the mass ratio is fixed at m 10 and the structural damping is chosen to be zero ζ 0 to ensure high amplitude cylinder displacement as mentioned in section 1 reynolds number and reduced velocity are not independent parameters if the natural frequency of the oscillating cylinder f n is constant the relationship between re and u is linear re ku where k f n d 2 ν const mittal and singh 2005 assuming that the reduced natural frequency f n 1 u is identical to the strouhal number for a stationary cylinder st0 at reynolds number re0 k can be determined as k re0 st0 it was found in the literature review that earlier investigations had been limited to low natural frequency values for 2dof motion only re0 100 was investigated prasanth and mittal 2008 in order to fill this gap systematic computations are carried out for four different re0 values st0 re0 and the computed k values are given in table 4 4 1 cylinder response and aerodynamic force coefficients the root mean square rms values of the transverse cylinder displacement y 0rms for the investigated re0 are shown in fig 5 as can be seen the cylinder response for a given re0 value consists of three different regimes at the initial branch the cylinder oscillation amplitude is low in both streamwise and transverse directions and the transverse vibration frequency f y is approximately equal to the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder st0 in fig 6 the variation of st0 f n and f y is shown for re0 140 where f y st0 at the initial branch can be clearly seen with increasing re and u cylinder response switches to the lower branch where the oscillation frequency synchronizes with the natural frequency of the cylinder resulting in high amplitude oscillations beyond the lock in domain the oscillation amplitude becomes small again and f y locks in to st0 as was observed in the initial branch the reynolds number range in which the oscillation frequency synchronizes with the natural frequency i e lock in strongly depends on re0 see fig 5 therefore comparison of data is difficult khalak and williamson 1999 showed that the cylinder responses for different mass damping parameters m ζ can collapse into a single curve by using true reduced velocity u f where f is the ratio of the transverse oscillation frequency and the natural frequency of the cylinder as an independent variable instead of reduced velocity due to ζ 0 mass damping parameter is zero in all the cases investigated in this study singh and mittal 2005 used u st0 as an independent variable for the cases where either re or u was kept constant using the definitions of reduced velocity and strouhal number it can be seen that u st0 is the ratio of the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder f v and the natural frequency of the oscillating body f n u st 0 u f n d f v d u f v f n to the best knowledge of the authors u st0 has not previously been applied as an independent variable for constant natural frequency cases however it can be seen in fig 7 that by plotting y 0rms against u st0 the curves belonging to different re0 values can be represented in the same range strouhal number values in the range of re 50 250 are obtained from posdziech and grundmann 2007 as can be seen in fig 7 the curves shift to higher y 0rms with increasing re0 a larger difference in y 0rms values is found between re0 80 and 100 than between re0 140 180 it can also be seen that the lower branch is significantly wider for lower re0 values previous researchers e g prasanth and mittal 2008 showed that in the transition between the initial and the lower branch where the oscillation amplitude varies strongly the flow is chaotic the width of this transition range also depends on re0 in the case of re0 80 and 100 y 0rms jumps abruptly between the two branches in contrast to re0 140 and 180 where the rms value of the transverse vibration component changes gradually in fig 8 the rms of lift coefficient c lrms is plotted against u st0 it can be seen that in the initial branch and beyond the lower branch c lrms shifts to higher values with increasing re0 besides at the transition regime between initial and lower branches c lrms increases significantly up to a peak value which increases with re0 in the lower branch c lrms drops to a near zero value in figs 9 and 10 the rms value of the streamwise displacement x 0rms and drag coefficient c drms are shown against u st0 as expected the amplitude of oscillation in streamwise direction is significantly smaller than that in transverse direction similar characteristics are observed as were seen for y 0rms in fig 7 the curves belonging to increasing re0 shift to higher values for both x 0rms and c drms on the other hand the rms values of streamwise cylinder displacement show an increase in the range of u st0 0 4 0 65 which becomes more significant for higher re0 see fig 9 c drms shows similar behavior fig 10 but the difference is less than that observed in x 0rms note that this phenomenon is not observed for re0 80 because the flow is steady below u st0 0 5 in fig 11 the domain u st0 0 4 0 65 is shown at higher resolution it can be seen that x 0rms increases continuously until it reaches its local maximum value at around u st0 0 47 see fig 11a as expected with decreasing re0 the peak value diminishes and almost disappears at re0 100 in addition to the peak a local minimum point is identified for c drms at u st0 0 5 where it approaches zero see fig 11b after the local minimum point c drms starts to increase with the slope of the curve increasing with re0 to check the significance of the local maximum values of x 0rms and c drms and local minimum values of c drms the domain u st0 0 4 0 65 is further investigated 4 2 investigating the vicinity of u st0 0 5 in order to investigate the significance of local maximum points identified in x 0rms and c drms and local minimum point found in c drms the phase angle φ between x 0 and c d is computed fig 12 shows c drms against u st0 for re0 180 fig 12c and time histories of drag coefficient and streamwise cylinder displacement fig 12a b d e for different u st0 values it can be seen in the figure that there is an irregular change in the phase difference between x 0 and c d at around u st0 0 5 at u st0 0 5 x 0 and c d are in phase so the phase angle between the signals is φ 0 and in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 when c drms approaches zero the phase angle jumps to φ 180 the phase angle φ computed using hilbert transformation is shown in fig 13 against u st0 for the investigated re0 values the jump in the phase between 0 and 180 can be clearly seen the total drag coefficient is composed of two parts one is due to pressure c dp and another part originating from friction on the cylinder wall c dv as stated by eq 9 the rms values of c dp and c dv in the range u st0 0 4 0 65 show different behaviors as can be seen in fig 14 although both quantities have maximum and minimum values in this range the variation of c dprms is similar to c drms fig 11b while the change in c dvrms is similar to the characteristics of x 0rms fig 11a for this reason φ v phase angle between c dv and x 0 and φ p phase angle between c dp and x 0 are computed and shown for the investigated re0 values in fig 15 as expected the changes in φ v and φ p are different in the range of u st0 0 4 0 5 there is a φ v 35 phase shift between c dv and x 0 after this period φ v changes gradually until it reaches approximately 180 see fig 15b in contrast c dp and x 0 are approximately in phase between u st0 0 4 and 0 5 while in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 the phase angle changes abruptly to φ p 180 see fig 15a the tendencies of φ p and φ are very similar see figs 15a and 13 therefore pressure distribution around the cylinder surface influences the flow structure more strongly than friction does this behavior is similar to that observed by prasanth and mittal 2008 for re0 100 who found an abrupt jump in the phase between the lift coefficient and transverse displacement from φ 0 180 between re 110 and 115 decomposing lift into pressure lift c lp and viscous lift c lv they showed that the pressure component is responsible for the jump since the viscous component remains in phase with the displacement in fig 16 limit cycle curves time histories of viscous drag versus those of pressure drag are shown for the vicinity of u st0 0 5 for re0 140 it can be seen that below u st0 0 4904 the orientation of the curves is clockwise indicated by filled arrows see fig 16 at u st0 0 4904 the orientation switches abruptly to counterclockwise direction shown by empty arrows in fig 16 which means that pressure and viscous drag become nearly antiphase this substantial change is mainly caused by pressure drag since φ v increases gradually in this regime fig 15b in contrast to φ p which jumps abruptly between φ p 0 and 180 at around u st0 0 5 fig 15a the amplitudes of signals c dp and c dv not shown here are almost identical in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 these two features antiphase and equal signal amplitudes nearly cancel each other out resulting in an approximately zero value of c drms shown in fig 11b the abrupt change in the limit cycle curves shown in fig 16 suggests that the path of the cylinder also changes strongly in this domain fig 17 shows the power spectra fft of the x and y components of the cylinder displacement for u st0 0 9246 and re0 180 the intensity value i on the vertical axis is normalized by its maximum value i max it can be seen in the figure that the vibration frequency in the streamwise direction is double that in the transverse direction f x 2 f y which is true for all of the investigated cases except in the chaotic flow regime these peak values result in a distorted figure eight or lissajous curve cylinder path that can be written mathematically as follows 15 x 0 t x 0 m a x cos 4 π f y t θ 16 y 0 t y 0 m a x sin 2 π f y t where θ is the phase angle between x and y vibration components phase angle θ determines both the shape and the orientation of the moving trajectory in case of θ 0 the orbit is clockwise cw in the upper loop of the cylinder path while with θ 0 values counterclockwise ccw cylinder paths are obtained eqs 15 and 16 do not satisfy in the transition regime between initial and lower branches where the cylinder motion is not quasi periodic in fig 18 the direction of cylinder orbit is shown for cw filled arrows and ccw empty arrows for the intersection of a distorted figure eight path phase angles between the two oscillation components are computed and plotted against u st0 for the investigated re0 values in fig 19 it can be seen that cw cylinder motion occurs in the approximate range of u st0 0 4 0 5 and ccw orbits are found above u st0 0 5 it is obvious from the figure that θ varies strongly at the vicinity of u st0 0 5 in fig 20 cylinder trajectories are shown for various u st0 values for re0 180 it can be seen that by increasing u st0 the phase angle sharply decreases approaching zero at u st0 0 487 at the same value at which the local minimum value was identified in c drms see also fig 11b 5 conclusions the present study deals with the numerical simulation of low reynolds number flow around an elastically supported circular cylinder free to move in two directions the mass ratio is fixed at m 10 and the structural damping coefficient is set to zero the natural frequency of the structure f n is kept at a constant value agreeing with the vortex shedding frequency from a stationary cylinder at reynolds numbers re0 80 100 140 and 180 in order to keep f n constant both re and reduced velocity u are varied the main findings are as follows a two branch cylinder response is observed similarly to the previously published numerical and experimental results for low reynolds number flows the reynolds number range where synchronization or lock in takes place strongly depends on re0 making comparison of results belonging to different natural frequencies more difficult by plotting the results belonging to different re0 against u st0 the data series can be represented in the same range making comparison easier with increasing re0 the root mean square rms values of cylinder displacement and drag coefficient shift to higher values and the lock in domain becomes narrower in the initial branch local extreme values are observed in the rms of streamwise displacement x 0rms maximum and drag coefficient c drms maximum and minimum in the range of u st0 0 4 0 65 at u st0 0 5 c drms approaches zero at this point the phase angle between streamwise displacement and drag coefficient changes abruptly from 0 to 180 from in phase to antiphase phase angles between the x component of the cylinder motion and pressure and viscous drag coefficients φ p and φ v are also computed although φ p shows a sudden shift between 0 and 180 φ v gradually varies between φ v 35 and 180 this result indicates that pressure drag may be responsible for the abrupt phase change and switch in orientation of the cylinder path due to the abrupt change in φ p the limit cycle curves c dv c dp switch from clockwise to anticlockwise orientation in the vicinity of u st0 0 5 the cylinder follows a distorted figure eight path in all of the investigated cases except within the chaotic flow regime the phase angle between x and y components of the motion is computed and used to identify the orientation of the path it is found that at u st0 0 5 the orientation of the cylinder path changes from a clockwise to a counterclockwise orbit it is seen from the current study that higher re0 values cause noticeable changes in x 0rms and c drms we plan to investigate the effect of mass ratio at the range of m 0 1 25 on the cylinder response for higher re0 values re0 180 acknowledgements

23401,in this paper a model predictive control mpc method based on quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso combining with sliding mode control smc is studied to solve the dynamic trajectory tracking problem of unmanned underwater vehicle uuv in three dimensional underwater environment first the kinematic controller based on qpso mpc is designed to obtain the velocity signal qpso limits the velocity of uuv within a specified range to handle the speed jump problem when compared with backstepping control then kinematic control is extended to dynamic control for verifying the feasibility of qpso mpc in the realistic dynamical uuv system here smc is adopted in dynamic control because of its good robustness and anti interference performance the combination of kinematic and dynamic controllers can efficiently realize the trajectory tracking of uuv the experimental simulation results prove that the algorithm proposed in this paper can solve the speed jump and the driven saturation caused by speed jump and also can satisfy the propeller constraints of uuv keywords unmanned underwater vehicle trajectory tracking quantum behaved particle swarm optimization model predictive control sliding mode control backstepping control 1 introduction uuv wynn et al 2014 xu et al 2016 has been widely used in ocean exploration and submarine activities due to its mobility security intelligence and so on it is getting more and more attention from industry and even the military but the design of uuv system especially the design of its control system is a big challenge for engineers and researchers the trajectory tracking yan et al 2012 2015 is one of the main problems in the control system of uuv and is also the basis for the realization of various tasks therefore the research on it is particularly significant the content of trajectory tracking is making uuv arrive and accurately track the desired trajectory until getting to the target location within a limited period of time at present the main research methods of it include pid control adaptive control fuzzy control neural network control backstepping control model predictive control sliding mode control and so forth pid control method xiang et al 2013 refers to a linear combination of the proportional integral and derivative terms of the control deviation to form the control law the design is simple and low complexity but the performance of traditional pid control is not ideal because of the nonlinear and uncertain characteristics of uuv although some scholars presented a variety of pid controllers which have being improved later like fuzzy pid control xiang et al 2016 adaptive pid control chamsai et al 2015 and so on the interference suppression ability of these improved methods is mainly for the known interference and the performance is always directly related to hydrodynamic model accuracy therefore the pid method can t solve the insufficient robustness adaptive control method liu et al 2010 sahu and subudhi 2016 pezeshki et al 2016 is designed for uncertain objects whose dynamic model is difficult to determine adaptive control has little dependence on mathematical information and requires only a small amount of prior knowledge it doesn t require precise dynamic model of uuv all the dynamic parameters can be obtained by adaptive method its design can be summarized in three parts 1 select the control law including the change in parameters 2 select the adaptive law that is employed to correct these parameters 3 analyze the convergence characteristics of the existing system adaptive control is suitable for controlling a complex system such as uuv however the construction of it is complex and it requires high demand for parameter changes which affects its further application the essence of fuzzy control liu et al 2014 xiang et al 2017a b c sun et al 2017 is to convert a control strategy based on expert knowledge to an automatic control strategy in practical applications the collected control information is utilized to obtain a fuzzy set of the control vector through fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy decision making the exact value of output is determined by the fuzzy decision made regarding the controlled object allowing the desired control over the process to be achieved so it doesn t depend on the accurate mathematical model of control system it has a strong robustness to process and parameters change and also has a strong anti interference ability unfortunately fuzzy control relies on gained experience to establish the fuzzy rule and the establishment of fuzzy rule is very subjective neural network control method zhu et al 2017a b sun et al 2014a b xiang et al 2017a b c entails utilizing a neural network as a controller or an identifier in the control structure it can approximate any nonlinear function with arbitrary precision weights between inputs and outputs of a control system are obtained by previous samples leaning then the weights are used to calculate the corresponding outputs for a set of inputs of system at the current time it doesn t also need accurate dynamics model the nonlinear performance of uuv can be fitted by neural network it has the characteristics of non linear self learning intelligence nevertheless neural network control is not only difficult to obtain the training samples but also the learning process of sample is lagging which makes the real time performance of control system is poor backstepping control method sun et al 2014a b wang et al 2015 xiang et al 2015 is a common method used to realize uuv trajectory tracking at present backstepping control refers to use the reference system s control variables and the deviation of the control system to carry out linear combination then control variables of the control system can be obtained its design is relatively simple and easy to understand and its stability can be proved by the lyapunov stability theory the theory of backstepping control is to devise a backstepping controller to make the closed loop system asymptotically stable it can deal with the situation with large error at initial state however its shortcoming is also obvious the design of backstepping control law is directly related to the state error a large speed change is generated due to the large initial error which will cause the speed jump phenomenon when state suddenly changes extended to dynamic control this means that the required force torque at the jump point may exceed the maximal force torque that uuv can offer for the speed jump problem in backstepping control mpc beal and gerdes 2013 gao et al 2016 is proposed to solve it in virtue of the constraints for uuv velocity mpc is an advanced control methodology based on the model of plant and has three characteristics namely prediction model rolling optimization and feedback correction the model of uuv is needed in mpc but can be reasonably simplified so it is suitable for complex systems such as uuv the biggest attraction of mpc is that it has the capability to explicitly handle constraints this ability comes from its model based prediction of system future dynamic behavior and then the constraints are acted on future inputs outputs or state variables for uuv system a variety of constraints for velocities are incorporated into qpso li 2015 zeng et al 2016 optimization process which can effectively solve the speed jump problem very well qpso is adopted in the rolling optimization process in terms of the solution quality robustness and the convergence property moreover mpc has the advantages of robustness and stability using rolling optimization strategy can compensate for the uncertainties caused by model mismatch distortion and interference this leads to better dynamic performance then it is extended to dynamic control sliding mode control xu et al 2015 londhe et al 2016 xiang et al 2017a b c has been used in the dynamic tracking control for several decades and it has the advantage in robust character of parameter insensitivity and disturbance rejection in order to resolve the speed jump and the driven saturation caused by speed jump a novel dynamic tracking control of uuv is realized by combining mpc and sliding mode control in this paper the rest parts of the paper are organized as follows in section 2 the description of trajectory tracking is introduced the kinematic and dynamic model of uuv are established propellers arrangement and thrust normalization are carried out for the specific falcon robot in section 3 qpso mpc is used to design the kinematic controller for obtaining the desired speed then sliding mode control is presented and used to design the dynamic controller based on the desired speed the combination of two controllers can eventually achieve stable trajectory tracking control for falcon in section 4 the simulation results are presented and analyzed the results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm when compared with the backstepping control algorithm in section 5 some concluding remarks are summarized and the research about the trajectory tracking of uuv in the future is discussed 2 the description of trajectory tracking and modeling of uuv 2 1 trajectory tracking the trajectory tracking problem means that uuv starts from a given initial position arriving and tracking a geometric path associated with time with given velocity by using tracking control law since the 3d motion situation is studied in this paper only considering the tracking control problem under four most common degrees of freedom surge u sway v heave w and yaw r the diagrammatic sketch of trajectory tracking is shown in fig 1 the actual position of uuv represents η x y

control input ν d t u d t v d t w d t r d t t uuv tracks the reference trajectory by controlling the actual surge speed u sway speed v heave speed w and yaw speed r of uuv and finally makes the error

explains the geometric relationship between position velocity of uuv dynamic modeling analyses forces changes of uuv during the accelerated motion process yang et al 2015 2 2 1 kinematic modeling kinematic modeling involves the coordinate system of uuv including two parts the inertial coordinate and the body fixed coordinate the inertial coordinate which is also called the earth coordinate origin of it is a point on earth the body fixed coordinate is fixed on uuv origin of it is the carter of uuv gravity it moves along with uuv uuv coordinate systems are shown in fig 2 the uuv kinematics equation is 2 η j η v under normal circumstances six degrees of freedom are not fully considered it can be simplified according to the actual needs of decoupling four most common degrees of freedom surge sway heave and yaw are considered for the tracking control problem in three dimensional underwater environment in this paper that is η x y z ψ t and v u v w r t the kinematics

buoyancy thrust hydrodynamic force disturbing force and various torques associated with these forces under the action of resultant force and resultant moment generated from these forces and moments

thrust normalization the thrusts τ τ x τ y τ z τ n t will be assigned to each thruster here falcon open frame underwater vehicle is as a research object in trajectory tracking control in this paper the dynamic model and propulsion system of falcon are analyzed the model is decoupled and controllable in 4 dof which are surge sway yaw and heave the structure of falcon is shown in fig 3 the distribution of horizontal thrusters is laid out in fig 4 four thrusters arranged symmetrically provide horizontal motion actuation and a vertical thruster provides depth control all thrusters are the same model a and b are the width and length of falcon which a 0 6 m b 1 m α 36 is the angle between the thruster and the coordinate axis x 0 partial hydrodynamic parameters of falcon refer to zand 2005 according to the distribution of horizontal thrusters in fig 4 it is easy to calculate the resultant force and resultant moment of falcon on each degree of freedom 5 τ x τ y τ z τ n cos α cos α

obtain thrusts is put forward the block diagram of dynamics tracking control based on qpso mpc and smc is illustrated in fig 5 the control system of uuv is composed of two parts qpso mpc based kinematic controller and smc based dynamic controller the qpso mpc kinematic controller consists of a linear error model system constraints and objective function solved by qpso the linear error model predicts future dynamic output of uuv based on prior information and future inputs which can provide better prior knowledge for system optimization system constraints make sure that the control system is carried out on the premise of meeting state and control constraints the objective function within qpso optimization process is the essence of mpc algorithm which guarantees that uuv can perform efficient and stable tracking control however in hardware system of uuv it is relies on the thrusters to offer forces to make uuv sail in that case the kinematic control design is not a complete control system for actual tracking control it is necessary to expand kinematic control to dynamic control the controlling value obtained by qpso optimization in kinematic way is employed as input to dynamic control then forces moments calculated by sliding mode control drive uuv to track the reference trajectory 3 1 the kinematic controller based on qpso mpc 3 1 1 uuv linear error model the uuv system can be seen as a control system with input v u v w r t and the state η x y z ψ t where its general form is 13 η f η v for a given reference trajectory each point on that satisfies the above kinematic equation with the subscript d representing the reference and the general form is 14 η d f η d v d where η d x d y d z d ψ d t v d u d v d w d r d t by using taylor series expansion and ignoring the higher order terms in 13 at the reference trajectory point then 13 can be obtained as 15 η f η d v d f η v η η η d v v d η η d f η v v η η d v v d v v d the uuv error model can be

problem based on qpso the deviation of system state and optimization of control should be added so that the objective function is able to ensure that uuv can track desired trajectory rapidly and

controller which means the desired velocity in dynamics controller is v c δ v t v d 3 2 dynamic controller based on sliding mode control 3 2 1 sliding mode control uuv is a typical strong coupling and nonlinear system the traditional linear control method is not applicable meanwhile complex hydrodynamic parameters are difficult to calculate and the motion also changes with time it s unrealistic to establish an accurate dynamic model so many model based control methods are hard to control uuv precisely sliding mode control method is often used in trajectory tracking of uuv because of its insensitivity to parameter variations and external disturbance strong robustness no need to model accurately in order to overcome the chattering problem in sliding mode control a new adaptive sliding mode controller replacing the switch item with adaptive item is proposed in this character 3 2 2 the smc based dynamic controller v c represents the expected velocity given by the kinematic controller v represents the actual velocity of uuv virtual tracking velocity error is laid out as 28 e v c v there are two steps in the design of smc controller first one is the selection of sliding manifold and the second one is the design of control law it is very important to select appropriate sliding manifold which is related to the quality factor and robustness of sliding mode control in general the sliding manifold can be selected as follows soylu et al 2008 29 s d d t λ 2 e d t e 2 λ e λ 2 e d t where s is the selected sliding manifold and λ is a constant coefficient positive definite matrix when system reaches sliding manifold and is carrying out on sliding manifold which means the derivation of 29 equals to 0 30 s e 2 λ e λ 2 e e 2 λ v c v λ 2 e 0 m v c v v d v v g η τ is transformed to

since the calculation of e is complex there is a convenience sample method called error acceleration feedback control which is used to calculate e 33 e k e where k is constant coefficient the equivalent control law after substitution is as follows 34 τ e q m ˆ v c k e 2 λ λ 2 e c ˆ v d ˆ v g ˆ in order to eliminate the chattering problem caused by the discontinuous switching term an adaptive term is used to replace the switching term so a new adaptive sliding mode controller can be obtained the adaptive term is designed as follows 35 τ a d τ e s t k c ˆ 2 λ s where τ e s t is the adaptive variation used to estimate the unknown quantity τ and k is a constant scalar representing the strictly positive constant for the convergence rate of the controller the adaptive variation satisfies the following update rate τ e s t γ s γ is the constant coefficient of s determining the rate of adaption then the complete control law of the adaptive sliding mode controller can be expressed as 36 τ τ e q τ a d τ e q τ e s t k c ˆ 2 λ s 3 2 3 stability analysis for nonlinear system like uuv in this paper construct lyapunov function as follows 37 v 1 4 λ s t m s 1 2 θ t γ 1 θ

unknown error term and eventually converge to zero even in the worst case system stability can also be guaranteed by increasing k and γ there are assumptions that must be known such as hypothesis 1 uncertain dynamics term τ r is bounded hypothesis 2 if τ r t γ 1 θ 0 then s t k s τ r t γ 1 θ v 0 can be inferred from hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 so that the energy function of uuv system can converge to zero from any initial value based on the lyapunov stability criterion uuv system is stable 4 simulation results and analysis in this chapter falcon uuv has been used to get the related simulation experiment the structure thrusters arrangement and thrust normalization of falcon have been described above in detail firstly genetic ga algorithm particle swarm optimization pso algorithm and quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso algorithm are applied to model predictive control to solve the optimization problem it verifies that qpso can converge to the optimal solution quickly and stably which makes its tracking performance obviously better than ga and pso then to verify the effectiveness of the new hybrid trajectory tracking control algorithm proposed in this paper the traditional backstepping control algorithm and the new algorithm based on qpso mpc are simulated for falcon uuv respectively through the comparison of two algorithms for tracking performance and controlling variables change including velocities and thrusts it is demonstrated that the control algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively restrain the speed jump phenomenon and deal with the problem of thrust overrun lastly the robustness of the proposed method is verified by simulation cases here two typical kinds of different reference trajectories are simulated which are spiral line trajectory and piecewise line trajectory 4 1 simulation comparisons of optimization algorithms for verifying the global convergence and stability of qpso genetic algorithm hereinafter referred to as ga and particle swarm optimization hereinafter referred to as pso are employed into the rolling optimization part of mpc to form three different kinds of mpc in kinematic part which respectively refer to ga mpc pso mpc and qpso mpc asmc is adopted in dynamic part for three mpc methods a simulation case of tracking classical spiral line is given in this chapter it is assumed that the actual initial position of falcon is 2 2 0 0 and the desired initial positon is 0 0 0 0 then initial state error is 2 2 0 0 the simulation time is set from 0 to 60s the given trajectory is presented as x d t 5 sin 0 2 t y d t 5 5 cos 0 2 t z d t 0 1 t ψ d t 0 2 t u d t 1 v d t 0 w d t 0 1 r d t 0 2 the parameters of controller are set as follows the parameters related to dynamics for simulation are λ 1 k 1 k 50 γ 1 for ga mpc pso mpc and qpso mpc there are some of the same parameters such as the predictive domain ν p 10 and the control domain ν c 1 however for three kinds of optimization algorithms they all have to set up the parameters named the population size hereinafter referred to popsize and the maximal number of iterations hereinafter referred to maxiter for pso and qpso these two parameters directly affect the optimization performance and the algorithms stability for ga there are also two important factors namely crossover probability pc and mutation probability pm the values of these parameters are indicated in table 1 fig 7 shows tracking results of ga mpc pso mpc and qpso mpc for tracking a spiral line the black curve is the given reference trajectory the green one is the trajectory tracked by ga mpc the cyan one is the trajectory tracked by pso mpc the red one is the trajectory tracked by qpso mpc the comparison of tracking error curves is given in fig 8 for ga mpc the green line there are four factors that directly determine the optimization results in order to compare with qpso mpc popsize and maxiter are set as 30 for both two methods several experiments were carried out on the values of mutation probability and crossover probability the values in table 2 are obtained to get a better tracking performance in fig 7 however the convergence speed of ga mpc is slow qpso mpc can make uuv track the desired trajectory after 10s but ga mpc method weren t able to achieve roughly stable tracking until after 30s moreover ga requires tedious coding and decoding operations which makes the running time needed in simulink much longer than that of qpso in comparison with ga qpso has fast convergence speed and fewer parameters need to be adjusted which is also easy to program and run fast for pso mpc the cyan line pso algorithm can t guarantee convergence to global optimal solution which leads to the repeated oscillation occurs when tracking the reference trajectory even the population size and maximal iterations are increased to five times of qpso mpc the tracking effect of pso mpc is not good and still in the oscillation state in contrast qpso mpc not only ensures fast search speed and global convergence but also achieves stable and efficient tracking control 4 2 spiral line tracking the reference trajectory and given speed for spiral line in this chapter can be consulted in chapter 4 1 the control parameters are set as follows in tables 2 and 3 which were achieved through several simulation results the simulation results tracked by qpso mpc and backstepping control are laid out in fig 9 it shows that the two methods are able to make uuv reach and track the reference trajectory smoothly from the tracking performance two control methods have achieved similar results however the tracking speed and thrust response of two controllers are obviously different which will be analyzed in the following speed contrast of two controllers is shown in fig 10 where the black dotted line represents the maximal value and minimal value of speed shown in 19 since the spiral line is continuous and differentiable everywhere the primary problem of tracking control is the speed jump phenomenon due to the initial position errors in order to be more intuitive to present the velocity changes in initial tracking process here just cut out the first 10s of simulation curve to analyze after 10s both of these two methods have tracked the reference trajectory steadily and it makes little sense to compare them after 10s table 4 presents the velocity change of uuv moving from the starting point 0 to first point 1 the value beyond 2 2 is marked in red at the initial moment for the backstepping control the speed jump phenomenon is produced due to the control law of it is related to the large state error directly for example u c is changed from 0 m s to 5 m s when uuv moves from the initial position to next one position the speed change value δ u c t is up to 5 m s which is beyond the maximal speed 2 m s of uuv it means that the excessive speed changed will be generated in short time by using backstepping control to track this leads to the presence of too large acceleration which requires a sufficiently large thrust it is very obvious beyond the maximal thrust limit of thruster which can also be confirmed from the normalized thrust diagram it is evident from table 4 that qpso mpc limits the speed within the range of 2 m s to 2 m s overall qpso mpc can restrict the speed within the specified range which is solving the problem of speed jump in backstepping control fig 11 is normalized thrust comparison of two controllers in first 10s due to the thrust of thruster has been normalized it should meet the constraint 1 t i 1 i 1 2 3 4 5 as can be seen from fig 11 the normalized thrusts of backstepping control do not satisfy the constraint table 5 displays the maximum of 5 thrusters under control of backstepping control and qpso mpc the thrust value exceeding the prescribed range 1 1 is marked in red which directly reflects the thrust overrun problem in the early stages of tracking t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 generated by backstepping control are all over the range of 1 to 1 for example the maximal normalized thrust of t 4 is even up to 4 5457 even if the tracking simulation result of backstepping control is very good but it is impossible to achieve such accurate tracking in the actual situation nevertheless t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 generated by qpso mpc are all up to the standard in summary the application of qpso mpc can overcome the problem of thrust overrun which the control effect is better than that of backstepping control 4 3 piecewise line tracking based on the simulation results of tracking spiral line explained above it is shown that qpso mpc can solve the speed jump caused by the initial posture error and the thrust overrun problem however the spiral line is a continuous trajectory this section will further discuss the speed jump problem of discrete trajectory the trajectory is continuous but not differentiable the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm the reference trajectory is a piecewise line in three dimensional environment and the initial position of uuv is not on the reference trajectory its initial position is η x y z ψ t 2 0 2 0 t the piecewise line trajectory is a subsection function which can be defined as follows when 0 t 20 s η d x d t 0 15 t 3 y d t 0 15 t z d t 0 15 t 3 ψ d t π 4 u d t 0 3 v d t 0 w d t 0 15 r d t 0 when 20 s t 40 s η d x d t 0 15 t 20 6 y d t 3 z d t 6 ψ d t 0 u d t 0 15 v d t 0 w d t 0 r d t 0 when 40 s t 60 s η d x d t 0 15 t 40 9 y d t 0 15 t 40 3 z d t 0 15 t 40 6 ψ d t π 4 u d t 0 3 v d t 0 w d t 0 15 r d t 0 time varies from 0 to 60s and the sampling time t is 0 1s there are 600 trajectory points the control parameters are set as follows in tables 2 and 3 the tracking performance of two controllers is shown in fig 12 pay attention to the tracking performance in the initial stage and round the two turning points b c why the tracking performance of qpso mpc method is worse than that of backstepping control method because the control law of backstepping method is connection with posture error directly it only takes the tracking performance into account but does not consider whether the velocities and thrusts are beyond the limits of uuv this also leads to speed jump and thrust overrun problems experienced in backstepping control nonetheless the reason why tracking performance of qpso mpc is bit worse is thinking about the velocities and thrusts should be in the range offered by uuv so the tracking performance of qpso mpc in fig 12 is the balance between the control performance and velocities thrusts constraint optimization in that way the tracking speed and thrust response of two controllers are obviously different correlation analysis of velocities and forces will be analyzed in the following speed contrast of two controllers is displayed in fig 13 table 6 shows the maximum value of each speed simulated by two controllers the speed value exceeding the prescribed range is marked in red at the initial moment because of the large error between desired state and actual state high speed should be needed to make uuv reach the reference trajectory as soon as possible the change of surge speed u c heave speed w c and yaw speed r c of backstepping control are all over the range of 2 m s which can be seen very clearly in table 6 but the four speeds of qpso mpc are all within the specified range considering that the only difference between the discrete trajectory and continuous trajectory is the state mutation at the turning points which will cause the speed jump problem and the thrust overrun phenomenon the so called state mutation means the sudden change of angle at the turning points so the angular velocity and yaw moment change most obviously at the turning points table 7 shows the speed jump values at turning points b and c for backstepping control the yaw velocity r c has the speed jump problem at the turning points for example when r c is 0 0007 rad s at point 200 it becomes 2 3555 rad s at next point 201 hence the speed jump value δ r c is 2 3562 rad s nevertheless the velocity r c of qpso mpc is 0 0004 rad s at point 200 and becomes 0 367 rad s at next point 201 with the speed jump value δ r c 0 3666 rad s only which is smaller than the speed jump of backstepping control that s all saying the yaw moment of backstepping control is much larger than that of qpso mpc when realizing the accurate trajectory tracking control in other words thrusters produced by backstepping control method may exceed the maximal value of thrusters can provide which can also be confirmed from the normalized thrust diagram in the following normalized thrust comparison of two controllers is displayed in fig 14 the thrust of thruster has been normalized and it should meet the constraint 1 t i 1 i 1 2 3 4 5 fig 14 is the forces comparison in whole 60s fig 15 is the detail figures amplifying three parts of fig 14 for observing the thrust change at the initial moment and turning points fig 15 a is the normalized thrust in 0 2s t 2 t 3 t 5 of backstepping control are all beyond the specified range however all normalized thrusts of qpso mpc are in the specified range 1 1 the normalized thrust at the turning point will be emphatically analyzed for a piecewise line trajectory here is taken the turning point b as an example the angle change of uuv involves all 5 thrusters between 19 5s and 20 5s reach point b at 20s it can be seen from fig 16 b that there are sharp changes at the turning point on 5 thrusters normalized thrusts under control of backstepping t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 are all exceeding the specified range 1 1 the maximum values of t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 under control of backstepping are shown in table 8 the speed value exceeding the prescribed range is marked in red that means even if the tracking simulation result of backstepping control is very good but it is impossible to achieve in the actual situation however from fig 15 b and c the normalized thrust at the turning point under control of qpso mpc has a beating but the fluctuation is small and it is within the specified range as also can be seen from table 8 the maximal values of t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 are all within 1 1 which can overcome the problem of thrust overrun but it is worth noting that qpso mpc method limits the velocity range forcibly which restricts thrust within saturation range so the respond time and tracking performance will be affected inevitably the tracking results obtained ultimately is the balance between control performance and thrust constraints it can be known from the above two simulation results that backstepping control can make uuv accurately tracking reference trajectory in the simulation environment but considering that the velocity and force provided by uuv are limited the tracking results of backstepping control in real underwater environment are much worse than that in simulation environment and may not even finish the tracking task by comparison qpso mpc can inhibit the excessive velocity and force and its application on uuv can solve the speed jump and drive saturation problems in backstepping control so as to meet the physical constraints of thrust of uuv and to further realize the trajectory tracking control of uuv very well 4 4 feasibility of tracking in large scale in order to verify the proposed method can be applied in real ocean environment the feasibility analysis of tracking in large scale environment which is closer to the actual marine environment is given in this chapter fig 16 shows the spiral tracking in a 100 m 150 m 80 m space and the simulation time is set as 500 s fig 17 is a polyline tracking with a simulation time of 300 s in a 150 m 150 m 80 m environment as can be seen from figs 16 and 17 the proposed method can also achieve stable and accurate tracking performance in a large scale environment 4 5 robustness analysis when operating at different depths of the ocean the hydrodynamic parameters of uuv will be changed with the underwater environment the hydrodynamic parameters at this time can t be accurately obtained in virtue of the limitations of the current measurement techniques therefore in this situation the control system should be strongly robust to parameters uncertainty in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for parameters uncertainty the parameters errors of 40 20 and 10 are added into the dynamic model respectively the simulation results generated by qpso mpc and asmc under different conditions are provided in figs 18 and 19 the spiral and polyline simulation cases for parameters setting refer to chapter 4 4 are employed to verify qpso mpc tracking performance when existing parameter uncertainty the black line is the reference trajectory the blue dotted line the red dotted line and the green dotted line respectively represent the tracking results using qpso mpc asmc with 40 20 and 10 errors on the dynamic matrix figs 18 and 19 given the tracking results comparison with parameter uncertainty condition 40 20 and 10 errors respectively it can be clearly seen from two figures that under the circumstance of different parameter uncertainty the tracking performances are basically the same and the tracking error is tiny and basically can be ignored consequently it is able to be considered that the proposed tracking control method has strong robustness to overcome the parameter uncertainty problem and achieve stable tracking 5 conclusion in this paper the trajectory tracking control of uuv in three dimensional underwater environment is investigated from kinematic way to dynamic way on the basis of qpso mpc mentioned on the previous work the kinematic control is further extended to dynamic control a cascade control algorithm combined qpso mpc and smc has been proposed the algorithm is divided into two parts the kinematic controller which restrains the velocity within the preset range and the dynamic controller which achieves stable tracking control in actual situation the proposed method solves the speed jump problem and avoids the drive saturation when comparing with backstepping control the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in various environments is verified by the simulation experiments on tracking continuous and discrete curves in three dimensional environment in the future the kinematic and dynamic tracking control under the ocean current situation will be worked out in the further research

23401,in this paper a model predictive control mpc method based on quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso combining with sliding mode control smc is studied to solve the dynamic trajectory tracking problem of unmanned underwater vehicle uuv in three dimensional underwater environment first the kinematic controller based on qpso mpc is designed to obtain the velocity signal qpso limits the velocity of uuv within a specified range to handle the speed jump problem when compared with backstepping control then kinematic control is extended to dynamic control for verifying the feasibility of qpso mpc in the realistic dynamical uuv system here smc is adopted in dynamic control because of its good robustness and anti interference performance the combination of kinematic and dynamic controllers can efficiently realize the trajectory tracking of uuv the experimental simulation results prove that the algorithm proposed in this paper can solve the speed jump and the driven saturation caused by speed jump and also can satisfy the propeller constraints of uuv keywords unmanned underwater vehicle trajectory tracking quantum behaved particle swarm optimization model predictive control sliding mode control backstepping control 1 introduction uuv wynn et al 2014 xu et al 2016 has been widely used in ocean exploration and submarine activities due to its mobility security intelligence and so on it is getting more and more attention from industry and even the military but the design of uuv system especially the design of its control system is a big challenge for engineers and researchers the trajectory tracking yan et al 2012 2015 is one of the main problems in the control system of uuv and is also the basis for the realization of various tasks therefore the research on it is particularly significant the content of trajectory tracking is making uuv arrive and accurately track the desired trajectory until getting to the target location within a limited period of time at present the main research methods of it include pid control adaptive control fuzzy control neural network control backstepping control model predictive control sliding mode control and so forth pid control method xiang et al 2013 refers to a linear combination of the proportional integral and derivative terms of the control deviation to form the control law the design is simple and low complexity but the performance of traditional pid control is not ideal because of the nonlinear and uncertain characteristics of uuv although some scholars presented a variety of pid controllers which have being improved later like fuzzy pid control xiang et al 2016 adaptive pid control chamsai et al 2015 and so on the interference suppression ability of these improved methods is mainly for the known interference and the performance is always directly related to hydrodynamic model accuracy therefore the pid method can t solve the insufficient robustness adaptive control method liu et al 2010 sahu and subudhi 2016 pezeshki et al 2016 is designed for uncertain objects whose dynamic model is difficult to determine adaptive control has little dependence on mathematical information and requires only a small amount of prior knowledge it doesn t require precise dynamic model of uuv all the dynamic parameters can be obtained by adaptive method its design can be summarized in three parts 1 select the control law including the change in parameters 2 select the adaptive law that is employed to correct these parameters 3 analyze the convergence characteristics of the existing system adaptive control is suitable for controlling a complex system such as uuv however the construction of it is complex and it requires high demand for parameter changes which affects its further application the essence of fuzzy control liu et al 2014 xiang et al 2017a b c sun et al 2017 is to convert a control strategy based on expert knowledge to an automatic control strategy in practical applications the collected control information is utilized to obtain a fuzzy set of the control vector through fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy decision making the exact value of output is determined by the fuzzy decision made regarding the controlled object allowing the desired control over the process to be achieved so it doesn t depend on the accurate mathematical model of control system it has a strong robustness to process and parameters change and also has a strong anti interference ability unfortunately fuzzy control relies on gained experience to establish the fuzzy rule and the establishment of fuzzy rule is very subjective neural network control method zhu et al 2017a b sun et al 2014a b xiang et al 2017a b c entails utilizing a neural network as a controller or an identifier in the control structure it can approximate any nonlinear function with arbitrary precision weights between inputs and outputs of a control system are obtained by previous samples leaning then the weights are used to calculate the corresponding outputs for a set of inputs of system at the current time it doesn t also need accurate dynamics model the nonlinear performance of uuv can be fitted by neural network it has the characteristics of non linear self learning intelligence nevertheless neural network control is not only difficult to obtain the training samples but also the learning process of sample is lagging which makes the real time performance of control system is poor backstepping control method sun et al 2014a b wang et al 2015 xiang et al 2015 is a common method used to realize uuv trajectory tracking at present backstepping control refers to use the reference system s control variables and the deviation of the control system to carry out linear combination then control variables of the control system can be obtained its design is relatively simple and easy to understand and its stability can be proved by the lyapunov stability theory the theory of backstepping control is to devise a backstepping controller to make the closed loop system asymptotically stable it can deal with the situation with large error at initial state however its shortcoming is also obvious the design of backstepping control law is directly related to the state error a large speed change is generated due to the large initial error which will cause the speed jump phenomenon when state suddenly changes extended to dynamic control this means that the required force torque at the jump point may exceed the maximal force torque that uuv can offer for the speed jump problem in backstepping control mpc beal and gerdes 2013 gao et al 2016 is proposed to solve it in virtue of the constraints for uuv velocity mpc is an advanced control methodology based on the model of plant and has three characteristics namely prediction model rolling optimization and feedback correction the model of uuv is needed in mpc but can be reasonably simplified so it is suitable for complex systems such as uuv the biggest attraction of mpc is that it has the capability to explicitly handle constraints this ability comes from its model based prediction of system future dynamic behavior and then the constraints are acted on future inputs outputs or state variables for uuv system a variety of constraints for velocities are incorporated into qpso li 2015 zeng et al 2016 optimization process which can effectively solve the speed jump problem very well qpso is adopted in the rolling optimization process in terms of the solution quality robustness and the convergence property moreover mpc has the advantages of robustness and stability using rolling optimization strategy can compensate for the uncertainties caused by model mismatch distortion and interference this leads to better dynamic performance then it is extended to dynamic control sliding mode control xu et al 2015 londhe et al 2016 xiang et al 2017a b c has been used in the dynamic tracking control for several decades and it has the advantage in robust character of parameter insensitivity and disturbance rejection in order to resolve the speed jump and the driven saturation caused by speed jump a novel dynamic tracking control of uuv is realized by combining mpc and sliding mode control in this paper the rest parts of the paper are organized as follows in section 2 the description of trajectory tracking is introduced the kinematic and dynamic model of uuv are established propellers arrangement and thrust normalization are carried out for the specific falcon robot in section 3 qpso mpc is used to design the kinematic controller for obtaining the desired speed then sliding mode control is presented and used to design the dynamic controller based on the desired speed the combination of two controllers can eventually achieve stable trajectory tracking control for falcon in section 4 the simulation results are presented and analyzed the results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm when compared with the backstepping control algorithm in section 5 some concluding remarks are summarized and the research about the trajectory tracking of uuv in the future is discussed 2 the description of trajectory tracking and modeling of uuv 2 1 trajectory tracking the trajectory tracking problem means that uuv starts from a given initial position arriving and tracking a geometric path associated with time with given velocity by using tracking control law since the 3d motion situation is studied in this paper only considering the tracking control problem under four most common degrees of freedom surge u sway v heave w and yaw r the diagrammatic sketch of trajectory tracking is shown in fig 1 the actual position of uuv represents η x y

explains the geometric relationship between position velocity of uuv dynamic modeling analyses forces changes of uuv during the accelerated motion process yang et al 2015 2 2 1 kinematic modeling kinematic modeling involves the coordinate system of uuv including two parts the inertial coordinate and the body fixed coordinate the inertial coordinate which is also called the earth coordinate origin of it is a point on earth the body fixed coordinate is fixed on uuv origin of it is the carter of uuv gravity it moves along with uuv uuv coordinate systems are shown in fig 2 the uuv kinematics equation is 2 η j η v under normal circumstances six degrees of freedom are not fully considered it can be simplified according to the actual needs of decoupling four most common degrees of freedom surge sway heave and yaw are considered for the tracking control problem in three dimensional underwater environment in this paper that is η x y z ψ t and v u v w r t the kinematics

obtain thrusts is put forward the block diagram of dynamics tracking control based on qpso mpc and smc is illustrated in fig 5 the control system of uuv is composed of two parts qpso mpc based kinematic controller and smc based dynamic controller the qpso mpc kinematic controller consists of a linear error model system constraints and objective function solved by qpso the linear error model predicts future dynamic output of uuv based on prior information and future inputs which can provide better prior knowledge for system optimization system constraints make sure that the control system is carried out on the premise of meeting state and control constraints the objective function within qpso optimization process is the essence of mpc algorithm which guarantees that uuv can perform efficient and stable tracking control however in hardware system of uuv it is relies on the thrusters to offer forces to make uuv sail in that case the kinematic control design is not a complete control system for actual tracking control it is necessary to expand kinematic control to dynamic control the controlling value obtained by qpso optimization in kinematic way is employed as input to dynamic control then forces moments calculated by sliding mode control drive uuv to track the reference trajectory 3 1 the kinematic controller based on qpso mpc 3 1 1 uuv linear error model the uuv system can be seen as a control system with input v u v w r t and the state η x y z ψ t where its general form is 13 η f η v for a given reference trajectory each point on that satisfies the above kinematic equation with the subscript d representing the reference and the general form is 14 η d f η d v d where η d x d y d z d ψ d t v d u d v d w d r d t by using taylor series expansion and ignoring the higher order terms in 13 at the reference trajectory point then 13 can be obtained as 15 η f η d v d f η v η η η d v v d η η d f η v v η η d v v d v v d the uuv error model can be

problem based on qpso the deviation of system state and optimization of control should be added so that the objective function is able to ensure that uuv can track desired trajectory rapidly and smoothly here it takes the form of the objective function as follows when designing tracking controller 18 j k i 1 n p η k i t η r e f k i t q 2 i 0 n c 1 δ v k i t r 2 where q and r are weight

controller which means the desired velocity in dynamics controller is v c δ v t v d 3 2 dynamic controller based on sliding mode control 3 2 1 sliding mode control uuv is a typical strong coupling and nonlinear system the traditional linear control method is not applicable meanwhile complex hydrodynamic parameters are difficult to calculate and the motion also changes with time it s unrealistic to establish an accurate dynamic model so many model based control methods are hard to control uuv precisely sliding mode control method is often used in trajectory tracking of uuv because of its insensitivity to parameter variations and external disturbance strong robustness no need to model accurately in order to overcome the chattering problem in sliding mode control a new adaptive sliding mode controller replacing the switch item with adaptive item is proposed in this character 3 2 2 the smc based dynamic controller v c represents the expected velocity given by the kinematic controller v represents the actual velocity of uuv virtual tracking velocity error is laid out as 28 e v c v there are two steps in the design of smc controller first one is the selection of sliding manifold and the second one is the design of control law it is very important to select appropriate sliding manifold which is related to the quality factor and robustness of sliding mode control in general the sliding manifold can be selected as follows soylu et al 2008 29 s d d t λ 2 e d t e 2 λ e λ 2 e d t where s is the selected sliding manifold and λ is a constant coefficient positive definite matrix when system reaches sliding manifold and is carrying out on sliding manifold which means the derivation of 29 equals to 0 30 s e 2 λ e λ 2 e e 2 λ v c v λ 2 e 0 m v c v v d v v g η τ is transformed to

since the calculation of e is complex there is a convenience sample method called error acceleration feedback control which is used to calculate e 33 e k e where k is constant coefficient the equivalent control law after substitution is as follows 34 τ e q m ˆ v c k e 2 λ λ 2 e c ˆ v d ˆ v g ˆ in order to eliminate the chattering problem caused by the discontinuous switching term an adaptive term is used to replace the switching term so a new adaptive sliding mode controller can be obtained the adaptive term is designed as follows 35 τ a d τ e s t k c ˆ 2 λ s where τ e s t is the adaptive variation used to estimate the unknown quantity τ and k is a constant scalar representing the strictly positive constant for the convergence rate of the controller the adaptive variation satisfies the following update rate τ e s t γ s γ is the constant coefficient of s determining the rate of adaption then the complete control law of the adaptive sliding mode controller can be expressed as 36 τ τ e q τ a d τ e q τ e s t k c ˆ 2 λ s 3 2 3 stability analysis for nonlinear system like uuv in this paper construct lyapunov function as follows 37 v 1 4 λ s t m s 1 2 θ t γ 1 θ

unknown error term and eventually converge to zero even in the worst case system stability can also be guaranteed by increasing k and γ there are assumptions that must be known such as hypothesis 1 uncertain dynamics term τ r is bounded hypothesis 2 if τ r t γ 1 θ 0 then s t k s τ r t γ 1 θ v 0 can be inferred from hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 so that the energy function of uuv system can converge to zero from any initial value based on the lyapunov stability criterion uuv system is stable 4 simulation results and analysis in this chapter falcon uuv has been used to get the related simulation experiment the structure thrusters arrangement and thrust normalization of falcon have been described above in detail firstly genetic ga algorithm particle swarm optimization pso algorithm and quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso algorithm are applied to model predictive control to solve the optimization problem it verifies that qpso can converge to the optimal solution quickly and stably which makes its tracking performance obviously better than ga and pso then to verify the effectiveness of the new hybrid trajectory tracking control algorithm proposed in this paper the traditional backstepping control algorithm and the new algorithm based on qpso mpc are simulated for falcon uuv respectively through the comparison of two algorithms for tracking performance and controlling variables change including velocities and thrusts it is demonstrated that the control algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively restrain the speed jump phenomenon and deal with the problem of thrust overrun lastly the robustness of the proposed method is verified by simulation cases here two typical kinds of different reference trajectories are simulated which are spiral line trajectory and piecewise line trajectory 4 1 simulation comparisons of optimization algorithms for verifying the global convergence and stability of qpso genetic algorithm hereinafter referred to as ga and particle swarm optimization hereinafter referred to as pso are employed into the rolling optimization part of mpc to form three different kinds of mpc in kinematic part which respectively refer to ga mpc pso mpc and qpso mpc asmc is adopted in dynamic part for three mpc methods a simulation case of tracking classical spiral line is given in this chapter it is assumed that the actual initial position of falcon is 2 2 0 0 and the desired initial positon is 0 0 0 0 then initial state error is 2 2 0 0 the simulation time is set from 0 to 60s the given trajectory is presented as x d t 5 sin 0 2 t y d t 5 5 cos 0 2 t z d t 0 1 t ψ d t 0 2 t u d t 1 v d t 0 w d t 0 1 r d t 0 2 the parameters of controller are set as follows the parameters related to dynamics for simulation are λ 1 k 1 k 50 γ 1 for ga mpc pso mpc and qpso mpc there are some of the same parameters such as the predictive domain ν p 10 and the control domain ν c 1 however for three kinds of optimization algorithms they all have to set up the parameters named the population size hereinafter referred to popsize and the maximal number of iterations hereinafter referred to maxiter for pso and qpso these two parameters directly affect the optimization performance and the algorithms stability for ga there are also two important factors namely crossover probability pc and mutation probability pm the values of these parameters are indicated in table 1 fig 7 shows tracking results of ga mpc pso mpc and qpso mpc for tracking a spiral line the black curve is the given reference trajectory the green one is the trajectory tracked by ga mpc the cyan one is the trajectory tracked by pso mpc the red one is the trajectory tracked by qpso mpc the comparison of tracking error curves is given in fig 8 for ga mpc the green line there are four factors that directly determine the optimization results in order to compare with qpso mpc popsize and maxiter are set as 30 for both two methods several experiments were carried out on the values of mutation probability and crossover probability the values in table 2 are obtained to get a better tracking performance in fig 7 however the convergence speed of ga mpc is slow qpso mpc can make uuv track the desired trajectory after 10s but ga mpc method weren t able to achieve roughly stable tracking until after 30s moreover ga requires tedious coding and decoding operations which makes the running time needed in simulink much longer than that of qpso in comparison with ga qpso has fast convergence speed and fewer parameters need to be adjusted which is also easy to program and run fast for pso mpc the cyan line pso algorithm can t guarantee convergence to global optimal solution which leads to the repeated oscillation occurs when tracking the reference trajectory even the population size and maximal iterations are increased to five times of qpso mpc the tracking effect of pso mpc is not good and still in the oscillation state in contrast qpso mpc not only ensures fast search speed and global convergence but also achieves stable and efficient tracking control 4 2 spiral line tracking the reference trajectory and given speed for spiral line in this chapter can be consulted in chapter 4 1 the control parameters are set as follows in tables 2 and 3 which were achieved through several simulation results the simulation results tracked by qpso mpc and backstepping control are laid out in fig 9 it shows that the two methods are able to make uuv reach and track the reference trajectory smoothly from the tracking performance two control methods have achieved similar results however the tracking speed and thrust response of two controllers are obviously different which will be analyzed in the following speed contrast of two controllers is shown in fig 10 where the black dotted line represents the maximal value and minimal value of speed shown in 19 since the spiral line is continuous and differentiable everywhere the primary problem of tracking control is the speed jump phenomenon due to the initial position errors in order to be more intuitive to present the velocity changes in initial tracking process here just cut out the first 10s of simulation curve to analyze after 10s both of these two methods have tracked the reference trajectory steadily and it makes little sense to compare them after 10s table 4 presents the velocity change of uuv moving from the starting point 0 to first point 1 the value beyond 2 2 is marked in red at the initial moment for the backstepping control the speed jump phenomenon is produced due to the control law of it is related to the large state error directly for example u c is changed from 0 m s to 5 m s when uuv moves from the initial position to next one position the speed change value δ u c t is up to 5 m s which is beyond the maximal speed 2 m s of uuv it means that the excessive speed changed will be generated in short time by using backstepping control to track this leads to the presence of too large acceleration which requires a sufficiently large thrust it is very obvious beyond the maximal thrust limit of thruster which can also be confirmed from the normalized thrust diagram it is evident from table 4 that qpso mpc limits the speed within the range of 2 m s to 2 m s overall qpso mpc can restrict the speed within the specified range which is solving the problem of speed jump in backstepping control fig 11 is normalized thrust comparison of two controllers in first 10s due to the thrust of thruster has been normalized it should meet the constraint 1 t i 1 i 1 2 3 4 5 as can be seen from fig 11 the normalized thrusts of backstepping control do not satisfy the constraint table 5 displays the maximum of 5 thrusters under control of backstepping control and qpso mpc the thrust value exceeding the prescribed range 1 1 is marked in red which directly reflects the thrust overrun problem in the early stages of tracking t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 generated by backstepping control are all over the range of 1 to 1 for example the maximal normalized thrust of t 4 is even up to 4 5457 even if the tracking simulation result of backstepping control is very good but it is impossible to achieve such accurate tracking in the actual situation nevertheless t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 generated by qpso mpc are all up to the standard in summary the application of qpso mpc can overcome the problem of thrust overrun which the control effect is better than that of backstepping control 4 3 piecewise line tracking based on the simulation results of tracking spiral line explained above it is shown that qpso mpc can solve the speed jump caused by the initial posture error and the thrust overrun problem however the spiral line is a continuous trajectory this section will further discuss the speed jump problem of discrete trajectory the trajectory is continuous but not differentiable the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm the reference trajectory is a piecewise line in three dimensional environment and the initial position of uuv is not on the reference trajectory its initial position is η x y z ψ t 2 0 2 0 t the piecewise line trajectory is a subsection function which can be defined as follows when 0 t 20 s η d x d t 0 15 t 3 y d t 0 15 t z d t 0 15 t 3 ψ d t π 4 u d t 0 3 v d t 0 w d t 0 15 r d t 0 when 20 s t 40 s η d x d t 0 15 t 20 6 y d t 3 z d t 6 ψ d t 0 u d t 0 15 v d t 0 w d t 0 r d t 0 when 40 s t 60 s η d x d t 0 15 t 40 9 y d t 0 15 t 40 3 z d t 0 15 t 40 6 ψ d t π 4 u d t 0 3 v d t 0 w d t 0 15 r d t 0 time varies from 0 to 60s and the sampling time t is 0 1s there are 600 trajectory points the control parameters are set as follows in tables 2 and 3 the tracking performance of two controllers is shown in fig 12 pay attention to the tracking performance in the initial stage and round the two turning points b c why the tracking performance of qpso mpc method is worse than that of backstepping control method because the control law of backstepping method is connection with posture error directly it only takes the tracking performance into account but does not consider whether the velocities and thrusts are beyond the limits of uuv this also leads to speed jump and thrust overrun problems experienced in backstepping control nonetheless the reason why tracking performance of qpso mpc is bit worse is thinking about the velocities and thrusts should be in the range offered by uuv so the tracking performance of qpso mpc in fig 12 is the balance between the control performance and velocities thrusts constraint optimization in that way the tracking speed and thrust response of two controllers are obviously different correlation analysis of velocities and forces will be analyzed in the following speed contrast of two controllers is displayed in fig 13 table 6 shows the maximum value of each speed simulated by two controllers the speed value exceeding the prescribed range is marked in red at the initial moment because of the large error between desired state and actual state high speed should be needed to make uuv reach the reference trajectory as soon as possible the change of surge speed u c heave speed w c and yaw speed r c of backstepping control are all over the range of 2 m s which can be seen very clearly in table 6 but the four speeds of qpso mpc are all within the specified range considering that the only difference between the discrete trajectory and continuous trajectory is the state mutation at the turning points which will cause the speed jump problem and the thrust overrun phenomenon the so called state mutation means the sudden change of angle at the turning points so the angular velocity and yaw moment change most obviously at the turning points table 7 shows the speed jump values at turning points b and c for backstepping control the yaw velocity r c has the speed jump problem at the turning points for example when r c is 0 0007 rad s at point 200 it becomes 2 3555 rad s at next point 201 hence the speed jump value δ r c is 2 3562 rad s nevertheless the velocity r c of qpso mpc is 0 0004 rad s at point 200 and becomes 0 367 rad s at next point 201 with the speed jump value δ r c 0 3666 rad s only which is smaller than the speed jump of backstepping control that s all saying the yaw moment of backstepping control is much larger than that of qpso mpc when realizing the accurate trajectory tracking control in other words thrusters produced by backstepping control method may exceed the maximal value of thrusters can provide which can also be confirmed from the normalized thrust diagram in the following normalized thrust comparison of two controllers is displayed in fig 14 the thrust of thruster has been normalized and it should meet the constraint 1 t i 1 i 1 2 3 4 5 fig 14 is the forces comparison in whole 60s fig 15 is the detail figures amplifying three parts of fig 14 for observing the thrust change at the initial moment and turning points fig 15 a is the normalized thrust in 0 2s t 2 t 3 t 5 of backstepping control are all beyond the specified range however all normalized thrusts of qpso mpc are in the specified range 1 1 the normalized thrust at the turning point will be emphatically analyzed for a piecewise line trajectory here is taken the turning point b as an example the angle change of uuv involves all 5 thrusters between 19 5s and 20 5s reach point b at 20s it can be seen from fig 16 b that there are sharp changes at the turning point on 5 thrusters normalized thrusts under control of backstepping t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 are all exceeding the specified range 1 1 the maximum values of t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 under control of backstepping are shown in table 8 the speed value exceeding the prescribed range is marked in red that means even if the tracking simulation result of backstepping control is very good but it is impossible to achieve in the actual situation however from fig 15 b and c the normalized thrust at the turning point under control of qpso mpc has a beating but the fluctuation is small and it is within the specified range as also can be seen from table 8 the maximal values of t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 are all within 1 1 which can overcome the problem of thrust overrun but it is worth noting that qpso mpc method limits the velocity range forcibly which restricts thrust within saturation range so the respond time and tracking performance will be affected inevitably the tracking results obtained ultimately is the balance between control performance and thrust constraints it can be known from the above two simulation results that backstepping control can make uuv accurately tracking reference trajectory in the simulation environment but considering that the velocity and force provided by uuv are limited the tracking results of backstepping control in real underwater environment are much worse than that in simulation environment and may not even finish the tracking task by comparison qpso mpc can inhibit the excessive velocity and force and its application on uuv can solve the speed jump and drive saturation problems in backstepping control so as to meet the physical constraints of thrust of uuv and to further realize the trajectory tracking control of uuv very well 4 4 feasibility of tracking in large scale in order to verify the proposed method can be applied in real ocean environment the feasibility analysis of tracking in large scale environment which is closer to the actual marine environment is given in this chapter fig 16 shows the spiral tracking in a 100 m 150 m 80 m space and the simulation time is set as 500 s fig 17 is a polyline tracking with a simulation time of 300 s in a 150 m 150 m 80 m environment as can be seen from figs 16 and 17 the proposed method can also achieve stable and accurate tracking performance in a large scale environment 4 5 robustness analysis when operating at different depths of the ocean the hydrodynamic parameters of uuv will be changed with the underwater environment the hydrodynamic parameters at this time can t be accurately obtained in virtue of the limitations of the current measurement techniques therefore in this situation the control system should be strongly robust to parameters uncertainty in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for parameters uncertainty the parameters errors of 40 20 and 10 are added into the dynamic model respectively the simulation results generated by qpso mpc and asmc under different conditions are provided in figs 18 and 19 the spiral and polyline simulation cases for parameters setting refer to chapter 4 4 are employed to verify qpso mpc tracking performance when existing parameter uncertainty the black line is the reference trajectory the blue dotted line the red dotted line and the green dotted line respectively represent the tracking results using qpso mpc asmc with 40 20 and 10 errors on the dynamic matrix figs 18 and 19 given the tracking results comparison with parameter uncertainty condition 40 20 and 10 errors respectively it can be clearly seen from two figures that under the circumstance of different parameter uncertainty the tracking performances are basically the same and the tracking error is tiny and basically can be ignored consequently it is able to be considered that the proposed tracking control method has strong robustness to overcome the parameter uncertainty problem and achieve stable tracking 5 conclusion in this paper the trajectory tracking control of uuv in three dimensional underwater environment is investigated from kinematic way to dynamic way on the basis of qpso mpc mentioned on the previous work the kinematic control is further extended to dynamic control a cascade control algorithm combined qpso mpc and smc has been proposed the algorithm is divided into two parts the kinematic controller which restrains the velocity within the preset range and the dynamic controller which achieves stable tracking control in actual situation the proposed method solves the speed jump problem and avoids the drive saturation when comparing with backstepping control the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in various environments is verified by the simulation experiments on tracking continuous and discrete curves in three dimensional environment in the future the kinematic and dynamic tracking control under the ocean current situation will be worked out in the further research

23402,conical grouted joints have been proposed as a solution for the relative settlement observed between the sleeve and the pile on monopiles for wind turbines in this paper the influence of the design parameters such as steel wall thicknesses and conical angle on the failure modes associated to continual loadings are assessed based on finite element analysis it is found that both the sleeve s and pile s wall thicknesses have a significant impact on the grouted joint health namely the larger are the wall thicknesses the more vulnerable the grout is with respect to fatigue and material degradation but the more limited the progressive settlement is and inversely this implies that the appropriate wall thicknesses should be chosen by designers having in mind that neither extreme is conservative based on statistical modeling the grout length is found to be the most influential parameter of the settlement caused by extreme loadings longer grout significantly contributes to the reduction of extreme settlement to ensure that the inevitable settlement does not jeopardize the joint s structural integrity a probability based method has been developed to estimate the minimal gap between the pile top and the brackets required to achieve a targeted annual reliability index of 3 3 keywords multi megawatt wind turbines conical grouted joint progressive settlement finite element reliability analysis 1 introduction in order to support the wind turbines placed at seas monopile substructures are the most frequently employed types in commercial wind farms kallehave et al 2015 relying on experience from the oil and gas industry the connections between the transition piece and the monopile for wind turbine support structures are made by the means of grouted joints classically the grouted joints for monopile substructures are built from the overlap of two cylindrical tubes a transition piece and a pile and the resulting annular gap is filled with a high strength concrete the grouted joints are efficient as they are easily constructible and they serve to correct the pile misalignment due to driving errors schaumann et al 2013 as presented in fig 1 a typical construction process follows few steps 1 the transition piece is jacked up at the pile top edge using jacking brackets 2 the concrete is poured in the annulus and left for curing and 3 after the concrete has hardened the jack ups are removed and the transition piece holds due to the passive friction resistance at the contact faces between the layers the passive friction resistance is made of two contributions which are the chemical adhesive bond between the concrete and the steel and the mechanical interlock between the rough concrete surface and the undulations on the steel surfaces an additional contribution coulomb friction is generated during the loading operations by the normal to the interface components of the loads transferred from the transition piece to the pile after few cycles gaps open between the grout and the steel walls at the connection top and bottom the adhesive bond deteriorates and cannot recover furthermore the friction abrades the geometrical imperfections at the adjacent surfaces over the whole connection length at very early age of the structure the two initial contributions depreciate and only the coulomb friction persists which is only effective when the normal pressure is present in case of insignificant normal pressure the shear resistance may not support the weight of the structure anymore and the transition piece will progressively slide downwards until the jacking brackets touch the pile top edge the connection fails this failure mode has been observed in some commercial wind farms dallyn et al 2015 in order to constantly keep the shear resistance two principal solutions were proposed dnvgl 2016a dnvgl 2016b the conical grouted joint and the shear keyed grouted joints fig 2 illustrates both proposed solutions the conical grouted joint is derived from the convention grouted joint by imposing a small conical angle 1 3 to the overlapping tubes with the conical angle the effect of the structure weight on the connection decomposes into a shear component along the contact faces and a normal component to the contact faces the latter component generates a permanent coulomb friction resistance which prevents the failure described above the alternative solution adds shear keys to the inner faces of the steel walls close to the connection middle in order to enhance the mechanical interlock the resulting friction resistance is said active it is not advisable to put shear keys close to the connection edges as the gap openings will nullify their effect in either solution as the passive mechanical interlock and the adhesive bond are ephemeral it is realistic to carry out analysis without accounting for their respective contributions nielsen 2007 as many studies devoted attention to the shear keyed grouted joints e g schaumann et al 2013 dallyn et al 2015 lotsberg 2013 lotsberg et al 2012 schaumann and raba 2015 schaumann et al 2014 this work will focus on the conical solution which is also addressed in lotsberg et al 2012 lee et al 2014 for example whereas lotsberg et al 2012 lotsberg et al 2012 have introduced the concept of conical grouted joints as a solution to limit settlements lee et al 2014 lee et al 2014 have presented a reliability based design optimization method for conical grouted joints they have considered various limit states except the grout degradation and the progressive settlement which has been proven crucial for grouted joints this article aims at investigating the behavior under continual loadings of the conical grouted joint based on detailed finite element analysis over years in addition to fatigue the grout material will progressively lose its elastic modulus nielsen 2007 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 which might impact the support structure stiffness the influence of the design parameter such as pile s wall thickness transition piece s wall thickness and conical angle on the grouted joint performance under continual loadings will be assessed although the conical shape of grouted joints will reduce the progressive settlement of the transition piece its vertical displacement cannot completely be precluded as materials have finite elastic moduli even if appropriate designs lead to acceptable progressive settlement at the end of their lifetime under normal conditions higher vertical displacement can be expected after extreme events therefore provisions should be given such that extreme settlements do not close the gap between the brackets and the pile top otherwise loads will not follow the same path or be transferred anymore as intended hence a procedure to estimate the minimum gap between the brackets and the pile top required to achieve a targeted annual reliability index of 3 3 is established this problem formulation is preferred to counterpart that consists in designing the grouted joint in such way that the vertical settlement lies below a certain threshold in fact as long as the settlement is not excessive the size of the gap will not strongly influence the remaining design features 2 site conditions structure and design constraints 2 1 metocean conditions the selected site is located in the north sea at 53 13 04 0 n and 3 13 13 0 e and its metocean conditions are given by von borstel 2013 the operational wind range goes from 4 m s to 25 m s and is binned into 11 intervals whose centres are 2 m s apart each mean wind speed bin is associated with a turbulence level as presented in table 1 the expected values of the sea states are conditional on each mean wind speed pierson moskowitz or jonswap spectra are used to model the wave height in case of normal operations or extreme cases respectively the mean sea level msl is 26 0 m above the seabed the verification of the grouted joint structure is done under loading cases corresponding to the wind turbine operations for the continual loadings the design load case dlc 1 2 the international electrotechnical commission 2005 is considered and for the extreme loading design load case that drives the ultimate limit state dlc 1 3 the international electrotechnical commission 2005 is used as it has been shown by njomo wandji et al 2017 to be critical at the grouted joint level dlc 1 2 is characterized by the wind normal turbulence and dlc 1 3 by the wind extreme turbulence the wind direction distribution is depicted by fig 3 as indicated by ref de vries 2011 from the metocean conditions of the selected site a statistical model describing the extreme loading case is prepared as tabulated in table 2 a probabilistic study is carried out only for the ultimate limit state whereas the limit case associated to the continual loadings will be studied based on load resistance factor design method the extreme turbulence intensity is computed based on the formula recommended by iec 61400 1 ed 3 the international electrotechnical commission 2005 and polynomials have been used to fit the relationship between the significant wave height and the wave peak period from table 1 and the mean wind speed during the sampling from this statistical model each mean wind speed will be associated to a unique seed 2 2 soil properties the soil conditions are the same as those used in njomo wandji et al 2017 the top 90 0 m are made of four layers of medium to highly dense sand the soil data presented in table 3 are assumed deterministic 2 3 wind turbine for case study the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine dtu 10 mw rwt bak et al 2013 is selected for the case study as a relevant turbine that depicts future large offshore installations it is a variable speed pitch controlled conceptual offshore wind turbine with 10 mw rated power its other key design properties are tabulated in table 4 the operational rotor speed range intersects the three first rotor harmonics 1p 2p and 3p within the ranges 0 10 hz 0 16 hz 0 30 hz 0 48 hz and 0 60 hz 0 96 hz respectively the wind turbine parameters are deterministic in this study 3 descriptive parameters of the grouted joint 3 1 grouted joint topology and dimensions the conical grouted joint is made of double co axial frusto conical tubes overlapping each other whose annulus is filled with a concrete grout the outer frustum is the transition piece or sleeve and the inner frustum is the pile fig 4 presents the topology and the dimension labels of a typical conical grouted joint the nomenclature is given in table 5 the relative position of the connection top with respect to the mean water level can also be considered as a design parameter for the reliability analysis the geometry is considered deterministic however it has been varied within realistic bounds for the sensitivity analysis presented in subsequent sections table 6 tabulated the bounds used for the sensitivity analysis 3 2 materials constitutive behaviour and parameter values the grouted joint is made of two principal materials steel and concrete and one interface steel concrete contact the steel material is assumed elastic transitioning into perfectly plastic the characteristic values of its properties are indicated by cremer and heckl 1988 cremer and heckl 1988 and dnv 0s j101 det norske veritas 2014 the joint committee on structural safety jcss joint committee on structural safety 2001 gives the statistical properties of the steel material as summarised in table 7 the grout is a high strength concrete of grade c120 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 nielsen 2007 nielsen 2007 proposed three candidates as constitutive formulation of the response for the grout the most sophisticated and most adapted alternative is the damaged plasticity model nielsen 2007 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 abaqus 2011 tyau 2009 this formulation models strain hardening and softening and thereby also cracking and crushing moreover it captures the material degradation along the loading cycles by altering the material stiffness as well as it accounts for material recovery fig 5 depicts the said formulation for the uniaxial load cycle path with the extreme cases of stiffness recovery factors while the yield surfaces are illustrated in fig 6 the basic relationships between the uniaxial parameters can be found in model code 2010 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 the parameters of this model and their values are taken or adapted from tyau 2009 tyau 2009 and are given in table 8 and table 9 together with their statistical distributions for the compressive strength the distribution is given by jcss joint committee on structural safety 2001 the mean by model code 2010 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 and the coefficient of variation is obtained from aitcin 2004 cauberg et al 2013 nowak rakoczy which indicate as appropriate values about 11 for samples from random producer and approximately 5 for samples within the same batch for the poisson s ratio model code 2010 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 sets the range between 0 14 and 0 26 the distribution type and the coefficient of variation are assumed based on engineering judgement the strain degradation relationships and some concrete properties in table 8 are set deterministic mainly due to lack of information the concrete intrinsic parameters density characteristic strength and poisson s ratio are given by model code 2010 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 the contacts between the steel walls and the grout surfaces are modelled according to the classic hard contact theory abaqus 2011 this formulation assumes that the sticking contributions from geometric imperfections and chemical adhesion are negligible nielsen 2007 therefore only the coulomb friction contributes to the stress transfer between the various parts with the absence of chemical adhesion and geometric imperfections the sliding parts can translate with respect to each other in the direction normal to the contact surface for a given normal pressure the shear strength is proportional to the coulomb friction coefficient i e the shear resistance is equal to the product between the normal pressure and the coulomb friction coefficient but does not exceed the shear strength in which case sliding occurs after the sticking phase the coulomb friction coefficient and the shear strength are respectively obtained from the experiments carried out by baltay and gjelsvik 1990 baltay and gjelsvik 1990 and rabbat and russell 1985 rabbat and russell 1985 table 10 presents the statistical properties of the contact used in this study 4 reference monopile substructure 4 1 boundary conditions and load assessment loads are assessed with the help of the aero hydro servo elastic software package hawc2 larsen and hansen 2015 it utilizes a multibody formulation which couples different elastic bodies together using timoshenko beam finite elements ankit et al 2016 chopra 1995 whereby their stiffness mass and damping are assembled into the governing equations of motion coupled to aerodynamic forces whose time domain solution is obtained using the newmark β method chopra 1995 cook et al 1989 the damping coefficients are specified using rayleigh coefficients chopra 1995 to obtain desired damping ratios for the global structure tarp johansen et al 2009 recommended 6 70 as overall structural logarithm decrement damping based on iec 61400 3 ed 1 the international electrotechnical commission 2009 two design load cases dlcs have been selected dlc 1 2 for the continual fatigue loading and dlc 1 3 for the extreme loading dlc 1 2 models the operational case associated to normal turbulence each mean wind speed is considered with six wind turbulence seeds no yaw error and no wave misalignment this set of conditions provides 11 6 66 scenarios of 10 min simulation durations dlc 1 3 considers normal operations with extreme turbulence but normal sea states six wind turbulence seeds for each of the 11 wind speed bins are simulated all assuming zero yaw error sea waves of jonswap type are aligned along the wind direction the loads

unit weight 4 2 limit states for the monopile design ultimate fatigue and serviceability limit states are selected to check the monopile substructure the ultimate limit state uls encompasses the strength limit state the stability limit state and the soil capacity limit state the strength limit state ensures that there is no yield of the steel material the utilization ratio u u l s 1 γ m γ c γ l σ v f y should be lower than one σ v is the hotspot von mises stresses obtained with hotspot stress components the partial safety factors are taken from sorensen and toft 2014 and from iec 61400 1 ed 3 the international electrotechnical commission 2005 γ m 1 30 γ c 1 10 and γ l 1 35 for extreme loads only are associated to the material properties to the component s consequence of failure and to the extreme loads respectively the stability limit state addresses the global and local buckling of the monopile for the global buckling the utilization factor u u l s 2 is computed as the combination of the respective ratios of the axial forces and bending moments applied at the column ends over their capacities reference is made to dnv rp c202 det norske veritas 2013 the utilization ratio of the local buckling is computed as u u l s 3 γ l σ v f k s d where f k s d is the design buckling strength as defined by dnv rp c202 det norske veritas 2013 both utilization ratios should be lower than one for structural safety the soil capacity limit state is checked by verifying that the equilibrium of the soil pile is not violated this means that for each failure mode the ratio of the load over the capacity should stay below one for the translation failure mode u u l s 4 γ m γ c γ l q r e s z p u where q r e s is the resulting acting horizontal force and for the rotation failure mode u u l s 5 γ

addition the accumulated fatigue damage during the structure lifetime assumed to be 25 years augmented by three equivalent years corresponding to the construction induced fatigue stolpe et al 2016 should be smaller than one the fatigue damage is aggregated using the palmgren miner s rule miner 1945 where the number of stress cycles are obtained by the rainflow counting method and the number of cycles to failure are computed with the design s n curve corresponding to the detail of type c1 for seawater with cathodic protection det norske veritas 2011 it is assumed that the cathodic protection is sufficient for the entire structure lifetime or can be renewed such that the protection against corrosion is always ensured over years the deformations of the pile soil system accumulate arany et al 2015 arany et al 2015 reported that the permanent displacement limits could be 20 cm and the permanent rotation limit 0 5⁰ at the pile head due to verticality error of driven pile the maximum allowable permanent rotation is reduced to 0 25⁰ lin and liao 1999 lin and liao 1999 proposed an experiment based method to evaluated the permanent strains of piles in sand due to cyclic lateral loads as also employed by achmus et al 2005 achmus et al 2005 this method will be used in this study reference is made to njomo wandji et al 2017 lin and liao 1999 and achmus et al 2005 for the details 4 3 reference design and verifications the design of the monopile consists of the determination of its dimensions outer diameter wall thickness and penetration depth such that the limit states are satisfied this study aims at the determination of a feasible reference substructure not an optimal or a ready to build design njomo wandji et al 2017 the determination process is iterative the initial and the retained reference values are given in table 11 fig 7 depicts the distribution of the utilization ratios corresponding to each limit states on the left the maximum utilization ratio for the uls 0 81 is obtained with the global buckling limit state and is lower than one the soil capacity is utilized at up to 1 69 for the translational failure mode and up to 23 47 for the bending failure mode on the center the maximum fatigue damage accumulated over 28 years is 0 99 which is smaller than one on the right the permanent displacement at the pile head is 3 32 cm which is lower than the allowable 20 cm and the permanent rotation is 0 15⁰ which is lower than the 0 25⁰ limit satisfying all the limit states with moderate reserve and feasible dimensions the reference design stands as a good candidate for this study 5 finite element model 5 1 substructure modelling and loading strategy for the detailed analysis of the grouted joint a finite element model fem is prepared on the abaqus platform abaqus 2011 in order to effectively couple the aero hydro servo elastic simulations with detailed soil boundary conditions the fem of the whole substructure could be prepared as presented on the center of fig 8 however the model would have been very expensive with no additional benefit bush and manuel 2009 have shown that the foundation models of apparent fixity type and of coupled spring type lead to similar fatigue behavior at the tower bottom than that of distributed spring type that is why the distributed spring foundation has been replaced by its equivalent apparent fixity model such that the mass the damping and the natural frequencies of the whole support structure is preserved this modelling strategy does not only result in a computationally moderate effort but also allows a high fidelity model which minimizes boundary effects the tower bottom loads are applied at the transition piece top the distributed loads along the transition piece aerodrag and the monopile sea loads have been modelled as nodal loads at 10 locations spread along the axis above the seafloor the loads have been applied in two steps first the self load of the structure is applied the transition piece settles onto the grout second the operational loads are then applied to the structure 5 2 finite elements element types and meshing size dnvgl rp 0419 dnvgl 2016b recommends to use 1st order shell elements for a steel wall in conjunction with 1st order solid elements for the grout this recommendation has been adopted for the finite element model prepared in this study an aspect ratio equal to one has been used for all elements for the steel wall elements of type s4rs have been selected which corresponds to 4 node doubly curved shell reduced integration hourglass control small membrane strains for the grout elements of type c3d8r are selected which corresponds to 8 node linear brick reduced integration hourglass control the relax stiffness method is used to control hourglass cook et al 1989 for the shell element and the pure stiffness method is used for that of the solid element for details of these methods reference is made to abaqus 2011 with the setup described above a convergence analysis was conducted in order to find out the appropriate size of a typical mesh element across the grout thickness three finite elements are used in accordance to dnvgl rp 0419 dnvgl 2016b various analyses have been conducted with different meshing arrangements several structural responses have been monitored at some selected hotspots the results at one of them are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that above 46500 mesh elements for the grout part the structural strain converges this corresponds to a mesh size of 20 cm 20 cm for the connection both grout and steel wall 6 limit states for the conical grouted joint design the design of the monopile substructure has ensured the safety of the steel components of the grouted joint this section will not address their limit states anymore rather it will focus on the grout material and the contact nielsen 2007 nielsen 2007 pointed out the almost inevitable appearance of the hairline cracks due to primary hoop stresses dallyn et al 2015 dallyn et al 2015 recognized the effect of these cracks in the reduction of bending stiffness but stating that the influence is limited about 5 as long as the lateral stresses are still transferred therefore the assumption made by lee et al 2014 lee et al 2014 is considered here the grout material does not support significant tensile stress in the hoop direction the grout is primarily in charge of transferring the pressure between the transition piece and the pile through shear friction thus limiting the slide of the transition piece the crack growths and their propagations are assumed sufficiently small such that their influences are limited these phenomena will not be considered in the subsequent analyses 6 1 limit states related to extreme events in the case of extreme loading three failure modes can be distinguished for the grouted connection failure of the steel grout contacts failure of the grout due to compressive stresses and excessive vertical displacement of the transition piece relative to the pile the shear stress τ due to the friction between the steel wall and the grout surfaces should be lower than the shear strength τ m a x of the interface to prevent excessive relative motion between the transition piece and the pile eq 3a this limit state is evaluated for both sides of the grout the tresca stress σ t r e s c a generated in the grout material should be kept lower than the concrete strength f c as specified by eq 3b moreover the relative settlement δ of the transition piece with respect to the pile under extreme loading should be moderate and is limited to a vertical settlement h see eq 4 3a g 1 τ m a x τ 3b g 2 f c σ t r e s c a 4 g 3 h δ 6 2 limit states related to continual loadings over the structure lifetime failures associated to continual loadings can occur they include the wear of the grout surfaces in contact with steel walls the reduction of the grout elastic modulus due to material degradation the fatigue of the grout material and the progressive vertical displacement of the transition piece relative to the pile as observed in some commercial wind systems the friction at the contact faces abrades the grout surfaces the wear rate is function of shear stress which is proportional to the normal pressure exerted from one layer to another in this paper the wear phenomenon is not investigated as a more sophisticated finite element model is required for an accurate prediction of the phenomenon two types of deterioration are engendered by continual loadings on grout material fatigue damage and degradation which are evaluated independently one to the other the concrete degradation corresponds to a variation diminution of elastic modulus with the possibility of material recovery as the word grade is generally used to characterize grout material strength the term degradation refers to the loss of its elastic modulus for the fatigue damage the s n curves have been calibrated based on samples that have been subjected to loadings till fatigue failure during the experiments the sample materials have been deteriorated continually and no full healing has been periodically assumed so the extrapolation of the fatigue damage includes the progressive degradation of the grout material therefore fatigue analyses do not require the monitoring of the damage parameters related to the degradation however it is relevant to monitor the appearance of cracks in the grout based on the damage parameters the reduction of the grout stiffness will be monitored based on the evolution of the material degradation parameters it is important to keep the severely affected areas marginal in the grout in order to preserve the bending stiffness of the substructure a change of the substructure bending stiffness can be noticed by following the lateral displacement of the interface for example subjected to cyclic loadings the connection engenders cyclic stresses that induce fatigue in the materials the accumulated fatigue d 25 in the grout during the intended lifetime calculated according to the palmgren miner assumption should be lower than one see eq 5 the rate of progression of the long term vertical settlement δ of the transition along the pile should be close to zero so that over time the initial gap g between the pile top edge and the brackets see eq 6 does not completely close 5 g 4 1 00 d 25 6 g 5 g δ h 7 behavior of the grouted joint under continual loadings 7 1 fatigue loads and resulting stresses fatigue loads result from dlc 1 2 simulations some load samples at the interface resulting from 13 m s mean wind speed are presented in fig 10 dynamic finite element analyses carried out with this loading set result in stresses in the grout material for fatigue assessment the influence of multiaxial stress states is generally accepted insignificant therefore the focus is on principal stresses as illustrated for few selected hotspots fig 11 in fig 12 and during a turbulent wind with mean speed of 13 m s whereas the structural responses of the grouted joint are computed over the whole mesh domain the hotspots are selected only to collect the stress and material degradation time series in fig 12 the positive sign refers to tension the minimum principal stresses are mainly of compressive type whereas the maximum principal stresses are of tensile type 7 2 degradation of the concrete following the concrete damaged plasticity model abaqus 2011 the occurrences of plastic strain generate the tridimensional degradation either of compressive d c or of tensile d t types in the grout material the equivalent degradation d which combines the effect of the compressive and of the tensile degradation alters the elastic stiffness of the concrete d e l t δ t 1 d t δ t d e l t where d e l is the material stiffness matrix the scalar degradation variable d is computed based on the tensile and compressive degradation variables 1 d 1 s t d c 1 s c d t d c and d t are taken as the maxima between their respective previous state values and the present state values obtained by interpolation in table 9 s t 1 w t r σ ˆ and s c 1 w c 1 r σ ˆ w t and w c are the recovery factor indicated in table 8 r σ ˆ i 1 3 σ ˆ i i 1 3 σ ˆ i is a stress weight factor equal to one if all principal stress components σ ˆ i i 1 2 3 are positive or zero if they are negative is the macaulay bracket fig 13 presents the evolution of the material degradation over 600 s with 13 m s mean wind speed and normal turbulence on the left the history data of the compressive degradation at the selected hotspots are shown similar data are shown for the tensile degradation on the center of the figure these two quantities monotonically increase over time on the right the time series of equivalent degradation variable is presented due to the material recovery phenomenon the degradation variable can reduce the plots show that the tensile degradation mainly contributes to the degradation variable compared to the compressive degradation this was expected as the plastic tensile stresses reach relatively higher levels compared to those from compressive ones for comparable magnitudes of strain in table 12 the visual history of the degradation variable is illustrated it shows that significant tensile degradation initiates before the compressive one the locus of degradation indicates a future appearance of hairline cracks in the meridional direction and concrete crushes at the grout edges these observations are in line with previous experimental or numerical studies presented by lee et al 2014 lee et al 2014 nielsen 2007 nielsen 2007 and dallyn et al 2015 dallyn et al 2015 the hairline cracks are due to the hoop stresses generated by the grout ovalization whereas the concrete crushes are the consequence of the compression of the transition piece towards the pile during operational oscillations of the support structure during the 600 s simulation the severely affected areas are marginal it can be expected that the joint preserves its connection bending stiffness as it will be seen later 7 3 fatigue of the concrete fatigue damage accumulates over lifetime due to cyclic stresses such as presented above dnvgl st 0126 2016 dnvgl 2016a proposes an algorithm to estimate the total damage the

characteristic grout cylinder strength measured in mpa c 1 calibration factor for structures in water c 1 10 0 for compression compression range and c 1 8 0 for compression tension range the damage accumulated over one year is linearly aggregated using eq 8 and the lifetime is calculated as l f d 1 1 and d 25 25 d 1 8 d 1 γ f f i n i δ σ t i δ σ n i δ σ where γ f f 3 0 is the fatigue reserve factor and t i δ σ is the occurrence frequency in one year of stress range δ σ which is counted n i δ σ times in the simulation time fig 14 presents the spatial distribution of the fatigue damage accumulated over 25 years on an unrolled grout accounting for the full directionality of the loads as the grout has been meshed in three layers across its thickness the respective fatigue damage levels of the different layers are shown the cumulative fatigue damage level at the critical hotspot is lower than one the alignment of the peaks of fatigue damage on the surfaces suggests the nascence of the hairline cracks as indicated by the previous observations it can also be noticed that fatigue affects the top edge of the grout on the transition face this was expected as the highest compressive stresses are transferred from the transition piece to the pile through the grout top edge the fatigue damage magnitudes indicate that the proposed design is not optimal with respect to the fatigue limit state carrying out a deterministic optimization design lee et al 2014 have shown that decreasing the grouted joint mass contributes to the increase of fatigue lifetime of the structure the sensitivities of the design parameters have been evaluated based on a design of experiment and using analysis of variance they have found that the wall thicknesses of the steel components were the variables that had the most influence on the fatigue lifetime indeed the wall thickness of the transition piece has a sensitivity of 46 whereas the wall thickness of the pile has a sensitivity of 35 the other variables were length of the grout 10 conical angle 3 pile s radius 1 grout s elastic modulus 1 steel s elastic modulus 1 and loads axial force torsional moment maximum bending moment and minimum bending moment 1 grout s thickness 0 contact friction 0 in order to investigate the influence of the wall thickness of the steel components a design with the other dimensions unchanged has been prepared with transition piece s wall thickness changed from 60 mm to 80 mm and pile s wall thickness changed from 70 mm to 100 mm load assessment has been done and the monopile substructure has been proven sufficient for the serviceability fatigue and ultimate limit states as per the reference monopile the results are not shown here for readability the evaluation of fatigue damage for this modified structure over the lifetime is depicted in fig 15 the mid layer and the outer layer show fatigue damage levels lower that one at all points whereas a minimal region of the inner layer has a damage level of 1 12 the hairline cracks and the vulnerability of the top edge can still be observed it is noticeable that the loci of high fatigue damage are at the top edge and along the meridian at 0⁰ where loads are primarily transferred the variation of the fatigue lifetime between both designs can be explained by the compressive stresses generated in the grout with thick steel walls the structural system is more rigid and the transition piece squeezes the grout more during load transfer thus higher compressive stress levels are generated within the grout material as shown by fig 16 where the compressive stresses are up to 9 mpa whereas they were up to 3 5 mpa with thinner walls see fig 12 7 4 vertical settlement with the progressive degradation of the grout the conical grouted joint could exhibit a gradual failure like the continuous settlement of the transition piece schaumann et al 2013 observed a continuous settlement of the transition piece on a cylindrical connection without shear keys where the passive shear resistance was due to coulomb friction and chemical adhesion they have explained that the vertical displacement is caused by the reduction of coulomb friction when the transition piece approaches its neutral position where the operational loads are small for the case in presence of conical grouted connection with the initial settlement already being undergone and under the assumption that the shear resistance is only due to coulomb friction a large amount of shear resistance is permanently due to the structural weight therefore it is expected that with a sufficient conical angle the settlement due to loss of coulomb friction is significantly reduced with a conical angle of 3⁰ simulation results depicted in fig 17 show i an initial vertical settlement due to the application of the dead load ii a slight gradual settlement due to the deformation of components steel and grout and grout degradation for simulation of 600 s duration the relationship between the grout degradation and the increase in vertical settlement can be observed in fig 15 for 13 m s mean wind speed as the degradation onsets in the grout at about 300 s the vertical settlement increases at that instant but tends to stabilize notwithstanding the apparition of cracks furthermore no trend change is observed during the 600 s simulation on the fore aft and the side side displacements suggesting no significant loss of the support structure global bending stiffness during the simulation period in case of bending stiffness reduction the amplitudes of the side side displacements would have increased and the means of the fore aft displacements would have shifted these observations are in line with the assumption that the hairline cracks do not significantly deter load transfer and also do not significantly elongate however it can be argued that 600 s simulations are not long enough to really capture a long term behavior of the connection therefore 1800 s simulations at 11 m s mean wind speed has been carried out fig 18 shows that the rate of vertical settlement of the interface central node continuously decreases even after 1800 s 7 5 effect of the conical angle in particular the influence of the conical angle on the vertical displacement of the interface is studied the structure dimensions are set as their nominal values see table 6 but the conical angle is varied from 1⁰ to 4⁰ the loading set corresponding to 11 m s mean wind speed is applied on the structure during 600 s and the displacement of the interface is monitored depicted in fig 19 the results show that both the initial settlement and the settlement rate reduce as the conical angle increases for small conical angles the settlement fails to stabilize during the 600 s suggesting a continuous vertical displacement till failure this indicates the necessity to choose a conical angle large enough to guarantee the grouted joint stability for the structure with thicker pile s and transition piece s wall the evolution of the interface vertical displacement is show in fig 20 for 1⁰ and 3⁰ conical angle it shows that with thicker steel wall the vertical displacement stabilizes quicker than with the reference design this is partly due to the high shear friction resistance generated due to the high compressive stresses exerted on the contact faces however with 1⁰ angle a two step phenomenon occurs the first step is the initial displacement due to the self weight which is larger for the thin wall case due to high steel flexibility and the lower shear friction resistance at the contact faces then the second step is the progressive settlement due to the operational loadings which is about 30 mm for the thin wall case and 70 mm for the thick wall case the greater vertical displacement in the case of thick walls can mainly be explained by the degradation of the grout material at about 100 s indeed during the first 100 s where both structures are intact the vertical displacement of the thin wall case is similar to that of the thick wall it is recalled that grout between thick steel walls is prone to rapid degradation due to high stresses generated by the compression it undergoes in short the comparison of the designs with different wall thickness ranges has shown that the wall thicknesses of the pile and transition piece impact the behavior of the grouted joint in a nonlinear manner thick walls negatively affect fatigue and grout degradation however the progressive settlement is reduced provided that grout degradation is minimal the opposite observation is done with the thin walls as summarized in table 13 in both cases high conical angle limits the vertical displacement of the transition piece however as mentioned before critical settlements can be due to the occurrence of extreme values of the load components and requirements to accommodate such deformation levels should be evaluated 8 structural responses under extreme loadings uls the selected structural responses under extreme loadings are the tresca stress in the concrete the shear stress at the contact faces and the vertical settlement investigations are carried out over the design space to determine their respective distributions and their sensitivities with respect to the design variables the design space consists of load variables geometry variables and material variables in this study the geometry variables are assumed deterministic but are varied within bounds to cover various possible designs of the grouted joint the probability density functions pdfs of the material variables are given in section 3 the pdfs of the extreme load variables are sought based on monte carlo simulations with n points for each point the load values that yield to extreme structural responses should be identified an approximate method for this identification is introduced as the 66 load variables are generated for one structural system by the same environmental conditions high correlations between the variables are expected the load set will then be reduced retaining only some variables taken as insufficiently correlated from the characterization of the reduced load set the pdfs of the whole set can be calculated 8 1 extreme loadings load assessment carried out in hawc2 under metocean conditions described by table 2 results in load time series collected at the 11 locations as described above the locations are numbered from 1 to 11 from bottom to top interface for each location six load time series are obtained corresponding to each degree of freedom ideally the ultimate structural responses should be obtained as the maximum of the structural response time series generated in the structure subjected to a set of load time series this requires that the finite element analysis is done for 600 s for a given set of load time series which is extremely computationally expensive in order to reduce the computational cost it is assumed that the ultimate structural responses occur when horizontal force vertical force bending moment or torsional moment measured at the center of the grouted joint is extreme this corresponds to four load criteria as depicted in fig 21 given a load criterion the time instant at which its extreme is attained is identified and the other load components corresponding to this instant are collected to form the set of contemporaneous extreme nodal loads resulting from the load scenarios a load scenario is understood here as an aero hydro servo elastic simulation with a given mean wind speed let take as an example the load criterion horizontal force the resultant horizontal force is obtained as the euclidian summation of the forces in x direction and y direction at the time t m when the extreme resultant horizontal force at the grouted joint center is attained the load vector f x t m f y t m f z t m m x t m m y t m m z t m is constructed for each of the 11 locations which gives 66 nodal loads this operation is repeated for the other three load criteria such that to every load scenario are related four sets of 66 nodal loads it can be noted that the nodal loads of interest are not necessarily the extreme values of their time series but the values that maximize the load criterion moreover as results from hawc2 are the internal loads at selected hotspots the distributed external loads at the 10 locations the interface is exempted are estimated as the difference between two consecutive hotspots 8 2 load randomness dimensionality reduction and parametrization for the probabilistic study of the grouted joint 500 data samples have been drawn from table 2 and the corresponding nodal loads are obtained from them given a load criterion each of the 66 nodal loads is established as a random variable numbered from 1 to 66 the first 6 variables are associated to location 1 the second 6 variables to location 2 and so forth fig 22 illustrates for the vertical force criterion the marginal distributions of the random variables numbered 1 6 i i 0 10 which correspond to f x at the eleven locations together with the one by one dependence structure between them as an example as it could be expected some variables are highly correlated as grouped with color in fig 20 physically the magenta colored variables mainly represent the hydrodynamic loads the cyan colored variable is the monopile section at the sea surface the red colored variables are primarily associated to the aerodynamic loads transmitted from the rotor and the green colored variable is the interface force in the side side direction this suggests that each group can be represented by one variable selected as insufficiently correlated and the other variables within the group are expressed as a function of it this reduces the set of 11 variables to four variables the same operation is carried out for all degrees of freedom resulting in the dimension reduction from m 66 to n 17 variables for the case of horizontal force criterion and to n 15 variables for the other criteria if z denotes the insufficiently correlated variables the dependent variables x can be obtained by 9 x m 1 α m n z n 1 β m 1 where α is the matrix of the scale factors obtained as the ratio of x s standard deviation over z s standard deviation and β is the vector of the shifts obtained as the difference between the x s average and the α z s average the marginals of the insufficiently correlated variables are modeled with parametric probability density functions pdfs three standard probability distributions gaussian johnson et al 1994 gumbel johnson et al 1995 and logistic johnson et al 1995 have been selected on the basis of their ability to represent the physical phenomena of interest here the gaussian is appropriate to accommodate the natural randomness contained in the environmental data the gumbel distribution is suitable for extreme values the difference of two gumbel distributed variables follows a logistic distribution as nodal loads are obtained as the difference of loads possibly gumbel distributed the logistic distribution is applicable each insufficiently correlated variable is tested against every selected probability distribution using kolmogorov smirnov test matlab 2016 with 0 05 significance level and the relevant pdf is identified as the probability distribution with the highest p values the null hypothesis poses that the insufficiently correlated variable data are from the assumed distribution fig 23 illustrates the marginals of the insufficiently correlated variables for the torsional moment criterion where the identified pdf and the corresponding p value are indicated the dependence structure within the sets of insufficiently correlated variables z is captured using gaussian copula abdallah 2015 which results in the joint probability distribution of the set of the insufficiently correlated random variables given the correlation matrix r of z the gaussian copula is defined as c u 1 u n ϕ r ϕ 1 u 1 ϕ 1 u n where u i f i z i f i cumulative distribution function cdf of the insufficiently correlated variable z i ϕ r is the joint cumulative distribution function of a n dimension multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equal to r and ϕ 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal the accuracy of the constructed dependence structure has been evaluated by comparing the correlation matrix from the observed data versus that of synthetic data generated from the constructed joint probability distribution the root mean square deviations rmsd between the correlation matrices of the two data sets are 1 12 0 85 0 83 0 60 for the horizontal force the vertical force the bending moment and the torsional moment criteria respectively 8 3 design space exploration in order to explore the design space uniformly distributed loads have been sampled within the bounds of the marginals defined as values corresponding to 10 7 cumulative and survival probabilities respectively the survival function is defined as the complementary cumulative distribution function fig 24 shows for the vertical force criterion as an example that the sampled loads cover well the tails of the variables suggesting a good representativeness of the edges of the design space the bounds have been defined similarly for the other load criterions they have been superimposed in order to find the global bounds and generate a unique uniform sampling for the four load criteria the results are depicted in fig 25 in addition the variables related to the material properties have been independently and uniformly sampled between the bounds found as per the load case the geometry related variables are also independently and uniformly sampled between the bounds as indicated in table 6 with the 500 uniformly sample variables describing loads material and geometry a batch of finite element simulations has been run in abaqus the absolute maxima of the structural responses pertaining to extreme loading which are the settlement of the transition piece relative to the pile the tresca equivalent stress in the concrete the shear forces at both sides of the contact grout steel have been collected fig 26 depicts the normalized safety margins for each structural response when the variables map the whole design space the safety margins are computed as the difference between the resistance parameters see eqs 3 and 4 and the structural responses respectively in preparing fig 26 the variable h in eq 4 has been set to 100 mm the difference is then divided by the respective characteristic values of the resistance parameters see tables 8 and 10 to obtain the normalized safety margins except for the settlement it can be noted that the safety margins of the other structural responses are all greater than zero indicating that failure will not arise from these failure modes therefore the reliability analysis will only focus on the failure mode respective to vertical displacement 8 4 sensitivity of the extreme vertical displacement with respect to the design parameters in order to assess the influence of the design parameters which are mainly the geometry and material types on the extreme vertical displacement a sensitivity analysis based on correlation between the design parameters and the structural responses has been carried out the sensitivity measures are computed as correlation coefficients between each design parameters and the structural response the correlation coefficients are calculated both as of pearson s or linear type abdallah 2015 and of spearman s or rank type abdallah 2015 fig 27 presents the resulting indices where the grout length demarcates from the rest of the parameters its index indicates that longer grouted connections generate lower relative displacements of the transition piece which can be explained by the fact larger surfaces offer larger shear resistance other parameters like the conical angle the position of the grouted joint with respect to the mean sea level and the transition piece s wall thickness show lesser influence on the extreme vertical displacement than that of the grout length this sensitivity analysis suggests that the set of variables of the system can be reduced further as only the connection length emerged as the key design variables of conical grouted joints during a design process whereas the material properties are generally known in advance the structural dimensions are primarily the sought variables thus from the set of material and geometry properties only the grout length is retained for further parametric study 9 prediction of the extreme settlement 9 1 problem formulation from each point of the simulation batch of size n described in section 8 the maximum vertical displacements δ i i 1 n are collected each can be seen as the peak of the time series of vertical displacement related to a given mean wind speed in this sense they are reasonably assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with this assumption the extreme value theory applies and the random variable δ i follows the cumulative distribution function cdf 10 f s x μ σ ε exp z x μ σ ε μ σ ε are the parameters of the cdf f s and z is a function of the random variable x for the traditional extreme value families gumbel frechet and weibull singh 1998 11 z x μ σ ε 1 ε x μ σ 1 ε with x μ σ ε ε 0 ε 0 μ σ ε ε 0 as a substitute of eq 11 several studies natarajan and holley 2008 natarajan and verelst 2011 have proposed a quadratic shape for z such that 12 z x μ σ ε μ x 2 σ x ε with x and have shown its appropriateness and its robustness for fitting extreme structural responses of various wind turbine structures furthermore the empirical cdf dimitrov 2015 is generally constructed by sorting the random variables δ i in ascending order so that each is associated to a rank d i the following expression of the empirical cdf can be written 13 f e δ d n 1 equating eq 10 and eq 13 the parameters μ σ ε can be obtained by regression hence the probability of exceeding a given vertical displacement is calculated as g δ 1 f s δ as per modern standards the targeted reliability index is about β 0 3 3 which corresponds to a targeted failure probability p f 0 4 93 10 4 this means that in order to be safe the grouted joint should be able to undergo a vertical displacement up to δ 0 g 1 p f 0 without any consequence on its structural integrity with an allowable settlement h δ 0 see eq 4 failure is not prevented the design should provide an allowable settlement greater than or equal to δ 0 9 2 provisions for a safe extreme settlement the reliability index is determined for a given design with given material and geometry properties in order to evaluate the survival distribution function sdf g the grouted joint design with similar properties have been binned with respect to grout length which is the primary influencing parameter four bins of equal width are constructed over the length range 9 m 25 m and the corresponding sdfs are fitted as illustrated in fig 28 for each bin the settlement threshold required to achieve the targeted annual reliability index is obtained by graphical projection for each bin range table 14 gives the settlement thresholds it shows that for the reference grouted joint which has 18 m grout length provisions for 72 mm of vertical displacement should be afforded for example the gap between the pile top edge and the jacking brackets should be at least 72 mm to ensure that with sufficient reliability the settlement of the transition piece does not create any consequence on the structural integrity within the framework of this study allowing a settlement of 72 mm is possible as the other failure modes associated to extreme events are proven improbably realizable in general in case high settlement cannot be afforded long grout should be used to achieve the required reliability 10 conclusion and recommendations for further studies in this paper the behavior of conical grouted joints under continual loadings is investigated based on short term numerical simulations three failure modes are considered the reduction of the grout elastic modulus due to successive yielding phenomena the fatigue of the grout material due to numerous repeated loading cycles and the progressive vertical displacement of the transition piece relative to the pile it is found that the transition piece s wall thickness and the pile s wall thickness have a significant impact on the realization of these failure modes the larger are the wall thicknesses the more vulnerable the grout is with respect to fatigue and material degradation but the more limited the progressive settlement is and inversely this implies that the appropriate wall thicknesses should be chosen by designers having in mind that neither extreme is conservative the reduction of support structure bending stiffness was not observed during short term simulations although the grout material degradation reveals the nascence of hairline cracks along grout meridians and concrete crushes at the grout edges however rate increases of progressive settlement coincide with the increase of grout degradation level the conical angle has been proven determinant to reduce the progressive settlement conical angle of up to 4⁰ can be required for grouted joint on large diameter monopiles in order to nullify the progressive settlement rate in practice a typical design process can start with relatively thin steel walls and a conical angle of 3⁰ then verifications with respect to the progressive settlement can require the increase of the wall thicknesses or of the conical angle verifications can be done by ensuring that the settlement rate is within a certain threshold after a specified simulation time however more severe vertical displacement can occur during extreme events and may lead to failure the grout length is found to be the most influential design parameter for the settlement due to extreme loadings longer grout enhances the structural performance of the grouted joint in this respect in order to ensure that the inevitable vertical displacement does not jeopardize the structural integrity a probability based method has been developed to estimate the minimal gap between the pile top and the brackets required to achieve a targeted annual reliability index of 3 3 this probability based method employs the maximum values of load time series which is uncertain indeed the highest values of time series of same mean wind speeds should be averaged in order to achieve comparable probability level of each load point further studies can incorporate this modification in the algorithm furthermore the vertical displacement values used for extreme value models were not generated based on the actual distributions of the input parameters but on the corresponding uniform distributions upcoming investigations can solve this issue for example by fitting surrogate models that will be used to generate vertical displacement values that are based on actual input distributions for this solution larger simulation batch will be required finally the study of the wear of the grout surfaces in contact with steels which has not been investigated in this paper can be considered in other works acknowledgements the research leading to these results has received funding from the european union seventh framework programme project irpwind under the grant agreement 609795 the financial support is greatly appreciated 
23402,conical grouted joints have been proposed as a solution for the relative settlement observed between the sleeve and the pile on monopiles for wind turbines in this paper the influence of the design parameters such as steel wall thicknesses and conical angle on the failure modes associated to continual loadings are assessed based on finite element analysis it is found that both the sleeve s and pile s wall thicknesses have a significant impact on the grouted joint health namely the larger are the wall thicknesses the more vulnerable the grout is with respect to fatigue and material degradation but the more limited the progressive settlement is and inversely this implies that the appropriate wall thicknesses should be chosen by designers having in mind that neither extreme is conservative based on statistical modeling the grout length is found to be the most influential parameter of the settlement caused by extreme loadings longer grout significantly contributes to the reduction of extreme settlement to ensure that the inevitable settlement does not jeopardize the joint s structural integrity a probability based method has been developed to estimate the minimal gap between the pile top and the brackets required to achieve a targeted annual reliability index of 3 3 keywords multi megawatt wind turbines conical grouted joint progressive settlement finite element reliability analysis 1 introduction in order to support the wind turbines placed at seas monopile substructures are the most frequently employed types in commercial wind farms kallehave et al 2015 relying on experience from the oil and gas industry the connections between the transition piece and the monopile for wind turbine support structures are made by the means of grouted joints classically the grouted joints for monopile substructures are built from the overlap of two cylindrical tubes a transition piece and a pile and the resulting annular gap is filled with a high strength concrete the grouted joints are efficient as they are easily constructible and they serve to correct the pile misalignment due to driving errors schaumann et al 2013 as presented in fig 1 a typical construction process follows few steps 1 the transition piece is jacked up at the pile top edge using jacking brackets 2 the concrete is poured in the annulus and left for curing and 3 after the concrete has hardened the jack ups are removed and the transition piece holds due to the passive friction resistance at the contact faces between the layers the passive friction resistance is made of two contributions which are the chemical adhesive bond between the concrete and the steel and the mechanical interlock between the rough concrete surface and the undulations on the steel surfaces an additional contribution coulomb friction is generated during the loading operations by the normal to the interface components of the loads transferred from the transition piece to the pile after few cycles gaps open between the grout and the steel walls at the connection top and bottom the adhesive bond deteriorates and cannot recover furthermore the friction abrades the geometrical imperfections at the adjacent surfaces over the whole connection length at very early age of the structure the two initial contributions depreciate and only the coulomb friction persists which is only effective when the normal pressure is present in case of insignificant normal pressure the shear resistance may not support the weight of the structure anymore and the transition piece will progressively slide downwards until the jacking brackets touch the pile top edge the connection fails this failure mode has been observed in some commercial wind farms dallyn et al 2015 in order to constantly keep the shear resistance two principal solutions were proposed dnvgl 2016a dnvgl 2016b the conical grouted joint and the shear keyed grouted joints fig 2 illustrates both proposed solutions the conical grouted joint is derived from the convention grouted joint by imposing a small conical angle 1 3 to the overlapping tubes with the conical angle the effect of the structure weight on the connection decomposes into a shear component along the contact faces and a normal component to the contact faces the latter component generates a permanent coulomb friction resistance which prevents the failure described above the alternative solution adds shear keys to the inner faces of the steel walls close to the connection middle in order to enhance the mechanical interlock the resulting friction resistance is said active it is not advisable to put shear keys close to the connection edges as the gap openings will nullify their effect in either solution as the passive mechanical interlock and the adhesive bond are ephemeral it is realistic to carry out analysis without accounting for their respective contributions nielsen 2007 as many studies devoted attention to the shear keyed grouted joints e g schaumann et al 2013 dallyn et al 2015 lotsberg 2013 lotsberg et al 2012 schaumann and raba 2015 schaumann et al 2014 this work will focus on the conical solution which is also addressed in lotsberg et al 2012 lee et al 2014 for example whereas lotsberg et al 2012 lotsberg et al 2012 have introduced the concept of conical grouted joints as a solution to limit settlements lee et al 2014 lee et al 2014 have presented a reliability based design optimization method for conical grouted joints they have considered various limit states except the grout degradation and the progressive settlement which has been proven crucial for grouted joints this article aims at investigating the behavior under continual loadings of the conical grouted joint based on detailed finite element analysis over years in addition to fatigue the grout material will progressively lose its elastic modulus nielsen 2007 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 which might impact the support structure stiffness the influence of the design parameter such as pile s wall thickness transition piece s wall thickness and conical angle on the grouted joint performance under continual loadings will be assessed although the conical shape of grouted joints will reduce the progressive settlement of the transition piece its vertical displacement cannot completely be precluded as materials have finite elastic moduli even if appropriate designs lead to acceptable progressive settlement at the end of their lifetime under normal conditions higher vertical displacement can be expected after extreme events therefore provisions should be given such that extreme settlements do not close the gap between the brackets and the pile top otherwise loads will not follow the same path or be transferred anymore as intended hence a procedure to estimate the minimum gap between the brackets and the pile top required to achieve a targeted annual reliability index of 3 3 is established this problem formulation is preferred to counterpart that consists in designing the grouted joint in such way that the vertical settlement lies below a certain threshold in fact as long as the settlement is not excessive the size of the gap will not strongly influence the remaining design features 2 site conditions structure and design constraints 2 1 metocean conditions the selected site is located in the north sea at 53 13 04 0 n and 3 13 13 0 e and its metocean conditions are given by von borstel 2013 the operational wind range goes from 4 m s to 25 m s and is binned into 11 intervals whose centres are 2 m s apart each mean wind speed bin is associated with a turbulence level as presented in table 1 the expected values of the sea states are conditional on each mean wind speed pierson moskowitz or jonswap spectra are used to model the wave height in case of normal operations or extreme cases respectively the mean sea level msl is 26 0 m above the seabed the verification of the grouted joint structure is done under loading cases corresponding to the wind turbine operations for the continual loadings the design load case dlc 1 2 the international electrotechnical commission 2005 is considered and for the extreme loading design load case that drives the ultimate limit state dlc 1 3 the international electrotechnical commission 2005 is used as it has been shown by njomo wandji et al 2017 to be critical at the grouted joint level dlc 1 2 is characterized by the wind normal turbulence and dlc 1 3 by the wind extreme turbulence the wind direction distribution is depicted by fig 3 as indicated by ref de vries 2011 from the metocean conditions of the selected site a statistical model describing the extreme loading case is prepared as tabulated in table 2 a probabilistic study is carried out only for the ultimate limit state whereas the limit case associated to the continual loadings will be studied based on load resistance factor design method the extreme turbulence intensity is computed based on the formula recommended by iec 61400 1 ed 3 the international electrotechnical commission 2005 and polynomials have been used to fit the relationship between the significant wave height and the wave peak period from table 1 and the mean wind speed during the sampling from this statistical model each mean wind speed will be associated to a unique seed 2 2 soil properties the soil conditions are the same as those used in njomo wandji et al 2017 the top 90 0 m are made of four layers of medium to highly dense sand the soil

parameters are deterministic in this study 3 descriptive parameters of the grouted joint 3 1 grouted joint topology and dimensions the conical grouted joint is made of double co axial frusto conical tubes overlapping each other whose annulus is filled with a concrete grout the outer frustum is the transition piece or sleeve and the inner frustum is the pile fig 4 presents the topology and the dimension labels of a typical conical grouted joint the nomenclature is given in table 5 the relative position of the connection top with respect to the mean water level can also be considered as a design parameter for the reliability analysis the geometry is considered deterministic however it has been varied within realistic bounds for the sensitivity analysis presented in subsequent sections table 6 tabulated the bounds used for the sensitivity analysis 3 2 materials constitutive behaviour and parameter values the grouted joint is made of two principal materials steel and concrete and one interface steel concrete contact the steel material is assumed elastic transitioning into perfectly plastic the characteristic values of its properties are indicated by cremer and heckl 1988 cremer

summarised in table 7 the grout is a high strength concrete of grade c120 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 nielsen 2007 nielsen 2007 proposed three candidates as constitutive formulation of the response for the grout the most sophisticated and most adapted alternative is the damaged plasticity model nielsen 2007 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 abaqus 2011 tyau 2009 this formulation models strain hardening and softening and thereby also cracking and crushing moreover it captures the material degradation along the loading cycles by altering the material stiffness as well as it accounts for material recovery fig 5 depicts the said formulation for the uniaxial load cycle path with the extreme cases of stiffness recovery factors while the yield surfaces are illustrated in fig 6 the basic relationships between the uniaxial parameters can be found in model code 2010 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 the parameters of this model and their values are taken or adapted from tyau 2009 tyau 2009 and are given in table 8 and table 9 together with their statistical distributions for the compressive strength the

on engineering judgement the strain degradation relationships and some concrete properties in table 8 are set deterministic mainly due to lack of information the concrete intrinsic parameters density characteristic strength and poisson s ratio are given by model code 2010 the international federation for structural concrete 2010 the contacts between the steel walls and the grout surfaces are modelled according to the classic hard contact theory abaqus 2011 this formulation assumes that the sticking contributions from geometric imperfections and chemical adhesion are negligible nielsen 2007 therefore only the coulomb friction contributes to the stress transfer between the various parts with the absence of chemical adhesion and geometric imperfections the sliding parts can translate with respect to each other in the direction normal to the contact surface for a given normal pressure the shear strength is proportional to the coulomb friction coefficient i e the shear resistance is equal to the product between the normal pressure and the coulomb friction coefficient but does not exceed the shear strength in which case sliding occurs after the sticking phase the coulomb friction coefficient and the shear strength are respectively obtained from the experiments carried out by baltay and gjelsvik 1990 baltay and gjelsvik 1990 and rabbat and russell 1985 rabbat and russell 1985

addition the accumulated fatigue damage during the structure lifetime assumed to be 25 years augmented by three equivalent years corresponding to the construction induced fatigue stolpe et al 2016

cycles to failure are computed with the design s n curve corresponding to the detail of type c1 for seawater with cathodic protection det norske veritas 2011 it is assumed that the cathodic protection is sufficient for the entire structure lifetime or can be renewed such that the protection against corrosion is always ensured over years the deformations of the pile soil system accumulate arany et al 2015 arany et al 2015 reported that the permanent displacement limits could be 20 cm and the permanent rotation limit 0 5⁰ at the pile head due to verticality error of driven pile the maximum allowable permanent rotation is reduced to 0 25⁰ lin and liao 1999 lin and liao 1999 proposed an experiment based method to evaluated the permanent strains of piles in sand due to cyclic lateral loads as also employed by achmus et al 2005 achmus et al 2005 this method will be used in this study reference is made to njomo wandji et al 2017 lin and liao 1999 and achmus et al 2005 for the details 4 3 reference design and verifications the design of the monopile consists of the determination of its dimensions outer diameter wall thickness and penetration depth such that the limit states are satisfied this study aims at the determination of a feasible reference substructure not an optimal or a ready to build design njomo wandji et al 2017 the determination process is iterative the initial

mode on the center the maximum fatigue damage accumulated over 28 years is 0 99 which is smaller than one on the right the permanent displacement at the pile head is 3 32 cm which is lower than the allowable 20 cm and the permanent rotation is 0 15⁰ which is lower than the 0 25⁰ limit satisfying all the limit states with moderate reserve and feasible dimensions the reference design stands as a good candidate for this study 5 finite element model 5 1 substructure modelling and loading strategy for the detailed analysis of the grouted joint a finite element model fem is prepared on the abaqus platform abaqus 2011 in order to effectively couple the aero hydro servo elastic simulations with detailed soil boundary conditions the fem of the whole substructure could be prepared as presented on the center of fig 8 however the model would have been very expensive with no additional benefit bush and manuel 2009 have shown that the foundation models of apparent fixity type and of coupled spring type lead to similar fatigue behavior at the tower bottom than that of distributed spring type that is why the distributed spring foundation has been replaced by its equivalent apparent fixity model such that the mass the damping and the natural frequencies of the whole support structure is preserved this modelling strategy does not only result in a computationally moderate effort but also allows a high fidelity model which minimizes boundary effects the tower bottom loads are applied at the transition piece top the distributed loads along the transition piece aerodrag and the monopile sea loads have been modelled as nodal loads at 10 locations spread along the axis above the seafloor the loads have been applied in two steps first the self load of the structure is applied the transition piece settles onto the grout second the operational loads are then applied to the structure 5 2 finite elements element types and meshing size dnvgl rp 0419 dnvgl 2016b recommends to use 1st order shell elements for a steel wall in conjunction with 1st order solid elements for the grout this recommendation has been adopted for the finite element model prepared in this study an aspect ratio equal to one has been used for all elements for the steel wall elements of type s4rs have been selected which corresponds to 4 node doubly curved shell reduced integration hourglass control small membrane strains for the grout elements of type c3d8r are selected which corresponds to 8 node linear brick reduced integration hourglass control the relax stiffness method is used to control hourglass cook et al 1989 for the shell element and the pure stiffness method is used for that of the solid element for details of these methods reference is made to abaqus 2011 with the setup described above a convergence analysis was conducted in order to find out the appropriate size of a typical mesh element across the grout thickness three finite elements are used in accordance to dnvgl rp 0419 dnvgl 2016b various analyses have been conducted with different meshing arrangements several structural responses have been monitored at some selected hotspots the results at one of them are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that above 46500 mesh elements for the grout part the structural strain converges this corresponds to a mesh size of 20 cm 20 cm for the connection both grout and steel wall 6 limit states for the conical grouted joint design the design of the monopile substructure has ensured the safety of the steel components of the grouted joint this section will not address their limit states anymore rather it will focus on the grout material and the contact nielsen 2007 nielsen 2007 pointed out the almost inevitable appearance of the hairline cracks due to primary hoop stresses dallyn et al 2015 dallyn et al 2015 recognized the effect of these cracks in the reduction of bending stiffness but stating that the influence is limited about 5 as long as the lateral stresses are still transferred therefore the assumption made by lee et al 2014 lee et al 2014 is considered here the grout material does not support significant tensile stress in the hoop direction the grout is primarily in charge of transferring the pressure between the transition piece and the pile through shear friction thus limiting the slide of the transition piece the crack growths and their propagations are assumed sufficiently small such that their influences are limited these phenomena will not be considered in the subsequent analyses 6 1 limit states related to extreme events in the case of extreme loading three failure modes can be distinguished for the grouted connection failure of the steel grout contacts failure of the grout due to compressive stresses and excessive vertical displacement of the transition piece relative to the pile the shear stress τ due to the friction between the steel wall and the grout surfaces should be lower than the shear strength τ m a x of the interface to prevent excessive relative motion between the transition piece and the pile eq 3a this limit state is evaluated for both sides of the grout the tresca stress σ t r e s c a generated in the grout material should be kept lower than the concrete strength f c as specified by eq 3b moreover the relative settlement δ of the transition piece with respect to the pile under extreme loading should be moderate and is limited to a vertical settlement h see eq 4 3a g 1 τ m a x τ 3b g 2 f c σ t r e s c a 4 g 3 h δ 6 2 limit states related to continual loadings over the structure lifetime failures associated to continual loadings can occur they include the wear of the grout surfaces in contact with steel walls the reduction of the grout elastic modulus due to material degradation the fatigue of the grout material and the progressive vertical displacement of the transition piece relative to the pile as observed in some commercial wind systems the friction at the contact faces abrades the grout surfaces the wear rate is function of shear stress which is proportional to the normal pressure exerted from one layer to another in this paper the wear phenomenon is not investigated as a more sophisticated finite element model is required for an accurate prediction of the phenomenon two types of deterioration are engendered by continual loadings on grout material fatigue damage and degradation which are evaluated independently one to the other the concrete degradation corresponds to a variation diminution of elastic modulus with the possibility of material recovery as the word grade is generally used to characterize grout material strength the term degradation refers to the loss of its elastic modulus for the fatigue damage the s n curves have been calibrated based on samples that have been subjected to loadings till fatigue failure during the experiments the sample materials have been deteriorated continually and no full healing has been periodically assumed so the extrapolation of the fatigue damage includes the progressive degradation of the grout material therefore fatigue analyses do not require the monitoring of the damage parameters related to the degradation however it is relevant to monitor the appearance of cracks in the grout based on the damage parameters the reduction of the grout stiffness will be monitored based on the evolution of the material degradation parameters it is important to keep the severely affected areas marginal in the grout in order to preserve the bending stiffness of the substructure a change of the substructure bending stiffness can be noticed by following the lateral displacement of the interface for example subjected to cyclic loadings the connection engenders cyclic stresses that induce fatigue in the materials the accumulated fatigue d 25 in the grout during the intended lifetime calculated according to the palmgren miner assumption should be lower than one see eq 5 the rate of progression of the long term vertical settlement δ of the transition along the pile should be close to zero so that over time the initial gap g between the pile top edge and the brackets see eq 6 does not completely close 5 g 4 1 00 d 25 6 g 5 g δ h 7 behavior of the grouted joint under continual loadings 7 1 fatigue loads and resulting stresses fatigue loads result from dlc 1 2 simulations some load samples at the interface resulting from 13 m s mean wind speed are presented in fig 10 dynamic finite element analyses carried out with this loading set result in stresses in the grout material for fatigue assessment the influence of multiaxial stress states is generally accepted insignificant therefore the focus is on principal stresses as illustrated for few selected hotspots fig 11 in fig 12 and during a turbulent wind with mean speed of 13 m s whereas the structural responses of the grouted joint are computed over the whole mesh domain the hotspots are selected only to collect the stress and material degradation time series in fig 12 the positive sign refers to tension the minimum principal stresses are mainly of compressive type whereas the maximum principal stresses are of tensile type 7 2 degradation of the concrete following the concrete damaged plasticity model abaqus 2011 the occurrences of plastic strain generate the tridimensional degradation either of compressive d c or of tensile d t types in the grout material the equivalent degradation d which combines the effect of the compressive and of the tensile degradation alters the elastic stiffness of the concrete d e l t δ t 1 d t δ t d e l t where d e l is the material stiffness matrix the scalar degradation variable d is computed based on the tensile and compressive degradation variables 1 d 1 s t d c 1 s c d t d c and d t are taken as the maxima between their respective previous state values and the present state values obtained by interpolation in table 9 s t 1 w t r σ ˆ and s c 1 w c 1 r σ ˆ w t and w c are the recovery factor indicated in table 8 r σ ˆ i 1 3 σ ˆ i i 1 3 σ ˆ i is a stress weight factor equal to one if all principal stress components σ ˆ i i 1 2 3 are positive or zero if they are negative is the macaulay bracket fig 13 presents the evolution of the material degradation over 600 s with 13 m s mean wind speed and normal turbulence on the left the history data of the compressive degradation at the selected hotspots are shown similar data are shown for the tensile degradation on the center of the figure these two quantities monotonically increase over time on the right the time series of equivalent degradation variable is presented due to the material recovery phenomenon the degradation variable can reduce the plots show that the tensile degradation mainly contributes to the degradation variable compared to the compressive degradation this was expected as the plastic tensile stresses reach relatively higher levels compared to those from compressive ones for comparable magnitudes of strain in table 12 the visual history of the degradation variable is illustrated it shows that significant tensile degradation initiates before the compressive one the locus of degradation indicates a future appearance of hairline cracks in the meridional direction and concrete crushes at the grout edges these observations are in line with previous experimental or numerical studies presented by lee et al 2014 lee et al 2014 nielsen 2007 nielsen 2007 and dallyn et al 2015 dallyn et al 2015 the hairline cracks are due to the hoop stresses generated by the grout ovalization whereas the concrete crushes are the consequence of the compression of the transition piece towards the pile during operational oscillations of the support structure during the 600 s simulation the severely affected areas are marginal it can be expected that the joint preserves its connection bending stiffness as it will be seen later 7 3 fatigue of the concrete fatigue damage accumulates over lifetime due to cyclic stresses such as presented above dnvgl st 0126 2016 dnvgl 2016a proposes an algorithm to estimate the total damage the characteristic number of cycles to failure is calculated from 7 log n y y x y 1 0 2 y x y x with y c 1 1 σ m a x 0 8 f c n γ m 1 σ m i n 0 8 f c n γ m x c 1 1 σ m i n 0 8 f c n γ m 0 1 c 1 f c n f c k 1 f c k 600 where σ m a x σ m i n are respectively the largest value of the maximum principal compressive stress during a stress cycle within the stress block and the smallest compressive stress in the same direction during this stress cycle they are to be individually set to zero if they belong to the tensile range γ m 1 5 is the safety factor associated to the grout material f c k is the characteristic grout cylinder strength measured in mpa c 1 calibration factor for structures in water c 1 10 0 for compression compression range and c 1 8 0 for compression tension range the damage accumulated over one year is linearly aggregated using eq 8 and the lifetime is calculated as l f d 1 1 and d 25 25 d 1 8 d 1 γ f f i n i δ σ t i δ σ n i δ σ where γ f f 3 0 is the fatigue reserve factor and t i δ σ is the occurrence frequency in one year of stress range δ σ which is counted n i δ σ times in the simulation time fig 14 presents the spatial distribution of the fatigue damage accumulated over 25 years on an unrolled grout accounting for the full directionality of the loads as the grout has been meshed in three layers across its thickness the respective fatigue damage levels of the different layers are shown the cumulative fatigue damage level at the critical hotspot is lower than one the alignment of the peaks of fatigue damage on the surfaces suggests the nascence of the hairline cracks as indicated by the previous observations it can also be noticed that fatigue affects the top edge of the grout on the transition face this was expected as the highest compressive stresses are transferred from the transition piece to the pile through the grout top edge the fatigue damage magnitudes indicate that the proposed design is not optimal with respect to the fatigue limit state carrying out a deterministic optimization design lee et al 2014 have shown that decreasing the grouted joint mass contributes to the increase of fatigue lifetime of the structure the sensitivities of the design parameters have been evaluated based on a design of experiment and using analysis of variance they have found that the wall thicknesses of the steel components were the variables that had the most influence on the fatigue lifetime indeed the wall thickness of the transition piece has a sensitivity of 46 whereas the wall thickness of the pile has a sensitivity of 35 the other variables were length of the grout 10 conical angle 3 pile s radius 1 grout s elastic modulus 1 steel s elastic modulus 1 and loads axial force torsional moment maximum bending moment and minimum bending moment 1 grout s thickness 0 contact friction 0 in order to investigate the influence of the wall thickness of the steel components a design with the other dimensions unchanged has been prepared with transition piece s wall thickness changed from 60 mm to 80 mm and pile s wall thickness changed from 70 mm to 100 mm load assessment has been done and the monopile substructure has been proven sufficient for the serviceability fatigue and ultimate limit states as per the reference monopile the results are not shown here for readability the evaluation of fatigue damage for this modified structure over the lifetime is depicted in fig 15 the mid layer and the outer layer show fatigue damage levels lower that one at all points whereas a minimal region of the inner layer has a damage level of 1 12 the hairline cracks and the vulnerability of the top edge can still be observed it is noticeable that the loci of high fatigue damage are at the top edge and along the meridian at 0⁰ where loads are primarily transferred the variation of the fatigue lifetime between both designs can be explained by the compressive stresses generated in the grout with thick steel walls the structural system is more rigid and the transition piece squeezes the grout more during load transfer thus higher compressive stress levels are generated within the grout material as shown by fig 16 where the compressive stresses are up to 9 mpa whereas they were up to 3 5 mpa with thinner walls see fig 12 7 4 vertical settlement with the progressive degradation of the grout the conical grouted joint could exhibit a gradual failure like the continuous settlement of the transition piece schaumann et al 2013 observed a continuous settlement of the transition piece on a cylindrical connection without shear keys where the passive shear resistance was due to coulomb friction and chemical adhesion they have explained that the vertical displacement is caused by the reduction of coulomb friction when the transition piece approaches its neutral position where the operational loads are small for the case in presence of conical grouted connection with the initial settlement already being undergone and under the assumption that the shear resistance is only due to coulomb friction a large amount of shear resistance is permanently due to the structural weight therefore it is expected that with a sufficient conical angle the settlement due to loss of coulomb friction is significantly reduced with a conical angle of 3⁰ simulation results depicted in fig 17 show i an initial vertical settlement due to the application of the dead load ii a slight gradual settlement due to the deformation of components steel and grout and grout degradation for simulation of 600 s duration the relationship between the grout degradation and the increase in vertical settlement can be observed in fig 15 for 13 m s mean wind speed as the degradation onsets in the grout at about 300 s the vertical settlement increases at that instant but tends to stabilize notwithstanding the apparition of cracks furthermore no trend change is observed during the 600 s simulation on the fore aft and the side side displacements suggesting no significant loss of the support structure global bending stiffness during the simulation period in case of bending stiffness reduction the amplitudes of the side side displacements would have increased and the means of the fore aft displacements would have shifted these observations are in line with the assumption that the hairline cracks do not significantly deter load transfer and also do not significantly elongate however it can be argued that 600 s simulations are not long enough to really capture a long term behavior of the connection therefore 1800 s simulations at 11 m s mean wind speed has been carried out fig 18 shows that the rate of vertical settlement of the interface central node continuously decreases even after 1800 s 7 5 effect of the conical angle in particular the influence of the conical angle on the vertical displacement of the interface is studied the structure dimensions are set as their nominal values see table 6 but the conical angle is varied from 1⁰ to 4⁰ the loading set corresponding to 11 m s mean wind speed is applied on the structure during 600 s and the displacement of the interface is monitored depicted in fig 19 the results show that both the initial settlement and the settlement rate reduce as the conical angle increases for small conical angles the settlement fails to stabilize during the 600 s suggesting a continuous vertical displacement till failure this indicates the necessity to choose a conical angle large enough to guarantee the grouted joint stability for the structure with thicker pile s and transition piece s wall the evolution of the interface vertical displacement is show in fig 20 for 1⁰ and 3⁰ conical angle it shows that with thicker steel wall the vertical displacement stabilizes quicker than with the reference design this is partly due to the high shear friction resistance generated due to the high compressive stresses exerted on the contact faces however with 1⁰ angle a two step phenomenon occurs the first step is the initial displacement due to the self weight which is larger for the thin wall case due to high steel flexibility and the lower shear friction resistance at the contact faces then the second step is the progressive settlement due to the operational loadings which is about 30 mm for the thin wall case and 70 mm for the thick wall case the greater vertical displacement in the case of thick walls can mainly be explained by the degradation of the grout material at about 100 s indeed during the first 100 s where both structures are intact the vertical displacement of the thin wall case is similar to that of the thick wall it is recalled that grout between thick steel walls is prone to rapid degradation due to high stresses generated by the compression it undergoes in short the comparison of the designs with different wall thickness ranges has shown that the wall thicknesses of the pile and transition piece impact the behavior of the grouted joint in a nonlinear manner thick walls negatively affect fatigue and grout degradation however the progressive settlement is reduced provided that grout degradation is minimal the opposite observation is done with the thin walls as summarized in table 13 in both cases high conical angle limits the vertical displacement of the transition piece however as mentioned before critical settlements can be due to the occurrence of extreme values of the load components and requirements to accommodate such deformation levels should be evaluated 8 structural responses under extreme loadings uls the selected structural responses under extreme loadings are the tresca stress in the concrete the shear stress at the contact faces and the vertical settlement investigations are carried out over the design space to determine their respective distributions and their sensitivities with respect to the design variables the design space consists of load variables geometry variables and material variables in this study the geometry variables are assumed deterministic but are varied within bounds to cover various possible designs of the grouted joint the probability density functions pdfs of the material variables are given in section 3 the pdfs of the extreme load variables are sought based on monte carlo simulations with n points for each point the load values that yield to extreme structural responses should be identified an approximate method for this identification is introduced as the 66 load variables are generated for one structural system by the same environmental conditions high correlations between the variables are expected the load set will then be reduced retaining only some variables taken as insufficiently correlated from the characterization of the reduced load set the pdfs of the whole set can be calculated 8 1 extreme loadings load assessment carried out in hawc2 under metocean conditions described by table 2 results in load time series collected at the 11 locations as described above the locations are numbered from 1 to 11 from bottom to top interface for each location six load time series are obtained corresponding to each degree of freedom ideally the ultimate structural responses should be obtained as the maximum of the structural response time series generated in the structure subjected to a set of load time series this requires that the finite element analysis is done for 600 s for a given set of load time series which is extremely computationally expensive in order to reduce the computational cost it is assumed that the ultimate structural responses occur when horizontal force vertical force bending moment or torsional moment measured at the center of the grouted joint is extreme this corresponds to four load criteria as depicted in fig 21 given a load criterion the time instant at which its extreme is attained is identified and the other load components corresponding to this instant are collected to form the set of contemporaneous extreme nodal loads resulting from the load scenarios a load scenario is understood here as an aero hydro servo elastic simulation with a given mean wind speed let take as an example the load criterion horizontal force the resultant horizontal force is obtained as the euclidian summation of the forces in x direction and y direction at the time t m when the extreme resultant horizontal force at the grouted joint center is attained the load vector f x t m f y t m f z t m m x t m m y t m m z t m is constructed for each of the 11 locations which gives 66 nodal loads this operation is repeated for the other three load criteria such that to every load scenario are related four sets of 66 nodal loads it can be noted that the nodal loads of interest are not necessarily the extreme values of their time series but the values that maximize the load criterion moreover as results from hawc2 are the internal loads at selected hotspots the distributed external loads at the 10 locations the interface is exempted are estimated as the difference between two consecutive hotspots 8 2 load randomness dimensionality reduction and parametrization for the probabilistic study of the grouted joint 500 data samples have been drawn from table 2 and the corresponding nodal loads are obtained from them given a load criterion each of the 66 nodal loads is established as a random variable numbered from 1 to 66 the first 6 variables are associated to location 1 the second 6 variables to location 2 and so forth fig 22 illustrates for the vertical force criterion the marginal distributions of the random variables numbered 1 6 i i 0 10 which correspond to f x at the eleven locations together with the one by one dependence structure between them as an example as it could be expected some variables are highly correlated as grouped with color in fig 20 physically the magenta colored variables mainly represent the hydrodynamic loads the cyan colored variable is the monopile section at the sea surface the red colored variables are primarily associated to the aerodynamic loads transmitted from the rotor and the green colored variable is the interface force in the side side direction this suggests that each group can be represented by one variable selected as insufficiently correlated and the other variables within the group are expressed as a function of it this reduces the set of 11 variables to four variables the same operation is carried out for all degrees of freedom resulting in the dimension reduction from m 66 to n 17 variables for the case of horizontal force criterion and to n 15 variables for the other criteria if z denotes the insufficiently correlated variables the dependent variables x can be obtained by 9 x m 1 α m n z n 1 β m 1 where α is the matrix of the scale factors obtained as the ratio of x s standard deviation over z s standard deviation and β is the vector of the shifts obtained as the difference between the x s average and the α z s average the marginals of the insufficiently correlated variables are modeled with parametric probability density functions pdfs three standard probability distributions gaussian johnson et al 1994 gumbel johnson et al 1995 and logistic johnson et al 1995 have been selected on the basis of their ability to represent the physical phenomena of interest here the gaussian is appropriate to accommodate the natural randomness contained in the environmental data the gumbel distribution is suitable for extreme values the difference of two gumbel distributed variables follows a logistic distribution as nodal loads are obtained as the difference of loads possibly gumbel distributed the logistic distribution is applicable each insufficiently correlated variable is tested against every selected probability distribution using kolmogorov smirnov test matlab 2016 with 0 05 significance level and the relevant pdf is identified as the probability distribution with the highest p values the null hypothesis poses that the insufficiently correlated variable data are from the assumed distribution fig 23 illustrates the marginals of the insufficiently correlated variables for the torsional moment criterion where the identified pdf and the corresponding p value are indicated the dependence structure within the sets of insufficiently correlated variables z is captured using gaussian copula abdallah 2015 which results in the joint probability distribution of the set of the insufficiently correlated random variables given the correlation matrix r of z the gaussian copula is defined as c u 1 u n ϕ r ϕ 1 u 1 ϕ 1 u n where u i f i z i f i cumulative distribution function cdf of the insufficiently correlated variable z i ϕ r is the joint cumulative distribution function of a n dimension multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equal to r and ϕ 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal the accuracy of the constructed dependence structure has been evaluated by comparing the correlation matrix from the observed data versus that of synthetic data generated from the constructed joint probability distribution the root mean square deviations rmsd between the correlation matrices of the two data sets are 1 12 0 85 0 83 0 60 for the horizontal force the vertical force the bending moment and the torsional moment criteria respectively 8 3 design space exploration in order to explore the design space uniformly distributed loads have been sampled within the bounds of the marginals defined as values corresponding to 10 7 cumulative and survival probabilities respectively the survival function is defined as the complementary cumulative distribution function fig 24 shows for the vertical force criterion as an example that the sampled loads cover well the tails of the variables suggesting a good representativeness of the edges of the design space the bounds have been defined similarly for the other load criterions they have been superimposed in order to find the global bounds and generate a unique uniform sampling for the four load criteria the results are depicted in fig 25 in addition the variables related to the material properties have been independently and uniformly sampled between the bounds found as per the load case the geometry related variables are also independently and uniformly sampled between the bounds as indicated in table 6 with the 500 uniformly sample variables describing loads material and geometry a batch of finite element simulations has been run in abaqus the absolute maxima of the structural responses pertaining to extreme loading which are the settlement of the transition piece relative to the pile the tresca equivalent stress in the concrete the shear forces at both sides of the contact grout steel have been collected fig 26 depicts the normalized safety margins for each structural response when the variables map the whole design space the safety margins are computed as the difference between the resistance parameters see eqs 3 and 4 and the structural responses respectively in preparing fig 26 the variable h in eq 4 has been set to 100 mm the difference is then divided by the respective characteristic values of the resistance parameters see tables 8 and 10 to obtain the normalized safety margins except for the settlement it can be noted that the safety margins of the other structural responses are all greater than zero indicating that failure will not arise from these failure modes therefore the reliability analysis will only focus on the failure mode respective to vertical displacement 8 4 sensitivity of the extreme vertical displacement with respect to the design parameters in order to assess the influence of the design parameters which are mainly the geometry and material types on the extreme vertical displacement a sensitivity analysis based on correlation between the design parameters and the structural responses has been carried out the sensitivity measures are computed as correlation coefficients between each design parameters and the structural response the correlation coefficients are calculated both as of pearson s or linear type abdallah 2015 and of spearman s or rank type abdallah 2015 fig 27 presents the resulting indices where the grout length demarcates from the rest of the parameters its index indicates that longer grouted connections generate lower relative displacements of the transition piece which can be explained by the fact larger surfaces offer larger shear resistance other parameters like the conical angle the position of the grouted joint with respect to the mean sea level and the transition piece s wall thickness show lesser influence on the extreme vertical displacement than that of the grout length this sensitivity analysis suggests that the set of variables of the system can be reduced further as only the connection length emerged as the key design variables of conical grouted joints during a design process whereas the material properties are generally known in advance the structural dimensions are primarily the sought variables thus from the set of material and geometry properties only the grout length is retained for further parametric study 9 prediction of the extreme settlement 9 1 problem formulation from each point of the simulation batch of size n described in section 8 the maximum vertical displacements δ i i 1 n are collected each can be seen as the peak of the time series of vertical displacement related to a given mean wind speed in this sense they are reasonably assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with this assumption the extreme value theory applies and the random variable δ i follows the cumulative distribution function cdf 10 f s x μ σ ε exp z x μ σ ε μ σ ε are the parameters of the cdf f s and z is a function of the random variable x for the traditional extreme value families gumbel frechet and weibull singh 1998 11 z x μ σ ε 1 ε x μ σ 1 ε with x μ σ ε ε 0 ε 0 μ σ ε ε 0 as a substitute of eq 11 several studies natarajan and holley 2008 natarajan and verelst 2011 have proposed a quadratic shape for z such that 12 z x μ σ ε μ x 2 σ x ε with x and have shown its appropriateness and its robustness for fitting extreme structural responses of various wind turbine structures furthermore the empirical cdf dimitrov 2015 is generally constructed by sorting the random variables δ i in ascending order so that each is associated to a rank d i the following expression of the empirical cdf can be written 13 f e δ d n 1 equating eq 10 and eq 13 the parameters μ σ ε can be obtained by regression hence the probability of exceeding a given vertical displacement is calculated as g δ 1 f s δ as per modern standards the targeted reliability index is about β 0 3 3 which corresponds to a targeted failure probability p f 0 4 93 10 4 this means that in order to be safe the grouted joint should be able to undergo a vertical displacement up to δ 0 g 1 p f 0 without any consequence on its structural integrity with an allowable settlement h δ 0 see eq 4 failure is not prevented the design should provide an allowable settlement greater than or equal to δ 0 9 2 provisions for a safe extreme settlement the reliability index is determined for a given design with given material and geometry properties in order to evaluate the survival distribution function sdf g the grouted joint design with similar properties have been binned with respect to grout length which is the primary influencing parameter four bins of equal width are constructed over the length range 9 m 25 m and the corresponding sdfs are fitted as illustrated in fig 28 for each bin the settlement threshold required to achieve the targeted annual reliability index is obtained by graphical projection for each bin range table 14 gives the settlement thresholds it shows that for the reference grouted joint which has 18 m grout length provisions for 72 mm of vertical displacement should be afforded for example the gap between the pile top edge and the jacking brackets should be at least 72 mm to ensure that with sufficient reliability the settlement of the transition piece does not create any consequence on the structural integrity within the framework of this study allowing a settlement of 72 mm is possible as the other failure modes associated to extreme events are proven improbably realizable in general in case high settlement cannot be afforded long grout should be used to achieve the required reliability 10 conclusion and recommendations for further studies in this paper the behavior of conical grouted joints under continual loadings is investigated based on short term numerical simulations three failure modes are considered the reduction of the grout elastic modulus due to successive yielding phenomena the fatigue of the grout material due to numerous repeated loading cycles and the progressive vertical displacement of the transition piece relative to the pile it is found that the transition piece s wall thickness and the pile s wall thickness have a significant impact on the realization of these failure modes the larger are the wall thicknesses the more vulnerable the grout is with respect to fatigue and material degradation but the more limited the progressive settlement is and inversely this implies that the appropriate wall thicknesses should be chosen by designers having in mind that neither extreme is conservative the reduction of support structure bending stiffness was not observed during short term simulations although the grout material degradation reveals the nascence of hairline cracks along grout meridians and concrete crushes at the grout edges however rate increases of progressive settlement coincide with the increase of grout degradation level the conical angle has been proven determinant to reduce the progressive settlement conical angle of up to 4⁰ can be required for grouted joint on large diameter monopiles in order to nullify the progressive settlement rate in practice a typical design process can start with relatively thin steel walls and a conical angle of 3⁰ then verifications with respect to the progressive settlement can require the increase of the wall thicknesses or of the conical angle verifications can be done by ensuring that the settlement rate is within a certain threshold after a specified simulation time however more severe vertical displacement can occur during extreme events and may lead to failure the grout length is found to be the most influential design parameter for the settlement due to extreme loadings longer grout enhances the structural performance of the grouted joint in this respect in order to ensure that the inevitable vertical displacement does not jeopardize the structural integrity a probability based method has been developed to estimate the minimal gap between the pile top and the brackets required to achieve a targeted annual reliability index of 3 3 this probability based method employs the maximum values of load time series which is uncertain indeed the highest values of time series of same mean wind speeds should be averaged in order to achieve comparable probability level of each load point further studies can incorporate this modification in the algorithm furthermore the vertical displacement values used for extreme value models were not generated based on the actual distributions of the input parameters but on the corresponding uniform distributions upcoming investigations can solve this issue for example by fitting surrogate models that will be used to generate vertical displacement values that are based on actual input distributions for this solution larger simulation batch will be required finally the study of the wear of the grout surfaces in contact with steels which has not been investigated in this paper can be considered in other works acknowledgements the research leading to these results has received

23403,underwater exploration in the last years has evolved toward a wide adoption of increasingly smaller rovs remotely operated vehicle as a consequence the need to equip these underwater vehicles with robotic arms is currently rising as well according to this demand the paper presents three innovative solutions achieved in the uvms underwater vehicle manipulator system field firstly the paper proposes a modular architecture for a lightweight underwater robotic arm which can be mounted on small sized rovs the modular concept of the arm enables several different configurations each one characterized by the related dofs deployed according to the type of application to be performed secondly the arm has been equipped with an adaptive gripper that taking advantage of the additive manufacturing techniques is able to easily grip differently shaped objects lastly the underwater arm is controlled through a master slave approach designed for commercial off the shelf electronics that on the one hand entailed a significant reduction of the bill of materials but on the other hand required a greater effort in the software development experimental tests have been carried out to measure and evaluate the gripping and manipulation capability of the robotic arm and the performance of the proposed control system keywords underwater vehicle manipulator systems uvms underwater manipulation master slave control modular robotic arm flexible gripper 1 introduction if performed in some particular conditions underwater explorations can raise risks for human operators this is the reason why subsea scouting is carried out with unmanned underwater vehicles equipped with one or more robotic arms uvms underwater vehicle manipulator system beside a small number of experimentations on auvs autonomous underwater vehicles lane et al 1997 marani et al 2009 yu et al 2013 xiang et al 2015 ridao et al 2015 the manipulation is commonly and largely implemented on rov remotely operated vehicle systems kawamura 2015 ribas et al 2015 bruno et al 2016 youakim et al 2017 rizzo et al 2017 recently the employment of small working rovs i e observer rovs is becoming more common thanks to their high portability and reduced dimensions but because of their lightweight design they can be equipped with simple prehension tools with 1 or 2 degrees of freedom dof and currently there are only a few examples of observer rovs with articulated robotic arms sakagami et al 2010 ambar and sagara 2015 in underwater manipulation a fundamental role is played by end effectors about impactive grippers the scientific literature presents anthropomorphic tools with three or four fingers mouri et al 2002 chen 2012 telegenov et al 2015 and non anthropomorphic ones with three jointed fingers cabas and balaguer 2005 bartolini et al 2000 these grippers include rigid fingers that are not well suited for accurate manipulation tasks that require a soft touch like the recovery of archaeological finds or the collecting of biological specimens for this reason for a few years now there is the tendency to design adaptive grippers able to adapt their fingers to the widest variety of objects about the control of manipulators the reference market offers a plethora of robotic control systems for underwater applications but these products are expensive because of their complex control architectures on the basis of these considerations the paper presents three innovative achievements in the uvms field 1 a lightweight modular arm architecture that can be fitted on observer class rovs the modular feature enables various different configurations each one characterized by its number of degrees of freedom and kinematic model 2 an adaptive gripper characterized by an interchangeable palm for an easy integration of 2 and 4 finger elements and by a form locking gripping achieved by means of a flexible structure that allows for a quick and reliable handling of differently shaped objects without causing any damage 3 a master slave control system designed with commercial off the shelf electronics that entailed a significant reduction of the hardware costs the master manipulator has been designed to replicate the slave s kinematics in order to improve the usability of the control system the paper describes in detail the design of the proposed solutions and the assessment of the first physical prototypes in order to verify their feasibility and to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of their design and control system prior to proceed with further improvements the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the architecture of the modular underwater robotic arm is presented while the design of its adaptive gripper is described in section 3 the physical prototype of the manipulator is shown in section 4 section 5 describes the proposed master slave system its teleoperation control architecture and experimentation finally section 6 presents the conclusions of the paper 2 architecture of the underwater manipulator 2 1 design of the robotic arm the robotic arm has been designed to equip observer rovs with manipulators able to perform a much greater number of tasks if compared to simple tools with only 1 2 dofs this purpose has been achieved thanks to a modular lightweight structure that allows for different design configurations in particular the modularity is enabled by adopting only two classes of components fig 1 i e link module and bridge which have been designed to be manufactured by means of additive manufacturing technologies the link module s geometry fig 1a has been optimized to house servomotors and the motion transfer mechanism in particular the servos are held in place by two rails while their electric cables pass through wiring hooks integrated into the geometry the link module has a length of 100 mm a thickness of 3 mm and it features five air chambers that allow for a reduction of its weight in water these modules can be easily and quickly assembled by means of the bridge type components in fact the square section at the flat bottom of the link module allows for the assembly with a bridge i element fig 1b while on the opposite end a cylindrical shaped slot allows for the connection with bridge ii fig 1c and bridge iii fig 1d type components the bridge components differ for the enabled relative movements in fact the first one fig 1b allows for joining two link modules without adding any dofs while the second fig 1c and the third fig 1d types add a rotational dof to the robotic system i e a relative rotation of 180 and 360 respectively then by assembling link module and bridge components is possible to achieve a large variety of configurations each one characterized by its number of dofs fig 2 2 2 driving system design the driving system fig 3 features a motor and a motion transmission mechanism servos have been adopted as motors because despite their reduced speed they allow for a better control of the arm s position robotis dynamixel ax 18a servomotors have been chosen on the basis of three characteristics commercial off the shelf products high torque to size ratio and cascade communication capability about the motion transmission mechanism a worm gear has been adopted with the aims to avoid retrograde motion without using brakes and to minimize volumes and number of components that could introduce undesired frictions and inertias on the basis of these design solutions the ratio gear of the driving system has been chosen to maximize the worm gear output torque and minimize its dimensions in particular on the one hand the driving system s output torque depends on the ratio gear to be defined and on the worm gear efficiency and the servo s stall torque 0 22 for steel alloy components and 1 8 nm at the higher voltage of 12 v respectively on the other hand the worm wheel diameter is affected by the servo s dimensions 32 50 40 mm the screw s number of coils and the ratio gear as a consequence in order to satisfy both the abovementioned requirements a reduction ratio of 30 1 providing a driving system s output torque of 11 9 nm has been adopted as depicted in fig 3 the plug and play design is achieved by means of a square section shaft integral to the wheel that simplifies the assembly with bridge type components fastened down by two grub screws furthermore three ball bearings allow for reducing the radial loads on the worm gear while two o rings have been applied for the watertight in particular the cross section view depicted in fig 4 shows three nitrile rubber type o rings the first two are devoted to the waterproof seal for the driving mechanism and its housing and are applied to the cylindrical contact surface between the support and link module and the support and the rotational part of the joint the third one is placed on the inferior part of the joint shaft in contact with the inner cylindrical surface of a bridge ii or iii component and assures the watertight of a second link module component the waterproof design for dynamic sealing has been carried out by adopting the design rules provided by the manufacturer starting from the groove and bore diameters and the diametrical clearance of the joint shaft and stopper fig 4 and in accordance with iso 3601 standard suitable o ring sizes have been defined in particular the o rings placed on the joint shaft have the diameter of 20 88 mm and cross section of 1 78 mm while the o ring placed on the support has inside diameter 33 05 mm and cross section 1 78 mm 2 3 simulation and analysis prior to proceed with physical prototyping the modular robotic arm has been subjected to fem analysis in order to simulate and verify its reliability and integrity in the underwater environment in particular the link module has been subjected to static analysis taking into account the materials adopted for the additive manufacturing pa2200 a polyamide with high strength and stiffness and gp1 a pre alloyed stainless steel the results demonstrated that the steel component fig 5 a keeps a full functionality with a factor of safety of 1 9 at the maximum operating depth at which observer rovs operate namely a depth of 300 m below the sea level with a water pressure of 3 1 mpa on the contrary the polymeric component which results are depicted in fig 5b tolerates a pressure of 0 4 mpa at a maximum depth of 30 m below the sea level an intermediate design solution that allows to safely operate at intermediate depths up to 100 m could be reached by adopting polymeric components with metallic steel inserts additional analyses have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the watertight seal that is affected by the pressure range at which the o rings work on the basis of the technical documentation supplied by the o ring s producer the results of the analysis carried out on the module link show that the waterproofness of the housing is not compromised in particular at a depth of 30 m the polymeric module link component shows a displacement of 0 42 mm that does not exceed the upper threshold value of 0 59 mm even better for the steel component which presents a displacement of 0 027 mm at a depth of 300 m far below the upper limit 3 design of the gripper the manipulator s end effector ee is a mechanical gripper fig 6 with adaptive fingers that allows for handling differently shaped objects and ensure an efficient grip it is assembled to the robotic arm by means of a bridge ii type component fig 1c that has been modified and strengthened to support the torsional and bending loads the ee s case houses mechanical components and two actuators one for the wrist rotation and another one for the movement of the fingers the ee features also an interchangeable palm fig 7 that depending on the requirements allows for an easy and fast change of the gripper with two or four fingers the kinematic motion of the wrist is accomplished by coupling a gear wheel integral to the servomotor shaft and a crown wheel while the fingers motion is given by an under actuated self locking mechanism fig 8 in which a worm gear driven by an electric actuator transmits the motion to the fingers by means of two couples of gear wheels in particular the servomotor through a mechanical adapter drives a worm screw accommodated by two ball bearings a stopper with the function of strengthening the mechanism stops the axial loads generated by the worm screw rotation the finger s articulation has been designed on the basis of the anthropomorphic kinematic structure depicted in the following figure it is a simple mechanical linkage system that emulates the finger kinematics as depicted in fig 9 the finger mechanism consists of two phalanges that allow for 2 dof rotational motions with one degree of actuation in particular thanks to the design of the first phalanx that mimes a helical spring with elastic modulus k the gear wheel which rotation axis is positioned in o 1 drags the entire fingers structure providing the actuation for the second phalanx for which concerns the closing sequence when the first phalanx is in contact with an object its reaction force locks the rotation and the remaining part of the kinematic structure is moved by a torque generated on the crank ta that allows for a 90 rotation of the second phalanx around the pivot point o 2 the dimensions of the finger components have been determined on the basis of the kinematic model described above starting from the length of the first and second phalanges 68 mm and 61 mm respectively the adoption of selective laser sintering technology allowed for minimizing the number of elements of the end effector mechanical structure and to create light and flexible structures such as the spring of the quadrilateral of the first phalanx and the fin ray pattern structure inspired by the festo fingripper design wilson 2011 that entails the adaptive grip of the second phalanx 4 arm and gripper prototyping the physical prototype of the underwater manipulator has been manufactured by means of additive manufacturing technologies in particular selective laser sintering sls has been adopted to build the polymeric components such as the modular parts of the arm and the adaptive fingers of the gripper the polymer used is the pa 2200 characterized by a higher melting point and a more crystalline structure if compared to traditional polyamide at the same time direct metal laser sintering dmls has been employed for the prototyping of the gear train components in stainlesssteel gp1 material such as shafts and screws fig 10 shows the reference configuration chosen for the prototyping and testing and the implementation of the control system it consists of a 5 dof architecture obtained by assembling three link modules with bridge components and the gripper this configuration allows the robotic arm to move and operate its gripper into a polar working envelope fig 11 with conical dead zones both above and below the robot structure due to the physical limits imposed by the link modules adopted for this specific layout the physical prototype of the underwater manipulator has been tested both in air and in water in a laboratory pool furthermore the manipulator at rest has been successfully tested in a hydrodynamic chamber at a pressure of 4 atm a grasping test has been carried out on various objects of different shapes fig 12 i e objects with cylindrical spherical and flexible shapes with a maximum weight of 1 5 kg in water the tests showed that unlike currently available mini rov robotic manipulators that have only clasping abilities the proposed robotic arm allows for mimicking work class manipulator abilities thanks to its modular architecture design that enables multiple dofs the adaptive gripper is able to grip and handle a large variety of objects with different shapes sizes surfaces and textures 5 master slave control this section describes the master slave control system firstly the kinematic model of the arm configuration chosen to be prototyped and tested fig 10 has been deducted in order to replicate it in the design of the master device subsequently the teleoperation control architecture has been defined to determine the hardware and software to be implemented finally experimentations have been carried out to test the effectiveness and the limits of the proposed teleoperation system 5 1 kinematics model of the arm the direct kinematics model of the specific arm configuration adopted for the prototyping and testing has been determined by adopting the denavit hartenberg dh method hartenberg and denavit 1955 through this method it is possible to calculate the location of the ee s frame coordinate with respect to the base b coordinate system by means of the homogeneous matrix t b e that takes into account the joint variables and link lengths in particular the 5 dof arm configuration fig 13 consists of five links i including the basis and the end effector and five joints q i in particular three joints allow for the shoulder and elbow s rotation and arm s elevation while the last two joints are related to the ee for rotating the wrist rotation and opening closing the fingers the homogeneous transform matrix of the arm end in the base coordinate system is t b e t 0 1 t 1 2 t 2 3 t 3 4 where the first three elementary transformations i e t 0 1 t 1 2 and t 2 3 have been calculated according to the dh convention by defining the following parameters the joint angle θ i the joint distance d i the link length a i and the link twist angle α i the following table 1 shows the dh parameters where r and d are the rotational and translational matrices respectively once the dh parameters have been defined they have been integrated in the following formulation in order to derive the transformation matrices t i i 1 cos θ i s e n θ i cos α i s e n θ i sen α i a i cos θ i s e n θ i cos θ i cos α i cos θ i s e n α i a i sen θ i 0 s e n α i cos α i d i 0 0 0 1 the ee does not follow the dh convention therefore the last coordinate transformation matrix i e t 3 4 has been deduced as follows t 34 r z q 4 d z l 3 5 2 design of the master device the master device fig 14 has been designed to replicate the kinematics of the slave arm and to feature high ergonomics of the handle the master arm is characterized by a modular structure that consists of four main elements servomotors connectors handle and trigger in particular it features five dynamixel xl 320 actuators with a fully integrated motor and servo module as depicted in the following figure four servomotors have been employed for shoulder rotation β 1 elbow elevation β 2 and wrist motions β 3 and β 4 a fifth servomotor has been adopted to actuate the opening closing β 5 of the slave s gripper by means of a trigger the adoption of servomotors of small dimensions allowed for a scaling factor of 1 2 between the link lengths l j of the master and slave devices all the servomotors have been assembled by means of connectors specifically designed and realized with 3d printing technologies the same technologies have been adopted for the manufacturing of the trigger and the ergonomic handle too servomotors have been preferred to encoders in the master arm design because they facilitate and improve the efficacy of the shadowing technique that is implemented in the master slave control system in fact thanks to servos when a pose of the master arm is settled it maintains the position and stands by for new instructions moreover it is possible to define a predefined set of positions to reach when the system is powered or to support calibration procedures 5 3 teleoperation due to the modularity of the robot arm each module has to be controlled locally independently from the configuration of the manipulator then an independent joint control strategy siciliano et al 2010 has been adopted in order to achieve this goal it is a decentralized control technique in which the joints are decoupled and their dynamics are modelled by a fixed linear second order system plus a disturbance torque representing all the unmodeled dynamics such as coupling effects and payload uncertainties hsia et al 1988 this strategy simplifies the development of the master slave teleoperation because it leads the design to a decentralized control structure in which each joint is treated as a single input single output system this allows for splitting the system into local controlled sub systems where the resulting algorithm structure is based on the relative position error between the master and slave joint angles in particular the teleoperation control algorithm has been established on the basis of the approach suggested by tsai and morgan 1985 bobgan and kazerooni 1991 wei et al 1996 that is characterized by two different time periods i e link off and link on phases in the first phase the slave device is stationary and the master is in motion whereas in the second one the slave manipulator chases the master s position in particular the teleoperation system s algorithm reads the angles of the master manipulator joints β 1 β 5 and its position and attitude are estimated through the kinematics model the position and attitude are then shifted and scaled according to the base coordinate of the slave device in order to calculate the joints of its angles θ 1 θ 5 these angles minus those of the previous pose result in the difference values of the angles δθ 1 δθ 5 that are the commands for controlling the slave s motion which adjustment is based on a proportional control on the position the teleoperation control system requires a preliminary calibration phase between the manipulator devices aimed at setting the slave arm into the zero position fig 13 of the master arm about the motion control since the master slave system lacks of feedback that provides the absolute position of the joints a software workaround that controls servos according to a trapezoidal move profile has been implemented to achieve the desired effects 5 3 1 teleoperation control architecture the teleoperation control architecture is depicted in the following figure on the basis of the 5 dof configuration described in the previous section the master manipulator depicted on the left side of fig 15 is equipped with 5 parallel connected dynamixel xl 320 servomotors equipped with an encoder the encoder has 1034 counts revolution which gives an angular resolution of 0 29 an opencm9 04 is used as the controller to collect and send data to a workstation through a serial socket the slave arm depicted on the right side of fig 15 presents 5 dynamixel ax 18a servomotors connected in series that communicate with the calculator by means of a usb2dynamixel micro controller the calculator receives as input the data acquired by the controllers about the joints position of the master and slave devices then elaborates with translation and scaling operations and compares them by means of a software implemented ad hoc in c the pc performs these operations in order to define the relative displacements of the slave s joints accordingly to the desired master s pose and finally provide the actuation of the slave s servomotors 5 4 experimental test of the teleoperation system the teleoperation system has been tested by adopting an experimental setup shown in fig 16 consisting of the master slave system and an optical tracking system for the monitoring of the position and attitude of the manipulators the test aims to verify the feasibility of the proposing master slave teleoperation system and to evaluate the performance capabilities of the slave to follow the master arm an optitrack motion capture system has been adopted and equipped with eight infrared cameras that feature a resolution of 1 3 mp and a sample time of 1 120 s the cameras have been mounted onto speed rails fixed to the ceiling of the room this placement allows for minimizing interferences so that each point is visible by at least two cameras at all times the cameras acquire the position and the attitude of the master and the slave devices by monitoring the movements of spherical passive markers fig 16 placed on both devices the 2d images caught from each camera are sent via usb to a workstation and processed by the optical motion caption software in order to compute the 3d coordinates and to provide as output a 3d point cloud generated by the markers positions over time about the master slave system the manipulator as depicted in fig 17 has been anchored to a desk by means a structural aluminum support and a vise prior to proceed with the experimentations some preliminary activities have been carried out firstly the optical motion capture system needed to be configured and calibrated the calibration process has been performed in order to compute position and orientation of each camera and estimate lens distortions in captured images furthermore the calibration data allowed to define the 3d capture volume within the motion tracking was accomplished this preliminary calibration process allowed also for calculating the accuracy of the optical system which measure was 0 197 mm for the described set up secondly the precision of the optical system has been determined in order to take a measure of the systematic errors that could affect the overall acquisition process this measure has been calculated starting from a data set of 1200 spatial positions acquired by capturing a marker pose in a lapse time of 10 s the variation coefficient resultant was 15 6 10 6 thirdly six passive markers were pasted on each manipulator fig 17 in particular three markers were devoted to define the plane normal to the rotation axis of the joint 2 fig 13 and the others were devoted to the motion tracking of the 2 link a fourth preliminary activity was carried out for the development of algorithms implemented in matlab that support the analysis and interpretation of the tracking data in fact the algorithms project the 3d captured data on the reference plane generated by means the first set of markers and perform a fitting procedure of the 3d points acquired through the second set of markers from which it is possible to infer the joint s angular displacement finally when the preliminary activities were accomplished the experimental test was carried out by rotating the elbow master s joint in the range β 2 0 90 fig 14 and specifically starting from the position depicted in fig 17 and following a downward motion with a constant velocity various motions which differ for the number of intermediate steps of the master and slave devices have been tracked the use of commercial off the shelf electronics allow for a reduction of the hardware cost but imply a reduction in terms of performance as a consequence the main aim of the experimental test was to evaluate the feasibility and the overall performances of the arm prototype therefore potential optimisation processes of the control software have been postponed for future improvements 5 4 1 results and discussion the following graphs fig 18 are three examples of the different tests conducted on the master slave system in order to evaluate some time or angle dependencies in particular the graphs show the time required by the master and slave devices to reach predetermined angular displacements thanks to the adoption of the external measuring instrument the results are not affected by the pc influence from the analysis of the graphs it has been possible to infer the presence of a time delay between the master and the slave manipulators this delay due to the communication channels and the time required to reach the desired end effector pose presents an average value of 1 90 s with a standard deviation of 0 8 s about the accumulation of delay over the time the data didn t provide sufficient evidence the line graphs indicate also a systematic position error located between the desired angle and the actual slave s position in the direction of the movement starting point with an average value of 9 03 and a standard deviation of 0 3 from the data it is not possible to infer a correlation between this error and the time neither with the target angle most probably it is due to inefficiencies of the control system and of the supporting mechanical structure in conclusion the evaluation test has demonstrated the need to redesign the slave arm s structure in order to reduce mechanical vibrations increase its robustness and improve the reliability of the control system furthermore more powerful servos have to be adopted in order to have a faster response quicker and smoother acceleration deceleration and higher payload capability about the teleoperation control system the tests have been carried out without any corrective algorithm or chasing strategy because the purpose was the assessment of the first design prototypes before proceeding with the development of more sophisticated control strategies e g to mitigate the impact of the inertia or with serial data feedbacks provided by absolute encoder devices 6 in water test a preliminary experiment has been carried out in realistic conditions to test the proposed arm in particular the test aims to evaluate the accuracy of the manipulator while reaching predefined positions both inside and outside of the water since the manipulator has been designed for the underwater environment when it operates on land it presents some limitations in movements to reach desired positions especially when moving upward because of its weight for this reason the experiment has been carried out by commanding the robotic arm with starting position depicted in fig 17 to move downward and reach the desired β 2 fig 14 angle at 70 and 90 at least 30 measurements have been taken for each commanded position by means of an external measurement system the laboratory dry test has been conducted adopting the set up fig 17 and the motion capture system as an external measuring device detailed in section 5 4 the in water test has been performed in a water tank fig 19 a with the underwater manipulator attached to a fixed platform a calibrated camera housed in a waterproof case detects a passive marker placed on the end effector fig 19b and by coupling these data with the kinematic model of the arm allows to measure the end effector s pose the results shows an accuracy for the air and in water test respectively of 7 02 0 97 and 6 38 1 82 for the desired angle of 70 4 67 2 63 and 2 57 3 09 for the desired angle of 90 these results demonstrate that the manipulator s accuracy improves in the underwater environment because of the buoyancy that reduces the gravity effects and allows servomotors to operate more accurately no meaningful hydrodynamic effects have been detected during the test 7 conclusions this paper has presented some innovative solutions for the underwater manipulation field a lightweight modular underwater manipulator that can be mounted on small size rovs has been designed and prototyped taking advantage of the modern additive manufacturing technologies the modularity feature of the arm has been achieved by designing two structural components that allow for various different configurations each one characterized by its number of dofs the underwater manipulator has been equipped with an adaptive gripper designed to be

side this design solution entailed a number of limitations on the performances of the overall system that required the development of specific software workarounds this design approach has been justified by the fact that the proposed innovative solutions require a first feasibility study aimed to uncover the strengths and weakness of their design and control system before proceeding with further improvements in fact the analysis showed that a redesign of the control system and the supporting structure along with the adoption of more powerful servos are required in order to improve the overall performance of the system and further experimentations i e static and dynamic tests need to be performed in the underwater environment on more complex configurations of the robotic arm 
23403,underwater exploration in the last years has evolved toward a wide adoption of increasingly smaller rovs remotely operated vehicle as a consequence the need to equip these underwater vehicles with robotic arms is currently rising as well according to this demand the paper presents three innovative solutions achieved in the uvms underwater vehicle manipulator system field firstly the paper proposes a modular architecture for a lightweight underwater robotic arm which can be mounted on small sized rovs the modular concept of the arm enables several different configurations each one characterized by the related dofs deployed according to the type of application to be performed secondly the arm has been equipped with an adaptive gripper that taking advantage of the additive manufacturing techniques is able to easily grip differently shaped objects lastly the underwater arm is controlled through a master slave approach designed for commercial off the shelf electronics that on the one hand entailed a significant reduction of the bill of materials but on the other hand required a greater effort in the software development experimental tests have been carried out to measure and evaluate the gripping and manipulation capability of the robotic arm and the performance of the proposed control system keywords underwater vehicle manipulator systems uvms underwater manipulation master slave control modular robotic arm flexible gripper 1 introduction if performed in some particular conditions underwater explorations can raise risks for human operators this is the reason why subsea scouting is carried out with unmanned underwater vehicles equipped with one or more robotic arms uvms underwater vehicle manipulator system beside a small number of experimentations on auvs autonomous underwater vehicles lane et al 1997 marani et al 2009 yu et al 2013 xiang et al 2015 ridao et al 2015 the manipulation is commonly and largely implemented on rov remotely operated vehicle systems kawamura 2015 ribas et al 2015 bruno et al 2016 youakim et al 2017 rizzo et al 2017 recently the employment of small working rovs i e observer rovs is becoming more common thanks to their high portability and reduced dimensions but because of their lightweight design they can be equipped with simple prehension tools with 1 or 2 degrees of freedom dof and currently there are only a few examples of observer rovs with articulated robotic arms sakagami et al 2010 ambar and sagara 2015 in underwater manipulation a fundamental role is played by end effectors about impactive grippers the scientific literature presents anthropomorphic tools with three or four fingers mouri et al 2002 chen 2012 telegenov et al 2015 and non anthropomorphic ones with three jointed fingers cabas and balaguer 2005 bartolini et al 2000 these grippers include rigid fingers that are not well suited for accurate manipulation tasks that require a soft touch like the recovery of archaeological finds or the collecting of biological specimens for this reason for a few years now there is the tendency to design adaptive grippers able to adapt their fingers to the widest variety of objects about the control of manipulators the reference market offers a plethora of robotic control systems for underwater applications but these products are expensive because of their complex control architectures on the basis of these considerations the paper presents three innovative achievements in the uvms field 1 a lightweight modular arm architecture that can be fitted on observer class rovs the modular feature enables various different configurations each one characterized by its number of degrees of freedom and kinematic model 2 an adaptive gripper characterized by an interchangeable palm for an easy integration of 2 and 4 finger elements and by a form locking gripping achieved by means of a flexible structure that allows for a quick and reliable handling of differently shaped objects without causing any damage 3 a master slave control system designed with commercial off the shelf electronics that entailed a significant reduction of the hardware costs the master manipulator has been designed to replicate the slave s kinematics in order to improve the usability of the control system the paper describes in detail the design of the proposed solutions and the assessment of the first physical prototypes in order to verify their feasibility and to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of their design and control system prior to proceed with further improvements the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the architecture of the modular underwater robotic arm is presented while the design of its adaptive gripper is described in section 3 the physical prototype of the manipulator is shown in section 4 section 5 describes the proposed master slave system its teleoperation control architecture and experimentation finally section 6 presents the conclusions of the paper 2 architecture of the underwater manipulator 2 1 design of the robotic arm the robotic arm has been designed to equip observer rovs with manipulators able to perform a much greater number of tasks if compared to simple tools with only 1 2 dofs this purpose has been achieved thanks to a modular lightweight structure that allows for different design configurations in particular the modularity is enabled by adopting only two classes of components fig 1 i e link module and bridge which have been designed to be manufactured by means of additive manufacturing technologies the link module s geometry fig 1a has been optimized to house servomotors and the motion transfer mechanism in particular the servos are held in place by two rails while their electric cables pass through wiring hooks integrated into the geometry the link module has a length of 100 mm a thickness of 3 mm and it features five air chambers that allow for a reduction of its weight in water these modules can be easily and quickly assembled by means of the bridge type components in fact the square section at the flat bottom of the link module allows for the assembly with a bridge i element fig 1b while on the opposite end a cylindrical shaped slot allows for the connection with bridge ii fig 1c and bridge iii fig 1d type components the bridge components differ for the enabled relative movements in fact the first one fig 1b allows for joining two link modules without adding any dofs while the second fig 1c and the third fig 1d types add a rotational dof to the robotic system i e a relative rotation of 180 and 360 respectively then by assembling link module and bridge components is possible to achieve a large variety of configurations each one characterized by its number of dofs fig 2 2 2 driving system design the driving system fig 3 features a motor and a motion transmission mechanism servos have been adopted as motors because despite their reduced speed they allow for a better control of the arm s position robotis dynamixel ax 18a servomotors have been chosen on the basis of three characteristics commercial off the shelf products high torque to size ratio and cascade communication capability about the motion transmission mechanism a worm gear has been adopted with the aims to avoid retrograde motion without using brakes and to minimize volumes and number of components that could introduce undesired frictions and inertias on the basis of these design solutions the ratio gear of the driving system has been chosen to maximize the worm gear output torque and minimize its dimensions in particular on the one hand the driving system s output torque depends on the ratio gear to be defined and on the worm gear efficiency and the servo s stall torque 0 22 for steel alloy components and 1 8 nm at the higher voltage of 12 v respectively on the other hand the worm wheel diameter is affected by the servo s dimensions 32 50 40 mm the screw s number of coils and the ratio gear as a consequence in order to satisfy both the abovementioned requirements a reduction ratio of 30 1 providing a driving system s output torque of 11 9 nm has been adopted as depicted in fig 3 the plug and play design is achieved by means of a square section shaft integral to the wheel that simplifies the assembly with bridge type components fastened down by two grub screws furthermore three ball bearings allow for reducing the radial loads on the worm gear while two o rings have been applied for the watertight in particular the cross section view depicted in fig 4 shows three nitrile rubber type o rings the first two are devoted to the waterproof seal for the driving mechanism and its housing and are applied to the cylindrical contact surface between the support and link module and the support and the rotational part of the joint the third one is placed on the inferior part of the joint shaft in contact with the inner cylindrical surface of a bridge ii or iii component and assures the watertight of a second link module component the waterproof design for dynamic sealing has been carried out by adopting the design rules provided by the manufacturer starting from the groove and bore diameters and the diametrical clearance of the joint shaft and stopper fig 4 and in accordance with iso 3601 standard suitable o ring sizes have been defined in particular the o rings placed on the joint shaft have the diameter of 20 88 mm and cross section of 1 78 mm while the o ring placed on the support has inside diameter 33 05 mm and cross section 1 78 mm 2 3 simulation and analysis prior to proceed with physical prototyping the modular robotic arm has been subjected to fem analysis in order to simulate and verify its reliability and integrity in the underwater environment in particular the link module has been subjected to static analysis taking into account the materials adopted for the additive manufacturing pa2200 a polyamide with high strength and stiffness and gp1 a pre alloyed stainless steel the results demonstrated that the steel component fig 5 a keeps a full functionality with a factor of safety of 1 9 at the maximum operating depth at which observer rovs operate namely a depth of 300 m below the sea level with a water pressure of 3 1 mpa on the contrary the polymeric component which results are depicted in fig 5b tolerates a pressure of 0 4 mpa at a maximum depth of 30 m below the sea level an intermediate design solution that allows to safely operate at intermediate depths up to 100 m could be reached by adopting polymeric components with metallic steel inserts additional analyses have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the watertight seal that is affected by the pressure range at which the o rings work on the basis of the technical documentation supplied by the o ring s producer the results of the analysis carried out on the module link show that the waterproofness of the housing is not compromised in particular at a depth of 30 m the polymeric module link component shows a displacement of 0 42 mm that does not exceed the upper threshold value of 0 59 mm even better for the steel component which presents a displacement of 0 027 mm at a depth of 300 m far below the upper limit 3 design of the gripper the manipulator s end effector ee is a mechanical gripper fig 6 with adaptive fingers that allows for handling differently shaped objects and ensure an efficient grip it is assembled to the robotic arm by means of a bridge ii type component fig 1c that has been modified and strengthened to support the torsional and bending loads the ee s case houses mechanical components and two actuators one for the wrist rotation and another one for the movement of the fingers the ee features also an interchangeable palm fig 7 that depending on the requirements allows for an easy and fast change of the gripper with two or four fingers the kinematic motion of the wrist is accomplished by coupling a gear wheel integral to the servomotor shaft and a crown wheel while the fingers motion is given by an under actuated self locking mechanism fig 8 in which a worm gear driven by an electric actuator transmits the motion to the fingers by means of two couples of gear wheels in particular the servomotor through a mechanical adapter drives a worm screw accommodated by two ball bearings a stopper with the function of strengthening the mechanism stops the axial loads generated by the worm screw rotation the finger s articulation has been designed on the basis of the anthropomorphic kinematic structure depicted in the following figure it is a simple mechanical linkage system that emulates the finger kinematics as depicted in fig 9 the finger mechanism consists of two phalanges that allow for 2 dof rotational motions with one degree of actuation in particular thanks to the design of the first phalanx that mimes a helical spring with elastic modulus k the gear wheel which rotation axis is positioned in o 1 drags the entire fingers structure providing the actuation for the second phalanx for which concerns the closing sequence when the first phalanx is in contact with an object its reaction force locks the rotation and the remaining part of the kinematic structure is moved by a torque generated on the crank ta that allows for a 90 rotation of the second phalanx around the pivot point o 2 the dimensions of the finger components have been determined on the basis of the kinematic model described above starting from the length of the first and second phalanges 68 mm and 61 mm respectively the adoption of selective laser sintering technology allowed for minimizing the number of elements of the end effector mechanical structure and to create light and flexible structures such as the spring of the quadrilateral of the first phalanx and the fin ray pattern structure inspired by the festo fingripper design wilson 2011 that entails the adaptive grip of the second phalanx 4 arm and gripper prototyping the physical prototype of the underwater manipulator has been manufactured by means of additive manufacturing technologies in particular selective laser sintering sls has been adopted to build the polymeric components such as the modular parts of the arm and the adaptive fingers of the gripper the polymer used is the pa 2200 characterized by a higher melting point and a more crystalline structure if compared to traditional polyamide at the same time direct metal laser sintering dmls has been employed for the prototyping of the gear train components in stainlesssteel gp1 material such as shafts and screws fig 10 shows the reference configuration chosen for the prototyping and testing and the implementation of the control system it consists of a 5 dof architecture obtained by assembling three link modules with bridge components and the gripper this configuration allows the robotic arm to move and operate its gripper into a polar working envelope fig 11 with conical dead zones both above and below the robot structure due to the physical limits imposed by the link modules adopted for this specific layout the physical prototype of the underwater manipulator has been tested both in air and in water in a laboratory pool furthermore the manipulator at rest has been successfully tested in a hydrodynamic chamber at a pressure of 4 atm a grasping test has been carried out on various objects of different shapes fig 12 i e objects with cylindrical spherical and flexible shapes with a maximum weight of 1 5 kg in water the tests showed that unlike currently available mini rov robotic manipulators that have only clasping abilities the proposed robotic arm allows for mimicking work class manipulator abilities thanks to its modular architecture design that enables multiple dofs the adaptive gripper is able to grip and handle a large variety of objects with different shapes sizes surfaces and textures 5 master slave control this section describes the master slave control system firstly the kinematic model of the arm configuration chosen to be prototyped and tested fig 10 has been deducted in order to replicate it in the design of the master device subsequently the teleoperation control architecture has been defined to determine the hardware and software to be implemented finally experimentations have been carried out to test the effectiveness and the limits of the proposed teleoperation system 5 1 kinematics model of the arm the direct kinematics model of the specific arm configuration adopted for the prototyping and testing has been determined by adopting the denavit hartenberg dh method hartenberg and denavit 1955 through this method it is possible to calculate the location of the ee s frame coordinate with respect to the base b coordinate system by means of the homogeneous matrix t b e that takes into account the joint variables and link lengths in particular the 5 dof arm configuration fig 13 consists of five links i including the basis and the end effector and five joints q i in particular three joints allow for the shoulder and elbow s rotation and arm s elevation while the last two joints are related to the ee for rotating the wrist rotation and opening closing the fingers the homogeneous transform matrix of the arm end in the base coordinate system is t b e t 0 1 t 1 2 t 2 3 t 3 4 where the first three elementary transformations i e t 0 1 t 1 2 and t 2 3 have been calculated according to the dh convention by defining the following parameters the joint angle θ i the joint distance d i the link length a i and the link twist angle α i the following table 1 shows the dh parameters where r and d are the rotational and translational matrices respectively once the dh parameters have been defined they have been integrated in the following formulation in order to derive the transformation matrices t i i 1 cos θ i s e n θ i cos α i s e n θ i sen α i a i cos θ i s e n θ i cos θ i cos α i cos θ i s e n α i a i sen θ i 0 s e n α i cos α i d i 0 0 0 1 the ee does not follow the dh convention therefore the last coordinate transformation matrix i e t 3 4 has been deduced as follows t 34 r z q 4 d z l 3 5 2 design of the master device the master device fig 14 has been designed to replicate the kinematics of the slave arm and to feature high ergonomics of the handle the master arm is characterized by a modular structure that consists of four main elements servomotors connectors handle and trigger in particular it features five dynamixel xl 320 actuators with a fully integrated motor and servo module as depicted in the following figure four servomotors have been employed for shoulder rotation β 1 elbow elevation β 2 and wrist motions β 3 and β 4 a fifth servomotor has been adopted to actuate the opening closing β 5 of the slave s gripper by means of a trigger the adoption of servomotors of small dimensions allowed for a scaling factor of 1 2 between the link lengths l j of the master and slave devices all the servomotors have been assembled by means of connectors specifically designed and realized with 3d printing technologies the same technologies have been adopted for the manufacturing of the trigger and the ergonomic handle too servomotors have been preferred to encoders in the master arm design because they facilitate and improve the efficacy of the shadowing technique that is implemented in the master slave control system in fact thanks to servos when a pose of the master arm is settled it maintains the position and stands by for new instructions moreover it is possible to define a predefined set of positions to reach when the system is powered or to support calibration procedures 5 3 teleoperation due to the modularity of the robot arm each module has to be controlled locally independently from the configuration of the manipulator then an independent joint control strategy siciliano et al 2010 has been adopted in order to achieve this goal it is a decentralized control technique in which the joints are decoupled and their dynamics are modelled by a fixed linear second order system plus a disturbance torque representing all the unmodeled dynamics such as coupling effects and payload uncertainties hsia et al 1988 this strategy simplifies the development of the master slave teleoperation because it leads the design to a decentralized control structure in which each joint is treated as a single input single output system this allows for splitting the system into local controlled sub systems where the resulting algorithm structure is based on the relative position error between the master and slave joint angles in particular the teleoperation control algorithm has been established on the basis of the approach suggested by tsai and morgan 1985 bobgan and kazerooni 1991 wei et al 1996 that is characterized by two different time periods i e link off and link on phases in the first phase the slave device is stationary and the master is in motion whereas in the second one the slave manipulator chases the master s position in particular the teleoperation system s algorithm reads the angles of the master manipulator joints β 1 β 5 and its position and attitude are estimated through the kinematics model the position and attitude are then shifted and scaled according to the base coordinate of the slave device in order to calculate the joints of its angles θ 1 θ 5 these angles minus those of the previous pose result in the difference values of the angles δθ 1 δθ 5 that are the commands for controlling the slave s motion which adjustment is based on a proportional control on the position the teleoperation control system requires a preliminary calibration phase between the manipulator devices aimed at setting the slave arm into the zero position fig 13 of the master arm about the motion control since the master slave system lacks of feedback that provides the absolute position of the joints a software workaround that controls servos according to a trapezoidal move profile has been implemented to achieve the desired effects 5 3 1 teleoperation control architecture the teleoperation control architecture is depicted in the following figure on the basis of the 5 dof configuration described in the previous section the master manipulator depicted on the left side of fig 15 is equipped with 5 parallel connected dynamixel xl 320 servomotors equipped with an encoder the encoder has 1034 counts revolution which gives an angular resolution of 0 29 an opencm9 04 is used as the controller to collect and send data to a workstation through a serial socket the slave arm depicted on the right side of fig 15 presents 5 dynamixel ax 18a servomotors connected in series that communicate with the calculator by means of a usb2dynamixel micro controller the calculator receives as input the data acquired by the controllers about the joints position of the master and slave devices then elaborates with translation and scaling operations and compares them by means of a software implemented ad hoc in c the pc performs these operations in order to define the relative displacements of the slave s joints accordingly to the desired master s pose and finally provide the actuation of the slave s servomotors 5 4 experimental test of the teleoperation system the teleoperation system has been tested by adopting an experimental setup shown in fig 16 consisting of the master slave system and an optical tracking system for the monitoring of the position and attitude of the manipulators the test aims to verify the feasibility of the proposing master slave teleoperation system and to evaluate the performance capabilities of the slave to follow the master arm an optitrack motion capture system has been adopted and equipped with eight infrared cameras that feature a resolution of 1 3 mp and a sample time of 1 120 s the cameras have been mounted onto speed rails fixed to the ceiling of the room this placement allows for minimizing interferences so that each point is visible by at least two cameras at all times the cameras acquire the position and the attitude of the master and the slave devices by monitoring the movements of spherical passive markers fig 16 placed on both devices the 2d images caught from each camera are sent via usb to a workstation and processed by the optical motion caption software in order to compute the 3d coordinates and to provide as output a 3d point cloud generated by the markers positions over time about the master slave system the manipulator as depicted in fig 17 has been anchored to a desk by means a structural aluminum support and a vise prior to proceed with the experimentations some preliminary activities have been carried out firstly the optical motion capture system needed to be configured and calibrated the calibration process has been performed in order to compute position and orientation of each camera and estimate lens distortions in captured images furthermore the calibration data allowed to define the 3d capture volume within the motion tracking was accomplished this preliminary calibration process allowed also for calculating the accuracy of the optical system which measure was 0 197 mm for the described set up secondly the precision of the optical system has been determined in order to take a measure of the systematic errors that could affect the overall acquisition process this measure has been calculated starting from a data set of 1200 spatial positions acquired by capturing a marker pose in a lapse time of 10 s the variation coefficient resultant was 15 6 10 6 thirdly six passive markers were pasted on each manipulator fig 17 in particular three markers were devoted to define the plane normal to the rotation axis of the joint 2 fig 13 and the others were devoted to the motion tracking of the 2 link a fourth preliminary activity was carried out for the development of algorithms implemented in matlab that support the analysis and interpretation of the tracking data in fact the algorithms project the 3d captured data on the reference plane generated by means the first set of markers and perform a fitting procedure of the 3d points acquired through the second set of markers from which it is possible to infer the joint s angular displacement finally when the preliminary activities were accomplished the experimental test was carried out by rotating the elbow master s joint in the range β 2 0 90 fig 14 and specifically starting from the position depicted in fig 17 and following a downward motion with a constant velocity various motions which differ for the number of intermediate steps of the master and slave devices have been tracked the use of commercial off the shelf electronics allow for a reduction of the hardware cost but imply a reduction in terms of performance as a consequence the main aim of the experimental test was to evaluate the feasibility and the overall performances of the arm prototype therefore potential optimisation processes of the control software have been postponed for future improvements 5 4 1 results and discussion the following graphs fig 18 are three examples of the different tests conducted on the master slave system in order to evaluate some time or angle dependencies in particular the graphs show the time required by the master and slave devices to reach predetermined angular displacements thanks to the adoption of the external measuring instrument the results are not affected by the pc influence from the analysis of the graphs it has been possible to infer the presence of a time delay between the master and the slave manipulators this delay due to the communication channels and the time required to reach the desired end effector pose presents an average value of 1 90 s with a standard deviation of 0 8 s about the accumulation of delay over the time the data didn t provide sufficient evidence the line graphs indicate also a systematic position error located between the desired angle and the actual slave s position in the direction of the movement starting point with an average value of 9 03 and a standard deviation of 0 3 from the data it is not possible to infer a correlation between this error and the time neither with the target angle most probably it is due to inefficiencies of the control system and of the supporting mechanical structure in conclusion the evaluation test has demonstrated the need to redesign the slave arm s structure in order to reduce mechanical vibrations increase its robustness and improve the reliability of the control system furthermore more powerful servos have to be adopted in order to have a faster response quicker and smoother acceleration deceleration and higher payload capability about the teleoperation control system the tests have been carried out without any corrective algorithm or chasing strategy because the purpose was the assessment of the first design prototypes before proceeding with the development of more sophisticated control strategies e g to mitigate the impact of the inertia or with serial data feedbacks provided by absolute encoder devices 6 in water test a preliminary experiment has been carried out in realistic conditions to test the proposed arm in particular the test aims to evaluate the accuracy of the manipulator while reaching predefined positions both inside and outside of the water since the manipulator has been designed for the underwater environment when it operates on land it presents some limitations in movements to reach desired positions especially when moving upward because of its weight for this reason the experiment has been carried out by commanding the robotic arm with starting position depicted in fig 17 to move downward and reach the desired β 2 fig 14 angle at 70 and 90 at least 30 measurements have been taken for each commanded position by means of an external measurement system the laboratory dry test has been conducted adopting the set up fig 17 and the motion capture system as an external measuring device detailed in section 5 4 the in water test has been performed in a water tank fig 19 a with the underwater manipulator attached to a fixed platform a calibrated camera housed in a waterproof case detects a passive marker placed on the end effector fig 19b and by coupling these data with the kinematic model of the arm allows to measure the end effector s pose the results shows an accuracy for the air and in water test respectively of 7 02 0 97 and 6 38 1 82 for the desired angle of 70 4 67 2 63 and 2 57 3 09 for the desired angle of 90 these results demonstrate that the manipulator s accuracy improves in the underwater environment because of the buoyancy that reduces the gravity effects and allows servomotors to operate more accurately no meaningful hydrodynamic effects have been detected during the test 7 conclusions this paper has presented some innovative solutions for the underwater manipulation field a lightweight modular underwater manipulator that can be mounted on small size rovs has been designed and prototyped taking advantage of the modern additive manufacturing technologies the modularity feature of the arm has been achieved by designing two structural components that allow for various different configurations each one characterized by its number of dofs the underwater manipulator has been equipped with an adaptive gripper designed to be manufactured by means of selective laser sintering technology in order to minimize the number of components and maximize the fingers flexibility furthermore a master slave control system with a fast and intuitive piloting has been proposed electric control devices and servos have been chosen among consumer electronics in order to have a significant reduction of the hardware costs but on the other side this design solution entailed a number of limitations on the performances of the overall system that required the development of specific software workarounds this design approach has been justified by the fact that the proposed innovative solutions require a first feasibility study aimed to uncover the strengths and weakness of their design and control system before proceeding with further improvements in fact the analysis showed that a redesign of the control system and the supporting structure along with the adoption of more powerful servos are required in order to improve the overall performance of the system and further experimentations i e static and dynamic tests need to be performed in the underwater environment on more complex configurations of the robotic arm 
23404,the paper presents a method of determining organizing and displaying ship collision avoidance information which is based on the collision threat parameters area ctpa technique the method makes it possible to visualize navigational threats as well as possible collision avoidance manoeuvres the solution is focused on supporting navigation in severe weather conditions normally collision avoidance decisions are made taking into account targets motion parameters international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs and navigational obstacles however in hard weather conditions each manoeuvre has to be additionally checked to assess whether it is safe in terms of ship s stability therefore the proposed method provides four types of information motion parameters of targets within a given range combinations of own course and speed which collide with those targets combinations of own course and speed which would lead to grounding within a specified time and combinations of own course and speed which could result in stability related dynamical threats optionally it is also possible to display only manoeuvres compliant with colregs a superposition of these types of data enables a navigator to choose an efficient manoeuvre in a situation when possibilities are limited by weather conditions and actual characteristics of the ship stability keywords collision avoidance methods stability severe weather conditions ship target tracking ship radar display 1 introduction one of the reasons why ship accidents still occur is that collision avoidance actions are prone to error if based on unreliable target ship information or if a navigator is under extreme pressure perera and guedes soares 2015 therefore it is equally important to provide navigators with reliable data on targets as it is to present those data in a way which helps them to make quickly right decisions concerning collision avoidance manoeuvres pietrzykowski et al 2016 however apart from information on targets a number of other factors have to be taken into account when choosing a particular manoeuvre including geographical data and weather conditions the former are obviously essential in restricted waters because of various navigational obstacles and risk of grounding when manoeuvring in the proximity of a landmass as for the latter severe weather conditions may seriously limit the possibility of collision avoidance manoeuvres especially the alteration of own course which is the most common evasive action the method proposed in this paper has been designed so as to address those issues by determining and visualizing all combinations of own course and speed which are safe as a result the navigator will be able to make the manoeuvre selection faster while avoiding the risk of ship stability related dynamical adverse phenomena due to unfortunately chosen alteration of own course or speed the paper includes a description of the proposed method as well as examples which demonstrate determining safe manoeuvres in heavy weather conditions the method utilizes laidyn code matusiak 2013 for modelling ship dynamics because it passed numerous benchmark studies and is able to directly model the rudder action and the propeller thrust it must be mentioned though that it is possible to incorporate any other code or ship models the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section the ctpa display technique and other related radar displays are described including past versions of the proposed method sections 3 presents ship s manoeuvrability model and its approximations used in this paper while section 4 describes modelling of ship stability related dangerous dynamical phenomena section 5 presents the method s usefulness in a series of ship encounter scenarios and finally the paper is summarized and briefly concluded in section 6 2 related display techniques and past versions of the proposed method the first visualization methods that featured information on ship collision risk were potential points of collision ppc and predicted areas of danger pads both methods indicated areas that should be avoided by own ship so as not to collide with other ships and targets ppc and pads shapes evolved they were first circles riggs 1973 then ellipses fleischer et al 1973 irregular shapes o sullivan 1982 zhao lin 1988 polygons hakoyama et al 1996 and smooth curves wood and yancey 2002 the common element of pads ppcs and related predicted capability envelope method van breda 2000 was that they indicated areas of danger and by doing this they provided data for determining collision avoidance manoeuvres an alternative approach collision threat parameters area ctpa has been introduced in lenart 1983 with an extended analysis presented in lenart 2015 2 1 ctpa method similarly to pad in ctpa a collision threat is defined as an encounter with a target for which distance at closest point of approach dcpa is smaller than a minimum safe distance d s however the difference between ppc or pad and ctpa is utilization of a coupled cartesian coordinate system each point in the system represents ship s course given by its x and y positions and velocity given by v x v y coordinates which are coupled by a constant time value τ in h 1 x v x τ y v y τ for each target ctpa is defined as an area covering combinations of own course and speed that would cause violating the safe distance between the ships d s consequently the own ship should perform collision avoidance manoeuvres by changing course and speed to points being outside the ctpa area ctpa for a single target encounter is presented in fig 1 where the target s position and velocity vector v are shown ctpa area for a single target is bounded by two straight lines of safe distance dcpa d s for a multiple target encounter the ctpa becomes a superposition of all targets ctpa in such cases manoeuvres violating the safe distance d s may be conditionally allowed if time to the closest point of approach tcpa is large enough and there is no direct safe manoeuvre the tip of the own velocity vector may then be temporarily placed between the lines of dcpa ds and inside the circle of tcpa t c the ctpa technique has been further developed by other researchers cone shaped collision danger sectors cds and collision danger lines cdl have been presented by qiao and pedersen 2004 and qiao et al 2006 in pedersen et al 2003 the authors additionally described an experiment comparing the efficiency of a classic display and a ctpa based display referred to as collision danger presentation cdp its results have indicated the superiority of using the ctpa based display for various traffic conditions 2 2 past versions of the proposed method the integration of automatic radar plotting aids arpa and automatic identification system ais with electronic charts ec weintrit 2009 has resulted in a new generation of marine displays which can now offer consolidated navigational information in line with the concept of e navigation due to this functional progress as well as the rise in computational powers the authors of this paper have decided to re examine the ctpa technique and enhance it by elements that were technologically unavailable when it was first introduced thus an extended ctpa version handling any convex shape of ship domain has been presented in szlapczynski 2009 following that in szlapczynska 2015 a ctpa based display has been described which additionally supported selecting collision avoidance manoeuvres in both good and restricted visibility analytical formulas for determining domain based collision risk parameters time to domain violation tdv and degree of domain violation ddv have been introduced in szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 so as to offer an alternative to classic approach parameters of dcpa and tcpa still popular in collision avoidance research mou et al 2010 li and pang 2013 zhang et al 2015 these new parameters have been applied in the ctpa inspired displaying method szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 which also included information on potential groundings altogether the method presented there indicated combinations of own course and speed which would result in violating the own or targets domains would lead to grounding or would collide with some navigational obstacles or were not compliant with colregs colregs 1972 cockcroft and lameijer 2011 additionally the method featured the accelerated look ahead mode in which the consequences of a proposed manoeuvre after a specified time were shown the summary of the method s functionality and progress up to this paper has been gathered in table 1 the last two rows point out the new elements on which the current paper is focused ship s manoeuvrability and avoiding stability related threats in heavy weather both elements are described in detail in the following sections 3 modelling ship s maneuverability in the proposed method 3 1 ship maneuverability estimation in 6dof approach according to the rule 8 action to avoid collision of the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea any action to avoid collision shall be made in ample time and if there is sufficient sea room alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close quarters situation provided that it is made in good time colregs 1972 these both requirements directly refers to ships encounter development considered versus time which practically amounts to proper in each individual case distance of commencing of course alternation over years there was a massive number of ship crashes and serious disasters due to late undertaken evasive manoeuvres the notion late manoeuvre shall be obviously related to encountering ships sizes and essentially to their speed and extends of a basin required for turning e g to manoeuvring characteristics one of many examples for late decision regarding action to avoid collision may be the case of car carrier baltic ace colliding with the containers vessel corvus j on 5 th of december 2012 causing the loss of the former with her eleven crewmembers a give way ship m s corvus j did not fulfil her duties towards a stand on vessel m s baltic ace as prescribed by collision regulations colreg and continued with her course and speed since the give way vessel failed with her obligation m s baltic ace had to initiate collision evasive action unfortunately this was done too late maritime bulletin 2012 that situation shows an encroachment of the critical distance montewka and krata 2014 krata and montewka 2015 for successful evasive manoeuvre in a given encounter which was directly related to both ships manoeuvrability the manoeuvring characteristics of a vessel are routinely established during sea trials at the end of ship building process and then they are given for further use in the form of a wheelhouse poster the turning circles at maximum rudder angles are plotted and aside from the tactical diameter also the advance and transfer characteristics are given there usually for ballast and fully loaded conditions however the maximum rudder angle is almost never applied in practice except for last chance manoeuvre which shall be avoided at all thanks to proper planning of encounter situations solving moreover such hard turning may be sometimes completely inapplicable due to excessive heel expectations as a consequence of tender stability of a ship krata et al 2016 thus the trajectories of turning vessel needs to be obtained for a useful range of rudder angles then they are utilized in the course of further planning of a safe and efficient collision avoidance manoeuvre taking into account numerous factors influencing ship s manoeuvring characteristics we decided to utilize a state of the art code called laidyn capable to simulate motions of a ship in six degrees of freedom with regard to key elements governing the circulation e g a ship shape hull geometry rudder and propulsion action an impact of external environment wind and wave action the laidyn is capable to carry out the six degrees of freedom simulations of ship motions in time domain in irregular seas conditions the non linear components are implemented and the froude krylov forces the diffraction forces these two relate to wave action and the radiation forces are considered the first are computed by integrating the water pressure over the wetted panels of the hull and the non linear approach is utilized the diffraction forces in turn are evaluated according to the linear model the radiation forces comprising added mass and damping terms take into account the history of the previous motions by applying the memory function the detailed description of the laidyn code is thoroughly presented in matusiak 2013 the positive validation of the code carried out also during the ittc benchmark studies allows to use the laidyn as a credible tool ittc 2002 ittc 2005 spanos and palmquist 2009 it is especially useful for complex operational simulations since besides the wave action both the propeller and the rudder are directly modelled in the code and the kinematics of water flow in waves is taken into account when evaluating the resultant thrust matusiak 2013 in this study the code laidyn is utilized to obtain the time histories of the ship circulations with regard to all her motions similarly to an earlier work matusiak and stigler 2012 the rudder is set consecutively to 10 20 30 to port and then to starboard the ship taken into account is a mid size ro pax whose particulars are as follows table 2 in order to observe the noticeable effects of seas action the weather conditions taken into account in simulations are quite heavy the wind force about 8 on beaufort scale and the corresponding wave system are considered the numerical simulations of 6 dof ship motions provide the time history of coupled motions with regard to the ship characteristics influencing all degrees of freedom however for further use in evasive manoeuvre planning procedure the shape of ship s tracks are essential these trajectories obtained for every single studied case are represented by a set of relative positions in consecutive time steps ti xi yi where xi and yi denote the position of ship s centre of gravity referred to the initial position fixed at the manoeuvre commencing the sample trajectory and heading of the turning ship is shown in fig 2 since the laidyn code is a complex numerical tool providing the full 6 dof description of a ship motion the question may be asked whether such approach is really required most software tools utilized for manoeuvring characteristics estimation get rid of rolling and pitching of a ship however we decided that the influence of ship transverse stability on her manoeuvrability is so significant that cannot be omitted especially reflection on some marine accidents reveals the importance of a complex modelling of ship motions to prevent excessive heeling and capsizing such a case took place for instance on 3 rd of january 2015 when 180 m long car carrier terminated loading cargo in southampton and bounded for bremerhaven in the evening unfortunately pilot s order scarcely port 10 to the helmsman when making good a speed of 12 knots caused an excessively increasing angle of heel leading finally to exposing her rudder and propeller clear of the water marine accident investigation branch maib 2016 another relatively new and well known accident is sinking of sewol ferry due to a sharp turn on 16 april 2014 about 19 miles off the southwest coast the ferry began to list badly just after the sharp turn for the heading towards jeju seanews 2014 both mentioned examples among many others similar to those two clearly show that ship transverse stability characteristics needs to be taken into account in the course of manoeuvring as limiting of the rudder angle during a routine turn for instance at the planned waypoint is pretty simple the restrictions regarding to the rudder angle and resultant rate of ship s turn during anti collision manoeuvre may be problematic thus it would be through profitable to comprise the ship stability characteristics at the stage of an anti collision manoeuvre planning 3 2 course alterations and speed reduction the set of simulations carried out for the ship turning to port and to starboard comprises the full range of rudder settings reaching from 30 up to 30 every single case is repeated three times due to irregular seas taken into account resulting in non deterministic output of the simulation the obtained trajectories are averaged and generalized in the form of a meta model the meta model consists in three formulas enabling calculation of ship s centre of gravity relative position in every moment of the turning manoeuvre and the relative heading the relative position and the relative heading refer to the initial position and the initial heading of the ship at the manoeuvre commencing the formulas of the meta model are as follows 2 x t i 1 6 p i t i y t i 1 6 q i t i h e a d i n g r e l t i 1 5 r i t i where x t and y t denote the expected position at any time step according to the meta model of ship s centre of gravity referred to the initial position fixed at the manoeuvre commencing heading rel t is the relative heading at any time step taking the initial heading at the manoeuvre commencing as zero t is time of the turning manoeuvre p i q i r i are the coefficients adjusted with the use of least squares method according to colregs regulations and the sea routine action the typical collision evasive manoeuvre is just the course alternation significant enough to enable quick identification and undertaken in ample time however the alternatively permitted manoeuvre is ship s speed reduction generally it is much slower then turning and more difficult to recognize for surrounding vessels however in some circumstances slowing down could be the solution thus besides the meta model of turning the other one is worked out to describe the speed reductions characteristics the following scenario is assumed for the simulation purpose the ship is steaming with her typical service speed 17 knots then the reduction of speed is started the process of slowing down the machinery lasts 2 min and the thrust gradually drops down to the value corresponding to the speed 8 knots however the ship is pushed forward by her inertia besides the propeller thrust so the decrease in speed is slower than the thrust reduction the numerical simulation reflecting the assumed scenario is carried out and the obtained result shows that the considered ship requires about 10 min time to slow down from the service speed to the speed 8 knots which still ensures proper manoeuvrability of the ship the outcome is presented in fig 3 according to the result of the performed simulation the ship slowing down characteristics is presented in further modelling of the collision evasive manoeuvre in the form of the programming convenient meta model as follows 3 v t i 1 9 s i t i 1 where s i are coefficients of the polynomial model and t is the time from the speed reduction manoeuvre initiation elaboration of the two meta models allows for time efficient computations at the stage of collision evasive manoeuvre planning the simulations of ship motion do not need to be repeated on board 4 modelling of stability related dynamical phenomena in the proposed method weather conditions have long been taken into account in marine navigation but lately they have become more important because of improved ability to predict weather dynamics moreover the sophisticated numerical tools development enables more and more realistic modelling of ship and environment interaction dealing with harsh or extreme weather conditions has been discussed by multiple authors research on more accurate weather forecasts for marine purposes has been documented in natskår et al 2015 roulston et al 2005 among others the consequent progress in weather routing has been documented in multiple works including mannarini et al 2013 szlapczynska 2015 vettor and guedes soares 2017 an analysis of the wave climate along the main north atlantic routes has been presented in vettor et al 2017 and a similar study on weather conditions for european coastal routes has been provided in vettor and guedes soares 2017 the impact of harsh weather on ship routing and navigation has been discussed in chen et al 2013 decò and frangopol 2015 perera and guedes soares 2017 and the impact on ship s behaviour and safety in acanfora et al 2017 suzuki et al 2017 in a similar vein the authors of the current paper investigate how adverse weather affects possible collision avoidance manoeuvres 4 1 time effective approach to ship stability issues the laidyn code utilized for the purpose of estimation of the ship manoeuvring characteristics with regard to weather action is capable to model the dynamical stability issues the laidyn s output contains ship response in 6 degrees of freedom approach and even such complex phenomena like parametric rolling are comprised matusiak and stigler 2012 acanfora et al 2017 so the straightforward solution would be continuation of this tool utilization however there is a crucial difference between the manoeuvring characteristics estimation and ship s rolling prediction the first may be much easier generalized and repeated runs of simulation return the comparable results in turn in case of dynamic stability issues the nonlinear ship response may differ significantly depending on the irregular waves sequence therefore the ship roll response is usually analysed for relatively long time of steady course sailing acanfora et al 2017 or by multiple simulation for a manoeuvring vessel for that reason and additionally taking into account the time of simulation reaching more than a half of real time of the simulated manoeuvre we decided to simplify the approach to the ship dynamical stability threats the recommendations included in the revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions imo document numbered msc 1 circ 1228 are applied instead of the use of laidyn at this stage of the research which makes the method time efficient and therefore fully applicable on board the revised guidance is intended to give significant help to ship masters when sailing in stormy conditions this publication contains a set of remarks and advices regarding the avoidance of following dangerous dynamical phenomena at sea like surf riding and broaching to reduction of intact stability when riding a wave crest amidships synchronous rolling parametric roll motions imo 2007 usually the guidance is used in route execution as an advice providing some restrictions of speed and course configurations however we assume that analogous restrictions are appropriate to any phase of the sea voyage including the manoeuvres not only when following the planned straight route our intention is to plan the collision evasive action and any other manoeuvre with regard to both colregs rules and dynamic constraints resulting from the ship stability characteristics related to actual sea state according to the revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions the ship shall avoid some configurations of her speed and course in order not to expose herself to excessive rolling and accelerations or loss of steering control during surf riding or severe green water loads imo 2007 the excessive rolling may be typically caused by resonance type phenomena synchronous or parametric rolling which leads to rapid growth of accelerations and mass forces acting on the ship structure equipment and carried cargo this can bring on exceeding of cargo lashing loads and damage or loss of cargo acanfora et al 2017 such accidents have been noticed for instance in case of serious cargo damage experienced by the large container vessel svendborg maersk the 347 m long fully cellular container vessel was bound for far east destination encountering quite heavy weather off the english channel she suddenly and without warning rolled to extreme angles and a large number of cargo containers fell overboard dmaib 2014 the very essential remark is that such sort of rapid response of a ship may build up in short time thus even in relatively short lasting manoeuvre like anti collision turning the conditions for synchronous and parametric rolling development should be avoided also another dangerous phenomena mentioned in the guidance are able to damage ship and cargo or even lead to the ship capsizing in relatively short time the green water loads are destructive to ships buchner 2002 the pure loss of stability due to prolongated sailing in wave crest amidships may cause capsizing or at least large amplitudes of roll umeda et al 2017 sailing in following and quartering seas can lead to surf riding or broaching depending on the froude number spyrou and umeda 1995 the common feature of all listed dynamical phenomena is quite short time required to activate the dangerous aftermaths thus including of them into the manoeuvre planning algorithm may be found as a proactive safety oriented approach since the guidance provides the formulas allowing for calculation of the potentially dangerous zones location location related to the ship the visualization is prepared with the use of a software strictly based on these formulas which is described in krata and szlapczynska 2011 the result obtained for the considered vessel is shown in fig 4 the crucial input element to the formulas allowing for calculation of the diagram shown in fig 4 is besides the ship dimensions the metacentric height it is assumed that the gm governs the natural period of roll which decides of tuning or mistuning of the ship roll response with the encountering wave as a result the resonance origin phenomena may likely develop or not the significant influence of proper application of the metacentric height notion onto the location of dangerous zones is examined and described in some latest works krata and wawrzynski 2017a 2017b and the practical implementation of this approach to weather routing algorithm is described in krata and szlapczyńska 2018 in such a case it is particularly important to provide an adequate value of the metacentric height the problem is not trivial since the initial metacentric height routinely calculated and reported on board may be improper value with respect to large amplitudes of rolling which take place during the considered dangerous dynamic phenomena according to the works wawrzynski and krata 2016a 2016b the valid value is so called equivalent metacentric height it may be calculated on the basis of the righting arm curve with regard to its nonlinearity the strongest nonlinearity of the gz curve is noticed the larger difference between initial gm and equivalent gm occurs wawrzynski and krata 2016a 2016b basically in case of linear characteristics of the gz curve the initial metacentric height is valid not only for the small angles of heel but in relatively large range it may be also understood that the equivalent metacentric height equals to the initial gm in case of nonlinear shape of gz curve the equivalent metacentric height has to be calculated according to the formula given in wawrzynski and krata 2016a 2016b and the initial gm is no longer valid for the purpose of the natural period of roll calculation in this particular case of the considered vessel in the assumed loading condition the gz curve is linear within vary large range of angles of heel which is shown in fig 5 this means that the derivative of the righting arm curve with respect to angle of heel directly describing the metacentric height is close to constant in the whole practical range amplitudes of roll therefore the initial metacentric height and the equivalent metacentric height are practically equal thus in this case the initial gm may be applied to the formula enabling the natural period of roll calculation instead of the equivalent gm without deterioration of the accuracy of the dangerous zones location the approach based on the revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions instead of laidyn or any other ship motion simulation code is a kind of simplification however we decided to apply such method mainly for the sake of time effective execution of the main algorithm aiming at the safe navigation planning in adverse weather conditions since one of the objective beaconing in this research is further practical implementation of the results on board ships the excessive time of safe manoeuvre prediction is inacceptable therefore we find the simplification justified 4 2 visualizing the risk related limitations including stability issues altogether the following areas resulting from various types of threats are determined and visualized by the proposed method 1 groundings possible within a configured time 2 major and minor domain violations 3 combinations of courses and speeds which are not recommended due to the potential occurrence of the dangerous dynamic phenomena related to the ship stability characteristics a new feature introduced here 4 speeds not feasible for the own ship optional feature 5 colregs derived limitations optional feature in case of overlapping of areas representing various threats they are displayed as layers in the above listed order potential groundings are by default displayed on top because they are sure to happen if the navigator chooses wrong course and keeps it too long the third layer is less restrictive than the former two however in rough sea conditions the limitations due to potential dynamic stability issues may be vital for the purpose of this work we do not focus on distinguishing the specific sorts of stability problems since the proposed method is addressed to navigators planning collision evasive action we assumed that it would be productive and safety oriented to provide information related to permitted and banned configuration of course and speed without explicit identification of synchronous rolling parametric resonance and others to avoid end user mind overloading authors sea experience suggests that deck officers rarely understand the dynamics of a ship thoroughly enough to distinguish different modes of heavy rolling we provide just simple information about banned location of the ship velocity vector based on simplified approach recommended by imo in the guidance msc circ 1228 as for the last two layers they may be displayed optionally because they represent hints rather than conditions that must be always fulfilled in general the method aims to offer a full picture of navigational threats and limitations though the particular layout of these information on screen is up to the operator and his decisions an example is shown in fig 6 where only the first three types of information groundings domain violations and dangerous dynamic phenomena are displayed so as to make the figure easier to read apart from the standard view the proposed method additionally features an accelerated look ahead mode in which an operator may foresee the consequences of a particular manoeuvre that is how the situation will look after a specified time from performing a manoeuvre detailed examples of using the method including the accelerated look ahead mode are provided in the next section 5 using the method example scenarios all examples presented in this section are encounters on restricted waters this choice is dictated by the fact that the majority of actual ship accidents occur on restricted waters rather than open waters as shown by a number of research projects montewka et al 2010 2014 hu et al 2007 reportedly groundings are one of the most common causations of accident about twice as frequent as ship ship collisions guedes soares and teixeira 2001 also ship ship collisions are more likely to happen on coastal waters than on open sea kujala et al 2009 which can be attributed to higher traffic density and limited sea room for manoeuvring on restricted waters the scenarios in this section include one overtaking encounter one head on encounter and three crossings with 45 90 and 135 differences between the course of the own ship and the course of the potentially colliding target the motion parameters of the ships and wind for all scenarios are provided in table 3 all wind speeds are within 15 20 m s range which corresponds to 29 39 knots and beaufort forces of 7 8 a decentralized elliptically shaped length dependant ship domain is used in all examples as a safety criterion the domain s shape has been first proposed by coldwell 1983 but the dimensions used here have been updated so as to be in line with more recent research in the field based on empirical data hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2015 for each scenario an overview figure is shown first with the own ship marked in this is followed by figure showing the proposed visualization which features combinations of course and speed that may lead to a stability related problems due to parametric resonance surf riding and broaching to or a successive high wave attack finally for each scenario there is a figure showing the results of a selected manoeuvre own ship passing safely targets to make the examples easier to follow all scenarios feature the own ship dealing with only one or two targets however the situations have been designed to maximally limit possible manoeuvres of the own ship so it may be hard to choose the right manoeuvre based on the overview figure fortunately a close look at the figures showing proposed visualization technique reveals that there is a solution to each scenario which makes it possible to avoid collision while obeying colregs and not risking stability related threats due to sea conditions 5 1 scenario 1 overtaking overtaking encounters have been reported to produce a significantly more collisions goerlandt and kujala 2011 hanninen and kujala 2012 than crossing and head on meetings even though the relative speeds are smaller during overtaking the current scenario is an example of a special case of overtaking encounter where choosing a safe manoeuvre is seriously limited by a risk of parametric resonance in fig 7 it is shown that own ship is about to overtake the target in front the motion parameters of both ships are such that a manoeuvre of the own ship is necessary to avoid collision turns to both sides are compliant with colregs in such cases though navigators are usually reluctant to turn towards landmass due to grounding risk so it is possible that a turn to starboard would be selected in this case however as fig 8 shows it is turn to port which is safe here as turns to starboard may lead to an excessive rolling due to parametric resonance the above mentioned turn to port does not have to be larger than 15 which is enough to safely pass the target while steering far enough from the landmass on port the consequences of turning to port by 15 and keeping this course for 25 min are shown in fig 9 where the own ship passes in the safe distance from a target and can turn back to starboard 5 2 scenario 2 head on encounter while head on encounters are relatively rare the risk of collision in case of head on is considerable due to high relative speed and little time for manoeuvring according to hanninen and kujala 2012 even a minor alteration of course is usually enough to avoid collision then however if there is more than one target involved and manoeuvres are limited because of severe weather conditions the head on situation can still be difficult which is illustrated by the following example in fig 10 the positions and courses of three ships are shown the own ship is facing two targets in front of these two the head on encounter with a target on port requires a collision avoidance manoeuvre according to colregs the own ship should turn to starboard however the presence of another target on starboard makes the decision harder and the navigator could theoretically try a turn to port instead fortunately fig 11 leaves no doubt as to which manoeuvre is safe turning to port is not possible a minor turn could result in dangerous parametric rolling blue area and a greater turn would lead to grounding yellow area instead as fig 11 informs a manoeuvre to starboard by about 30 should be applied the consequences of such decision are shown in fig 12 20 min after turning to starboard by above mentioned 30 the own ship is passing safely both targets and may get back to the original course turn back to port by 30 5 3 scenario 3 crossing encounter 45 difference between ships courses crossing encounters usually occur due to intersection of traffic talavera et al 2013 when theoretically making decisions is easy a vessel gives way to a target on starboard by turning towards it however if an encounter occurs in severe weather and in restricted waters the problem may be more complex in fig 13 we can see the ship approaching a target on starboard the ships would collide with had none of them change their courses since the target is on starboard it is the own ship that should manoeuvre unfortunately the space on starboard is limited by a nearby landmass so manoeuvres to port might also be taken into account however as shown in fig 14 the turn to port would be dangerous apart from the fact that it would contravene colregs it would carry a significant risk of heavy rolling either because of parametric resonance minor turns to port or because of successive high wave attack turns larger than 45 instead it would be safe to reduce own speed by about 7 knots as shown in fig 14 the results of such speed reduction from 17 to 10 knots are depicted in fig 15 where the own ship is passing astern of the target in a safe distance and may get back to the normal speed 5 4 scenario 4 crossing encounter 90 difference between ships courses another crossing encounter is presented in fig 16 this time with the own ship and the target on perpendicular courses the target is on starboard so the own ship is bound to manoeuvre the limited space on starboard may cause an inexperienced navigator to turn to port risking the stability problems not to mention acting against colregs however as fig 17 shows a minor course alteration to starboard is enough to avoid collisions with the target while avoiding the risk of running aground 25 min from turning to starboard by 15 the own ship is safely passed by the target and may turn back to the old course fig 18 5 5 scenario 5 crossing encounter 135 difference between ships courses the third and last of crossing encounters presented here involves two targets fig 19 one of which is on a collision course with the own ship this time the colliding target s course differs from the own ship s course by 135 manoeuvres to starboard are limited by the second target in comparison manoeuvring space on port seems significantly larger despite the presence of a landmass in the above mentioned circumstances an inexperienced navigator could choose a manoeuvre to port however the display view shown in fig 20 informs that turning to port carries the risk of resonance due to unfortunate combination of wind s direction and speed as opposed to that turn to starboard is a much better solution as it is not only compliant with colregs but also makes it possible to avoid collision without putting own stability at risk as can be seen depending on the navigator s preferences it is possible to either pass between two targets or pass both on the same side of both of them the former possibility is illustrated here the situation after 15 min from turning to starboard by 15 is shown in fig 21 where both targets are just being passed is safe distance 5 6 a discussion of example results and related conclusions as has been shown for all of the discussed encounter situations the method was able to determine and display the safe combinations of own course and speed avoiding collision by a course alteration only is not always possible and even when it is it is not necessarily obvious to which side the own ship should turn based on the general view of the situation a wrong decision can be made especially without readily accessible and properly organized information on the stability related dangerous dynamic phenomena in comparison using the proposed method a navigator can easily choose a manoeuvre by selecting a point in the white area representing a certain combination of course and speed for more complex cases when multiple threats have to be considered targets grounding and risk of stability problems the speed reduction may occasionally be necessary though it is not desired for economy and practical reasons of the three potential threats associated with heavy weather resonance was usually the most limiting constraint for the particular vessel model and wind conditions used in the examples however a successive high wave attack can also affect an evasive action as it has in scenario 3 fig 14 as for surf riding and broaching to it practically has not limited the choice of manoeuvres because for the assumed vessel its impact is serious only for larger own speeds over 22 knots however it could be more significant for other vessel types and sizes or in extreme situations when increasing own speed has to be considered despite its economic drawbacks finally it must be mentioned that while the proposed method optionally visualizes colregs based limitations of potential manoeuvres meeting all presented constraints might not be feasible in some situations in case of encountering multiple targets in extremely rough weather a navigator may be occasionally forced to choose between violating colregs or facing stability related dynamical threats any actions not compliant with colregs or counter intuitional for ships in direct vicinity should be then taken only as a last resort they should also be clearly signalled to other vessels so as to avoid any misinterpretation such signals should preferably include means other than horn blasts it would be reasonable here to benefit from the approach tried and tested in modern aviation the airborne collision avoidance system acas where the system warns pilots to take certain precautionary measures or emergency measures to avoid collisions acas based solutions for maritime domain have already been introduced in baldauf et al 2014 2015 and further developed as maritime traffic alert and collision avoidance system mtcas in denker et al 2016 baldauf et al 2017 extending the method proposed in this paper by elements of mtcas functionality or embedding it in a cas solution is likely to be an effective way of handling counter intuitional manoeuvres in rough weather and therefore will be considered in future research 6 summary and conclusions the paper presents a method of determining and visualizing collision avoidance information which largely extends the functionality of the collision threat parameters area ctpa technique it utilizes detailed modelling of own ship dynamics especially course alteration manoeuvres and supports navigation in harsh weather conditions when some of the possible evasive manoeuvres have to be excluded due to the risk of stability related dangerous dynamic phenomena the proposed visualization method offers a unique integration of features strictly belonging to different aspects of marine navigation this opens a chance of both first common recognition of components influencing safety of navigation with regard to its complexity second the mental breakthrough among navigators often focusing only on pending activity collision evasive manoeuvre port entry turning at a waypoint etc with no regard to another issues affecting the process of navigation it is likely that the second aspect of prospective practical implementation of the proposed solution would be even more profitable in terms of safety of navigation improvement for the considered vessel model resonance turned out to be the most important threat with successive high wave attack being the second one however for different vessels and larger speeds the problem of surf riding and broaching to could be just as significant as a manoeuvre limiting factor apart from stability related information the method also makes use of previously introduced detection of potential domain violations and groundings within an assumed time period a superposition of all the above information enables a navigator to quickly choose a collision avoidance manoeuvre which is compliant with the abiding regulations and safe in the current weather conditions the authors intend to continue their research on the presented method and extend it by elements of collision alert system cas other possible directions of development include utilising feedback from multiple navigators so as to address human machine interaction issue and optimise presentation layer for the users convenience acknowledgment all numerical simulations of a ship motions made with the use of laidyn code were carried out by tomasz hinz for which authors of this paper are grateful we are also indebted to prof jerzy matusiak for making the laidyn code available to us 
23404,the paper presents a method of determining organizing and displaying ship collision avoidance information which is based on the collision threat parameters area ctpa technique the method makes it possible to visualize navigational threats as well as possible collision avoidance manoeuvres the solution is focused on supporting navigation in severe weather conditions normally collision avoidance decisions are made taking into account targets motion parameters international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs and navigational obstacles however in hard weather conditions each manoeuvre has to be additionally checked to assess whether it is safe in terms of ship s stability therefore the proposed method provides four types of information motion parameters of targets within a given range combinations of own course and speed which collide with those targets combinations of own course and speed which would lead to grounding within a specified time and combinations of own course and speed which could result in stability related dynamical threats optionally it is also possible to display only manoeuvres compliant with colregs a superposition of these types of data enables a navigator to choose an efficient manoeuvre in a situation when possibilities are limited by weather conditions and actual characteristics of the ship stability keywords collision avoidance methods stability severe weather conditions ship target tracking ship radar display 1 introduction one of the reasons why ship accidents still occur is that collision avoidance actions are prone to error if based on unreliable target ship information or if a navigator is under extreme pressure perera and guedes soares 2015 therefore it is equally important to provide navigators with reliable data on targets as it is to present those data in a way which helps them to make quickly right decisions concerning collision avoidance manoeuvres pietrzykowski et al 2016 however apart from information on targets a number of other factors have to be taken into account when choosing a particular manoeuvre including geographical data and weather conditions the former are obviously essential in restricted waters because of various navigational obstacles and risk of grounding when manoeuvring in the proximity of a landmass as for the latter severe weather conditions may seriously limit the possibility of collision avoidance manoeuvres especially the alteration of own course which is the most common evasive action the method proposed in this paper has been designed so as to address those issues by determining and visualizing all combinations of own course and speed which are safe as a result the navigator will be able to make the manoeuvre selection faster while avoiding the risk of ship stability related dynamical adverse phenomena due to unfortunately chosen alteration of own course or speed the paper includes a description of the proposed method as well as examples which demonstrate determining safe manoeuvres in heavy weather conditions the method utilizes laidyn code matusiak 2013 for modelling ship dynamics because it passed numerous benchmark studies and is able to directly model the rudder action and the propeller thrust it must be mentioned though that it is possible to incorporate any other code or ship models the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section the ctpa display technique and other related radar displays are described including past versions of the proposed method sections 3 presents ship s manoeuvrability model and its approximations used in this paper while section 4 describes modelling of ship stability related dangerous dynamical phenomena section 5 presents the method s usefulness in a series of ship encounter scenarios and finally the paper is summarized and briefly concluded in section 6 2 related display techniques and past versions of the proposed method the first visualization methods that featured information on ship collision risk were potential points of collision ppc and predicted areas of danger pads both methods indicated areas that should be avoided by own ship so as not to collide with other ships and targets ppc and pads shapes evolved they were first circles riggs 1973 then ellipses fleischer et al 1973 irregular shapes o sullivan 1982 zhao lin 1988 polygons hakoyama et al 1996 and smooth curves wood and yancey 2002 the common element of pads ppcs and related predicted capability envelope method van breda 2000 was that they indicated areas of danger and by doing this they provided data for determining collision avoidance manoeuvres an alternative approach collision threat parameters area ctpa has been introduced in lenart 1983 with an extended analysis presented in lenart 2015 2 1 ctpa method similarly to pad in ctpa a collision threat is defined as an encounter with a target for which distance at closest point of approach dcpa is smaller than a minimum safe distance d s however the difference between ppc or pad and ctpa is utilization of a coupled cartesian coordinate system each point in the system represents ship s course given by its x and y positions and velocity given by v x v y coordinates which are coupled by a constant time value τ in h 1 x v x τ y v y τ for each target ctpa is defined as an area covering combinations of own course and speed that would cause violating the safe distance between the ships d s consequently the own ship should perform collision avoidance manoeuvres by changing course and speed to points being outside the ctpa area ctpa for a single target encounter is presented in fig 1 where the target s position and velocity vector v are shown ctpa area for a single target is bounded by two straight lines of safe distance dcpa d s for a multiple target encounter the ctpa becomes a superposition of all targets ctpa in such cases manoeuvres violating the safe distance d s may be conditionally allowed if time to the closest point of approach tcpa is large enough and there is no direct safe manoeuvre the tip of the own velocity vector may then be temporarily placed between the lines of dcpa ds and inside the circle of tcpa t c the ctpa technique has been further developed by other researchers cone shaped collision danger sectors cds and collision danger lines cdl have been presented by qiao and pedersen 2004 and qiao et al 2006 in pedersen et al 2003 the authors additionally described an experiment comparing the efficiency of a classic display and a ctpa based display referred to as collision danger presentation cdp its results have indicated the superiority of using the ctpa based display for various traffic conditions 2 2 past versions of the proposed method the integration of automatic radar plotting aids arpa and automatic identification system ais with electronic charts ec weintrit 2009 has resulted in a new generation of marine displays which can now offer consolidated navigational information in line with the concept of e navigation due to this functional progress as well as the rise in computational powers the authors of this paper have decided to re examine the ctpa technique and enhance it by elements that were technologically unavailable when it was first introduced thus an extended ctpa version handling any convex shape of ship domain has been presented in szlapczynski 2009 following that in szlapczynska 2015 a ctpa based display has been described which additionally supported selecting collision avoidance manoeuvres in both good and restricted visibility analytical formulas for determining domain based collision risk parameters time to domain violation tdv and degree of domain violation ddv have been introduced in szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 so as to offer an alternative to classic approach parameters of dcpa and tcpa still popular in collision avoidance research mou et al 2010 li and pang 2013 zhang et al 2015 these new parameters have been applied in the ctpa inspired displaying method szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 which also included information on potential groundings altogether the method presented there indicated combinations of own course and speed which would result in violating the own or targets domains would lead to grounding or would collide with some navigational obstacles or were not compliant with colregs colregs 1972 cockcroft and lameijer 2011 additionally the method featured the accelerated look ahead mode in which the consequences of a proposed manoeuvre after a specified time were shown the summary of the method s functionality and progress up to this paper has been gathered in table 1 the last two rows point out the new elements on which the current paper is focused ship s manoeuvrability and avoiding stability related threats in heavy weather both elements are described in detail in the following sections 3 modelling ship s maneuverability in the proposed method 3 1 ship maneuverability estimation in 6dof approach according to the rule 8 action to avoid collision of the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea any action to avoid collision shall be made in ample time and if there is sufficient sea room alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close quarters situation provided that it is made in good time colregs 1972 these both requirements directly refers to ships encounter development considered versus time which practically amounts to proper in each individual case distance of commencing of course alternation over years there was a massive number of ship crashes and serious disasters due to late undertaken evasive manoeuvres the notion late manoeuvre shall be obviously related to encountering ships sizes and essentially to their speed and extends of a basin required for turning e g to manoeuvring characteristics one of many examples for late decision regarding action to avoid collision may be the case of car carrier baltic ace colliding with the containers vessel corvus j on 5 th of december 2012 causing the loss of the former with her eleven crewmembers a give way ship m s corvus j did not fulfil her duties towards a stand on vessel m s baltic ace as prescribed by collision regulations colreg and continued with her course and speed since the give way vessel failed with her obligation m s baltic ace had to initiate collision evasive action unfortunately this was done too late maritime bulletin 2012 that situation shows an encroachment of the critical distance montewka and krata 2014 krata and montewka 2015 for successful evasive manoeuvre in a given encounter which was directly related to both ships manoeuvrability the manoeuvring characteristics of a vessel are routinely established during sea trials at the end of ship building process and then they are given for further use in the form of a wheelhouse poster the turning circles at maximum rudder angles are plotted and aside from the tactical diameter also the advance and transfer characteristics are given there usually for ballast and fully loaded conditions however the maximum rudder angle is almost never applied in practice except for last chance manoeuvre which shall be avoided at all thanks to proper planning of encounter situations solving moreover such hard turning may be sometimes completely inapplicable due to excessive heel expectations as a consequence of tender stability of a ship krata et al 2016 thus the trajectories of turning vessel needs to be obtained for a useful range of rudder angles then they are utilized in the course of further planning of a safe and efficient collision avoidance manoeuvre taking into account numerous factors influencing ship s manoeuvring characteristics we decided to utilize a state of the art code called laidyn capable to simulate motions of a ship in six degrees of freedom with regard to key elements governing the circulation e g a ship shape hull geometry rudder and propulsion action an impact of external environment wind and wave action the laidyn is capable to carry out the six degrees of freedom simulations of ship motions in time domain in irregular seas conditions the non linear components are implemented and the froude krylov forces the diffraction forces these two relate to wave action and the radiation forces are considered the first are computed by integrating the water pressure over the wetted panels of the hull and the non linear approach is utilized the diffraction forces in turn are evaluated according to the linear model the radiation forces comprising added mass and damping terms take into account the history of the previous motions by applying the memory function the detailed description of the laidyn code is thoroughly presented in matusiak 2013 the positive validation of the code carried out also during the ittc benchmark studies allows to use the laidyn as a credible tool ittc 2002 ittc 2005 spanos and palmquist 2009 it is especially useful for complex operational simulations since besides the wave action both the propeller and the rudder are directly modelled in the code and the kinematics of water flow in waves is taken into account when evaluating the resultant thrust matusiak 2013 in this study the code laidyn is utilized to obtain the time histories of the ship circulations with regard to all her motions similarly to an earlier work matusiak and stigler 2012 the rudder is set consecutively to 10 20 30 to port and then to starboard the ship taken into account is a mid size ro pax whose particulars are as follows table 2 in order to observe the noticeable effects of seas action the weather conditions taken into account in simulations are quite heavy the wind force about 8 on beaufort scale and the corresponding wave system are considered the numerical simulations of 6 dof ship motions provide the time history of coupled motions with regard to the ship characteristics influencing all degrees of freedom however for further use in evasive manoeuvre planning procedure the shape of ship s tracks are essential these trajectories obtained for every single studied case are represented by a set of relative positions in consecutive time steps ti xi yi where xi and yi denote the position of ship s centre of gravity referred to the initial position fixed at the manoeuvre commencing the sample trajectory and heading of the turning ship is shown in fig 2 since the laidyn code is a complex numerical tool providing the full 6 dof description of a ship motion the question may be asked whether such approach is really required most software tools utilized for manoeuvring characteristics estimation get rid of rolling and pitching of a ship however we decided that the influence of ship transverse stability on her manoeuvrability is so significant that cannot be omitted especially reflection on some marine accidents reveals the importance of a complex modelling of ship motions to prevent excessive heeling and capsizing such a case took place for instance on 3 rd of january 2015 when 180 m long car carrier terminated loading cargo in southampton and bounded for bremerhaven in the evening unfortunately pilot s order scarcely port 10 to the helmsman when making good a speed of 12 knots caused an excessively increasing angle of heel leading finally to exposing her rudder and propeller clear of the water marine accident investigation branch maib 2016 another relatively new and well known accident is sinking of sewol ferry due to a sharp turn on 16 april 2014 about 19 miles off the southwest coast the ferry began to list badly just after the sharp turn for the heading towards jeju seanews 2014 both mentioned examples among many others similar to those two clearly show that ship transverse stability characteristics needs to be taken into account in the course of manoeuvring as limiting of the rudder angle during a routine turn for instance at the planned waypoint is pretty simple the restrictions regarding to the rudder angle and resultant rate of ship s turn during anti collision manoeuvre may be problematic thus it would be through profitable to comprise the ship stability characteristics at the stage of an anti collision manoeuvre planning 3 2 course alterations and speed reduction the set of simulations carried out for the ship turning to port and to starboard comprises the full range of rudder settings reaching from 30 up to 30 every single case is repeated three times due to irregular seas taken into account resulting in non deterministic output of the simulation the obtained trajectories are averaged and generalized in the form of a meta model the meta model consists in three formulas enabling calculation of ship s centre of gravity relative position in every moment of the turning manoeuvre and the relative heading the relative position and the relative heading refer to the initial position and the initial heading of the ship at the manoeuvre commencing the formulas of the meta model are as follows 2 x t i 1 6 p i t i y t i 1 6 q i t i h e a d i n g r e l t i 1 5 r i t i where x t and y t denote the expected position at any time step according to the meta model of ship s centre of gravity referred to the initial position fixed at the manoeuvre commencing heading rel t is the relative heading at any time step taking the initial heading at the manoeuvre commencing as zero t is time of the turning manoeuvre p i q i r i are the coefficients adjusted with the use of least squares method according to colregs regulations and the sea routine action the typical collision evasive manoeuvre is just the course alternation significant enough to enable quick identification and undertaken in ample time however the alternatively permitted manoeuvre is ship s speed reduction generally it is much slower then turning and more difficult to recognize for surrounding vessels however in some circumstances slowing down could be the solution thus besides the meta model of turning the other one is worked out to describe the speed reductions characteristics the following scenario is assumed for the simulation purpose the ship is steaming with her typical service speed 17 knots then the reduction of speed is started the process of slowing down the machinery lasts 2 min and the thrust gradually drops down to the value corresponding to the speed 8 knots however the ship is pushed forward by her inertia besides the propeller thrust so the decrease in speed is slower than the thrust reduction the numerical simulation reflecting the assumed scenario is carried out and the obtained result shows that the considered ship requires about 10 min time to slow down from the service speed to the speed 8 knots which still ensures proper manoeuvrability of the ship the outcome is presented in fig 3 according to the result of the performed simulation the ship slowing down characteristics is presented in further modelling of the collision evasive manoeuvre in the form of the programming convenient meta model as follows 3 v t i 1 9 s i t i 1 where s i are coefficients of the polynomial model and t is the time from the speed reduction manoeuvre initiation elaboration of the two meta models allows for time efficient computations at the stage of collision evasive manoeuvre planning the simulations of ship motion do not need to be repeated on board 4 modelling of stability related dynamical phenomena in the proposed method weather conditions have long been taken into account in marine navigation but lately they have become more important because of improved ability to predict weather dynamics moreover the sophisticated numerical tools development enables more and more realistic modelling of ship and environment interaction dealing with harsh or extreme weather conditions has been discussed by multiple authors research on more accurate weather forecasts for marine purposes has been documented in natskår et al 2015 roulston et al 2005 among others the consequent progress in weather routing has been documented in multiple works including mannarini et al 2013 szlapczynska 2015 vettor and guedes soares 2017 an analysis of the wave climate along the main north atlantic routes has been presented in vettor et al 2017 and a similar study on weather conditions for european coastal routes has been provided in vettor and guedes soares 2017 the impact of harsh weather on ship routing and navigation has been discussed in chen et al 2013 decò and frangopol 2015 perera and guedes soares 2017 and the impact on ship s behaviour and safety in acanfora et al 2017 suzuki et al 2017 in a similar vein the authors of the current paper investigate how adverse weather affects possible collision avoidance manoeuvres 4 1 time effective approach to ship stability issues the laidyn code utilized for the purpose of estimation of the ship manoeuvring characteristics with regard to weather action is capable to model the dynamical stability issues the laidyn s output contains ship response in 6 degrees of freedom approach and even such complex phenomena like parametric rolling are comprised matusiak and stigler 2012 acanfora et al 2017 so the straightforward solution would be continuation of this tool utilization however there is a crucial difference between the manoeuvring characteristics estimation and ship s rolling prediction the first may be much easier generalized and repeated runs of simulation return the comparable results in turn in case of dynamic stability issues the nonlinear ship response may differ significantly depending on the irregular waves sequence therefore the ship roll response is usually analysed for relatively long time of steady course sailing acanfora et al 2017 or by multiple simulation for a manoeuvring vessel for that reason and additionally taking into account the time of simulation reaching more than a half of real time of the simulated manoeuvre we decided to simplify the approach to the ship dynamical stability threats the recommendations included in the revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions imo document numbered msc 1 circ 1228 are applied instead of the use of laidyn at this stage of the research which makes the method time efficient and therefore fully applicable on board the revised guidance is intended to give significant help to ship masters when sailing in stormy conditions this publication contains a set of remarks and advices regarding the avoidance of following dangerous dynamical phenomena at sea like surf riding and broaching to reduction of intact stability when riding a wave crest amidships synchronous rolling parametric roll motions imo 2007 usually the guidance is used in route execution as an advice providing some restrictions of speed and course configurations however we assume that analogous restrictions are appropriate to any phase of the sea voyage including the manoeuvres not only when following the planned straight route our intention is to plan the collision evasive action and any other manoeuvre with regard to both colregs rules and dynamic constraints resulting from the ship stability characteristics related to actual sea state according to the revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions the ship shall avoid some configurations of her speed and course in order not to expose herself to excessive rolling and accelerations or loss of steering control during surf riding or severe green water loads imo 2007 the excessive rolling may be typically caused by resonance type phenomena synchronous or parametric rolling which leads to rapid growth of accelerations and mass forces acting on the ship structure equipment and carried cargo this can bring on exceeding of cargo lashing loads and damage or loss of cargo acanfora et al 2017 such accidents have been noticed for instance in case of serious cargo damage experienced by the large container vessel svendborg maersk the 347 m long fully cellular container vessel was bound for far east destination encountering quite heavy weather off the english channel she suddenly and without warning rolled to extreme angles and a large number of cargo containers fell overboard dmaib 2014 the very essential remark is that such sort of rapid response of a ship may build up in short time thus even in relatively short lasting manoeuvre like anti collision turning the conditions for synchronous and parametric rolling development should be avoided also another dangerous phenomena mentioned in the guidance are able to damage ship and cargo or even lead to the ship capsizing in relatively short time the green water loads are destructive to ships buchner 2002 the pure loss of stability due to prolongated sailing in wave crest amidships may cause capsizing or at least large amplitudes of roll umeda et al 2017 sailing in following and quartering seas can lead to surf riding or broaching depending on the froude number spyrou and umeda 1995 the common feature of all listed dynamical phenomena is quite short time required to activate the dangerous aftermaths thus including of them into the manoeuvre planning algorithm may be found as a proactive safety oriented approach since the guidance provides the formulas allowing for calculation of the potentially dangerous zones location location related to the ship the visualization is prepared with the use of a software strictly based on these formulas which is described in krata and szlapczynska 2011 the result obtained for the considered vessel is shown in fig 4 the crucial input element to the formulas allowing for calculation of the diagram shown in fig 4 is besides the ship dimensions the metacentric height it is assumed that the gm governs the natural period of roll which decides of tuning or mistuning of the ship roll response with the encountering wave as a result the resonance origin phenomena may likely develop or not the significant influence of proper application of the metacentric height notion onto the location of dangerous zones is examined and described in some latest works krata and wawrzynski 2017a 2017b and the practical implementation of this approach to weather routing algorithm is described in krata and szlapczyńska 2018 in such a case it is particularly important to provide an adequate value of the metacentric height the problem is not trivial since the initial metacentric height routinely calculated and reported on board may be improper value with respect to large amplitudes of rolling which take place during the considered dangerous dynamic phenomena according to the works wawrzynski and krata 2016a 2016b the valid value is so called equivalent metacentric height it may be calculated on the basis of the righting arm curve with regard to its nonlinearity the strongest nonlinearity of the gz curve is noticed the larger difference between initial gm and equivalent gm occurs wawrzynski and krata 2016a 2016b basically in case of linear characteristics of the gz curve the initial metacentric height is valid not only for the small angles of heel but in relatively large range it may be also understood that the equivalent metacentric height equals to the initial gm in case of nonlinear shape of gz curve the equivalent metacentric height has to be calculated according to the formula given in wawrzynski and krata 2016a 2016b and the initial gm is no longer valid for the purpose of the natural period of roll calculation in this particular case of the considered vessel in the assumed loading condition the gz curve is linear within vary large range of angles of heel which is shown in fig 5 this means that the derivative of the righting arm curve with respect to angle of heel directly describing the metacentric height is close to constant in the whole practical range amplitudes of roll therefore the initial metacentric height and the equivalent metacentric height are practically equal thus in this case the initial gm may be applied to the formula enabling the natural period of roll calculation instead of the equivalent gm without deterioration of the accuracy of the dangerous zones location the approach based on the revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions instead of laidyn or any other ship motion simulation code is a kind of simplification however we decided to apply such method mainly for the sake of time effective execution of the main algorithm aiming at the safe navigation planning in adverse weather conditions since one of the objective beaconing in this research is further practical implementation of the results on board ships the excessive time of safe manoeuvre prediction is inacceptable therefore we find the simplification justified 4 2 visualizing the risk related limitations including stability issues altogether the following areas resulting from various types of threats are determined and visualized by the proposed method 1 groundings possible within a configured time 2 major and minor domain violations 3 combinations of courses and speeds which are not recommended due to the potential occurrence of the dangerous dynamic phenomena related to the ship stability characteristics a new feature introduced here 4 speeds not feasible for the own ship optional feature 5 colregs derived limitations optional feature in case of overlapping of areas representing various threats they are displayed as layers in the above listed order potential groundings are by default displayed on top because they are sure to happen if the navigator chooses wrong course and keeps it too long the third layer is less restrictive than the former two however in rough sea conditions the limitations due to potential dynamic stability issues may be vital for the purpose of this work we do not focus on distinguishing the specific sorts of stability problems since the proposed method is addressed to navigators planning collision evasive action we assumed that it would be productive and safety oriented to provide information related to permitted and banned configuration of course and speed without explicit identification of synchronous rolling parametric resonance and others to avoid end user mind overloading authors sea experience suggests that deck officers rarely understand the dynamics of a ship thoroughly enough to distinguish different modes of heavy rolling we provide just simple information about banned location of the ship velocity vector based on simplified approach recommended by imo in the guidance msc circ 1228 as for the last two layers they may be displayed optionally because they represent hints rather than conditions that must be always fulfilled in general the method aims to offer a full picture of navigational threats and limitations though the particular layout of these information on screen is up to the operator and his decisions an example is shown in fig 6 where only the first three types of information groundings domain violations and dangerous dynamic phenomena are displayed so as to make the figure easier to read apart from the standard view the proposed method additionally features an accelerated look ahead mode in which an operator may foresee the consequences of a particular manoeuvre that is how the situation will look after a specified time from performing a manoeuvre detailed examples of using the method including the accelerated look ahead mode are provided in the next section 5 using the method example scenarios all examples presented in this section are encounters on restricted waters this choice is dictated by the fact that the majority of actual ship accidents occur on restricted waters rather than open waters as shown by a number of research projects montewka et al 2010 2014 hu et al 2007 reportedly groundings are one of the most common causations of accident about twice as frequent as ship ship collisions guedes soares and teixeira 2001 also ship ship collisions are more likely to happen on coastal waters than on open sea kujala et al 2009 which can be attributed to higher traffic density and limited sea room for manoeuvring on restricted waters the scenarios in this section include one overtaking encounter one head on encounter and three crossings with 45 90 and 135 differences between the course of the own ship and the course of the potentially colliding target the motion parameters of the ships and wind for all scenarios are provided in table 3 all wind speeds are within 15 20 m s range which corresponds to 29 39 knots and beaufort forces of 7 8 a decentralized elliptically shaped length dependant ship domain is used in all examples as a safety criterion the domain s shape has been first proposed by coldwell 1983 but the dimensions used here have been updated so as to be in line with more recent research in the field based on empirical data hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2015 for each scenario an overview figure is shown first with the own ship marked in this is followed by figure showing the proposed visualization which features combinations of course and speed that may lead to a stability related problems due to parametric resonance surf riding and broaching to or a successive high wave attack finally for each scenario there is a figure showing the results of a selected manoeuvre own ship passing safely targets to make the examples easier to follow all scenarios feature the own ship dealing with only one or two targets however the situations have been designed to maximally limit possible manoeuvres of the own ship so it may be hard to choose the right manoeuvre based on the overview figure fortunately a close look at the figures showing proposed visualization technique reveals that there is a solution to each scenario which makes it possible to avoid collision while obeying colregs and not risking stability related threats due to sea conditions 5 1 scenario 1 overtaking overtaking encounters have been reported to produce a significantly more collisions goerlandt and kujala 2011 hanninen and kujala 2012 than crossing and head on meetings even though the relative speeds are smaller during overtaking the current scenario is an example of a special case of overtaking encounter where choosing a safe manoeuvre is seriously limited by a risk of parametric resonance in fig 7 it is shown that own ship is about to overtake the target in front the motion parameters of both ships are such that a manoeuvre of the own ship is necessary to avoid collision turns to both sides are compliant with colregs in such cases though navigators are usually reluctant to turn towards landmass due to grounding risk so it is possible that a turn to starboard would be selected in this case however as fig 8 shows it is turn to port which is safe here as turns to starboard may lead to an excessive rolling due to parametric resonance the above mentioned turn to port does not have to be larger than 15 which is enough to safely pass the target while steering far enough from the landmass on port the consequences of turning to port by 15 and keeping this course for 25 min are shown in fig 9 where the own ship passes in the safe distance from a target and can turn back to starboard 5 2 scenario 2 head on encounter while head on encounters are relatively rare the risk of collision in case of head on is considerable due to high relative speed and little time for manoeuvring according to hanninen and kujala 2012 even a minor alteration of course is usually enough to avoid collision then however if there is more than one target involved and manoeuvres are limited because of severe weather conditions the head on situation can still be difficult which is illustrated by the following example in fig 10 the positions and courses of three ships are shown the own ship is facing two targets in front of these two the head on encounter with a target on port requires a collision avoidance manoeuvre according to colregs the own ship should turn to starboard however the presence of another target on starboard makes the decision harder and the navigator could theoretically try a turn to port instead fortunately fig 11 leaves no doubt as to which manoeuvre is safe turning to port is not possible a minor turn could result in dangerous parametric rolling blue area and a greater turn would lead to grounding yellow area instead as fig 11 informs a manoeuvre to starboard by about 30 should be applied the consequences of such decision are shown in fig 12 20 min after turning to starboard by above mentioned 30 the own ship is passing safely both targets and may get back to the original course turn back to port by 30 5 3 scenario 3 crossing encounter 45 difference between ships courses crossing encounters usually occur due to intersection of traffic talavera et al 2013 when theoretically making decisions is easy a vessel gives way to a target on starboard by turning towards it however if an encounter occurs in severe weather and in restricted waters the problem may be more complex in fig 13 we can see the ship approaching a target on starboard the ships would collide with had none of them change their courses since the target is on starboard it is the own ship that should manoeuvre unfortunately the space on starboard is limited by a nearby landmass so manoeuvres to port might also be taken into account however as shown in fig 14 the turn to port would be dangerous apart from the fact that it would contravene colregs it would carry a significant risk of heavy rolling either because of parametric resonance minor turns to port or because of successive high wave attack turns larger than 45 instead it would be safe to reduce own speed by about 7 knots as shown in fig 14 the results of such speed reduction from 17 to 10 knots are depicted in fig 15 where the own ship is passing astern of the target in a safe distance and may get back to the normal speed 5 4 scenario 4 crossing encounter 90 difference between ships courses another crossing encounter is presented in fig 16 this time with the own ship and the target on perpendicular courses the target is on starboard so the own ship is bound to manoeuvre the limited space on starboard may cause an inexperienced navigator to turn to port risking the stability problems not to mention acting against colregs however as fig 17 shows a minor course alteration to starboard is enough to avoid collisions with the target while avoiding the risk of running aground 25 min from turning to starboard by 15 the own ship is safely passed by the target and may turn back to the old course fig 18 5 5 scenario 5 crossing encounter 135 difference between ships courses the third and last of crossing encounters presented here involves two targets fig 19 one of which is on a collision course with the own ship this time the colliding target s course differs from the own ship s course by 135 manoeuvres to starboard are limited by the second target in comparison manoeuvring space on port seems significantly larger despite the presence of a landmass in the above mentioned circumstances an inexperienced navigator could choose a manoeuvre to port however the display view shown in fig 20 informs that turning to port carries the risk of resonance due to unfortunate combination of wind s direction and speed as opposed to that turn to starboard is a much better solution as it is not only compliant with colregs but also makes it possible to avoid collision without putting own stability at risk as can be seen depending on the navigator s preferences it is possible to either pass between two targets or pass both on the same side of both of them the former possibility is illustrated here the situation after 15 min from turning to starboard by 15 is shown in fig 21 where both targets are just being passed is safe distance 5 6 a discussion of example results and related conclusions as has been shown for all of the discussed encounter situations the method was able to determine and display the safe combinations of own course and speed avoiding collision by a course alteration only is not always possible and even when it is it is not necessarily obvious to which side the own ship should turn based on the general view of the situation a wrong decision can be made especially without readily accessible and properly organized information on the stability related dangerous dynamic phenomena in comparison using the proposed method a navigator can easily choose a manoeuvre by selecting a point in the white area representing a certain combination of course and speed for more complex cases when multiple threats have to be considered targets grounding and risk of stability problems the speed reduction may occasionally be necessary though it is not desired for economy and practical reasons of the three potential threats associated with heavy weather resonance was usually the most limiting constraint for the particular vessel model and wind conditions used in the examples however a successive high wave attack can also affect an evasive action as it has in scenario 3 fig 14 as for surf riding and broaching to it practically has not limited the choice of manoeuvres because for the assumed vessel its impact is serious only for larger own speeds over 22 knots however it could be more significant for other vessel types and sizes or in extreme situations when increasing own speed has to be considered despite its economic drawbacks finally it must be mentioned that while the proposed method optionally visualizes colregs based limitations of potential manoeuvres meeting all presented constraints might not be feasible in some situations in case of encountering multiple targets in extremely rough weather a navigator may be occasionally forced to choose between violating colregs or facing stability related dynamical threats any actions not compliant with colregs or counter intuitional for ships in direct vicinity should be then taken only as a last resort they should also be clearly signalled to other vessels so as to avoid any misinterpretation such signals should preferably include means other than horn blasts it would be reasonable here to benefit from the approach tried and tested in modern aviation the airborne collision avoidance system acas where the system warns pilots to take certain precautionary measures or emergency measures to avoid collisions acas based solutions for maritime domain have already been introduced in baldauf et al 2014 2015 and further developed as maritime traffic alert and collision avoidance system mtcas in denker et al 2016 baldauf et al 2017 extending the method proposed in this paper by elements of mtcas functionality or embedding it in a cas solution is likely to be an effective way of handling counter intuitional manoeuvres in rough weather and therefore will be considered in future research 6 summary and conclusions the paper presents a method of determining and visualizing collision avoidance information which largely extends the functionality of the collision threat parameters area ctpa technique it utilizes detailed modelling of own ship dynamics especially course alteration manoeuvres and supports navigation in harsh weather conditions when some of the possible evasive manoeuvres have to be excluded due to the risk of stability related dangerous dynamic phenomena the proposed visualization method offers a unique integration of features strictly belonging to different aspects of marine navigation this opens a chance of both first common recognition of components influencing safety of navigation with regard to its complexity second the mental breakthrough among navigators often focusing only on pending activity collision evasive manoeuvre port entry turning at a waypoint etc with no regard to another issues affecting the process of navigation it is likely that the second aspect of prospective practical implementation of the proposed solution would be even more profitable in terms of safety of navigation improvement for the considered vessel model resonance turned out to be the most important threat with successive high wave attack being the second one however for different vessels and larger speeds the problem of surf riding and broaching to could be just as significant as a manoeuvre limiting factor apart from stability related information the method also makes use of previously introduced detection of potential domain violations and groundings within an assumed time period a superposition of all the above information enables a navigator to quickly choose a collision avoidance manoeuvre which is compliant with the abiding regulations and safe in the current weather conditions the authors intend to continue their research on the presented method and extend it by elements of collision alert system cas other possible directions of development include utilising feedback from multiple navigators so as to address human machine interaction issue and optimise presentation layer for the users convenience acknowledgment all numerical simulations of a ship motions made with the use of laidyn code were carried out by tomasz hinz for which authors of this paper are grateful we are also indebted to prof jerzy matusiak for making the laidyn code available to us
