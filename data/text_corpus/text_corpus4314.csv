which a cavity is formed around an underwater vehicle since most of the vehicular surface is encompassed by a supercavity the skin friction drag of such a vehicle is significantly reduced compared to a conventional fully wetted vehicle resulting in a ten fold increase in speed phuc et al 2019 in general supercavitating vehicles svs are composed of a cavitator a conical section a cylindrical section a pair of aft vertical rudders and a nozzle as shown in fig 1 svs are usually operated in an afterbody planing supported mode that is using only the cavitator rudders and partial afterbody in contact with the liquid and the remainder of the vehicle is fully enveloped in the supercavity the lift forces provided by the cavitator and rudders and the immersion planing force are responsible for the equilibrium problem kong et al 2015 during sailing the pitch motion is controlled by the cavitator and the yaw motion is adjusted using the vertical rudders in the aft portion while the rolling motion is regulated by the vertical rudders via the differential angle the supercavitating torpedo of russia shkval choi et al 2015 petitpas et al 2011 vanek 2008 featuring a straight and level flight adopts this hydrodynamic layout mode hereinafter referred to as mode ⅰ extensive research has been performed for decades on the topic of cavitation logvinovich 1972 experimentally demonstrated the well known principle of independence of cavity section expansions which is regarded as the theoretical basis for modeling supercavities many researchers have expanded this theory and advanced its application in svs experimental investigations on the mechanisms of supercavitation ventilated cavitation hydrodynamic force and control strategy for svs have been carried out semenenko 2001a semenenko 2001b savchenko 2001 2002 erfanian and anbarsooz 2018 vasin and paryshev 2001 the structural behaviors of flexible and stiffened elastic svs have been studied choi et al 2004 ruzzene and soranna 2004 furthermore with the development of motion controllable svs existing research related to supercavitation has assisted in important advances in the guidance and control of svs kirschner et al 2001 2002 dzielski and kurdila 2003 scorcelletti et al 2009 zhao et al 2019 and the self noise signatures of the cavitators of svs howe et al 2009 previous research on svs have mainly focused on mechanisms such as supercavitation dynamic modeling and control the complexities of the existing problems are further increased by the development of maneuverable and highly agile svs in order to deliver high performance while operating within the boundaries of the flight envelope various issues must be addressed such as slope discontinuities in the forces kirschner et al 2006 effects of time delay savchenko 2001 nominally forward location of the center of pressure kirschner et al 2001 and changes in system parameters when the vehicle executes a maneuver savchenko 2002 when maneuvering unwanted changes in the wetted contacts arising from local cavity breakdowns may result in large destabilizing forces and moments in svs owing to the hydrodynamic characteristics of svs being fundamentally more complex than those of conventional underwater vehicles the hydrodynamical control of such vehicles must be implemented in a different manner one of the major issues concerning the development of a maneuvering sv is the hydrodynamic layout integrated design of the vehicle itself ahn et al 2010 including the size and location of the control surfaces and the dynamic behavior of the water cavity vehicle system limited investigations have been performed on the hydrodynamic layout configurations of svs regarding the vehicle itself most of these investigations mainly discussed structural behavior drag characteristics and cavitator assembly kuklinski et al 2006 presented experimental studies on the cavitation effect and control performance of different cavitators uhlman 2006 also conducted parametric studies on the supercavitating flow and cavitators for a range of cavitation numbers the results from these two studies show promising likenesses choi et al 2005 used a shape design sensitivity analysis technique principle of minimum drag to determine the optimum shape of the cavitator by carrying out supercavitating flow analyses for a range of cavitation numbers ruzzene 2004 extensively analyzed both the static and dynamic buckling stabilities of a cylindrical torpedo shell alyanak et al 2005 developed the optimal structural configuration for a supercavitating torpedo model which was a simple cylinder with a conical nose the cavitator and rear control fins were selected for the control surfaces furthermore an algorithm to determine the optimal configuration of the torpedo was presented alyanak et al 2006 in which an optimization problem was formulated to determine the general shape of the torpedo that would satisfy the required performance criteria kawakami and arndt 2011 experimentally investigated the artificial supercavitation behind a sharp edged disk for various model configurations mokhtarzadeh et al 2012 studied the effects of different cavitator shapes on vehicle stability and concluded that the vehicle static stability characteristics depended on the cavitator tangential forces park and rhee 2012 researched a turbulent supercavitating flow around a body equipped with a wedge shaped cavitator wherein computational fluid dynamics cfd solutions for the cavity length were consistent with those of the experimental results sweger et al 2004 studied an optimization process for high speed underwater vehicles to find the optimal trim configuration with minimal control effort global design parameters such as fin geometry and cavitator diameter as well as the angular position of the vehicle with respect to the direction of motion are considered as the optimization variables in general the existing hydrodynamic control approaches can be divided into two categories in the first category the hydrodynamic control authority is led by the combination of cavitator and aft rudders the cavitator has a degree of freedom in the pitch plane only which allows direct control of the diving and rising maneuvers the aft rudders deflect to drive the afterbody to achieve contact with the cavity boundary thus generating planing force and changing the yaw angle kirschner et al 2006 presented an overview of the slope discontinuous force curves and time delay effects of svs they mentioned that the more effective approach to controlling svs was by producing lift at the cavitator the simplest option for control at the cavitator is actuation in the pitch plane only the aft rudders are used for control in the yaw plane more complicated options include cavitator actuation in two degrees of freedom of pitch and yaw planes based on this hydrodynamic control approach ahn et al 2010 studied configuration optimizations of natural svs in terms of their overall dimensions mass distributions and control surface sizes their work considered specific requirements related to the operation of the vehicle during maneuvers kuklinski et al 2006 presented an overview of some experimental results involving the dynamics of svs they concluded that cavitator control has some obvious advantages over a system of aft vehicle control and proposed that the conical cavitators be designed with pivot points in each quadrant to allow the attachment of small wedge cross section fins that enhance the cavitator lift unwanted changes in the wetted contacts arising from local cavity breakdowns may result in large destabilizing forces and moments in the svs while forces associated with the cavitator could uncouple from the dynamics of the cavity downstream vanek 2008 studied the control methods for an sv similar to the hydrodynamic layout mode ⅰ this sv had a set of two control surfaces one in front of the vehicle and the other behind vanek notes that the configuration of the cavitator with two degrees of freedom is more advantageous from a control design perspective because disturbance attenuation in the yaw channel is difficult with only fin control inputs on the lateral dynamics for the second category the hydrodynamic control authority is led by a cavitator with two degrees of freedom in both the pitch and yaw planes this hydrodynamic layout mode is represented by the barracuda developed by german diehl bgt defence vanek 2008 the barracuda has a flexible nose cone which enables appropriate steering kirschner et al 2006 observed that cavitator actuation in two degrees of freedom would be expensive owing to the more complicated actuation systems in tight quarters near the front of the vehicle kuklinski et al 2006 believed that the cavitator in an sv was crucial for both acoustic sensor and hydrodynamic control requirements a cavitator should therefore be developed to accommodate homing sensors owing to the complex hydrodynamic characteristics of the water cavity vehicle system the feature slope discontinuous force characteristics of the sv causes inefficiencies in the rudder at the afterbody and lift forces produced by the front section of the vehicle are more effective for hydrodynamic control many researchers have proposed this mode but have not investigated it adequately in the present work a novel hydrodynamic layout of the front vertical rudders is proposed on the basis of rudder efficiency analysis for maneuvering svs using this mode the rudder efficiency is observed to improve remarkably and the degree of freedom of the cavitator remains constant thus preserving the valuable space of the cavitator comparisons of the system response characteristics with the existing mode show the advantages of the novel hydrodynamic layout in addition the results of free motion experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed layout the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 considering the specific requirements related to maneuvering operations of svs the disadvantages of the hydrodynamic layout of the aft vertical rudders are revealed 2 a novel hydrodynamic layout of the front vertical rudders is proposed for maneuvering svs and the efficiency of the vertical rudders is noted to be improved remarkably 3 free motion experiments of the sv with a preset vertical rudder angle are carried out to validate the feasibility of the proposed novel hydrodynamic layout the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the horizontal dynamics model section 3 presents the disadvantages of the hydrodynamic layout of the aft vertical rudders from rudder efficiency analysis section 4 is concerned with the novel hydrodynamic layout of the front aft vertical rudders section 5 presents comparison of the step response characteristics of the two modes section 6 presents the free motion experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed hydrodynamic layout and section 7 presents the conclusions 2 system modeling to obtain a low order model reflecting the essential dynamics in a mathematically tractable form the following assumptions are made the vehicle is sailing in a horizontal plane with a constant speed the rolling angle is zero the mass of the vehicle the propulsive force and the cavitation number remain constant the vehicle is sailing with a small yaw angle a small sideslip angle and a thrust misalignment angle therefore sin β β cos β 1 sin ψ ψ cos ψ 1 sin α t α t and cos α t 1 based on the above assumptions and using the hydrodynamic layout of the sv in fig 1 the free body diagram for the horizontal plane is shown in fig 2 the force balance of the sv in the horizontal plane is 1 m v ψ a δ δ a β β a ω ω y t α t the expressions for the coefficients a δ a β and a ω are given in the appendix the moment balance is given as 2 j ω y m δ δ m β β m ω ω y t α t l t the expressions for the coefficients m δ m ω and m β are given in the appendix the angle relationship is given as 3 ψ ω y 4 ψ ψ β in the force balance expression of equation 1 the first term on the right hand side describes the lateral force caused by the rudder the second term describes the planing force sanabria and arndt 2018 zou et al 2015 the third term describes the damping force under unsteady state conditions and the last term accounts for the lateral force caused by thrust misalignment the hydrodynamic parameters in the system model can be obtained using cfd 3 analysis of rudder efficiency based on equation 1 4 the following steady state relationship without rudder angle can be obtained under the steady state condition of ω y β 0 5 0 m β β m ω ω y t α t l t 6 m v ω y a β β a ω ω y t α t the steady state ω y and β values related to the thrust misalignment angle α t can be obtained as follows 7 ω y a β t α t l t m β t α t m v m β a β m ω m β a ω 8 β m ω ω y t α t l t m β based on equations 7 and 8 the existence of the thrust misalignment angle will enable a sustained yaw of the vehicle even for a statically stable sv therefore to achieve zero heading deviation the vertical rudder should be applied further to achieve zero yaw rate under the steady state condition of ω y β 0 the required vertical rudder angle and sideslip angle are calculated as 9 δ a β β t α t a δ 10 β t α t l t a δ m δ t α t m δ a β a δ m β where the coefficients m δ and m β are given by 11 m δ a δ l δ m β a β l β inserting equation 11 into equations 9 and 10 yields 12 a β β t α t l t l δ l δ l β 13 a δ δ t α t l t l β l δ l β equations 12 and 13 respectively describe the values of the sideslip angle and vertical rudder angle to achieve the fixed yaw angle in the presence of thrust misalignment from these two equations it is found that the required rudder force and sideslip angle respectively on the left hand side of the two equations are both larger owing to the action point of the rudder force being close to the action point of the lateral force of the vehicle furthermore α t and δ have opposite signs because the positive directions of both rudder force and side component of thrust are pointing toward the starboard if the position of the rudder is too close to the mass center the control action will be reversed using the hydrodynamic layout mode depicted in fig 1 in which the vertical rudders are arranged in the aft portion the control characteristics are further analyzed to highlight the primary issue the effect of thrust misalignment is neglected in response to a certain vertical rudder angle δ the vehicle can be maneuvered with yaw rate ω y based on the dynamic model in the horizontal plane and the steady state condition of ω y β 0 the yaw rate and sideslip angle are obtained as follows 14 ω y l β l δ m ω a ω l β m v l β a δ δ 15 β a δ l δ δ m ω ω y a β l β thus during strong maneuvering sailing when the controller is commanded to execute a turn the rudders will be deflected to drive the afterbody however no lateral force will be developed on the hull until the afterbody contacts the cavity boundary once the afterbody planing against the side of the cavity boundary the lateral force center on the hull migrates forward with the afterbody immersion increases this constitutes the slope discontinuous force characteristic of the sv during the migration of the lateral force center given equation 14 and in combination with fig 2 l β and l δ would have the same sign owing to the vertical rudders arranged on the afterbody this causes the yaw producing lateral force to weaken the total force toward the center of the turn in the limit case of l δ l β the vertical rudders will even be completely useless accordingly the hydrodynamic layout of the vertical rudders arranged in the aft portion is not suitable for strong maneuvering of an sv thereby illustrating the need for an alternative hydrodynamic layout 4 novel hydrodynamic layout to solve the rudder inefficiency of mode ⅰ a more effective approach to controlling the sv would be the production of a lateral force at the front portion of the vehicle hence a novel hydrodynamic layout for the front vertical rudders is proposed here as shown in fig 3 hereinafter referred to as mode ⅱ in this mode the vertical rudders are fixed behind the cavitator at the bow the sv is operated in finless tail planing supported motion mode to maneuver as shown in fig 4 the yaw motion is adjusted using the front vertical rudders the pitch motion is controlled by the cavitator and the rolling motion is regulated by the differential motion of upper and lower front vertical rudders the sv can be designed without any aft fins because the forces provided by the cavitator and front rudders and the immersion planing force are responsible for the equilibrium problem rather than relying on the aft fins moreover the system damping provided by the aft fins alone would be considerably less than that due to afterbody planing kirschner et al 2006 the rudder efficiency in this hydrodynamic layout is analyzed as follows in mode ⅱ the distance from the force acting point of vertical rudders to the center of gravity changes to l δ this results in the yaw producing lateral force enhancing the total force toward the center of the turn rather than working against it equations 14 and 15 are therefore transformed into 16 ω y l β l δ m ω a ω l β m v l β a δ δ 17 β a δ l δ δ m ω ω y a β l β comparing equations 14 and 16 greater yaw rate can be obtained in mode ⅱ with the same rudder force and the efficiency of the vertical rudder system is improved remarkably when using mode ⅰ the puncturing depths of the upper and lower vertical rudders are asymmetric because the supercavity cross section experiences deformation due to gravity and other effects kirschner et al 2006 whereas such inconsistencies do not exist in mode ⅱ composite of cavitator and rudders can enhance the control authority without significantly altering the downstream properties of the cavity encapsulating the vehicle kuklinski et al 2006 more importantly such a system has the advantage of not requiring cavitator actuation for maneuvering in the yaw plane avoiding the arrangement of complicated cavitator actuation in such tight quarters of the forward cavitator thereby making room for the installation of guidance and detection systems 5 comparison of the two modes ignoring the thrust misalignment regardless of the hydrodynamic layout mode used the force balance of equation 1 can be simplified as 18 m v ψ β z z c similarly the moment balance of equation 2 can be simplified as 19 j ψ z l β z c l c where l c is a positive value when z c acts on the aft region of the center of gravity the yaw speed z e in the ground coordinate system is given as 20 z e v ψ β according to the principle of independence of the cavity section expansion proposed by logvinovich 1972 the time delay effect τ is unavoidable and is given by the interval of the disturbance at the cavitator propagating to the supercavity at the tail i e τ l t v hassouneh et al 2013 thereafter the position and size of the supercavity at the aft section at time t are determined only by the previous state of the cavitator at time t τ the lateral force z acting on the hull can be described in a simplified form li et al 2019 as follows 21 z c α r z w c ω ψ where 22 r z w z n τ z w 23 z n τ z e τ ψ τ l n z w z e ψ l w therefore the lateral forces of equation 21 can be written as 24 z z e τ z e ψ τ l n ψ l w c α c ω ψ according to literature li et al 2019 huang et al 2017 the distance from acting point of the lateral force to the center of gravity is given as 25 l β l w k r α r z 2 r y 2 where r z 2 r y 2 is the deviation between the cavity and the vehicle at the aft the deviation which reflects the asymmetry of supercavity nguyen and balachandran 2011 can be used to identify the real time planing forces online considering the time delay effect the sideslip angle at time t can be approximated as 26 ψ ψ τ τ ψ ψ τ 2 its transfer function is given as 27 ℓ ψ τ ℓ ψ 1 τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s where ℓ denotes the laplace transform similarly the z component of the center of gravity in the ground coordinate system can be approximated using the transfer function as 28 ℓ z e τ ℓ z e ℓ z e τ s 1 τ 2 s from equations 20 24 27 and 28 the following expression can be obtained 29 ℓ z c α l t 1 τ 2 s ℓ β l t 1 τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s l n l w s c ω c α ℓ ψ from equation 29 the force balance equation 18 and

τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s l n l w s c ω c α s 2 j c α l β ℓ ψ the relation between the yaw angle and the yaw rate is given by 32 s ℓ ψ ℓ ω y from equations 30 32 the following relations can be obtained 33 ℓ ω y ℓ z c x ψ y l c l β l β m v 34 ℓ β ℓ z c x β y 1 l t l β c α m v the expressions of the coefficients y x ψ and x β are given in the appendix considering the relationship l t l n l w and equation

expressions of the coefficients b 1 b 2 k ω a ω 1 a ω 2 k β a β 1 and a β 2 are given in the appendix here equations 35 and 36 are the responses of the sideslip angle and yaw rate to the control action respectively using the parameters of an sv as listed in table 1 the system response characteristics are analyzed by assuming that ventilated supercavitating is carried out figs 5 and 6 show the unit step responses of the sideslip angle and figs 7 and 8 show the unit step responses of the yaw rate using the two hydrodynamic layout modes based on figs 5 and 6 the sideslip angle can be controlled by two approaches resulting in two responses with different directions and magnitudes the control gain of the sideslip angle generated by mode ⅱ is almost twice that of mode ⅰ similarly based on figs 7 and 8 the control gain of the yaw rate generated by mode ⅱ is about five times that of mode ⅰ therefore for the same control force and allowable limit of sideslip angle an sv using mode ⅱ can obtain approximately twice the sideslip angle and five times the yaw rate compared to that using mode ⅰ this is essential for the layout of the sv control surface hence the hydrodynamic layout of mode ⅱ is recommended as a better option than that of mode i 6 experimental verification to verify the feasibility of the proposed hydrodynamic layout for strong maneuvering svs free motion experiments were conducted using mode ⅱ fig 9 depicts the schematic of the experimental sv the parameters of this experimental sv are identical to those given in table 1 the experimental sv was supplied with an artificial cavity through ventilation the ventilation system included a gas cylinder gas valve and gas vent a carbon fiber gas cylinder was selected with a rated pressure of 30 mpa and rated volume of 0 8 l a truncated conical cavitator of 40 was affixed at the nose of the vehicle followed by vertical rudders as shown in fig 10 an inertial measurement unit was installed inside the sv to measure the triaxial accelerations and triaxial angular velocities as shown in fig 11 the ranges of the accelerometer and gyroscope are 250g and 2000 deg s respectively the sampling accuracy and rate of the system are 16 bits and 3 khz respectively the maneuvering trajectory characteristics of the sv with the preset rudder angle were then acquired in the experiment the sv was launched from a tube using high pressure gas which then made a water entry inclined at an angle of 15 the diagram of the launch system is shown in fig 12 for comparison the svs with 0 and 3 preset front rudder angle have been launched respectively fig 13 shows the surface maneuvering trajectory of the sv with 3 rudder angle where the vehicle is enveloped by the ventilated cavity in addition the time histories of the raw data of triaxial accelerations and angular velocities from the inertial measurement unit are shown in fig 14 and 15 respectively the triaxial velocities can be obtained by integrating the accelerations as shown in fig 16 similarly the euler angles can be obtained by integrating the angular velocities as shown in fig 17 the displacements and drag coefficient can be obtained from the velocity characteristics as shown in fig 18 and 19 respectively according to the experimental results the svs were launched at an angle of 15 fig 17 and then made water entry at about 0 2 s fig 14 after being accelerated by the launch tube the longitudinal velocity of the svs reached almost 60 m s fig 16 after water entry the svs decelerated owing to the water drag coefficient of about 0 06 fig 19 the total sailing range of the svs were about 17 m fig 18 and the sailing ended at approximately 0 42 s because the svs were uncontrolled roll angles were observed fig 17 meanwhile the pitch angle also increased continuously resulting in the risk of the vehicle exiting the water in the underwater sailing stage the lateral force generated by the preset rudder angle at the bow produced a turning yaw moment which made the sv show a turning maneuver trajectory characteristic in the horizontal plane as shown in fig 15 with the preset rudder angle of 3 the yaw rate of the sv is larger than 100 s the experimental results thus show that the hydrodynamic layout of mode ⅱ is able to provide the required lateral force for strong maneuvering motion 7 conclusions in this work the disadvantages of the existing sv hydrodynamic layout are revealed and a novel hydrodynamic layout of the front vertical rudders for strong maneuvering of svs is proposed a comparison of the system response characteristics shows the advantages of the proposed hydrodynamic layout and the free motion experiments verify its feasibility the key findings of this study are as follows 1 owing to the slope discontinuous force characteristics of an sv the hydrodynamic layout of the vertical rudders arranged in the aft portion is not suitable for strong maneuverability 2 for the same rudder force svs using the hydrodynamic layout of the front rudders can obtain approximately twice the sideslip angle and five times the yaw rate compared to those using the extant layout the efficiency of the vertical rudders is also vastly improved 3 the free motion experiments verified the feasibility of the proposed hydrodynamic layout for strong maneuverability of the svs the

which a cavity is formed around an underwater vehicle since most of the vehicular surface is encompassed by a supercavity the skin friction drag of such a vehicle is significantly reduced compared to a conventional fully wetted vehicle resulting in a ten fold increase in speed phuc et al 2019 in general supercavitating vehicles svs are composed of a cavitator a conical section a cylindrical section a pair of aft vertical rudders and a nozzle as shown in fig 1 svs are usually operated in an afterbody planing supported mode that is using only the cavitator rudders and partial afterbody in contact with the liquid and the remainder of the vehicle is fully enveloped in the supercavity the lift forces provided by the cavitator and rudders and the immersion planing force are responsible for the equilibrium problem kong et al 2015 during sailing the pitch motion is controlled by the cavitator and the yaw motion is adjusted using the vertical rudders in the aft portion while the rolling motion is regulated by the vertical rudders via the differential angle the supercavitating torpedo of russia shkval choi et al 2015 petitpas et al 2011 vanek 2008 featuring a straight and level flight adopts this hydrodynamic layout mode hereinafter referred to as mode ⅰ extensive research has been performed for decades on the topic of cavitation logvinovich 1972 experimentally demonstrated the well known principle of independence of cavity section expansions which is regarded as the theoretical basis for modeling supercavities many researchers have expanded this theory and advanced its application in svs experimental investigations on the mechanisms of supercavitation ventilated cavitation hydrodynamic force and control strategy for svs have been carried out semenenko 2001a semenenko 2001b savchenko 2001 2002 erfanian and anbarsooz 2018 vasin and paryshev 2001 the structural behaviors of flexible and stiffened elastic svs have been studied choi et al 2004 ruzzene and soranna 2004 furthermore with the development of motion controllable svs existing research related to supercavitation has assisted in important advances in the guidance and control of svs kirschner et al 2001 2002 dzielski and kurdila 2003 scorcelletti et al 2009 zhao et al 2019 and the self noise signatures of the cavitators of svs howe et al 2009 previous research on svs have mainly focused on mechanisms such as supercavitation dynamic modeling and control the complexities of the existing problems are further increased by the development of maneuverable and highly agile svs in order to deliver high performance while operating within the boundaries of the flight envelope various issues must be addressed such as slope discontinuities in the forces kirschner et al 2006 effects of time delay savchenko 2001 nominally forward location of the center of pressure kirschner et al 2001 and changes in system parameters when the vehicle executes a maneuver savchenko 2002 when maneuvering unwanted changes in the wetted contacts arising from local cavity breakdowns may result in large destabilizing forces and moments in svs owing to the hydrodynamic characteristics of svs being fundamentally more complex than those of conventional underwater vehicles the hydrodynamical control of such vehicles must be implemented in a different manner one of the major issues concerning the development of a maneuvering sv is the hydrodynamic layout integrated design of the vehicle itself ahn et al 2010 including the size and location of the control surfaces and the dynamic behavior of the water cavity vehicle system limited investigations have been performed on the hydrodynamic layout configurations of svs regarding the vehicle itself most of these investigations mainly discussed structural behavior drag characteristics and cavitator assembly kuklinski et al 2006 presented experimental studies on the cavitation effect and control performance of different cavitators uhlman 2006 also conducted parametric studies on the supercavitating flow and cavitators for a range of cavitation numbers the results from these two studies show promising likenesses choi et al 2005 used a shape design sensitivity analysis technique principle of minimum drag to determine the optimum shape of the cavitator by carrying out supercavitating flow analyses for a range of cavitation numbers ruzzene 2004 extensively analyzed both the static and dynamic buckling stabilities of a cylindrical torpedo shell alyanak et al 2005 developed the optimal structural configuration for a supercavitating torpedo model which was a simple cylinder with a conical nose the cavitator and rear control fins were selected for the control surfaces furthermore an algorithm to determine the optimal configuration of the torpedo was presented alyanak et al 2006 in which an optimization problem was formulated to determine the general shape of the torpedo that would satisfy the required performance criteria kawakami and arndt 2011 experimentally investigated the artificial supercavitation behind a sharp edged disk for various model configurations mokhtarzadeh et al 2012 studied the effects of different cavitator shapes on vehicle stability and concluded that the vehicle static stability characteristics depended on the cavitator tangential forces park and rhee 2012 researched a turbulent supercavitating flow around a body equipped with a wedge shaped cavitator wherein computational fluid dynamics cfd solutions for the cavity length were consistent with those of the experimental results sweger et al 2004 studied an optimization process for high speed underwater vehicles to find the optimal trim configuration with minimal control effort global design parameters such as fin geometry and cavitator diameter as well as the angular position of the vehicle with respect to the direction of motion are considered as the optimization variables in general the existing hydrodynamic control approaches can be divided into two categories in the first category the hydrodynamic control authority is led by the combination of cavitator and aft rudders the cavitator has a degree of freedom in the pitch plane only which allows direct control of the diving and rising maneuvers the aft rudders deflect to drive the afterbody to achieve contact with the cavity boundary thus generating planing force and changing the yaw angle kirschner et al 2006 presented an overview of the slope discontinuous force curves and time delay effects of svs they mentioned that the more effective approach to controlling svs was by producing lift at the cavitator the simplest option for control at the cavitator is actuation in the pitch plane only the aft rudders are used for control in the yaw plane more complicated options include cavitator actuation in two degrees of freedom of pitch and yaw planes based on this hydrodynamic control approach ahn et al 2010 studied configuration optimizations of natural svs in terms of their overall dimensions mass distributions and control surface sizes their work considered specific requirements related to the operation of the vehicle during maneuvers kuklinski et al 2006 presented an overview of some experimental results involving the dynamics of svs they concluded that cavitator control has some obvious advantages over a system of aft vehicle control and proposed that the conical cavitators be designed with pivot points in each quadrant to allow the attachment of small wedge cross section fins that enhance the cavitator lift unwanted changes in the wetted contacts arising from local cavity breakdowns may result in large destabilizing forces and moments in the svs while forces associated with the cavitator could uncouple from the dynamics of the cavity downstream vanek 2008 studied the control methods for an sv similar to the hydrodynamic layout mode ⅰ this sv had a set of two control surfaces one in front of the vehicle and the other behind vanek notes that the configuration of the cavitator with two degrees of freedom is more advantageous from a control design perspective because disturbance attenuation in the yaw channel is difficult with only fin control inputs on the lateral dynamics for the second category the hydrodynamic control authority is led by a cavitator with two degrees of freedom in both the pitch and yaw planes this hydrodynamic layout mode is represented by the barracuda developed by german diehl bgt defence vanek 2008 the barracuda has a flexible nose cone which enables appropriate steering kirschner et al 2006 observed that cavitator actuation in two degrees of freedom would be expensive owing to the more complicated actuation systems in tight quarters near the front of the vehicle kuklinski et al 2006 believed that the cavitator in an sv was crucial for both acoustic sensor and hydrodynamic control requirements a cavitator should therefore be developed to accommodate homing sensors owing to the complex hydrodynamic characteristics of the water cavity vehicle system the feature slope discontinuous force characteristics of the sv causes inefficiencies in the rudder at the afterbody and lift forces produced by the front section of the vehicle are more effective for hydrodynamic control many researchers have proposed this mode but have not investigated it adequately in the present work a novel hydrodynamic layout of the front vertical rudders is proposed on the basis of rudder efficiency analysis for maneuvering svs using this mode the rudder efficiency is observed to improve remarkably and the degree of freedom of the cavitator remains constant thus preserving the valuable space of the cavitator comparisons of the system response characteristics with the existing mode show the advantages of the novel hydrodynamic layout in addition the results of free motion experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed layout the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 considering the specific requirements related to maneuvering operations of svs the disadvantages of the hydrodynamic layout of the aft vertical rudders are revealed 2 a novel hydrodynamic layout of the front vertical rudders is proposed for maneuvering svs and the efficiency of the vertical rudders is noted to be improved remarkably 3 free motion experiments of the sv with a preset vertical rudder angle are carried out to validate the feasibility of the proposed novel hydrodynamic layout the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the horizontal dynamics model section 3 presents the disadvantages of the hydrodynamic layout of the aft vertical rudders from rudder efficiency analysis section 4 is concerned with the novel hydrodynamic layout of the front aft vertical rudders section 5 presents comparison of the step response characteristics of the two modes section 6 presents the free motion experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed hydrodynamic layout and section 7 presents the conclusions 2 system modeling to obtain a low order model reflecting the essential dynamics in a mathematically tractable form the following assumptions are made the vehicle is sailing in a horizontal plane with a constant speed the rolling angle is zero the mass of the vehicle the propulsive force and the cavitation number remain constant the vehicle is sailing with a small yaw angle a small sideslip angle and a thrust misalignment angle therefore sin β β cos β 1 sin ψ ψ cos ψ 1 sin α t α t and cos α t 1 based on the above assumptions and using the hydrodynamic layout of the sv in fig 1 the free body diagram for the horizontal plane is shown in fig 2 the force balance of the sv in the horizontal plane is 1 m v ψ a δ δ a β β a ω ω y t α t the expressions for the coefficients a δ a β and a ω are given in the appendix the moment balance is given as 2 j ω y m δ δ m β β m ω ω y t α t l t the expressions for the coefficients m δ m ω and m β are given in the appendix the angle relationship is given as 3 ψ ω y 4 ψ ψ β in the force balance expression of equation 1 the first term on the right hand side describes the lateral force caused by the rudder the second term describes the planing force sanabria and arndt 2018 zou et al 2015 the third term describes the damping force under unsteady state conditions and the last term accounts for the lateral force caused by thrust misalignment the hydrodynamic parameters in the system model can be obtained using cfd 3 analysis of rudder efficiency based on equation 1 4 the following steady state relationship without rudder angle can be obtained under the steady state condition of ω y β 0 5 0 m β β m ω ω y t α t l t 6 m v ω y a β β a ω ω y t α t the steady state ω y and β values related to the thrust misalignment angle α t can be obtained as follows 7 ω y a β t α t l t m β t α t m v m β a β m ω m β a ω 8 β m ω ω y t α t l t m β based on equations 7 and 8 the existence of the thrust misalignment angle will enable a sustained yaw of the vehicle even for a statically stable sv therefore to achieve zero heading deviation the vertical rudder should be applied further to achieve zero yaw rate under the steady state condition of ω y β 0 the required vertical rudder angle and sideslip angle are calculated as 9 δ a β β t α t a δ 10 β t α t l t a δ m δ t α t m δ a β a δ m β where the coefficients m δ and m β are given by 11 m δ a δ l δ m β a β l β inserting equation 11 into equations 9 and 10 yields 12 a β β t α t l t l δ l δ l β 13 a δ δ t α t l t l β l δ l β equations 12 and 13 respectively describe the values of the sideslip angle and vertical rudder angle to achieve the fixed yaw angle in the presence of thrust misalignment from these two equations it is found that the required rudder force and sideslip angle respectively on the left hand side of the two equations are both larger owing to the action point of the rudder force being close to the action point of the lateral force of the vehicle furthermore α t and δ have opposite signs because the positive directions of both rudder force and side component of thrust are pointing toward the starboard if the position of the rudder is too close to the mass center the control action will be reversed using the hydrodynamic layout mode depicted in fig 1 in which the vertical rudders are arranged in the aft portion the control characteristics are further analyzed to highlight the primary issue the effect of thrust misalignment is neglected in response to a certain vertical rudder angle δ the vehicle can be maneuvered with yaw rate ω y based on the dynamic model in the horizontal plane and the steady state condition of ω y β 0 the yaw rate and sideslip angle are obtained as follows 14 ω y l β l δ m ω a ω l β m v l β a δ δ 15 β a δ l δ δ m ω ω y a β l β thus during strong maneuvering sailing when the controller is commanded to execute a turn the rudders will be deflected to drive the afterbody however no lateral force will be developed on the hull until the afterbody contacts the cavity boundary once the afterbody planing against the side of the cavity boundary the lateral force center on the hull migrates forward with the afterbody immersion increases this constitutes the slope discontinuous force characteristic of the sv during the migration of the lateral force center given equation 14 and in combination with fig 2 l β and l δ would have the same sign owing to the vertical rudders arranged on the afterbody this causes the yaw producing lateral force to weaken the total force toward the center of the turn in the limit case of l δ l β the vertical rudders will even be completely useless accordingly the hydrodynamic layout of the vertical rudders arranged in the aft portion is not suitable for strong maneuvering of an sv thereby illustrating the need for an alternative hydrodynamic layout 4 novel hydrodynamic layout to solve the rudder inefficiency of mode ⅰ a more effective approach to controlling the sv would be the production of a lateral force at the front portion of the vehicle hence a novel hydrodynamic layout for the front vertical rudders is proposed here as shown in fig 3 hereinafter referred to as mode ⅱ in this mode the vertical rudders are fixed behind the cavitator at the bow the sv is operated in finless tail planing supported motion mode to maneuver as shown in fig 4 the yaw motion is adjusted using the front vertical rudders the pitch motion is controlled by the cavitator and the rolling motion is regulated by the differential motion of upper and lower front vertical rudders the sv can be designed without any aft fins because the forces provided by the cavitator and front rudders and the immersion planing force are responsible for the equilibrium problem rather than relying on the aft fins moreover the system damping provided by the aft fins alone would be considerably less than that due to afterbody planing kirschner et al 2006 the rudder efficiency in this hydrodynamic layout is analyzed as follows in mode ⅱ the distance from the force acting point of vertical rudders to the center of gravity changes to l δ this results in the yaw producing lateral force enhancing the total force toward the center of the turn rather than working against it equations 14 and 15 are therefore transformed into 16 ω y l β l δ m ω a ω l β m v l β a δ δ 17 β a δ l δ δ m ω ω y a β l β comparing equations 14 and 16 greater yaw rate can be obtained in mode ⅱ with the same rudder force and the efficiency of the vertical rudder system is improved remarkably when using mode ⅰ the puncturing depths of the upper and lower vertical rudders are asymmetric because the supercavity cross section experiences deformation due to gravity and other effects kirschner et al 2006 whereas such inconsistencies do not exist in mode ⅱ composite of cavitator and rudders can enhance the control authority without significantly altering the downstream properties of the cavity encapsulating the vehicle kuklinski et al 2006 more importantly such a system has the advantage of not requiring cavitator actuation for maneuvering in the yaw plane avoiding the arrangement of complicated cavitator actuation in such tight quarters of the forward cavitator thereby making room for the installation of guidance and detection systems 5 comparison of the two modes ignoring the thrust misalignment regardless of the hydrodynamic layout mode used the force balance of equation 1 can be simplified as 18 m v ψ β z z c similarly the moment balance of equation 2 can be simplified as 19 j ψ z l β z c l c where l c is a positive value when z c acts on the aft region of the center of gravity the yaw speed z e in the ground coordinate system is given as 20 z e v ψ β according to the principle of independence of the cavity section expansion proposed by logvinovich 1972 the time delay effect τ is unavoidable and is given by the interval of the disturbance at the cavitator propagating to the supercavity at the tail i e τ l t v hassouneh et al 2013 thereafter the position and size of the supercavity at the aft section at time t are determined only by the previous state of the cavitator at time t τ the lateral force z acting on the hull can be described in a simplified form li et al 2019 as follows 21 z c α r z w c ω ψ where 22 r z w z n τ z w 23 z n τ z e τ ψ τ l n z w z e ψ l w therefore the lateral forces of equation 21 can be written as 24 z z e τ z e ψ τ l n ψ l w c α c ω ψ according to literature li et al 2019 huang et al 2017 the distance from acting point of the lateral force to the center of gravity is given as 25 l β l w k r α r z 2 r y 2 where r z 2 r y 2 is the deviation between the cavity and the vehicle at the aft the deviation which reflects the asymmetry of supercavity nguyen and balachandran 2011 can be used to identify the real time planing forces online considering the time delay effect the sideslip angle at time t can be approximated as 26 ψ ψ τ τ ψ ψ τ 2 its transfer function is given as 27 ℓ ψ τ ℓ ψ 1 τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s where ℓ denotes the laplace transform similarly the z component of the center of gravity in the ground coordinate system can be approximated using the transfer function as 28 ℓ z e τ ℓ z e ℓ z e τ s 1 τ 2 s from equations 20 24 27 and 28 the following expression can be obtained 29 ℓ z c α l t 1 τ 2 s ℓ β l t 1 τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s l n l w s c ω c α ℓ ψ from equation 29 the force balance equation 18 and

τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s 1 τ 2 s l n l w s c ω c α s 2 j c α l β ℓ ψ the relation between the yaw angle and the yaw rate is given by 32 s ℓ ψ ℓ ω y from equations 30 32 the following relations can be obtained 33 ℓ ω y ℓ z c x ψ y l c l β l β m v 34 ℓ β ℓ z c x β y 1 l t l β c α m v the expressions of the coefficients y x ψ and x β are given in the appendix considering the relationship l t l n l w and equation

expressions of the coefficients b 1 b 2 k ω a ω 1 a ω 2 k β a β 1 and a β 2 are given in the appendix here equations 35 and 36 are the responses of the sideslip angle and yaw rate to the control action respectively using the parameters of an sv as listed in table 1 the system response characteristics are analyzed by assuming that ventilated supercavitating is carried out figs 5 and 6 show the unit step responses of the sideslip angle and figs 7 and 8 show the unit step responses of the yaw rate using the two hydrodynamic layout modes based on figs 5 and 6 the sideslip angle can be controlled by two approaches resulting in two responses with different directions and magnitudes the control gain of the sideslip angle generated by mode ⅱ is almost twice that of mode ⅰ similarly based on figs 7 and 8 the control gain of the yaw rate generated by mode ⅱ is about five times that of mode ⅰ therefore for the same control force and allowable limit of sideslip angle an sv using mode ⅱ can obtain approximately twice the sideslip angle and five times the yaw rate compared to that using mode ⅰ this is essential for the layout of the sv control surface hence the hydrodynamic layout of mode ⅱ is recommended as a better option than that of mode i 6 experimental verification to verify the feasibility of the proposed hydrodynamic layout for strong maneuvering svs free motion experiments were conducted using mode ⅱ fig 9 depicts the schematic of the experimental sv the parameters of this experimental sv are identical to those given in table 1 the experimental sv was supplied with an artificial cavity through ventilation the ventilation system included a gas cylinder gas valve and gas vent a carbon fiber gas cylinder was selected with a rated pressure of 30 mpa and rated volume of 0 8 l a truncated conical cavitator of 40 was affixed at the nose of the vehicle followed by vertical rudders as shown in fig 10 an inertial measurement unit was installed inside the sv to measure the triaxial accelerations and triaxial angular velocities as shown in fig 11 the ranges of the accelerometer and gyroscope are 250g and 2000 deg s respectively the sampling accuracy and rate of the system are 16 bits and 3 khz respectively the maneuvering trajectory characteristics of the sv with the preset rudder angle were then acquired in the experiment the sv was launched from a tube using high pressure gas which then made a water entry inclined at an angle of 15 the diagram of the launch system is shown in fig 12 for comparison the svs with 0 and 3 preset front rudder angle have been launched respectively fig 13 shows the surface maneuvering trajectory of the sv with 3 rudder angle where the vehicle is enveloped by the ventilated cavity in addition the time histories of the raw data of triaxial accelerations and angular velocities from the inertial measurement unit are shown in fig 14 and 15 respectively the triaxial velocities can be obtained by integrating the accelerations as shown in fig 16 similarly the euler angles can be obtained by integrating the angular velocities as shown in fig 17 the displacements and drag coefficient can be obtained from the velocity characteristics as shown in fig 18 and 19 respectively according to the experimental results the svs were launched at an angle of 15 fig 17 and then made water entry at about 0 2 s fig 14 after being accelerated by the launch tube the longitudinal velocity of the svs reached almost 60 m s fig 16 after water entry the svs decelerated owing to the water drag coefficient of about 0 06 fig 19 the total sailing range of the svs were about 17 m fig 18 and the sailing ended at approximately 0 42 s because the svs were uncontrolled roll angles were observed fig 17 meanwhile the pitch angle also increased continuously resulting in the risk of the vehicle exiting the water in the underwater sailing stage the lateral force generated by the preset rudder angle at the bow produced a turning yaw moment which made the sv show a turning maneuver trajectory characteristic in the horizontal plane as shown in fig 15 with the preset rudder angle of 3 the yaw rate of the sv is larger than 100 s the experimental results thus show that the hydrodynamic layout of mode ⅱ is able to provide the required lateral force for strong maneuvering motion 7 conclusions in this work the disadvantages of the existing sv hydrodynamic layout are revealed and a novel hydrodynamic layout of the front vertical rudders for strong maneuvering of svs is proposed a comparison of the system response characteristics shows the advantages of the proposed hydrodynamic layout and the free motion experiments verify its feasibility the key findings of this study are as follows 1 owing to the slope discontinuous force characteristics of an sv the hydrodynamic layout of the vertical rudders arranged in the aft portion is not suitable for strong maneuverability 2 for the same rudder force svs using the hydrodynamic layout of the front rudders can obtain approximately twice the sideslip angle and five times the yaw rate compared to those using the extant layout the efficiency of the vertical rudders is also vastly improved 3 the free motion experiments verified the feasibility of the proposed hydrodynamic layout for strong maneuverability of the svs the presented layout is able to provide the required lateral force for strong maneuvering motion data availability the data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding

21571,low crested structures such as submerged rubble mound breakwaters rmb are commonly used as successful examples of coastal protection measures this study addresses foundation issues related to the performance of a submerged rmb constructed on a liquefiable site where the foundation soils have been loosely deposited these issues were investigated using an integrated numerical model proposed by zhao et al 2018 unlike previous work in zhao et al 2018 the dynamic features of loose sand deposits i e build up of pore water pressures development of plastic strains degradation of soil stiffness due to the fluid seabed structure interactions accompanied by the onset of liquefaction were simulated the reliability of this model to predict the liquefaction susceptibility of loose sand deposits was validated against the experimental results available in literature this study shows that the submerged rmb constructed on a liquefiable seabed experienced progressive and asymmetric downward settlement under successive loading cycles the opposing currents in the wave field tended to enhance this asymmetric settlement whereas the following currents did the opposite regardless of changes to the magnitude and direction of current velocities ignoring the currents in the wave field may lead to an overestimation of the increased rate of residual pore water pressures in the region underneath the breakwater particularly in shallow soil layers where the maximum relative differences can reach up to 120 of p current p no current p 0 at t t 25 keywords fluid seabed structure interactions fssi loose sand deposits generalized plasticity model pziii progressive liquefaction 1 introduction breakwaters are popular and widely constructed offshore elements that are used as ports that eliminate the negative impact of ocean waves on the landscape and thus enhance the utility of coastlines unlike traditional breakwaters a submerged breakwater consisting of rubble stones is considered to be more ecologically friendly and therefore more popular due to their environmental implications existing studies have focused on the local hydrodynamic process i e breaking waves and the resulting currents around these structures zanuttigh and lamberti 2006 johnson et al 2005 and the process whereby sediment transportation i e erosion and scour may lead to failure due to the structure overturning and sliding zanuttigh 2007 young and testik 2009 zhang et al 2017 apart from the hydrodynamic aspect the instability of marine structures can be also attributed to seabed liquefaction a process marked by a rapid and considerable loss of strength in loose and saturated deposits subjected to cyclic loading de groot et al 1991 sumer 2014 the onset of liquefaction may compromise the stability and longevity of marine infrastructures and even result in their total collapse in as little as several years after installation oumeraci 1994 the newly deposited quaternary seabed is typical type of the loose marine sediments that are widely distributed throughout the world s coastal areas the nigerian coast for example is one of the most densely populated coastal areas in africa and consists of quaternary sand silts and clay that are almost 759 km long iliya et al 2017 the mechanical behaviour of loose saturated soil has already been investigated in previous field and laboratory tests using the standard penetration test spt and monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests the results show that loose sand exhibits contractive and strain softening behaviour as a result of transient or repeated disturbance which reduces the shearing resistance or enhances the development of excessive strain due to the build up of pore water pressure and subsequent reduction in the mean normal effective stress seed and rahman 1978 ishihara and yamazaki 1984 ishihara 1993 loose sand deposits are therefore not normally suitable as foundations for marine structures due to their poor mechanical properties and high vulnerability to liquefaction when subjected to repetitive loads in a harsh oceanic environment despite these disadvantages coastal and geotechnical engineers must still cope with loose sandy seabed as foundations for breakwaters if there are no other choices i e nigerian coastal regions understanding the liquefaction characteristics of loose sand deposits plays a vital role in mitigating the associated hazards enhancing the longevity of marine structures during their service life the performance of marine structures constructed on liquefiable sites can be reproduced using a prototype numerical analysis based on the computational technology of fluid seabed structure interactions fssi existing research related to fssi can be classified into two main categories depending on the coupling approach between the fluid and the soil structural domains i uncoupled models and ii partially coupled models most available fssi models tend to conform to the first category and focus on numerical modelling of soil structure interaction under wave loads that is computed analytically or empirically jeng 2003a ulker et al 2010 2018 due to the limitations of potential flow theory the effects of structure on the flow field such as viscosity and breaking waves particularly on the seabed foundation cannot be reproduced very well using uncoupled models more advanced works are often semi coupled so the hydrodynamic models and soil structural interaction models are developed separately and then integrated through a one way coupling process by applying advanced computational fluid dynamics cfd models lin and liu 1998 hsu et al 2002 higuera et al 2013 into these integrated frameworks the insights of fssi can be enhanced this includes the effect of seepage flow due to the generation of excess pore water pressure on the incipient motion of sediment around a spanning pipeline guo et al 2019 li et al 2019 the three dimensional response of soil around the breakwater heads or mono pile foundation due to the diffraction and reflection of water waves zhao et al 2013 2017 liao et al 2018 the impact of breaking waves on caissons and the subsequent dynamics of the seabed foundation as the structure rocks backwards and forwards ye et al 2014 elsafti and oumeraci 2017 regardless of the coupling approach these researches for fssi mainly assumed that seabed soil is a poro elastic material that cannot attain any permanent deformation so to reproduce the nonlinear and irreversible behaviour of loose sand more realistically an advanced constitutive model that will follow the stress strain path during cyclic loading is needed one early implementation of elastoplastic modelling for fluid seabed structure interaction can be found in jeng and ou 2010 this model was based on a semi analytical approach in which the breakwater was simplified as an impermeable line in order to consider the transformations of wave tip whereas the response of the seabed in relation to the weight of the structure was neglected ye et al 2015 numerically investigated features of residual soil deformation and liquefaction around a caisson type breakwater under cyclic waves by utilising the generalised plasticity model pziii pastor et al 1990 via fssi cas 2d their predicted results indicated progressive liquefaction corresponding to the long term performance of a seabed foundation undergoing elastoplastic deformation as the accumulated residual pore water pressure overcomes the overburdened weight of soil elsafti and oumeraci 2016 recently developed a finite volume model for fluid seabed structure interaction around monolithic breakwaters based on the open source code openfoam in which a multi surface plasticity model based on an extended drucker prager failure criterion was used to consider the material behaviour of the seabed soil a frictional contact model was also introduced for the soil structure interaction and the separation reattachment and sliding of the soil structure interface their results showed that the rocking motion of the structure due to the impact of breaking waves is more likely to lead to seabed instability than waves breaking on the surface in practice a submerged breakwater is usually constructed close to the shoreline in shallow water where currents are basically triggered by breaking waves lamberti et al 2005 however most of the existing research for fssi considered wave conditions without currents but in reality the existence of waves and currents may further complicate the flow structure and subsequent deformation of the foundation which may compromise the stability of the structure due to liquefaction qi and gao 2014 qi et al 2019 in a recent publication zhao et al 2018 developed a one way coupling model for the response of soil due to waves and currents around a submerged rmb by assuming that the seabed soil was deformed within the elastic approach during momentary liquefaction this present study can be seen as a follow up where we improved the model to consider the long term performance of a breakwater constructed on deposits of loose sand while undergoing elastoplastic deformation this model was then used to investigate the problems caused by the poor mechanical properties of loose sand particularly its susceptibility to liquefaction due to wave and current loading how the currents in the wave field affect the build up of residual pore water pressure cumulative breakwater settlement and potential for liquefaction etc were also discussed and compared to previous studies that were limited to wave alone case parametric studies were also carried out to extend the applicability of the model to various conditions in the candidate site 2 description of the numerical model the integrated numerical model contains two separate sub models which are semi coupled through a one way coupling algorithm developed by zhao et al 2018 a description of each model will be introduced in this section 2 1 hydrodynamic model 2 1 1 varans equations the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations varans include the continuity eq 1 and mass conservation equations eq 2 they can be expressed as follows jesus et al 2012 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j 1 n ρ u i u j n p f x i n g j x j ρ x i x j μ e f f u i x j c t where u i extended

computational fluid dynamics toolbox openfoam where a model called interfoam was used to solve the rans equations based on finite volume discretisation and the fractional two step projection method the volume of fluid vof method berberovic et al 2009 was used to track the free surface evolution since the vof method can track the position of each phase of the flow it is also a base for the multiphase capabilities of the interfoam solver where all the fluid properties needed to solve equations at each cell are described by the fraction α i occupied by the vof of the i th material in the cell where there is current in the wave field a uniform current velocity u c is considered for the inlet boundary condition fig 1 so the model for generating waves is switched on after the current becomes stable the incident flow velocity u w of the corresponding stokes wave is superimposed onto a stable ocean current based on the wave parameters given at the inlet boundary the incident flow velocity u w of the corresponding stokes wave is superimposed onto a stable ocean current based on the wave parameters given at the inlet boundary an active wave absorption 12 is used for the outlet boundary to eliminate wave reflection at the end of the computational domain so that the velocity of the outlet boundary u w can be determined by the incoming water surface elevation η as u w g h η furthermore the velocity profile u c equal to the inlet boundary is superimposed at the end of the domain to ensure the water is free to run out the pressure conditions at the inlet and outlet boundary are set at a zero gradient more details about the generation and absorption of water waves and ocean currents can be found in higuera et al 2013 2 2 geotechnical model 2 2 1 biot s partially dynamic equations saturated marine sediments are known as a multi phase medium that consists of a soil skeleton and pore fluid mostly water and some encapsulated air for the dynamic analysis of fluid seabed structure interaction considered in this study an appropriate estimation of solid pore fluid interactions in a porous medium is of great importance jeng 2003b this can be achieved using biot s theory because it can include the momentum balances between two phases and the mass conservation of pore water during flow by assuming that flow inside a porous medium obeys darcy s law the loading efficiency is generally caused by relatively low waves unlike those induced by high speed moving trains or earthquakes this enables biot s partially dynamic equations ulker and rahman 2009 chen et al 2020 to be applied because the relative displacement of pore fluid to soil particles is ignored but the inertia forces due to the acceleration of pore water and soil particles are considered 12 σ x x

14 the volumetric strain ε s can be defined as 15 ε s u s x w s z it is noteworthy that for the degree of saturation close to s r 100 the pore fluid can still be treated as a single phase with gas bubbles being diffused within and the compressibility of pore fluid β s in eq 14 can be defined as 16 β s 1 k f 1 k p 1 s r p w 0 where k f is the bulk modulus of the pore fluid p w 0 is the absolute static pressure and k p is the bulk modulus of the pore water normally taken at 2 24 10 9 n m 2 yamamoto et al 1978 2 2 2 finite element formulations the finite element method was used to discretise the governing equations 12 14 to obtain a weak form these equations are multiplied by virtual variables with appropriate shape functions and integrated within the domain of interest below is a summary

where u and p are vectors for nodal displacement and pore water pressure respectively k and h are the stiffness matrices of the solid and fluid phases respectively c and s are the damping matrices of the coupled system and the fluid phase m and g are the mass matrices of the solid and fluid phases also in the matrices b p and b u are the strain displacement matrices associated with the pressure and displacement fields respectively and same is the case for the n p and n u shape function matrices for each field the time integration scheme we adopted in obtaining the numerical results at each time step is the implicit newmark method which was originally proposed by newmark 1959 and later extended by zienkiewicz and taylor 1989 thus at time step n 1 with an increment δ t we have the following for the acceleration velocity displacement rate of change in pore water pressure and pore water pressure itself respectively 23 u n 1 u n δ u n 24 u n 1 u n u n δ t β 1 δ u n δ t 25 u n 1 u

numerical solution if we assume that eq 17 is satisfied at the n th time step then it will also be satisfied at the n 1 th time step 28 m n 1 0 g 0 u n 1 p n 1 0 0 c n 1 t s n 1 u n 1 p n 1 k n 1 c n

taking the values determined at the n th time step as the initial conditions once the incremental acceleration δ u n and the incremental rate of pore water pressure change δ p n have been determined the soil displacement and the pore water pressure can be obtained by applying 25 and 27 2 2 3 soil constitutive model pastor zienkiewicz mark iii model the effective stress and strain increments are expressed using an elastoplastic constitutive law 32 d σ d b d u d ε 0 where d σ d u and d ε 0 are the incremental values of effective stresses displacement and residual strains and d is the material matrix related to the constitutive model in this present study the pastor zienkiewicz mark iii pastor et al 1990 was used to analyse deposits of loose sand due to wave and current loading where the elastoplastic matrix d can be expressed in the following tensor form 33 d i j k l d i j k l e d i j m n e m m n n s t d s t k l e h l u n s t d s t k l e m k l where d i j k l e is the fourth order tangent elastic stiffness h l u is the plastic modulus in the loading or unloading stage m m n is the tensor form of plastic flow direction and n s t is the loading or unloading direction tensor in a generalized plasticity approach such as pastor et al 1990 the loading direction and plastic flow direction vectors can be fully described without reference to any yield surface or plastic potential because the gradients themselves are functions i e 34 m m n g σ m m g σ and n s t f σ s t f σ where g σ and f σ represent the normalisation of the tensor g σ i j and f σ i j respectively f and g are the yield surface function and plastic potential surface function in stress space and by using the dilatancy relationship given by balasubramaniam and chaudhry 1978 they can be determined as follows 35 g q m g p 1 1 α g 1 p p g α g 36 f q m f p 1 1 α f 1 p p c α f where m g is the slope of phase transformation line α g α f and m f are constants that determine the size of the loading surface and p g and p c are the size parameters p and q representing the mean normal effective stress and generalized shear stress can be determined as 37 p 1 3 σ x σ y σ z 38 q 1 2 σ x σ y 2 σ x σ z 2 σ y σ z 2 6 τ x z the plastic modulus h l u in eq 33 during unloading or reloading stage is defined as 39 h l h 0 p 1 q p η f 4 1 q p m g β 0 β 1 exp β 0 ξ ζ ζ m a x γ d m 40 h u h u 0 m g q p u γ u for m g q p u

p p 0 λ 3 k μ s 1 μ s k k e v 0 p p 0 where g is the shear modulus that may vary according to the mean effective stress so that the softening behaviour of the soil can be considered g 0 and p 0 are the initial value of the shear modulus and mean effective stress before shearing δ is the kronecker delta λ is lame s constant and k is the bulk modulus of the soil the initial value is k e v 0 the dynamic analysis requires the integration of eq 32 to determine the change in stress at each time step as the solution proceeds when doing this the adopted generalized plasticity model means that i no scalar yield function is involved and consistency conditions need not be fulfilled ii the stress point does not have to be brought back to the yield surface and the tangent moduli are easily established therefore convergence at the material point level can easily be achieved if the size of strain increment can be rationally controlled in this study an alternative one step explicit algorithm that uses the strain subdivision technique is used for a given strain increment δ ε at a stress state σ n and an internal stress variable k n the two increments based on the initial tangential d and the final d matrix can be calculated as follows 43 δ σ 1 d σ n k n δ ε 44 δ σ 2 d σ n δ σ 1 k n δ k δ ε where δ k k σ δ σ 1 then the number of subdivision ndiv is determined by the following equation 45 ndiv integer min δ σ 1 δ σ 2 2 c min δ σ 1 δ σ 2 where c is a tolerance specified by the user and it is usually taken from 0 02 to 0 05 as suggested by chan 1988 δ σ denotes the euclidean norm of δ σ and it is defined as 46 δ σ δ σ t δ σ 1 2 then the strain is subdivided δ ε sub δ ε ndiv and the stresses are incremented using the initial tangential d with the initial state defined as 47 σ 0 n σ n k 0 n k n during the i th increment the convergence at the material point level is achieved if 48 δ σ i 1 n δ σ i n δ σ i 1 n δ σ i n γ c where γ is a user defined parameter which is recommended to be 2 chan 1988 otherwise a warning is given or change the step until the material point convergence is achieved the constitutive model requires 13 parameters m f m g h 0 h u 0 α g α f β 0 β 1 p 0 γ u γ d m p 0 g 0 k e v 0 table 1 summarises the values of each parameter assigned to three kinds of granular soil considered in the model verifications and dynamic analysis note that the values for nevada sand were determined by zienkiewicz et al 1998 from the isotropically consolidated undrained tests at a confining pressure of 40 kpa a flow chart describing the strain subdivision technique is shown in fig 2 2 3 numerical simulation since the elastic modulus of the pziii model depends on the magnitude of the mean confining stress zienkiewicz et al 1998 a consolidation analysis was carried out to apply gravitational forces due to the weight of the soil and the structure before cyclic excitation with the stress state to be obtained at the end of consolidation phase as initial conditions the dynamic analysis can be activated using a nonlinear solution algorithm as shown in the flow chart fig 3 3 verifications the hydrodynamic model has been validated by zhao et al 2018 by comparing it with laboratory tests for propagating waves with a following current over a rigid bottom and wave and current interactions with a submerged breakwater the results fit the experimental data well with regards to the velocity profile and water surface elevations and therefore only the geotechnical model is validated in this section 3 1 comparison with ulker et al 2009 s analytical approximations the geotechnical model was first validated against analytical approximations ulker et al 2009 by applying a coupled solid pore fluid dynamic framework to dynamic wave loading in poro elastic material the following parameters g 5 2 10 7 n m 2 k s 2 10 3 m s n 0 333 μ 0 35 s r 1 were used for this model validation the analytical solution based on potential flow theory was used to determine the sinusoidal pressure exerted on the seabed surface due to a linear progressive wave i e 49 p z h 1 x t p 0 cos 2 π x l w 2 π t t where p 0 γ w h 2 cosh 2 π l w d where l w is the wave length h is the wave height p 0 is the amplitude of dynamic wave pressure of the incident wave fig 4 shows the normalisation of maximum pore water pressure vertical effective stress and shear stress over wave period for a seabed with varying thickness note that the numerical predictions fit the analytical approximations very well which indicates that the coupled solid pore fluid dynamic framework is well established in the developed model 3 2 comparison with castro 1969 s undrained triaxial test under monotonic and cyclic loadings castro 1969 carried out a series of undrained triaxial tests to investigate the mechanical behaviour of banding sand under monotonic and cyclic loadings but prior to testing the specimens were isotopically consolidated to the desired confining stress state fig 5 shows the results obtained by castro 1969 they include the stress path the deviatoric stress versus shear strain and the development of pore water pressure together with the model predictions these predicted results agree fairly well with the experimental data with the loose samples i e d r 29 and 44 the deviator stress q σ 1 σ 3 mobilised quickly to a peak value at a small shear strain and then it collapsed to flow rapidly to large strains accompanied by a significant increase in the pore water pressure and a reduction in the mean effective confining stress the transition from strain softening to strain hardening can be observed in fig 5 b as the relative density d r changed from 29 to 66 with the tested specimen that began in a medium dense state i e d r 66 the stress path moved towards the failure envelope associated with an increase in the shear strength but the pore water pressure and shear strain developed slowly after ε a 1 2 fig 6 shows the effective stress path and deviator stress versus axial strains in the specimen tested at d r 27 under cyclic loading the stress path gradually moved to the left with a reduced mean effective stress before its sudden drop indicated the specimen had failed as with the monotonic loading test the specimen subjected to cyclic loading also exhibited strain softening after q reached its peak value this was followed by a sudden loss of shear strength and a rapid development of axial strain all the aforementioned features can be captured by the model predictions which means the pziii model can reproduce the strength and deformation of loose sand 3 3 comparison with sassa and sekiguchi 2001 s geotechnical centrifugal wave tests the constitutive framework was then incorporated into the finite element model to reproduce sassa and sekiguchi 1999 s centrifuge wave testing for the liquefaction susceptibility of loose sand due to cyclic wave loads the tests were carried out in a balanced beam centrifuge under a centrifugal acceleration of 50 g in this test the water for pore fluid or fluid over the surface was replaced with a viscous silicone of 50 cst to match the time scaling laws of consolidation and wave propagation the granular soil used in the test was leighton buzzard sand british standard sieve 100 170 this experiment was an attempt to simulate a prototype layer of soil 10 m 5 m with a relative density of d r 40 the experimental case p5 1 was used to verify the model in which the wave and soil characteristics are as follows the wave period was t 4 55 s the fluid depth was d 4 5 m the wave height was h 1 7 m permeability coefficient was k s 1 5 10 4 m s and the degree of saturation was s r 100 fig 7 shows the pore water pressure at four different locations along the centreline of the computational domain the analytical solution was again used to determine the dynamic wave pressure exerted on the seabed i e z h 0 where the pore water pressure can freely drain out this is why there was no residual component at this location note that the incremental rate and ultimate value of pore water pressure were greater at deeper locations because the overburden pressure is quite high this means that a larger build up of pore water pressure is needed to liquefy the soil although there were some differences as the pore water pressure developed the maximum value can still be captured this is needed for practical engineering design to predict the onset of liquefaction sumer 2014 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 ye et al 2015 4 results and discussion the constitutive model and coupled solid fluid dynamic framework was incorporated into the integrated numerical model developed by zhao et al 2018 and then used to investigate the fluid seabed structure interactions around a submerged rubble mound breakwater the computational domain is the same as those considered in zhao et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 where a rubble mound low crested structure 284 m long by 20 m wide with an 18 m wide crest was constructed on a sandy seabed foundation in this simulation nevada sand zienkiewicz et al 1998 with a relative density of d r 40 was used to analyse deposits of loose sand whose material properties were determined by zienkiewicz et al 1998 and are listed in table 1 the wave characteristics the properties of the seabed foundation and breakwater are listed in table 2 unless specified in the parametric studies 4 1 dynamic characteristics of a submerged breakwater fig 9 shows snapshots of breakwater settlement at three loading phases here the current moved at 1 5 m s and in the same direction as wave propagation it was predicted that the breakwater would subside downwards under successive loading cycles as the loose sand experienced nonlinear and irrecoverable plastic deformation due to cyclic shearing ishihara and yoshimine 1992 since the breakwater subsided asymmetrically due to hydrodynamic loading settlement on the seaward side was greater than on the shoreward side this phenomenon could further trigger an irreversible and progressive sliding failure that could eventually lead to its total collapse oumeraci 1994 liu et al 2019 fig 10 shows the distributions of vertical displacement along the bottom of the rubble mound at t t 25 where the current velocities varied from u 0 1 5 m s to u 0 1 5 m s note that the initial settlement due to the construction of the breakwater was not considered overall the breakwater would suffer less downward settlement if there was a following current in the wave field unlike when u 0 0 m s i e wave alone case however an opposing current does the opposite despite having less effect on the evolution of breakwater settlement taking the waves encountered by a following current at u 0 1 5 m s as a typical example downward settlement peaked at x 250 5 m which is around 100 mm it would then increase to w m a x 121 mm approximately 20 relative difference at x 252 mm if there was no current in the wave field i e u 0 0 m s on the other hand with the same current velocity in the opposite direction i e u 0 1 5 m s the maximum accumulated downward settlement could only increase by approximately 4 i e from 121 mm to 126 5 mm moreover the current velocities would also be less significant fig 10 shows that settlement at the seaward side of the breakwater is always greater than on the shoreward side regardless of how the magnitude and direction of current velocities are changed to quantify how the current will affect the asymmetric settlement of the breakwater the parameter δ which is defined as the ratio between two different areas under the curve as shown in fig 11 a which are differentiated by the line crossing the centreline of the breakwater is introduced as follows 50 δ a r e a i a r e a i i x l x m x d x x m x r x d x where area i and area ii are obtained by taking the sum of a series of small rectangles defined by f i x δ x where f i is the accumulated downward settlement at each position fig 11 b shows the variations of δ where the current velocities varied from u 0 1 5 m s to u 0 1 5 m s at three loading phases where t t 15 20 30 note that δ increases in countercurrent waves and decreases in cocurrent waves in comparison with those of wave alone case u 0 0 m s the greater the current velocity the greater its effect on the asymmetric settlement of the breakwater moreover the gradient of asymmetric coefficient δ versus current velocity u 0 gradually becomes steeper with successive loading cycles where t t 30 the maximum δ occurred at u 0 1 5 m s and it could reach 1 9 whereas δ was only 1 1 when u 0 1 5 m s 4 2 dynamic characteristics of a loosely deposited seabed foundation fig 12 shows snapshots of the pore water pressure and the effective stress and shear stress in the rubble mound and foundation soil at two loading phases where t t 10 and t t 20 respectively based on these results three regions in the seabed were identified regions i and iii are on the seaward and shoreward side of the breakwater where the seabed is directly under the influence of surface water motions in region ii which is close to and underneath the breakwater these dynamics are induced as water flows through the layers of rubble to the seabed foundation and those associated with gravity as the breakwater was being constructed the pore water in all three regions gradually builds up with successive loading cycles while the mean normal effective stress and shear stress gradually decrease the increased rate of pore water pressure is more apparent in region i particularly at the antinode of the standing waves formed due to wave wave interactions than in region iii in region ii where the breakwater may increase the volumetric contraction of the soil skeleton and retard drainage enough to stop the water from dissipating the accumulated value of residual pore water pressure is significant particularly in shallow layers of soil nevertheless the soil is less susceptible to liquefaction in region ii due to an increase in the initial effective stress at the end of the consolidation phase since the rubble mound consists of gravel with large grain sizes the impact of waves hitting the breakwater was not enough to rearrange the gravel this is why there is no volumetric strain and build up of pore pressure in a rubble mound breakwater fig 13 shows the time series of pore water pressure vertical strains and shear stress at two locations near the structure as with those observed in field measurements and laboratory experiments the dynamic response of soil can be classified into two categories zen and yamazaki 1990 given by 51 p s p s p s where p s 1 t p s d t where t period of cyclic wave loading p s the oscillating component of pore water pressure p s which varies sinusoidally to the surface wave and current motions p s represents the period averaged value of each successive loading phase which gradually increases as the plastic volumetric contraction of soil occurs under cyclic shearing it is apparent that the period averaged residual pore water pressure is the key that drives seabed instability where the soil is located in front of the breakwater i e x 220 m z 18 m the residual pore water pressure could quickly increase to a stable level at t t 23 in this process the vertical cyclic strains increased moderately whereas the period averaged shear stress increased dramatically to 0 9 kpa at t t 14 and then dropped to a small value at t t 23 corresponding to a stable pore water pressure and an almost vanished mean value of shear stress the plastic strain developed quickly when t t 25 this indicates the soil loses its shear strength due to liquefaction when the residual pore water pressure builds up to the initial vertical effective stress because the pore pressure is unable to overcome the weight of soil overburden it stabilises after liquefaction occurrence despite the increasing loading cycles however the increasing vertical strain in the soil beneath the breakwater is less significant especially after a critical number of cycles i e t t 23 which means the soil takes longer to liquefy even though the incremental rate of pore water pressure is higher at a given number of loading cycles i e t t 35 at the end of computation the soil beneath the breakwater could still maintain a certain shear strength at τ x z 0 5 kpa fig 14 shows the vertical distribution of the relative difference of residual pore water pressure along various cross sections of the seabed foundation at t t 20 for currents varying in velocity from u 0 1 5 m s to u 0 1 5 m s here all the relative differences are normalised by p 0 which is the amplitude of dynamic wave pressure of the incident wave when u 0 0 m s in regions i and iii fig 14a b c g h the residual pore water pressure due to wave loading encountered by a following current was greater than those due to wave loading only but if an opposing current exists in the wave field the residual pore water pressure will be smaller than without a current the greater the current velocity the greater the difference relative to the condition when u 0 0 m s the effect that the magnitude and direction of current velocities have on the residual pore water pressure increases as the selected cross section approaches the shoreward side i e region iii of the structure for example at x 230 m region i the maximum relative difference of p s p 0 is approximately 25 which occurs when u 0 1 5 m s because the waves encountered by an opposing current differ more than cocurrent waves even if the current has the same velocity the trend in region iii is the opposite where the differences of p s p 0 are more apparent in cocurrent waves and can reach up to 120 when u 0 1 5 m s in region ii i e fig 14d e f the coexistence of wave and current yield a relative smaller residual pore water pressure in the upper seabed compared to the wave alone case regardless of the direction and magnitude of the current velocity where the maximum relative differences can reach up to 120 of p current p no current p 0 in the lower part of seabed where z h 0 6 in fig 14 d the relative difference has the same varying trend as those in regions i and ii since liquefaction is more likely to occur in shallow layers of soil ignoring the presence of a current may lead to overestimating the potential for liquefaction close to the structure 4 3 residual liquefaction the preceding predictions showed that a loosely deposited seabed foundation is susceptible to liquefaction due to wave and current loading basically the susceptibility of seabed soil to liquefaction is affected by the breakwater and the intensity of loading exerted onto the seabed both of which may vary according to wave and current conditions to quantify this possibility we used parameter l p proposed by ye et al 2015 which is determined as follows 52 l p σ z d σ z 0 σ z 0 0 where σ z d σ z σ z 0 is defined as the difference between initial vertical effective stress σ z 0 due to the weight of overburden and the vertical stress σ z in its current state which may decrease with the build up of residual pore water pressure eq 52 reveals that the higher the l p the more susceptible the seabed is to liquefaction fig 15 shows the variations in depths of the liquefaction potential at several locations and how they varied with time note here that the magnitude of l p at all the locations and loading phases gradually attenuate with depth because the upper soil layers with a lower overburden pressure are more susceptible to liquefaction as the number of loading cycles increase the potential of liquefaction l p within the soil gradually increases until it reaches a threshold value of l p 0 95 it remains at this value because the tensile stress state where σ z d σ z 0 i e l p 1 cannot occur in a sandy seabed zhu et al 2020 it is predicted that the soil on the seaward side of the breakwater is more susceptible to liquefaction than on the shoreward side and the potential of liquefaction at the antinode of the standing waves x 200 m is greater overall than those at the node x 220 m however the difference in l p between node and antinode during the latter stage of loading at say t t 30 becomes less significant because the liquefaction that took place at the antinode may cause the soil at the node to liquefy even though the initial vertical effective stress σ z 0 below the breakwater is relatively high the magnitude of l p can still rise to a considerable value after 30 successive loading cycles moreover the attenuation of l p with depth in this region is even less significant than those at x 220 m and x 300 m at selected loading phases i e t t 25 30 fig 16 shows the vertical distribution of normalised residual pore water pressure p p 0 against the normalised initial vertical effective stress σ z 0 p 0 along the depth the three lines of the graphs represent cases where waves encountered cocurrents or countercurrents moving at 1 5 m s whereas the three columns correspond to different locations at regions i ii and iii since the build up of residual pore water pressure cannot overcome the weight of overburden sumer 2014 the variations of depth in σ z 0 p 0 can also be called the liquefaction resistance line lrl note that the residual pore water pressure within the soil layers gradually increased with successive cycles until it coincided with the lrl where the soil became fully liquefied as expected and as reported by other researchers sassa et al 2001 sumer et al 2012 zhao et al 2020 liquefaction in loose sand is progressive it emerges at the mudline and then gradually advances downwards as the loading cycles increase like the preceding results with regards to the effect of current on the seabed soil particularly on the shoreward side of the breakwater i e x 300 m is more susceptible to liquefaction if there is a following current in the wave field fig 16a3 whereas the countercurrent wave tends to postpone the onset of liquefaction to some extent fig 16c3 compared to when u 0 0 m s fig 16b3 however there was no significant change in the depth of liquefaction on the seaward side of the structure after 30 loading cycles the liquefied soil was 0 62 h 0 52 h and 0 52 h deep at u 0 1 5 m s 0 m s and 1 5 m s respectively the residual pore pressure beneath the breakwater cannot touch the lrl but it stabilised in the upper layers of soil after 25 loading cycles see fig 16b2 c2 the increased rate of residual pore pressure can be overestimated if the ocean current is ignored in the wave field and in practice may lead to a conservative design stress path is another way to fundamentally understand the liquefaction characteristics of seabed soil within cycles of loading fig 17 shows the effective stress path and shear stress versus shear strain of seabed soil taken at two selected locations in the vicinity of the breakwater the soil located at x 200 m z 18 m collapses to flow liquefaction quickly within a few numbers of loading cycles it occurs in conjunction with a significant drop in the stress path with reduction in both p and deviator stress in this process the shear stress strain hysteresis loops gradually lean towards the horizontal axis which is indicative of the softening behaviour with regards to the degradation of soil stiffness the onset of liquefaction at x 200 m z 18 m is characterised by a rapid development of shear strains at low effective stress on the other hand where the soil is less susceptible to liquefaction due to the enlarged initial vertical effective stress at the end of consolidation phase i e x 257 m z 18 m the effective stress path gradually migrates to a lower stress state before it reaching the upper bound of a critical state line csl whereas the rate of increased shear strains associated with the soil degradation process is much smaller than those where the soil can become fully liquefied i e x 200 m z 18 m nevertheless the ultimate accumulated value of shear strain along the wave propagation direction can reach up to 1 2 it may significantly compromise the structure stability in the practice of engineering 4 4 parametric studies in the harsh oceanic environment the waves and properties of soil may vary at the selected site so the proposed model was used to examine the way the waves and soil parameters can affect the liquefaction susceptibility of loose sand deposits in this section only the vertical distribution of build up of pore water at a typical point in front of the breakwater x 230 m is examined fig 18 shows the accumulated residual pore water pressure after 25 successive loading cycles under different wave heights and wave periods a loose sandy seabed is more susceptible to liquefaction and at a deeper depth l d e p t h in large waves with longer periods moreover the wave period has a greater effect on the evolution of l d e p t h than the wave height for example an increase in the wave height h from 3 m to 4 m about 33 increase could increase the l d e p t h by 100 from 0 06 h to 0 12 h after 25 loading cycles whereas the l d e p t h can be two times larger than its original value i e from 0 12 h to 0 48 h with a 25 increase in the wave period i e from 8 s to 10 s fig 19 shows the vertical distribution of residual pore water pressure at t t 25 for various soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity permeability and the degree of saturation moreover the vulnerability of seabed to liquefaction increases as the degree of saturation decreases because the encapsulated air in the foundation soils makes it more difficult for the pore pressure to build up under dynamic wave and current loading this study revealed an approximate 40 reduction in the depth of liquefied soil i e from 0 52 h to 0 32 h after 25 loading cycles when 5 of the pore water was replaced with air in a fully saturated seabed moreover liquefaction and its associated hazards can be mitigated if a rational method can be used to improve the drainage of loose sand deposits for example the depth of liquefied soil was 0 48 h in a seabed with poor drainage conditions i e k s 10 5 m s but there was no liquefaction when the drainage conditions improved i e k s 10 2 m s 5 conclusions based on a well established integrated framework and a generalized plasticity model pziii this study numerically investigated the dynamic performance of a rubble mound low crested structure constructed over a loosely deposited seabed foundation due to combined waves and currents the following conclusions were drawn 1 the rubble mound low crested structure progressively subsides due to successive loads from waves and currents regardless of changes in the magnitude and direction of the current velocities the breakwater always subside more on the seaward side than on the shoreward side this asymmetric behaviour is enhanced by the presence of countercurrents in the wave field whereas it is diminished when there is a following current 2 where the location is susceptible to liquefaction due to fluid seabed structure interactions there was a significant drop in the stress path due to the build up of residual pore water pressure with successive cycles this was accompanied by a considerable degradation of stiffness as the soil became softer the onset of liquefaction is indicated by a stabilised residual pore water pressure and a sharp increase in the vertical plastic strains ε z and shear strains γ x z at a very low stress state 3 at a given number of loading cycles the increased rate and ultimate value of residual pore water pressure is greater underneath the breakwater region ii than in the far field region i and iii however the onset of liquefaction was postponed in region ii because the residual pore water pressure stabilised before it coincided with the lrl there was also no remarkable change in the developed rate of plastic strain nevertheless the potential for liquefaction in region ii could still rise to a large value of l p 0 95 with a diminished rate of attenuation within the soil layers after a certain number of loading cycles 4 the soil on the seaward side of the breakwater was more susceptible to liquefaction but less likely to be affected by any currents whereas on the shoreward side the soil was less susceptible to liquefaction but the currents affected the way the seabed responded underneath the breakwater particularly in shallow layers of soil less residual pore pressure accumulated in waves coexists with currents regardless of the magnitude and direction than in the wave alone case the maximum difference between cases with and without currents can be up to 120 of p c u r r e n t p n o c u r r e n t p 0 at t t 25 in this region 5 the parametric studies showed that liquefaction due to the build up of residual pore water pressure is more likely to occur in soil with a high water content and where the drainage is impeded soil is more vulnerable to liquefaction when subjected to large waves with longer periods credit authorship contribution statement h y zhao conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis writing original draft j f zhu methodology validation writing

21571,low crested structures such as submerged rubble mound breakwaters rmb are commonly used as successful examples of coastal protection measures this study addresses foundation issues related to the performance of a submerged rmb constructed on a liquefiable site where the foundation soils have been loosely deposited these issues were investigated using an integrated numerical model proposed by zhao et al 2018 unlike previous work in zhao et al 2018 the dynamic features of loose sand deposits i e build up of pore water pressures development of plastic strains degradation of soil stiffness due to the fluid seabed structure interactions accompanied by the onset of liquefaction were simulated the reliability of this model to predict the liquefaction susceptibility of loose sand deposits was validated against the experimental results available in literature this study shows that the submerged rmb constructed on a liquefiable seabed experienced progressive and asymmetric downward settlement under successive loading cycles the opposing currents in the wave field tended to enhance this asymmetric settlement whereas the following currents did the opposite regardless of changes to the magnitude and direction of current velocities ignoring the currents in the wave field may lead to an overestimation of the increased rate of residual pore water pressures in the region underneath the breakwater particularly in shallow soil layers where the maximum relative differences can reach up to 120 of p current p no current p 0 at t t 25 keywords fluid seabed structure interactions fssi loose sand deposits generalized plasticity model pziii progressive liquefaction 1 introduction breakwaters are popular and widely constructed offshore elements that are used as ports that eliminate the negative impact of ocean waves on the landscape and thus enhance the utility of coastlines unlike traditional breakwaters a submerged breakwater consisting of rubble stones is considered to be more ecologically friendly and therefore more popular due to their environmental implications existing studies have focused on the local hydrodynamic process i e breaking waves and the resulting currents around these structures zanuttigh and lamberti 2006 johnson et al 2005 and the process whereby sediment transportation i e erosion and scour may lead to failure due to the structure overturning and sliding zanuttigh 2007 young and testik 2009 zhang et al 2017 apart from the hydrodynamic aspect the instability of marine structures can be also attributed to seabed liquefaction a process marked by a rapid and considerable loss of strength in loose and saturated deposits subjected to cyclic loading de groot et al 1991 sumer 2014 the onset of liquefaction may compromise the stability and longevity of marine infrastructures and even result in their total collapse in as little as several years after installation oumeraci 1994 the newly deposited quaternary seabed is typical type of the loose marine sediments that are widely distributed throughout the world s coastal areas the nigerian coast for example is one of the most densely populated coastal areas in africa and consists of quaternary sand silts and clay that are almost 759 km long iliya et al 2017 the mechanical behaviour of loose saturated soil has already been investigated in previous field and laboratory tests using the standard penetration test spt and monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests the results show that loose sand exhibits contractive and strain softening behaviour as a result of transient or repeated disturbance which reduces the shearing resistance or enhances the development of excessive strain due to the build up of pore water pressure and subsequent reduction in the mean normal effective stress seed and rahman 1978 ishihara and yamazaki 1984 ishihara 1993 loose sand deposits are therefore not normally suitable as foundations for marine structures due to their poor mechanical properties and high vulnerability to liquefaction when subjected to repetitive loads in a harsh oceanic environment despite these disadvantages coastal and geotechnical engineers must still cope with loose sandy seabed as foundations for breakwaters if there are no other choices i e nigerian coastal regions understanding the liquefaction characteristics of loose sand deposits plays a vital role in mitigating the associated hazards enhancing the longevity of marine structures during their service life the performance of marine structures constructed on liquefiable sites can be reproduced using a prototype numerical analysis based on the computational technology of fluid seabed structure interactions fssi existing research related to fssi can be classified into two main categories depending on the coupling approach between the fluid and the soil structural domains i uncoupled models and ii partially coupled models most available fssi models tend to conform to the first category and focus on numerical modelling of soil structure interaction under wave loads that is computed analytically or empirically jeng 2003a ulker et al 2010 2018 due to the limitations of potential flow theory the effects of structure on the flow field such as viscosity and breaking waves particularly on the seabed foundation cannot be reproduced very well using uncoupled models more advanced works are often semi coupled so the hydrodynamic models and soil structural interaction models are developed separately and then integrated through a one way coupling process by applying advanced computational fluid dynamics cfd models lin and liu 1998 hsu et al 2002 higuera et al 2013 into these integrated frameworks the insights of fssi can be enhanced this includes the effect of seepage flow due to the generation of excess pore water pressure on the incipient motion of sediment around a spanning pipeline guo et al 2019 li et al 2019 the three dimensional response of soil around the breakwater heads or mono pile foundation due to the diffraction and reflection of water waves zhao et al 2013 2017 liao et al 2018 the impact of breaking waves on caissons and the subsequent dynamics of the seabed foundation as the structure rocks backwards and forwards ye et al 2014 elsafti and oumeraci 2017 regardless of the coupling approach these researches for fssi mainly assumed that seabed soil is a poro elastic material that cannot attain any permanent deformation so to reproduce the nonlinear and irreversible behaviour of loose sand more realistically an advanced constitutive model that will follow the stress strain path during cyclic loading is needed one early implementation of elastoplastic modelling for fluid seabed structure interaction can be found in jeng and ou 2010 this model was based on a semi analytical approach in which the breakwater was simplified as an impermeable line in order to consider the transformations of wave tip whereas the response of the seabed in relation to the weight of the structure was neglected ye et al 2015 numerically investigated features of residual soil deformation and liquefaction around a caisson type breakwater under cyclic waves by utilising the generalised plasticity model pziii pastor et al 1990 via fssi cas 2d their predicted results indicated progressive liquefaction corresponding to the long term performance of a seabed foundation undergoing elastoplastic deformation as the accumulated residual pore water pressure overcomes the overburdened weight of soil elsafti and oumeraci 2016 recently developed a finite volume model for fluid seabed structure interaction around monolithic breakwaters based on the open source code openfoam in which a multi surface plasticity model based on an extended drucker prager failure criterion was used to consider the material behaviour of the seabed soil a frictional contact model was also introduced for the soil structure interaction and the separation reattachment and sliding of the soil structure interface their results showed that the rocking motion of the structure due to the impact of breaking waves is more likely to lead to seabed instability than waves breaking on the surface in practice a submerged breakwater is usually constructed close to the shoreline in shallow water where currents are basically triggered by breaking waves lamberti et al 2005 however most of the existing research for fssi considered wave conditions without currents but in reality the existence of waves and currents may further complicate the flow structure and subsequent deformation of the foundation which may compromise the stability of the structure due to liquefaction qi and gao 2014 qi et al 2019 in a recent publication zhao et al 2018 developed a one way coupling model for the response of soil due to waves and currents around a submerged rmb by assuming that the seabed soil was deformed within the elastic approach during momentary liquefaction this present study can be seen as a follow up where we improved the model to consider the long term performance of a breakwater constructed on deposits of loose sand while undergoing elastoplastic deformation this model was then used to investigate the problems caused by the poor mechanical properties of loose sand particularly its susceptibility to liquefaction due to wave and current loading how the currents in the wave field affect the build up of residual pore water pressure cumulative breakwater settlement and potential for liquefaction etc were also discussed and compared to previous studies that were limited to wave alone case parametric studies were also carried out to extend the applicability of the model to various conditions in the candidate site 2 description of the numerical model the integrated numerical model contains two separate sub models which are semi coupled through a one way coupling algorithm developed by zhao et al 2018 a description of each model will be introduced in this section 2 1 hydrodynamic model 2 1 1 varans equations the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations varans include the continuity eq 1 and mass conservation equations eq 2 they can be expressed as follows jesus et al 2012 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j 1 n ρ u i u j n p f x i n g j x j ρ x i x j μ e f f u i x j c t where u i extended averaged or darcy velocity n porosity of porous medium p pseudo dynamic pressure μ e f f μ μ t is the efficient dynamic viscosity while considering the molecular dynamic viscosity μ and the effects of turbulence μ t is the so called eddy viscosity given by the selected turbulence model the last component in eq 2 represents the resistance of the porous media and can be expressed as 3 c t a u i b u u i 0 34 u i t in this study the friction coefficient is calculated according to engelund 1953 the formulae applied in burcharth and andersen 1995 and therefore 4 a α 1 n 3 n 2 μ d 50 2 5 b β 1 7 5 k c

computational fluid dynamics toolbox openfoam where a model called interfoam was used to solve the rans equations based on finite volume discretisation and the fractional two step projection method the volume of fluid vof method berberovic et al 2009 was used to track the free surface evolution since the vof method can track the position of each phase of the flow it is also a base for the multiphase capabilities of the interfoam solver where all the fluid properties needed to solve equations at each cell are described by the fraction α i occupied by the vof of the i th material in the cell where there is current in the wave field a uniform current velocity u c is considered for the inlet boundary condition fig 1 so the model for generating waves is switched on after the current becomes stable the incident flow velocity u w of the corresponding stokes wave is superimposed onto a stable ocean current based on the wave parameters given at the inlet boundary the incident flow velocity u w of the corresponding stokes wave is superimposed onto a stable ocean current based on the wave parameters given at the inlet boundary an active wave absorption 12 is used for the outlet boundary to eliminate wave reflection at the end of the computational domain so that the velocity of the outlet boundary u w can be determined by the incoming water surface elevation η as u w g h η furthermore the velocity profile u c equal to the inlet boundary is superimposed at the end of the domain to ensure the water is free to run out the pressure conditions at the inlet and outlet boundary are set at a zero gradient more details about the generation and absorption of water waves and ocean currents can be found in higuera et al 2013 2 2 geotechnical model 2 2 1 biot s partially dynamic equations saturated marine sediments are known as a multi phase medium that consists of a soil skeleton and pore fluid mostly water and some encapsulated air for the dynamic analysis of fluid seabed structure interaction considered in this study an appropriate estimation of solid pore fluid interactions in a porous medium is of great importance jeng 2003b this can be achieved using biot s theory because it can include the momentum balances between two phases and the mass conservation of pore water during flow by assuming that flow inside a porous medium obeys darcy s law the loading efficiency is generally caused by relatively low waves unlike those induced by high speed moving trains or earthquakes this enables biot s partially dynamic equations ulker and rahman 2009 chen et al 2020 to be applied because the relative displacement of pore fluid to soil particles is ignored but the inertia forces due to the acceleration of pore water and soil particles are considered 12 σ x x

where u and p are vectors for nodal displacement and pore water pressure respectively k and h are the stiffness matrices of the solid and fluid phases respectively c and s are the damping matrices of the coupled system and the fluid phase m and g are the mass matrices of the solid and fluid phases also in the matrices b p and b u are the strain displacement matrices associated with the pressure and displacement fields respectively and same is the case for the n p and n u shape function matrices for each field the time integration scheme we adopted in obtaining the numerical results at each time step is the implicit newmark method which was originally proposed by newmark 1959 and later extended by zienkiewicz and taylor 1989 thus at time step n 1 with an increment δ t we have the following for the acceleration velocity displacement rate of change in pore water pressure and pore water pressure itself respectively 23 u n 1 u n δ u n 24 u n 1 u n u n δ t β 1 δ u n δ t 25 u n 1 u

taking the values determined at the n th time step as the initial conditions once the incremental acceleration δ u n and the incremental rate of pore water pressure change δ p n have been determined the soil displacement and the pore water pressure can be obtained by applying 25 and 27 2 2 3 soil constitutive model pastor zienkiewicz mark iii model the effective stress and strain increments are expressed using an elastoplastic constitutive law 32 d σ d b d u d ε 0 where d σ d u and d ε 0 are the incremental values of effective stresses displacement and residual strains and d is the material matrix related to the constitutive model in this present study the pastor zienkiewicz mark iii pastor et al 1990 was used to analyse deposits of loose sand due to wave and current loading where the elastoplastic matrix d can be expressed in the following tensor form 33 d i j k l d i j k l e d i j m n e m m n n s t d s t k l e h l u n s t d s t k l e m k l where d i j k l e is the fourth order tangent elastic stiffness h l u is the plastic modulus in the loading or unloading stage m m n is the tensor form of plastic flow direction and n s t is the loading or unloading direction tensor in a generalized plasticity approach such as pastor et al 1990 the loading direction and plastic flow direction vectors can be fully described without reference to any yield surface or plastic potential because the gradients themselves are functions i e 34 m m n g σ m m g σ and n s t f σ s t f σ where g σ and f σ represent the normalisation of the tensor g σ i j and f σ i j respectively f and g are the yield surface function and plastic potential surface function in stress space and by using the dilatancy relationship given by balasubramaniam and chaudhry 1978 they can be determined as follows 35 g q m g p 1 1 α g 1 p p g α g 36 f q m f p 1 1 α f 1 p p c α f where m g is the slope of phase transformation line α g α f and m f are constants that determine the size of the loading surface and p g and p c are the size parameters p and q representing the mean normal effective stress and generalized shear stress can be determined as 37 p 1 3 σ x σ y σ z 38 q 1 2 σ x σ y 2 σ x σ z 2 σ y σ z 2 6

p p 0 λ 3 k μ s 1 μ s k k e v 0 p p 0 where g is the shear modulus that may vary according to the mean effective stress so that the softening behaviour of the soil can be considered g 0 and p 0 are the initial value of the shear modulus and mean effective stress before shearing δ is the kronecker delta λ is lame s constant and k is the bulk modulus of the soil the initial value is k e v 0 the dynamic analysis requires the integration of eq 32 to determine the change in stress at each time step as the solution proceeds when doing this the adopted generalized plasticity model means that i no scalar yield function is involved and consistency conditions need not be fulfilled ii the stress point does not have to be brought back to the yield surface and the tangent moduli are easily established therefore convergence at the material point level can easily be achieved if the size of strain increment can be rationally controlled in this study an alternative one step explicit algorithm that uses the strain subdivision technique is used for a given strain increment δ ε at a stress state σ n and an internal stress variable k n the two increments based on the initial tangential d and the final d matrix can be calculated as follows 43 δ σ 1 d σ n k n δ ε 44 δ σ 2 d σ n δ σ 1 k n δ k δ ε where δ k k σ δ σ 1 then the number of subdivision ndiv is determined by the following equation 45 ndiv integer min δ σ 1 δ σ 2 2 c min δ σ 1 δ σ 2 where c is a tolerance specified by the user and it is usually taken from 0 02 to 0 05 as suggested by chan 1988 δ σ denotes the euclidean norm of δ σ and it is defined as 46 δ σ δ σ t δ σ 1 2 then the strain is subdivided δ ε sub δ ε ndiv and the stresses are incremented using the initial tangential d with the initial state defined as 47 σ 0 n σ n k 0 n k n during the i th increment the convergence at the material point level is achieved if 48 δ σ i 1 n δ σ i n δ σ i 1 n δ σ i n γ c where γ is a user defined parameter which is recommended to be 2 chan 1988 otherwise a warning is given or change the step until the material point convergence is achieved the constitutive model requires 13 parameters m f m g h 0 h u 0

that the values for nevada sand were determined by zienkiewicz et al 1998 from the isotropically consolidated undrained tests at a confining pressure of 40 kpa a flow chart describing the strain subdivision technique is shown in fig 2 2 3 numerical simulation since the elastic modulus of the pziii model depends on the magnitude of the mean confining stress zienkiewicz et al 1998 a consolidation analysis was carried out to apply gravitational forces due to the weight of the soil and the structure before cyclic excitation with the stress state to be obtained at the end of consolidation phase as initial conditions the dynamic analysis can be activated using a nonlinear solution algorithm as shown in the flow chart fig 3 3 verifications the hydrodynamic model has been validated by zhao et al 2018 by comparing it with laboratory tests for propagating waves with a following current over a rigid bottom and wave and current interactions with a submerged breakwater the results fit the experimental data well with regards to the velocity profile and water surface elevations and therefore only the geotechnical model is validated in this section 3 1 comparison with ulker et al 2009 s analytical approximations the geotechnical model was first validated against analytical approximations ulker et al 2009 by applying a coupled solid pore fluid dynamic framework to dynamic wave loading in poro elastic material the following parameters g 5 2 10 7 n m 2 k s 2 10 3 m s n 0 333 μ 0 35 s r 1 were used for this model validation the analytical solution based on potential flow theory was used to determine the sinusoidal pressure exerted on the seabed surface due to a linear progressive wave i e 49 p z h 1 x t p 0 cos 2 π x l w 2 π t t where p 0 γ w h 2 cosh 2 π l w d where l w is the wave length h is the wave height p 0 is the amplitude of dynamic wave pressure of the incident wave fig 4 shows the normalisation of maximum pore water pressure vertical effective stress and shear stress over wave period for a seabed with varying thickness note that the numerical predictions fit the analytical approximations very well which indicates that the coupled solid pore fluid dynamic framework is well established in the developed model 3 2 comparison with castro 1969 s undrained triaxial test under monotonic and cyclic loadings castro 1969 carried out a series of undrained triaxial tests to investigate the mechanical behaviour of banding sand under monotonic and cyclic loadings but prior to testing the specimens were isotopically consolidated to the desired confining stress state fig 5 shows the results obtained by castro 1969 they include the stress path the deviatoric stress versus shear strain and the development of pore water pressure together with the model predictions these predicted results agree fairly well with the experimental data with the loose samples i e d r 29 and 44 the deviator stress q σ 1 σ 3 mobilised quickly to a peak value at a small shear strain and then it collapsed to flow rapidly to large strains accompanied by a significant increase in the pore water pressure and a reduction in the mean effective confining stress the transition from strain softening to strain hardening can be observed in fig 5 b as the relative density d r changed from 29 to 66 with the tested specimen that began in a medium dense state i e d r 66 the stress path moved towards the failure envelope associated with an increase in the shear strength but the pore water pressure and shear strain developed slowly after ε a 1 2 fig 6 shows the effective stress path and deviator stress versus axial strains in the specimen tested at d r 27 under cyclic loading the stress path gradually moved to the left with a reduced mean effective stress before its sudden drop indicated the specimen had failed as with the monotonic loading test the specimen subjected to cyclic loading also exhibited strain softening after q reached its peak value this was followed by a sudden loss of shear strength and a rapid development of axial strain all the aforementioned features can be captured by the model predictions which means the pziii model can reproduce the strength and deformation of loose sand 3 3 comparison with sassa and sekiguchi 2001 s geotechnical centrifugal wave tests the constitutive framework was then incorporated into the finite element model to reproduce sassa and sekiguchi 1999 s centrifuge wave testing for the liquefaction susceptibility of loose sand due to cyclic wave loads the tests were carried out in a balanced beam centrifuge under a centrifugal acceleration of 50 g in this test the water for pore fluid or fluid over the surface was replaced with a viscous silicone of 50 cst to match the time scaling laws of consolidation and wave propagation the granular soil used in the test was leighton buzzard sand british standard sieve 100 170 this experiment was an attempt to simulate a prototype layer of soil 10 m 5 m with a relative density of d r 40 the experimental case p5 1 was used to verify the model in which the wave and soil characteristics are as follows the wave period was t 4 55 s the fluid depth was d 4 5 m the wave height was h 1 7 m permeability coefficient was k s 1 5 10 4 m s and the degree of saturation was s r 100 fig 7 shows the pore water pressure at four different locations along the centreline of the computational domain the analytical solution was again used to determine the dynamic wave pressure exerted on the seabed i e z h 0 where the pore water pressure can freely drain out this is why there was no residual component at this location note that the incremental rate and ultimate value of pore water pressure were greater at deeper locations because the overburden pressure is quite high this means that a larger build up of pore water pressure is needed to liquefy the soil although there were some differences as the pore water pressure developed the maximum value can still be captured this is needed for practical engineering design to predict the onset of liquefaction sumer 2014 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 ye et al 2015 4 results and discussion the constitutive model and coupled solid fluid dynamic framework was incorporated into the integrated numerical model developed by zhao et al 2018 and then used to investigate the fluid seabed structure interactions around a submerged rubble mound breakwater the computational domain is the same as those considered in zhao et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 where a rubble mound low crested structure 284 m long by 20 m wide with an 18 m wide crest was constructed on a sandy seabed foundation in this simulation nevada sand zienkiewicz et al 1998 with a relative density of d r 40 was used to analyse deposits of loose sand whose material properties were determined by zienkiewicz et al 1998 and are listed in table 1 the wave characteristics the properties of the seabed foundation and breakwater are listed in table 2 unless specified in the parametric studies 4 1 dynamic characteristics of a submerged breakwater fig 9 shows snapshots of breakwater settlement at three loading phases here the current moved at 1 5 m s and in the same direction as wave propagation it was predicted that the breakwater would subside downwards under successive loading cycles as the loose sand experienced nonlinear and irrecoverable plastic deformation due to cyclic shearing ishihara and yoshimine 1992 since the breakwater subsided asymmetrically due to hydrodynamic loading settlement on the seaward side was greater than on the shoreward side this phenomenon could further trigger an irreversible and progressive sliding failure that could eventually lead to its total collapse oumeraci 1994 liu et al 2019 fig 10 shows the distributions of vertical displacement along the bottom of the rubble mound at t t 25 where the current velocities varied from u 0 1 5 m s to u 0 1 5 m s note that the initial settlement due to the construction of the breakwater was not considered overall the breakwater would suffer less downward settlement if there was a following current in the wave field unlike when u 0 0 m s i e wave alone case however an opposing current does the opposite despite having less effect on the evolution of breakwater settlement taking the waves encountered by a following current at u 0 1 5 m s as a typical example downward settlement peaked at x 250 5 m which is around 100 mm it would then increase to w m a x 121 mm approximately 20 relative difference at x 252 mm if there was no current in the wave field i e u 0 0 m s on the other hand with the same current velocity in the opposite direction i e u 0 1 5 m s the maximum accumulated downward settlement could only increase by approximately 4 i e from 121 mm to 126 5 mm moreover the current velocities would also be less significant fig 10 shows that settlement at the seaward side of the breakwater is always greater than on the shoreward side regardless of how the magnitude and direction of current velocities are changed to quantify how the current will affect the asymmetric settlement of the breakwater the parameter δ which is defined as the ratio between two different areas under the curve as shown in fig 11 a which are differentiated by the line crossing the centreline of the breakwater is introduced as follows 50 δ a r e a i a r e a i i x l x m x d x x m x r x d x where area i and area ii are obtained by taking the sum of a series of small rectangles defined by f i x δ x where f i is the accumulated downward settlement at each position fig 11 b shows the variations of δ where the current velocities varied from u 0 1 5 m s to u 0 1 5 m s at three loading phases where t t 15 20 30 note that δ increases in countercurrent waves and decreases in cocurrent waves in comparison with those of wave alone case u 0 0 m s the greater the current velocity the greater its effect on the asymmetric settlement of the breakwater moreover the gradient of asymmetric coefficient δ versus current velocity u 0 gradually becomes steeper with successive loading cycles where t t 30 the maximum δ occurred at u 0 1 5 m s and it could reach 1 9 whereas δ was only 1 1 when u 0 1 5 m s 4 2 dynamic characteristics of a loosely deposited seabed foundation fig 12 shows snapshots of the pore water pressure and the effective stress and shear stress in the rubble mound and foundation soil at two loading phases where t t 10 and t t 20 respectively based on these results three regions in the seabed were identified regions i and iii are on the seaward and shoreward side of the breakwater where the seabed is directly under the influence of surface water motions in region ii which is close to and underneath the breakwater these dynamics are induced as water flows through the layers of rubble to the seabed foundation and those associated with gravity as the breakwater was being constructed the pore water in all three regions gradually builds up with successive loading cycles while the mean normal effective stress and shear stress gradually decrease the increased rate of pore water pressure is more apparent in region i particularly at the antinode of the standing waves formed due to wave wave interactions than in region iii in region ii where the breakwater may increase the volumetric contraction of the soil skeleton and retard drainage enough to stop the water from dissipating the accumulated value of residual pore water pressure is significant particularly in shallow layers of soil nevertheless the soil is less susceptible to liquefaction in region ii due to an increase in the initial effective stress at the end of the consolidation phase since the rubble mound consists of gravel with large grain sizes the impact of waves hitting the breakwater was not enough to rearrange the gravel this is why there is no volumetric strain and build up of pore pressure in a rubble mound breakwater fig 13 shows the time series of pore water pressure vertical strains and shear stress at two locations near the structure as with those observed in field measurements and laboratory experiments the dynamic response of soil can be classified into two categories zen and yamazaki 1990 given by 51 p s p s p s where p s 1 t p s d t where t period of cyclic wave loading p s the oscillating component of pore water pressure p s which varies sinusoidally to the surface wave and current motions p s represents the period averaged value of each successive loading phase which gradually increases as the plastic volumetric contraction of soil occurs under cyclic shearing it is apparent that the period averaged residual pore water pressure is the key that drives seabed instability where the soil is located in front of the breakwater i e x 220 m z 18 m the residual pore water pressure could quickly increase to a stable level at t t 23 in this process the vertical cyclic strains increased moderately whereas the period averaged shear stress increased dramatically to 0 9 kpa at t t 14 and then dropped to a small value at t t 23 corresponding to a stable pore water pressure and an almost vanished mean value of shear stress the plastic strain developed quickly when t t 25 this indicates the soil loses its shear strength due to liquefaction when the residual pore water pressure builds up to the initial vertical effective stress because the pore pressure is unable to overcome the weight of soil overburden it stabilises after liquefaction occurrence despite the increasing loading cycles however the increasing vertical strain in the soil beneath the breakwater is less significant especially after a critical number of cycles i e t t 23 which means the soil takes longer to liquefy even though the incremental rate of pore water pressure is higher at a given number of loading cycles i e t t 35 at the end of computation the soil beneath the breakwater could still maintain a certain shear strength at τ x z 0 5 kpa fig 14 shows the vertical distribution of the relative difference of residual pore water pressure along various cross sections of the seabed foundation at t t 20 for currents varying in velocity from u 0 1 5 m s to u 0 1 5 m s here all the relative differences are normalised by p 0 which is the amplitude of dynamic wave pressure of the incident wave when u 0 0 m s in regions i and iii fig 14a b c g h the residual pore water pressure due to wave loading encountered by a following current was greater than those due to wave loading only but if an opposing current exists in the wave field the residual pore water pressure will be smaller than without a current the greater the current velocity the greater the difference relative to the condition when u 0 0 m s the effect that the magnitude and direction of current velocities have on the residual pore water pressure increases as the selected cross section approaches the shoreward side i e region iii of the structure for example at x 230 m region i the maximum relative difference of p s p 0 is approximately 25 which occurs when u 0 1 5 m s because the waves encountered by an opposing current differ more than cocurrent waves even if the current has the same velocity the trend in region iii is the opposite where the differences of p s p 0 are more apparent in cocurrent waves and can reach up to 120 when u 0 1 5 m s in region ii i e fig 14d e f the coexistence of wave and current yield a relative smaller residual pore water pressure in the upper seabed compared to the wave alone case regardless of the direction and magnitude of the current velocity where the maximum relative differences can reach up to 120 of p current p no current p 0 in the lower part of seabed where z h 0 6 in fig 14 d the relative difference has the same varying trend as those in regions i and ii since liquefaction is more likely to occur in shallow layers of soil ignoring the presence of a current may lead to overestimating the potential for liquefaction close to the structure 4 3 residual liquefaction the preceding predictions showed that a loosely deposited seabed foundation is susceptible to liquefaction due to wave and current loading basically the susceptibility of seabed soil to liquefaction is affected by the breakwater and the intensity of loading exerted onto the seabed both of which may vary according to wave and current conditions to quantify this possibility we used parameter l p proposed by ye et al 2015 which is determined as follows 52 l p σ z d σ z 0 σ z 0 0 where σ z d σ z σ z 0 is defined as the difference between initial vertical effective stress σ z 0 due to the weight of overburden and the vertical stress σ z in its current state which may decrease with the build up of residual pore water pressure eq 52 reveals that the higher the l p the more susceptible the seabed is to liquefaction fig 15 shows the variations in depths of the liquefaction potential at several locations and how they varied with time note here that the magnitude of l p at all the locations and loading phases gradually attenuate with depth because the upper soil layers with a lower overburden pressure are more susceptible to liquefaction as the number of loading cycles increase the potential of liquefaction l p within the soil gradually increases until it reaches a threshold value of l p 0 95 it remains at this value because the tensile stress state where σ z d σ z 0 i e l p 1 cannot occur in a sandy seabed zhu et al 2020 it is predicted that the soil on the seaward side of the breakwater is more susceptible to liquefaction than on the shoreward side and the potential of liquefaction at the antinode of the standing waves x 200 m is greater overall than those at the node x 220 m however the difference in l p between node and antinode during the latter stage of loading at say t t 30 becomes less significant because the liquefaction that took place at the antinode may cause the soil at the node to liquefy even though the initial vertical effective stress σ z 0 below the breakwater is relatively high the magnitude of l p can still rise to a considerable value after 30 successive loading cycles moreover the attenuation of l p with depth in this region is even less significant than those at x 220 m and x 300 m at selected loading phases i e t t 25 30 fig 16 shows the vertical distribution of normalised residual pore water pressure p p 0 against the normalised initial vertical effective stress σ z 0 p 0 along the depth the three lines of the graphs represent cases where waves encountered cocurrents or countercurrents moving at 1 5 m s whereas the three columns correspond to different locations at regions i ii and iii since the build up of residual pore water pressure cannot overcome the weight of overburden sumer 2014 the variations of depth in σ z 0 p 0 can also be called the liquefaction resistance line lrl note that the residual pore water pressure within the soil layers gradually increased with successive cycles until it coincided with the lrl where the soil became fully liquefied as expected and as reported by other researchers sassa et al 2001 sumer et al 2012 zhao et al 2020 liquefaction in loose sand is progressive it emerges at the mudline and then gradually advances downwards as the loading cycles increase like the preceding results with regards to the effect of current on the seabed soil particularly on the shoreward side of the breakwater i e x 300 m is more susceptible to liquefaction if there is a following current in the wave field fig 16a3 whereas the countercurrent wave tends to postpone the onset of liquefaction to some extent fig 16c3 compared to when u 0 0 m s fig 16b3 however there was no significant change in the depth of liquefaction on the seaward side of the structure after 30 loading cycles the liquefied soil was 0 62 h 0 52 h and 0 52 h deep at u 0 1 5 m s 0 m s and 1 5 m s respectively the residual pore pressure beneath the breakwater cannot touch the lrl but it stabilised in the upper layers of soil after 25 loading cycles see fig 16b2 c2 the increased rate of residual pore pressure can be overestimated if the ocean current is ignored in the wave field and in practice may lead to a conservative design stress path is another way to fundamentally understand the liquefaction characteristics of seabed soil within cycles of loading fig 17 shows the effective stress path and shear stress versus shear strain of seabed soil taken at two selected locations in the vicinity of the breakwater the soil located at x 200 m z 18 m collapses to flow liquefaction quickly within a few numbers of loading cycles it occurs in conjunction with a significant drop in the stress path with reduction in both p and deviator stress in this process the shear stress strain hysteresis loops gradually lean towards the horizontal axis which is indicative of the softening behaviour with regards to the degradation of soil stiffness the onset of liquefaction at x 200 m z 18 m is characterised by a rapid development of shear strains at low effective stress on the other hand where the soil is less susceptible to liquefaction due to the enlarged initial vertical effective stress at the end of consolidation phase i e x 257 m z 18 m the effective stress path gradually migrates to a lower stress state before it reaching the upper bound of a critical state line csl whereas the rate of increased shear strains associated with the soil degradation process is much smaller than those where the soil can become fully liquefied i e x 200 m z 18 m nevertheless the ultimate accumulated value of shear strain along the wave propagation direction can reach up to 1 2 it may significantly compromise the structure stability in the practice of engineering 4 4 parametric studies in the harsh oceanic environment the waves and properties of soil may vary at the selected site so the proposed model was used to examine the way the waves and soil parameters can affect the liquefaction susceptibility of loose sand deposits in this section only the vertical distribution of build up of pore water at a typical point in front of the breakwater x 230 m is examined fig 18 shows the accumulated residual pore water pressure after 25 successive loading cycles under different wave heights and wave periods a loose sandy seabed is more susceptible to liquefaction and at a deeper depth l d e p t h in large waves with longer periods moreover the wave period has a greater effect on the evolution of l d e p t h than the wave height for example an increase in the wave height h from 3 m to 4 m about 33 increase could increase the l d e p t h by 100 from 0 06 h to 0 12 h after 25 loading cycles whereas the l d e p t h can be two times larger than its original value i e from 0 12 h to 0 48 h with a 25 increase in the wave period i e from 8 s to 10 s fig 19 shows the vertical distribution of residual pore water pressure at t t 25 for various soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity permeability and the degree of saturation moreover the vulnerability of seabed to liquefaction increases as the degree of saturation decreases because the encapsulated air in the foundation soils makes it more difficult for the pore pressure to build up under dynamic wave and current loading this study revealed an approximate 40 reduction in the depth of liquefied soil i e from 0 52 h to 0 32 h after 25 loading cycles when 5 of the pore water was replaced with air in a fully saturated seabed moreover liquefaction and its associated hazards can be mitigated if a rational method can be used to improve the drainage of loose sand deposits for example the depth of liquefied soil was 0 48 h in a seabed with poor drainage conditions i e k s 10 5 m s but there was no liquefaction when the drainage conditions improved i e k s 10 2 m s 5 conclusions based on a well established integrated framework and a generalized plasticity model pziii this study numerically investigated the dynamic performance of a rubble mound low crested structure constructed over a loosely deposited seabed foundation due to combined waves and currents the following conclusions were drawn 1 the rubble mound low crested structure progressively subsides due to successive loads from waves and currents regardless of changes in the magnitude and direction of the current velocities the breakwater always subside more on the seaward side than on the shoreward side this asymmetric behaviour is enhanced by the presence of countercurrents in the wave field whereas it is diminished when there is a following current 2 where the location is susceptible to liquefaction due to fluid seabed structure interactions there was a significant drop in the stress path due to the build up of residual pore water pressure with successive cycles this was accompanied by a considerable degradation of stiffness as the soil became softer the onset of liquefaction is indicated by a stabilised residual pore water pressure and a sharp increase in the vertical plastic strains ε z and shear strains γ x z at a very low stress state 3 at a given number of loading cycles the increased rate and ultimate value of residual pore water pressure is greater underneath the breakwater region ii than in the far field region i and iii however the onset of liquefaction was postponed in region ii because the residual pore water pressure stabilised before it coincided with the lrl there was also no remarkable change in the developed rate of plastic strain nevertheless the potential for liquefaction in region ii could still rise to a large value of l p 0 95 with a diminished rate of attenuation within the soil layers after a certain number of loading cycles 4 the soil on the seaward side of the breakwater was more susceptible to liquefaction but less likely to be affected by any currents whereas on the shoreward side the soil was less susceptible to liquefaction but the currents affected the way the seabed responded underneath the breakwater particularly in shallow layers of soil less residual pore pressure accumulated in waves coexists with currents regardless of the magnitude and direction than in the wave alone case the maximum difference between cases with and without currents can be up to 120 of p c u r r e n t p n o c u r r e n t p 0 at t t 25 in this region 5 the parametric studies showed that liquefaction due to the build up of residual pore water pressure is more likely to occur in soil with a high water content and where the drainage is impeded soil is more vulnerable to liquefaction when subjected to large waves with longer periods credit authorship contribution statement h y zhao conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis writing original draft j f zhu methodology validation writing

in case of ship s cruise mode nox emission factor is 17 16 4 and 15 8 g kwh for engines marked at year 2000 2005 2010 and beyond respectively but in case of maneuvering and hoteling mode this factor

considered for evaluating effect of increasing the capacity of container ships regarding the environmental issue especially eedi estimations the selected vessels owned by one of the famous container ship companies named hapag lioyd that participated by valuable percentage in maritime transport sector according to the container ships classification the ships called a19 a15 and a13 a13 follows malta maritime authority home port valletta with 13500 containers a15 follows marshall islands maritime authority home port majuro with 14993 containers and a19 follows malta maritime authority home port valletta with 19870 containers the other important data are described in table 1 the three ships depend on slow speed diesel engine to generate the energy necessary to move the ship with the use of fuel containing 0 1 percent sulfur the engine is also equipped with a system to recover lost heat ships are used to transport cargo between several ports in the united states of america the mediterranean and the middle east region 4 results and discussion the benefits and the eco friendly impact caused by the application of various methods to be enhancing energy management on the three vessels are studied during this section a comparison between the achieved energy measure and the setting value by the international legislation is held the ships environmental and economic situation is also identified for ship of class a13 in case of implement speed reduction strategy lastly the applicability of using lng as a fuel onboard vessel of class a19 where the infrastructures are already initially installed onboard is studied it is assumed that the three vessels sailing between shanghai and united states west coast harbors where a huge amount of cargo transported between these harbors unctad 2011 deloitte 2019 according to the collected data the ships rout is 20600 n m each ship spends a certain period from the beginning of journey to the end of its rout according to its characteristics for simplicity of estimations the present research considering six journeys annually the effect of supporting machinery doesn t take into consideration in cruise mode pae neglect so ships will depend on the shaft generators as a source of electricity moreover vref will be used for ships calculations perera and mo 2016 4 1 environmental results for the selected case studies the prime mover is the main source of pollutant emissions in the open sea this is because the source of the electric power is provided by the shaft generator connected to the prime mover reduction gear system calculating the consumed fuel for the case study could be taken as a clear indicator of the vessel s rate of pollutant emissions table 2 illustrates the fuel consumption of the selected ships a19 a15 and a13 the highest fuel consumption is for a13 class container ship despite of its low capacity this is due to the high output power of the ship prime mover 64 570 kw which sails with a speed of 24 1 knots compared to the other two ships the different emission rates can be calculated for the three container ships by means of the predetermined fuel consumption values as illustrated in table 3 a13 container ship produces the highest nox sox co co2 and pm emission rates per trip this is due to the high amount of the consumed fuel for its prime mover engine when be comparable to a19 and a15 class container vessels in contrast a15 container ship results in the lowest emissions per trip in addition the annual exhaust gas pollutants are estimated per one unit of the container vessel s capacity a19 class container vessel has the lowest emission values per transported container for the different pollutant gases the new generations of container vessels are built with the installed selective catalytic reduction system for reducing nox emissions in order to comply with imo 2016 emission legislations in addition sox emissions are to be complied with imo 2020 regulations fig 3 shows nox and sox emissions rates for the three classes of container vessels compared with the latest imo emission regulations it is noticed that the case studies achieve the required sox emission rates due to the use of ultra low sulfur fuel for nox emissions scr system installed on the exhaust gas piping system reduces these emissions by 80 which achieves the required imo restrictions the values of nox and sox emissions in kg min during maneuvering are lower than cruise mode this is due to the reduced engine efficiency and the increased specific fuel consumption at low engine loads icf 2009 ammar and seddiek 2017 eea 2000 it is necessary to take the load dependency of scr performance into consideration when evaluate the scr system regarding the ship s nox emission reduction experiments carried out by briggs and mccarney 2013 fujibayashi et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 implied that the most important factors to ensure steady and optimal scr operation are to ensure good mixing of urea controlling the temperature into the scr reactor and soot blowers performance the scr efficiency shows a slightly increment with the increase of engine load at part load zone however it will be fixed at the normal condition loads if the correct operation is followed as shown in fig 4 this include control the warmup period of the scr reactor which takes from 30 min to 50 min to ensure that the catalyst surface is not covered with soot ash or sulfates hence although that the scr system can achieve a nox reduction percent of 90 during the calculation 80 percent will be taken as an average value during ship s cruise mode in anticipation of an occurrence malfunction of soot blower christensen 2018 for the case study ships the nox emission rates are reduced by 80 using scr therefore nox and sox emission rates comply with the imo limits during maneuvering and cruise modes imo regulations for reducing co2 emissions depends mainly on improving the design and the operation of ships through eedi and eeoi the actual eedi is compared with the imo reference values presented in three phases the initial values for the eedi recommended by imo for a19 a15 and a13 container vessels are 14 99 gco2 ton nm 15 89 gco2 ton nm and 15 98 gco2 ton nm at deadweights of 199744 149360 and 145327 9 metric ton respectively in 2025 these reference standards would be decreased to 10 49 gco2 ton nm 11 12 gco2 ton nm and 11 18 gco2 ton nm respectively further reductions by 10 20 and 30 is applied for the first the second and the third phase respectively table 4 illustrates the calculated eedi and the eeoi values for the three container vessels a19 class container vessel has the lowest co2 emissions compared with the other two vessels from the design and operational points of view the calculated eedi values for the three vessels incorporate the improvement due to the installed shaft generator and turbo alternator as a waste heat recovery system whr as illustrated in fig 5 the output electric power from the shaft generator is the main source of electric power onboard the ship at mcr this will enhance the eedi value for the vessel the output electric power from the shaft generator ranges from 5620 kva for both a19 and a15 container vessels to 3222 kva for a13 case study on the other hand the output power of the three turbo generators installed onboard a19 a15 and a13 container vessels are 2650 kw 2650 kw and 1818 kw respectively it can be noticed that the higher output powers both the shaft and the turbo generators will lead to high enhancement in the eedi value for the case study fig 6 shows the different values for the calculated eedi for the three case studies compared with the corresponding phases ii and iii reference values the calculated eedi for a19 a15 and a13 container vessels are based on vessel s speeds of 21 21 22 and 24 1 knots respectively both a19 and a15 container vessels comply with the required eedi values for the second and the third phases in contrast the calculated eedi for a13 case study do not comply with imo phases the calculated eedi value 16 3 gco2 ton nm should be reduced to 12 78 and 11 18 16 3 gco2 ton nm to comply with the second and the third phase respectively eeoi is the second imo index used for reducing the amount of co2 emitted from ships during their normal operations fig 7 shows the average eeoi results for the three case studies the eeoi is calculated for a19 a15 and a13 container vessels based on the number of transported containers 19870 14993 and 13500 teus respectively for 20600 nautical miles during ship maneuvering and standby modes the amount of the consumed fuel is calculated based on 20 and 5 engine loads respectively the eeoi is enhanced in case of the vessel speed is reduced from its designed value finally the lower value of the eeoi the more improved energy efficiency of the ship 4 2 economic results the financial aspects of container ship class a13 and the new generations a15 and a19 are studied the improvements in the new generations build in 2016 not only includes the effectiveness with imo emission regulations but also increased ship capacity with modification in the main dimensions especially length to beam ratio to evaluate the economic benefits for the three container ships the annual income measure is estimated for the three different ships the measure involves the analysis of the yearly freight ships operating investments for the three ships table 5 shows the cost of fuel used by the prime mover in year the figures are according to the collected prices of marine fuel of 772 6 m3 bunkerworld 2019 and the cost of supply the fuel to the ship of 8 0 m3 ammar and seddiek 2017 ammar 2019 the maximum yearly cost of consumed fuel is 80 94 million us for a13 class container vessel this is due to a13 consumes a higher quantity of oils for each trip more than ships class a19 and a15 also the cost of transferred cargo could be determined using the freight rate of the vessel s route and the number of containers transported by the different vessels the cost of transporting one unit from shanghai to the united state west coast is 1225 teu therefore the total annual costs of cargo transporting are 292 1 220 4 and 198 5 million us year for a19 a15 and a13 container vessels respectively besides the total annual fuel costs are 45 22 38 08 and 90 59 million us year respectively in addition the annual fees for passing through suez canals are 8 78 7 30 and 6 819 million us year respectively the average annual crew costs are assumed 0 73 million us year fig 8 shows the annual profit for the three ships ship of class a19 has the highest annual profit with specific cargo transporting profit of 995 us teu while the a13 container ship uses shaft generator and turbo generator which improve the calculated eedi value it is still not complied with imo requirements to improve the energy efficiency for this ship in the short run the speed reduction is assumed this will reduce both co2 emissions and the cost of the consumed fuel especially in case of increased fuel prices tezdogan et al 2016 amount of the consumed fuel in case of ship slow steaming mfsr could be estimated for the journey depending on the relation between designed speed vd and the operation speed vo banawan et al 2013 ammar 2018 as shown in eq 11 11 m fsr m me v o v d 3 m ae d t 24 v o where mme and mae are daily amounts of diesel generator and prime mover respectively on the other hand the annual fuel saving costs fsc at the different scenarios of speed reduction could be estimated as follows 12 fsc m sav c fuel 1 i n where msav is the mass of fuel saving per journey i is the annual fuel price change percent n is the anticipated working years for the vessel the value of carbon di oxide cost effectiveness cerco 2 which result due to ship s speed reduction could be determined as follows eide et al 2009 bishop et al 2014 13 cer co 2 p loss c oth r co 2 where ploss presents the loss of vessel s income due to reduce the speed coth is the financial paybacks through the vessel life as a result of fuel saving rco2 is the amount of co2 emissions reduction in a ton to evaluate the outcome from the viewpoint of energy measure in case of ship speed reduction for the ship class a13 the value of specific fuel consumption of the prime mover at various loads should be estimated using the man b w k98me c7 1 project guide man 2014 the relation between prime mover load and the consumed fuel could be estimated using a curve fitting concept as shown in fig 9 as the vessel speed is reduced the output power of the prime mover will be reduced consequently this will accordingly decrease the amount of co2 emissions fig 10 displays the trend of the fuel saving and co2 emission reduction cost effectiveness due to slow steaming for the rest of a13 vessel lifespan the expected residual lifespan of the vessel is 21 years based on the average vessels operating years mikelis 2008 ammar and seddiek 2017 the yearly fuel cost increment i is supposed to be 10 ship slow steaming is limited according to imo standards for the lowest power necessities mepc 2016 faber et al 2017 furthermore the reduction in ship s transported cargo is expected 6 9 for each knot reduction eide et al 2009 ammar 2018 it is clear that as the ship speed is reduced the cost effectiveness of co2 emission reduction will be increased consequently a higher fuel saving costs is achieved as shown in fig 10 after 21 years the fuel saving costs will reach 354 million dollars with co2 cost effectiveness of 5291 ton co2 in case of reducing ship speed by 40 lower the designed speed to assess the outcome of speed reduction on a13 container ship energy efficiency during operation eeoi should be estimated using eq 7 the middling eeoi could be estimated at various ship speed reduction percentages of design speed as shown in fig 11 these estimations are based on 13 500 teu of transported cargo for each ship journey along with the distance from shanghai to united states west coast harbors 20 600 nautical miles the amount of the consumed fuel at standby and maneuvering modes each voyage is based on the prime mover load percentages of 5 and 20 respectively at the operative vessel s speed 24 1 knots the average eeoi is 0 00016 ton co2 teu nm fig 11 shows the outcome of speed reduction on the eeoi it is clear that in case of reducing the ship s speed by 10 and 40 this will expand the eeoi value by 15 62 and 73 68 respectively from the operative ship speed value which accordingly expands the eedi values the impact of low speeds on the efficiency of the a13 vessel could be assessed using the enhancement in energy efficiency indexes with reduce the shipping speed the output power of prime mover pme will be reduced this reduction will affect the eedi value as illustrated using eq 2 the enhancement in the eedi relative to the international restrictive values in three phases is revealed in fig 12 on the other side the reference energy efficiency standards are 14 38 12 78 and 11 18 gco2 ton nm for phases i ii and iii respectively the estimated eedi values are 16 09 15 56 14 75 and 13 55 gco2 ton nm corresponding to ship slow steaming by 10 20 30 and 40 respectively the relative calculated to the required imo standards for phases i and ii will be 89 and 99 7 respectively at ship speed reduction of 45 lastly the present diesel fuel and lng infrastructure which installed onboard ship class a19 could be used for the analysis of the outcome of applying dual fuel on energy efficiency and fuel saving costs in this case the dual fuel emission factor efdfde should be used in place of fuel emission factor in eq 9 efdfde could be estimated by means of the emission factors of the diesel and lng fueled engines efd and efng as stated in eq 14 considering the dual 95 lng and 5 diesel fuel 14 ef dfde 0 05 ef d 0 95 ef ng the cost of a metric ton of natural gas fuels and diesel oil are 0 1075 and 772 6 respectively eia 2019 bunkerworld 2019 the cost of fuel delivery to the ship for diesel fuel and lng is 8 m3 and 0 009 respectively ammar and seddiek 2017 ammar 2019 fig 13 shows the outcome of applying different percentages of the original fuel and lng and the corresponding eedi and fuel saving for the a19 container ship on the other side the lowest eedi value is 3 572 gco2 ton nm which corresponding to the highest improvement percent of 9 34 using dual fuel 5 do 95 ng the annual fuel saving at these percentages is 24 7 million dollars 4 3 comparing the results with the new emerging technologies according to the data provided by the maritime transportation inventories and researchers container vessels produce the highest greenhouse gases in terms of million tons of co2 compared with other cargo ships in addition container vessels have a significant share in the transported cargo worldwide and this percentage is in a continuous increase every year unctad 2011 brent petersen and rex 2018 in order to reduce the exhaust gas emissions from container vessels many of the navigational corporations will highly consider using mega or medium vessels the increased capacity of containerized shipping will decrease the amount of required fuel for transported container consequently the energy efficiency of big container vessels will be enhanced with the reduced fuel consumption and co2 pollutants per transported container this will increase the ship profit and decrease the emitted greenhouse gases for the international containerized shipping therefore container vessel capacities are increased in a continuous rate through the last decades moreover it is noticed that the orders for the new built container ships for the next 5 10 years will increase the teu capacities with 60 percent by selecting the most effective ship breadth to length ratio which may reach 6 514 unctad 2011 pani et al 2015 knowler 2019 unctad 2019 this agrees with the current research finding where the environmental impact and the eedi values for the three case studies are enhanced by increasing both the ship beam and the number of transported containers per trip 5 conclusions reducing exhaust gas emissions from ships is one of the main concerns of the imo the energy efficiency of the three container ships classed a19 a15 and a13 with the possible enhancement methods for the eedi and the eeoi were discussed in addition other emission rates from the three ships were evaluated the main findings from the present study are as follows environmentally a19 container vessel generates the lowest average pollutant emissions per teu it releases 3 4 149 9 13 8 1 8 and 5677kg teu for sox nox co pm and co2 emissions respectively the three ships comply with imo emission regulations for nox sox and co2 emissions except a13 container ship it will be complied with the required eedi values advised by imo after reducing its speed by 45 from the designed value the calculated eedi values are 16 3 4 28 and 3 94 gco2 ton nm for a13 a15 and a19 container vessels respectively waste heat recovery and shaft motor enhances the eedi by 31 71 and 9 39 respectively for a15 container vessel besides eedi the eeoi will be improved as the ration of the ship length to breadth is reduced economically the cost of fuel consumption for the a13 class container vessel is the highest compared with a19 and a15 a19 container ship has the highest annual profit for transported cargo of 995 us teu in addition reducing the speed of a13 container vessel by 45 will lead to a reduction in co2 emissions with cost effectiveness of 5863 ton at this speed the calculated eedi value will be complied with imo values by 89 and 99 7 for the first and the second phases respectively a further reduction in the eedi value by 14 is required in 2025 finally using natural gas for operating a19 class container vessel will reduce fuel cost by 24 7 million dollars per year with the enhanced eedi vale by 9 34 credit authorship contribution statement nader r ammar conceptualization methodology

21572,the present paper aims to study the best methods that can be applied to improve energy management onboard container ships of large capacity container ships of class a13 a15 and a19 are considered those ships are taken as a reference to evaluate the impact of the proposed methods from the viewpoints of environmental and economic aspects their calculated energy efficiency values are 3 94 4 28 and 16 29 gco2 per ton nautical mile respectively ship class a19 appeared as the best ship in terms of emissions rates that can be reduced annually with reference to the transported cargo these rates are 3 4 149 9 13 8 5677 and 1 8 kg teu for sox nox co co2 and pm emissions respectively to enhance energy management for the a13 the ship will be forced to decrees its speed by 45 percent the proposed concept will fulfil with 2023 year legislations by rate of 5860 per each ton co2 decreased alternatively applying the strategy of lng fueled engine for container ship class a19 can expand the energy measure about 9 34 at yearly operating reduction by 24 7 million dollars keywords emission reduction imo legislations containerized shipping energy efficiency indexes 1 introduction for a long time ships relied on fossil fuels as an energy source merien paul et al 2018 hua et al 2017 seddiek 2016 implied that this type of fuel has become one of the problems facing ships imo 2014b johansson et al 2017 showed that in its recent reports the international maritime organization imo indicated that the shipping industry is responsible for 2 7 and 6 6 of greenhouse gases of carbon dioxide co2 and nitrogen oxides nox respectively with perceptions of a rising trend seddiek and elgohary 2014 seddiek 2016 yang et al 2012 explained that to mitigate the negative impact resulting from vessels emissions the imo set guidelines 13 and 14 to curtail nox and sox emissions respectively such legislations are found in the international convention for the prevention of maritime pollution marpol 73 78 annex vi a further policy has been imposed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent at the end of 2023 ammar 2018 hou et al 2019 sames and köpke 2012 the measures include the energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi and the energy efficiency design index eedi rehmatulla et al 2017 fig 1 presents data about top categories of ships that have the greatest impact on fuel consumption and co2 emissions from the figure it could be found that container vessels became accountable for emitting nearby two hundred million tons of co2 as a result of consume a huge amount of fossil fuels this represents around 27 of whole ships consumed fuels imo 2014b unctad 2011 at the worldwide level the imo executed a few methods that proposed for enhancing vessels energy the estimations of the vessel s power effectiveness including vessel s profile propulsion means prime movers and vessel s arrangements guangrong et al 2013 showed that the influence of the vessel s profile can be attained through enhancement of the forward section design body painting and resistance reduction sarasquete et al 2011 explained that propulsion means and ship s steering devices will contribute to power management employing kort nozzle propellers and twin or multi engine propeller diab et al 2016 benvenuto et al 2014 revealed that the prime movers development play a role in the way of power management including electronic injection upgrades and other technologies such as wind and solar power shipping financial aspects presents a significant influence on the growing of the international trade transfer cost of a cargo onboard container vessels valued giving to size of the cargo s unit twenty or forty feet in addition to the location where the cargo will be shipped since the harbor of shanghai is one of the major harbors in the world to receive ships carrying containers the harbor could be used for actual statistics fig 2 represents the information of transferring cargo between shanghai and other famous harbors such as with shanghai west africa shanghai mediterranean shanghai northern europe and shanghai united state west coast unctad 2011 brent petersen and rex 2018 deloitte 2019 the objective of this research is to illustrate the economic and environmental profits from spread over the eed strategy for maritime vehicles container ships of a19 a15 and a13 are considered moreover different methods for enhancing energy effectiveness are demonstrated specifically ship s speed reduction lng engines and ship s optimum dismissions 2 environmental and

considered for evaluating effect of increasing the capacity of container ships regarding the environmental issue especially eedi estimations the selected vessels owned by one of the famous container ship companies named hapag lioyd that participated by valuable percentage in maritime transport sector according to the container ships classification the ships called a19 a15 and a13 a13 follows malta maritime authority home port valletta with 13500 containers a15 follows marshall islands maritime authority home port majuro with 14993 containers and a19 follows malta maritime authority home port valletta with 19870 containers the other important data are described in table 1 the three ships depend on slow speed diesel engine to generate the energy necessary to move the ship with the use of fuel containing 0 1 percent sulfur the engine is also equipped with a system to recover lost heat ships are used to transport cargo between several ports in the united states of america the mediterranean and the middle east region 4 results and discussion the benefits and the eco friendly impact caused by the application of various methods to be enhancing energy management on the three vessels are studied during this section a comparison between the achieved energy measure and the setting value by the international legislation is held the ships environmental and economic situation is also identified for ship of class a13 in case of implement speed reduction strategy lastly the applicability of using lng as a fuel onboard vessel of class a19 where the infrastructures are already initially installed onboard is studied it is assumed that the three vessels sailing between shanghai and united states west coast harbors where a huge amount of cargo transported between these harbors unctad 2011 deloitte 2019 according to the collected data the ships rout is 20600 n m each ship spends a certain period from the beginning of journey to the end of its rout according to its characteristics for simplicity of estimations the present research considering six journeys annually the effect of supporting machinery doesn t take into consideration in cruise mode pae neglect so ships will depend on the shaft generators as a source of electricity moreover vref will be used for ships calculations perera and mo 2016 4 1 environmental results for the selected case studies the prime mover is the main source of pollutant emissions in the open sea this is because the source of the electric power is provided by the shaft generator connected to the prime mover reduction gear system calculating the consumed fuel for the case study could be taken as a clear indicator of the vessel s rate of pollutant emissions table 2 illustrates the fuel consumption of the selected ships a19 a15 and a13 the highest fuel consumption is for a13 class container ship despite of its low capacity this is due to the high output power of the ship prime mover 64 570 kw which sails with a speed of 24 1 knots compared to the other two ships the different emission rates can be calculated for the three container ships by means of the predetermined fuel consumption values as illustrated in table 3 a13 container ship produces the highest nox sox co co2 and pm emission rates per trip this is due to the high amount of the consumed fuel for its prime mover engine when be comparable to a19 and a15 class container vessels in contrast a15 container ship results in the lowest emissions per trip in addition the annual exhaust gas pollutants are estimated per one unit of the container vessel s capacity a19 class container vessel has the lowest emission values per transported container for the different pollutant gases the new generations of container vessels are built with the installed selective catalytic reduction system for reducing nox emissions in order to comply with imo 2016 emission legislations in addition sox emissions are to be complied with imo 2020 regulations fig 3 shows nox and sox emissions rates for the three classes of container vessels compared with the latest imo emission regulations it is noticed that the case studies achieve the required sox emission rates due to the use of ultra low sulfur fuel for nox emissions scr system installed on the exhaust gas piping system reduces these emissions by 80 which achieves the required imo restrictions the values of nox and sox emissions in kg min during maneuvering are lower than cruise mode this is due to the reduced engine efficiency and the increased specific fuel consumption at low engine loads icf 2009 ammar and seddiek 2017 eea 2000 it is necessary to take the load dependency of scr performance into consideration when evaluate the scr system regarding the ship s nox emission reduction experiments carried out by briggs and mccarney 2013 fujibayashi et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 implied that the most important factors to ensure steady and optimal scr operation are to ensure good mixing of urea controlling the temperature into the scr reactor and soot blowers performance the scr efficiency shows a slightly increment with the increase of engine load at part load zone however it will be fixed at the normal condition loads if the correct operation is followed as shown in fig 4 this include control the warmup period of the scr reactor which takes from 30 min to 50 min to ensure that the catalyst surface is not covered with soot ash or sulfates hence although that the scr system can achieve a nox reduction percent of 90 during the calculation 80 percent will be taken as an average value during ship s cruise mode in anticipation of an occurrence malfunction of soot blower christensen 2018 for the case study ships the nox emission rates are reduced by 80 using scr therefore nox and sox emission rates comply with the imo limits during maneuvering and cruise modes imo regulations for reducing co2 emissions depends mainly on improving the design and the operation of ships through eedi and eeoi the actual eedi is compared with the imo reference values presented in three phases the initial values for the eedi recommended by imo for a19 a15 and a13 container vessels are 14 99 gco2 ton nm 15 89 gco2 ton nm and 15 98 gco2 ton nm at deadweights of 199744 149360 and 145327 9 metric ton respectively in 2025 these reference standards would be decreased to 10 49 gco2 ton nm 11 12 gco2 ton nm and 11 18 gco2 ton nm respectively further reductions by 10 20 and 30 is applied for the first the second and the third phase respectively table 4 illustrates the calculated eedi and the eeoi values for the three container vessels a19 class container vessel has the lowest co2 emissions compared with the other two vessels from the design and operational points of view the calculated eedi values for the three vessels incorporate the improvement due to the installed shaft generator and turbo alternator as a waste heat recovery system whr as illustrated in fig 5 the output electric power from the shaft generator is the main source of electric power onboard the ship at mcr this will enhance the eedi value for the vessel the output electric power from the shaft generator ranges from 5620 kva for both a19 and a15 container vessels to 3222 kva for a13 case study on the other hand the output power of the three turbo generators installed onboard a19 a15 and a13 container vessels are 2650 kw 2650 kw and 1818 kw respectively it can be noticed that the higher output powers both the shaft and the turbo generators will lead to high enhancement in the eedi value for the case study fig 6 shows the different values for the calculated eedi for the three case studies compared with the corresponding phases ii and iii reference values the calculated eedi for a19 a15 and a13 container vessels are based on vessel s speeds of 21 21 22 and 24 1 knots respectively both a19 and a15 container vessels comply with the required eedi values for the second and the third phases in contrast the calculated eedi for a13 case study do not comply with imo phases the calculated eedi value 16 3 gco2 ton nm should be reduced to 12 78 and 11 18 16 3 gco2 ton nm to comply with the second and the third phase respectively eeoi is the second imo index used for reducing the amount of co2 emitted from ships during their normal operations fig 7 shows the average eeoi results for the three case studies the eeoi is calculated for a19 a15 and a13 container vessels based on the number of transported containers 19870 14993 and 13500 teus respectively for 20600 nautical miles during ship maneuvering and standby modes the amount of the consumed fuel is calculated based on 20 and 5 engine loads respectively the eeoi is enhanced in case of the vessel speed is reduced from its designed value finally the lower value of the eeoi the more improved energy efficiency of the ship 4 2 economic results the financial aspects of container ship class a13 and the new generations a15 and a19 are studied the improvements in the new generations build in 2016 not only includes the effectiveness with imo emission regulations but also increased ship capacity with modification in the main dimensions especially length to beam ratio to evaluate the economic benefits for the three container ships the annual income measure is estimated for the three different ships the measure involves the analysis of the yearly freight ships operating investments for the three ships table 5 shows the cost of fuel used by the prime mover in year the figures are according to the collected prices of marine fuel of 772 6 m3 bunkerworld 2019 and the cost of supply the fuel to the ship of 8 0 m3 ammar and seddiek 2017 ammar 2019 the maximum yearly cost of consumed fuel is 80 94 million us for a13 class container vessel this is due to a13 consumes a higher quantity of oils for each trip more than ships class a19 and a15 also the cost of transferred cargo could be determined using the freight rate of the vessel s route and the number of containers transported by the different vessels the cost of transporting one unit from shanghai to the united state west coast is 1225 teu therefore the total annual costs of cargo transporting are 292 1 220 4 and 198 5 million us year for a19 a15 and a13 container vessels respectively besides the total annual fuel costs are 45 22 38 08 and 90 59 million us year respectively in addition the annual fees for passing through suez canals are 8 78 7 30 and 6 819 million us year respectively the average annual crew costs are assumed 0 73 million us year fig 8 shows the annual profit for the three ships ship of class a19 has the highest annual profit with specific cargo transporting profit of 995 us teu while the a13 container ship uses shaft generator and turbo generator which improve the calculated eedi value it is still not complied with imo requirements to improve the energy efficiency for this ship in the short run the speed reduction is assumed this will reduce both co2 emissions and the cost of the consumed fuel especially in case of increased fuel prices tezdogan et al 2016 amount of the consumed fuel in case of ship slow steaming mfsr could be estimated for the journey depending on the relation between designed speed vd and the operation speed vo banawan et al 2013 ammar 2018 as shown in eq 11 11 m fsr m me v o v d 3 m ae d t 24 v o where mme and mae are daily amounts of diesel generator and prime mover respectively on the other hand the annual fuel saving costs fsc at the different scenarios of speed reduction could be estimated as follows 12 fsc m sav c fuel 1 i n where msav is the mass of fuel saving per journey i is the annual fuel price change percent n is the anticipated working years for the vessel the value of carbon di oxide cost effectiveness cerco 2 which result due to ship s speed reduction could be determined as follows eide et al 2009 bishop et al 2014 13 cer co 2 p loss c oth r co 2 where ploss presents the loss of vessel s income due to reduce the speed coth is the financial paybacks through the vessel life as a result of fuel saving rco2 is the amount of co2 emissions reduction in a ton to evaluate the outcome from the viewpoint of energy measure in case of ship speed reduction for the ship class a13 the value of specific fuel consumption of the prime mover at various loads should be estimated using the man b w k98me c7 1 project guide man 2014 the relation between prime mover load and the consumed fuel could be estimated using a curve fitting concept as shown in fig 9 as the vessel speed is reduced the output power of the prime mover will be reduced consequently this will accordingly decrease the amount of co2 emissions fig 10 displays the trend of the fuel saving and co2 emission reduction cost effectiveness due to slow steaming for the rest of a13 vessel lifespan the expected residual lifespan of the vessel is 21 years based on the average vessels operating years mikelis 2008 ammar and seddiek 2017 the yearly fuel cost increment i is supposed to be 10 ship slow steaming is limited according to imo standards for the lowest power necessities mepc 2016 faber et al 2017 furthermore the reduction in ship s transported cargo is expected 6 9 for each knot reduction eide et al 2009 ammar 2018 it is clear that as the ship speed is reduced the cost effectiveness of co2 emission reduction will be increased consequently a higher fuel saving costs is achieved as shown in fig 10 after 21 years the fuel saving costs will reach 354 million dollars with co2 cost effectiveness of 5291 ton co2 in case of reducing ship speed by 40 lower the designed speed to assess the outcome of speed reduction on a13 container ship energy efficiency during operation eeoi should be estimated using eq 7 the middling eeoi could be estimated at various ship speed reduction percentages of design speed as shown in fig 11 these estimations are based on 13 500 teu of transported cargo for each ship journey along with the distance from shanghai to united states west coast harbors 20 600 nautical miles the amount of the consumed fuel at standby and maneuvering modes each voyage is based on the prime mover load percentages of 5 and 20 respectively at the operative vessel s speed 24 1 knots the average eeoi is 0 00016 ton co2 teu nm fig 11 shows the outcome of speed reduction on the eeoi it is clear that in case of reducing the ship s speed by 10 and 40 this will expand the eeoi value by 15 62 and 73 68 respectively from the operative ship speed value which accordingly expands the eedi values the impact of low speeds on the efficiency of the a13 vessel could be assessed using the enhancement in energy efficiency indexes with reduce the shipping speed the output power of prime mover pme will be reduced this reduction will affect the eedi value as illustrated using eq 2 the enhancement in the eedi relative to the international restrictive values in three phases is revealed in fig 12 on the other side the reference energy efficiency standards are 14 38 12 78 and 11 18 gco2 ton nm for phases i ii and iii respectively the estimated eedi values are 16 09 15 56 14 75 and 13 55 gco2 ton nm corresponding to ship slow steaming by 10 20 30 and 40 respectively the relative calculated to the required imo standards for phases i and ii will be 89 and 99 7 respectively at ship speed reduction of 45 lastly the present diesel fuel and lng infrastructure which installed onboard ship class a19 could be used for the analysis of the outcome of applying dual fuel on energy efficiency and fuel saving costs in this case the dual fuel emission factor efdfde should be used in place of fuel emission factor in eq 9 efdfde could be estimated by means of the emission factors of the diesel and lng fueled engines efd and efng as stated in eq 14 considering the dual 95 lng and 5 diesel fuel 14 ef dfde 0 05 ef d 0 95 ef ng the cost of a metric ton of natural gas fuels and diesel oil are 0 1075 and 772 6 respectively eia 2019 bunkerworld 2019 the cost of fuel delivery to the ship for diesel fuel and lng is 8 m3 and 0 009 respectively ammar and seddiek 2017 ammar 2019 fig 13 shows the outcome of applying different percentages of the original fuel and lng and the corresponding eedi and fuel saving for the a19 container ship on the other side the lowest eedi value is 3 572 gco2 ton nm which corresponding to the highest improvement percent of 9 34 using dual fuel 5 do 95 ng the annual fuel saving at these percentages is 24 7 million dollars 4 3 comparing the results with the new emerging technologies according to the data provided by the maritime transportation inventories and researchers container vessels produce the highest greenhouse gases in terms of million tons of co2 compared with other cargo ships in addition container vessels have a significant share in the transported cargo worldwide and this percentage is in a continuous increase every year unctad 2011 brent petersen and rex 2018 in order to reduce the exhaust gas emissions from container vessels many of the navigational corporations will highly consider using mega or medium vessels the increased capacity of containerized shipping will decrease the amount of required fuel for transported container consequently the energy efficiency of big container vessels will be enhanced with the reduced fuel consumption and co2 pollutants per transported container this will increase the ship profit and decrease the emitted greenhouse gases for the international containerized shipping therefore container vessel capacities are increased in a continuous rate through the last decades moreover it is noticed that the orders for the new built container ships for the next 5 10 years will increase the teu capacities with 60 percent by selecting the most effective ship breadth to length ratio which may reach 6 514 unctad 2011 pani et al 2015 knowler 2019 unctad 2019 this agrees with the current research finding where the environmental impact and the eedi values for the three case studies are enhanced by increasing both the ship beam and the number of transported containers per trip 5 conclusions reducing exhaust gas emissions from ships is one of the main concerns of the imo the energy efficiency of the three container ships classed a19 a15 and a13 with the possible enhancement methods for the eedi and the eeoi were discussed in addition other emission rates from the three ships were evaluated the main findings from the present study are as follows environmentally a19 container vessel generates the lowest average pollutant emissions per teu it releases 3 4 149 9 13 8 1 8 and 5677kg teu for sox nox co pm and co2 emissions respectively the three ships comply with imo emission regulations for nox sox and co2 emissions except a13 container ship it will be complied with the required eedi values advised by imo after reducing its speed by 45 from the designed value the calculated eedi values are 16 3 4 28 and 3 94 gco2 ton nm for a13 a15 and a19 container vessels respectively waste heat recovery and shaft motor enhances the eedi by 31 71 and 9 39 respectively for a15 container vessel besides eedi the eeoi will be improved as the ration of the ship length to breadth is reduced economically the cost of fuel consumption for the a13 class container vessel is the highest compared with a19 and a15 a19 container ship has the highest annual profit for transported cargo of 995 us teu in addition reducing the speed of a13 container vessel by 45 will lead to a reduction in co2 emissions with cost effectiveness of 5863 ton at this speed the calculated eedi value will be complied with imo values by 89 and 99 7 for the first and the second phases respectively a further reduction in the eedi value by 14 is required in 2025 finally using natural gas for operating a19 class container vessel will reduce fuel cost by 24 7 million dollars per year with the enhanced eedi vale by 9 34 credit authorship contribution statement nader r ammar conceptualization methodology

21573,this paper deals with the adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant control problem for unmanned marine vehicles umvs with signal quantization and state time delay a unified thruster fault model for umvs is built by taking bias partial total time varying stuck and hard over faults into account for umvs in the network environment the effects of quantization and state time delay on umvs are inevitable in this situation adaptive sliding mode technology and dynamic quantization parameter adjustment strategy are combined to compensate for the quantization errors and time delay effects compared with the traditional method a larger quantization parameter adjustment range is given and a new dynamic quantization parameter adjustment strategy is designed further the quantized sliding mode fault tolerant controller independent of fault detection and diagnosis mechanism is designed for umvs in the presence of time delay and various thruster faults to reduce the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error the comparison simulations of a typical floating production ship have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm keywords adaptive sliding mode control unmanned marine vehicles quantization time delay thruster faults 1 introduction due to advances in communication networks and challenging mission scenarios both theory and engineering research interests in control of unmanned marine vehicles umvs have been increasing over the past three decades wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2019b wang and han 2018 hao et al 2019a b dong et al 2016 wang et al 2018 glotzbach et al 2015 dong et al 2019 hao et al 2020 some interesting study results are shown in the literature on trajectory tracking control dong et al 2016 target tracking control glotzbach et al 2015 dynamic positioning control wang et al 2018 and stabilization control dong et al 2019 the widespread applications of the unmanned marine vehicle umv in practice e g water quality monitoring ocean emergency rescue deep sea exploration coastal patrol make it necessary to have higher accuracy higher performance and reliability in such a context increasing demands for reducing the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error have motivated more and more researchers to investigate this problem wang and han 2018 hao et al 2019a b note that the motion of umvs is always controlled by a remote land based control station the communication between the umv and the control station is completed via communication networks in this case due to the severe communication constraints in the ocean network communication in the sensor to control station is plagued with limited communication bandwidth intermittent failures latency and multi path effects which cause quantization hao et al 2017 yan and yu 2018 xue et al 2018 hao et al 2019b time delay wang and han 2018 wang et al 2018 wang and han 2016 and event trigger zheng et al 2018 ye et al 2019 li and yang 2018 inevitably the existence of quantization errors can lead to performance deterioration of a umv system hao et al 2019b thus it is of paramount importance to reduce its impact on the umv sliding mode technique an effective robust tool is widely adopted to deal with quantization problems hao et al 2019b yan and yu 2018 xue et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 however in the practical situation owing to quantization errors the traditional sliding mode approach can affect the stability of the umv system hao et al 2019b though there are some existing works hao and yang 2013a b hao et al 2017 xue et al 2018 on connecting quantized sliding mode control few results have devoted to the problem of designing quantized sliding mode controller for the umv system addressing this issue is the first motivation of the current research for umvs in the network environment time delay caused by information transfers and processing is usually unavoidable which is a factor affecting the stability of the umv system wang and han 2018 substantial research has been conducted about the communication time delays for marine vehicles t s fuzzy dynamic positioning control for umvs with network induced delays has been addressed in wang et al 2018 as observed by liu et al 2019 a novel distributed control law for multiple marine vessels in the delayed network has been proposed by considering the communication time delay effects fuzzy state feedback depth control of the unmanned underwater vehicle has been studied in yan et al 2018 unfortunately these articles only take time delays into account both time delay and quantization are not considered for the umv in the network environment which is unrealistic though reasonable it is a challenge to deal with quantization and state time delay in the umv system and the presence of the time delay parameter increases the difficulty of dynamic adjustment of the quantization parameter to the best of our knowledge there is no research on the effect of state time delay and quantization on umvs in the literature which is the second motivation of this work the umv is subject to failures in the complex ocean environment thrusters are one of the most common sources of failures hao et al 2019b thruster faults not only may cause the umv not to complete its task but also may lead it to irreversible damage corradini et al 2010 indeed tolerance to thruster faults is the core issue in umv control system deng and yang 2019 the problem of fault tolerant control ye et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 has been largely covered from different viewpoints izadi zamanabadi and blanke 1999 and edwards and spurgeon 2000 have considered the impact of bias additive fault on the ship zhu et al 2008 and blanke and nguyen 2018 have presented a thruster fault tolerant strategy to address the total fault problem huang et al 2014 and dos santos et al 2016 have designed a fault tolerant controller for thruster total fault and partial fault hao et al 2019a has researched fault tolerant control for thruster total partial and time varying faults however they only take one two or three types of thruster faults into consideration which is different from the actual fault situation of the thrusters in practice if the propeller of umvs is jammed heavily the thruster will produce unknown constant forces under this circumstance it may occur hard over fault hao et al 2019b having these in mind based on considering quantization and state time delay the establishment of a unified thruster fault model including partial total bias time varying stuck and hard over failures is practically significant which is the third motivation of this paper motivated by the above discussions a quantized sliding mode controller is designed for umvs with various thruster faults and time delay in this paper the main contributions of this paper are listed as follows 1 since various types of thruster faults may appear in umv operation a unified thruster fault model including partial total time vary stuck bias and hard over faults is established in this paper 2 compared with the existing results in yan and yu 2018 the thruster fault factors and time delay parameter are taken into account in the quantization parameter adjustment strategy which leads to more practical application 3 inspired by hao et al 2019b a larger quantization parameter adjustment range which can reduce to the traditional one in hao and yang 2013a when time delay constant is zero is given the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 control problem formulation including a umv time delay modeling quantizer mechanism and control objective is presented the adaptive quantized sliding mode fault tolerant strategy for umvs with time delay is given in section 3 in section 4 some comparison experiments of the umv time delay system with multitype thruster faults and quantization are carried out and the conclusion

modeling this subsection aims to establish a model for umv with time delay the body fixed equations of motion in surge sway and yaw are described as 1 e ν t f ν t r η t k ϕ f t where e is the matrix of inertia that is e e t 0 f denotes damping r introduces mooring forces and k is the thruster configuration matrix kadiyam et al 2020 ν t ζ t υ t r t t is the linear and angular velocities of the umv defined in the body fixed frame with ζ t υ t and r t denoting the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity respectively η t x p t y p t ψ t t is the position x p t y p t and the yaw angle ψ t of the umv with respect to the earth fixed frame ϕ f t a control vector is defined as 2 ϕ f t α ϕ t β ϕ s t where the diagonal semi positive definite weighting matrix α is the effectiveness of each thruster which belongs to δ α j α j α j d i a g α 1 j α 2 j α m j α i j α i j α i j with the elements 0 α i j α i j α i j 1 where the indexes i i 1 m and j j 1 n denote the i th thruster and the j th fault mode respectively n is the total fault modes β is a diagonal matrix with its diagonal element 0 or 1 the bound of thruster stuck fault ϕ s t satisfies that ϕ s t 2 ϕ s t for clarity and conciseness we summarize the above unified thruster fault model including partial total time varying stuck hard over and bias failures as table 1 remark 1 for the umv equipped with thrusters how to cover various thruster faults in the umv operation and establish a comprehensive thruster failure model in the fault tolerant control are practically important and attractive in the literature throughout this paper we consider various thruster faults such as partial huang et al 2014 dos santos et al 2016 total zhu et al 2008 blanke and nguyen 2018 huang et al 2014 dos santos et al 2016 time varying stuck hao et al 2019a bias izadi zamanabadi and blanke 1999 edwards and spurgeon 2000 and hard over failures in comparison with the above literature the thruster fault model 2 in this paper is more unified which brings more practical application to some degree and 3 η t j ψ t ν t where j cos ψ t sin ψ t 0 sin ψ t c o s ψ t 0 0 0 1 taking the ocean external disturbance q t into account the umv system 1 is converted to 4 ν t t ν t l α ϕ t β ϕ s t q t v η t where t e 1 f l e 1 k and v e 1 r since the yaw angle ψ t is small enough it is obvious that c o s ψ t 1 s i n ψ t 0 and j ψ t i wang and han 2018 then 3 can be rewritten as 5 η t ν t define the umv system state error e t e η t e ν t η t η r e f ν t ν r e f and combine with 4 and 5 then we have 6 e t t e t l α ϕ t β ϕ s t y ξ t where t 0 i v t l 0 l a 1 0 i v 0 i e r e f η r e f ν r e f y ξ t t e r e f a 1 q t as observed from fig 1 the umv and the control station are linked together through the communication network note that communication network channel induced delays of the sensor to control station are unavoidable for the umv in the network environment thus the mathematical model of the umv system 6 is converted into 7 e t t e t t d e t d l α ϕ t β ϕ s t y ξ t e t 0 e 0 where t d is a known constant matrix of appropriate dimension d is a known time delay parameter t 0 denotes the initial instant e 0 r 6 is the initial condition this paper aims at reducing the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error so the controlled output z t can be defined as follows z t c e t where c 0 0 0 0 0 1 for guaranteeing the achievement of the control aim state information can be available and we assume that r a n k l α r a n k l is true and every pair t l ρ is completely stabilizable for all α δ α j j i 1 n 2 2 quantizer model the remote land based control station which is composed of the thruster allocation the adaptive sliding mode controller and the state error calculator is connected to umvs through communication networks before the state vectors η t and ν t pass through the network channel they should be quantized by the quantizer similarly the output φ t of the remote land based control station should be quantized before transmitting to the umv generally a quantizer can be considered as a piecewise constant function h r r h 1 h r where h 1 h r r r are quantization points which satisfies h y y δ i f y σ h y y δ i f y σ where h represents the quantizer y is the quantized variable δ and σ present the error bound and the range of h respectively based on it in this paper we use the single parameter family of quantizer h ρ y ρ h y ρ ρ r o u n d y ρ ρ 0 where h ρ is the uniform quantizer with the quantization parameter ρ if the quantizing level ρ is a fixed value h ρ y is a static quantizer if the quantization sensitivity ρ is a variable number h ρ y is a dynamic quantizer define quantization error e ρ h ρ y y we have 8 e ρ 1 h ρ 1 φ φ δ 1 ρ 1 e ρ 2 h ρ 2 e e δ 2 ρ 2 where h ρ 1 φ is a static quantizer h ρ 2 e is a dynamic quantizer remark 2 it should be mentioned that in this paper the static quantizer and the dynamic quantizer are simultaneously taken into consideration the existence of dynamic quantizers ensures that the states of the umv time delay system under the control laws can reach the sliding mode surface moreover the umv time delay system states can stay on the sliding surface if ρ 2 0 to get a whole definition of the quantizer we have h ρ 2 e 0 when ρ 2 0 2 3 control objective in this paper the control objective is to design a quantized sliding mode controller for attenuating the oscillation of the yaw velocity error of umvs in the presence of communication time delay and various thruster faults and a novel dynamic quantization adjustment range related to the thruster fault factors and time delay parameter is given to reduce the conservative to some degree 3 quantized sliding mode fault tolerant control strategy for umvs with time delay in this section we design an adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant controller for a umv by using quantized signals in the presence of state time delay and various thruster faults and the whole control strategy is shown in fig 1 3 1 switching surface function and stability analysis according to the full rank decomposition of the matrix the control input matrix l becomes

all α δ α j j i 1 n where l r p q l v r p x and n r x q lemma 2 hao and yang 2013b if the inequality 25 holds there exists α δ α j j i 1 n such that 26 χ t n α n t s i g n χ μ λ 1 χ 1 where λ 1 is the smallest eigenvalue of the positive matrix n n t based on the above lemmas the main results will be given in the following lemma 3 by noting that n n 0 and μ are given in 9 10 and 26 respectively there must exist positive numbers ι and κ such that 27 λ 1 ι 2 λ 10 28 μ κ λ 1 d 1 where λ 10 denotes the smallest eigenvalue of n 0 n 0 t proof according to the basic properties of a square matrix

delay and quantization in the communication network are taken into account which is different from hao et al 2019b and yan and yu 2018 that only considering the influence of quantization on marine vehicle the range of quantization adjustment and the relation among s e ρ 2 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 and s h ρ 2 e 1 are given in lemma 4 because of the existence of steady time delay parameter the range of quantization adjustment parameter ρ 2 in this paper is d 3 μ λ 2 λ 1 3 1 κ χ e 1 3 λ 2 d λ 1 d 3 λ 2 λ 1 1 δ 2 larger than hao and yang 2013a it should be mentioned that when d 0 it reduces to the traditional results in hao and yang 2013a a larger quantization parameter adjustment range is good for the designer to choose and adjust the larger the range is the less the conservativeness is thus quantization adjustment parameter ρ 2 with state delay parameter d reduces the conservativeness of the umv system design to guarantee the reachability of the sliding mode we have the following theorem

there is no research on quantized sliding mode control of umvs with various thruster faults and state time delay our work is inspired by hao and yang 2013a and owing to the introduction of the delay

parameters of the umv are listed as follows ϕ ˆ s 0 0 5 0 03 1 0 3 5 1 β ˆ 0 0 1 0 01 0 1 0 001 0 01 0 001 in addition we choose the adaptive gains as γ 1 i 1 and γ 2 i 0 001 the quantizer parameters in this paper are set to ρ 1 0 02 δ 1 6 2 δ 2 6 2 and ℑ 407960 to reflect the effectiveness of the presented design of this paper more comprehensively we compare the effects of the controller in this paper with hao et al 2019b without considering state time delay in the simulation the thruster failures occur after t 15 s and the thruster fault case is that port main propeller works healthily starboard main propeller undergoes total fault the time varying thruster stuck fault with ϕ s t s i n 2 t occurs on aft tunnel thruster i aft tunnel thruster ii has been supposed to undergo hard over fault and the hard over fault is frozen at 0 2 bow tunnel thruster is loss of effectiveness 50 and bias fault occurs on bow azimuth thruster the comparison simulation results are shown in figs 2 7 in fig 2 we plot the umv time delay system state error response curves of this paper in red solid lines and the blue dotted lines are the existing results of hao et al 2019b by observing fig 2 it can be obvious that the state errors in this paper eventually tend to zero while the state errors of hao et al 2019b are generally diverging fig 3 shows the controller respectively using the method of hao et al 2019b and the method proposed here when considering the state time delay the designed controller works well in which various faults occur in the faults after 15s and the adjusting time may be longer compared to hao et al 2019b without considering state time delay which means the designed controller in this paper is robust to state time delays quantization and various thruster faults the comparison response curves of the sliding mode surface in this case are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from this picture that the sliding mode surfaces χ 1 χ 2 and χ 3 in this paper converge to small bounded regions around zero which better than hao et al 2019b the dynamic quantization parameter ρ 2 in this paper and hao et al 2019b are plotted in fig 5 which shows that the dynamic quantization parameter in this paper will converge better to zero asymptotically than hao et al 2019b figs 6 and 7 show the estimated values of ϕ ˆ s i and β ˆ i respectively according to these images we can see that the estimated values using the proposed scheme converge while these of hao et al 2019b diverge to some degree 5 conclusion this paper has presented a new sliding mode fault tolerant compensation strategy for umvs with quantization and time delay first a general thruster fault model including bias partial total time varying stuck and hard over faults has been built without the prior knowledge of the lower bound of fault information the quantization parameter adjustment scheme with time delay constant for umvs has been introduced to ensure the arrival condition of the sliding mode then based on sliding mode control theory an adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant controller independent of fault detection and diagnosis mechanism is designed to guarantee the gradual stabilization of the umv system while considering quantization and state time delay simultaneously finally the comparison simulation studies by a typical floating production ship verify the effectiveness of the proposed

21573,this paper deals with the adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant control problem for unmanned marine vehicles umvs with signal quantization and state time delay a unified thruster fault model for umvs is built by taking bias partial total time varying stuck and hard over faults into account for umvs in the network environment the effects of quantization and state time delay on umvs are inevitable in this situation adaptive sliding mode technology and dynamic quantization parameter adjustment strategy are combined to compensate for the quantization errors and time delay effects compared with the traditional method a larger quantization parameter adjustment range is given and a new dynamic quantization parameter adjustment strategy is designed further the quantized sliding mode fault tolerant controller independent of fault detection and diagnosis mechanism is designed for umvs in the presence of time delay and various thruster faults to reduce the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error the comparison simulations of a typical floating production ship have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm keywords adaptive sliding mode control unmanned marine vehicles quantization time delay thruster faults 1 introduction due to advances in communication networks and challenging mission scenarios both theory and engineering research interests in control of unmanned marine vehicles umvs have been increasing over the past three decades wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2019b wang and han 2018 hao et al 2019a b dong et al 2016 wang et al 2018 glotzbach et al 2015 dong et al 2019 hao et al 2020 some interesting study results are shown in the literature on trajectory tracking control dong et al 2016 target tracking control glotzbach et al 2015 dynamic positioning control wang et al 2018 and stabilization control dong et al 2019 the widespread applications of the unmanned marine vehicle umv in practice e g water quality monitoring ocean emergency rescue deep sea exploration coastal patrol make it necessary to have higher accuracy higher performance and reliability in such a context increasing demands for reducing the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error have motivated more and more researchers to investigate this problem wang and han 2018 hao et al 2019a b note that the motion of umvs is always controlled by a remote land based control station the communication between the umv and the control station is completed via communication networks in this case due to the severe communication constraints in the ocean network communication in the sensor to control station is plagued with limited communication bandwidth intermittent failures latency and multi path effects which cause quantization hao et al 2017 yan and yu 2018 xue et al 2018 hao et al 2019b time delay wang and han 2018 wang et al 2018 wang and han 2016 and event trigger zheng et al 2018 ye et al 2019 li and yang 2018 inevitably the existence of quantization errors can lead to performance deterioration of a umv system hao et al 2019b thus it is of paramount importance to reduce its impact on the umv sliding mode technique an effective robust tool is widely adopted to deal with quantization problems hao et al 2019b yan and yu 2018 xue et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 however in the practical situation owing to quantization errors the traditional sliding mode approach can affect the stability of the umv system hao et al 2019b though there are some existing works hao and yang 2013a b hao et al 2017 xue et al 2018 on connecting quantized sliding mode control few results have devoted to the problem of designing quantized sliding mode controller for the umv system addressing this issue is the first motivation of the current research for umvs in the network environment time delay caused by information transfers and processing is usually unavoidable which is a factor affecting the stability of the umv system wang and han 2018 substantial research has been conducted about the communication time delays for marine vehicles t s fuzzy dynamic positioning control for umvs with network induced delays has been addressed in wang et al 2018 as observed by liu et al 2019 a novel distributed control law for multiple marine vessels in the delayed network has been proposed by considering the communication time delay effects fuzzy state feedback depth control of the unmanned underwater vehicle has been studied in yan et al 2018 unfortunately these articles only take time delays into account both time delay and quantization are not considered for the umv in the network environment which is unrealistic though reasonable it is a challenge to deal with quantization and state time delay in the umv system and the presence of the time delay parameter increases the difficulty of dynamic adjustment of the quantization parameter to the best of our knowledge there is no research on the effect of state time delay and quantization on umvs in the literature which is the second motivation of this work the umv is subject to failures in the complex ocean environment thrusters are one of the most common sources of failures hao et al 2019b thruster faults not only may cause the umv not to complete its task but also may lead it to irreversible damage corradini et al 2010 indeed tolerance to thruster faults is the core issue in umv control system deng and yang 2019 the problem of fault tolerant control ye et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 has been largely covered from different viewpoints izadi zamanabadi and blanke 1999 and edwards and spurgeon 2000 have considered the impact of bias additive fault on the ship zhu et al 2008 and blanke and nguyen 2018 have presented a thruster fault tolerant strategy to address the total fault problem huang et al 2014 and dos santos et al 2016 have designed a fault tolerant controller for thruster total fault and partial fault hao et al 2019a has researched fault tolerant control for thruster total partial and time varying faults however they only take one two or three types of thruster faults into consideration which is different from the actual fault situation of the thrusters in practice if the propeller of umvs is jammed heavily the thruster will produce unknown constant forces under this circumstance it may occur hard over fault hao et al 2019b having these in mind based on considering quantization and state time delay the establishment of a unified thruster fault model including partial total bias time varying stuck and hard over failures is practically significant which is the third motivation of this paper motivated by the above discussions a quantized sliding mode controller is designed for umvs with various thruster faults and time delay in this paper the main contributions of this paper are listed as follows 1 since various types of thruster faults may appear in umv operation a unified thruster fault model including partial total time vary stuck bias and hard over faults is established in this paper 2 compared with the existing results in yan and yu 2018 the thruster fault factors and time delay parameter are taken into account in the quantization parameter adjustment strategy which leads to more practical application 3 inspired by hao et al 2019b a larger quantization parameter adjustment range which can reduce to the traditional one in hao and yang 2013a when time delay constant is zero is given the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 control problem formulation including a umv time delay modeling quantizer mechanism and control objective is presented the adaptive quantized sliding mode fault tolerant strategy for umvs with time delay is given in section 3 in section 4 some comparison experiments of the umv time delay system with multitype thruster faults and quantization are carried out and the conclusion

modeling this subsection aims to establish a model for umv with time delay the body fixed equations of motion in surge sway and yaw are described as 1 e ν t f ν t r η t k ϕ f t where e is the matrix of inertia that is e e t 0 f denotes damping r introduces mooring forces and k is the thruster configuration matrix kadiyam et al 2020 ν t ζ t υ t r t t is the linear and angular velocities of the umv defined in the body fixed frame with ζ t υ t and r t denoting the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity respectively η t x p t y p t ψ t t is the position x p t y p t and the yaw angle ψ t of the umv with respect to the earth fixed frame ϕ f t a control vector is defined as 2 ϕ f t α ϕ t β ϕ s t where the diagonal semi positive definite weighting matrix α is the effectiveness of each thruster which belongs to δ α j α j α j d i a g α 1 j α 2 j α m j α i j α i j α i j with the elements 0 α i j α i j α i j 1 where the indexes i i 1 m and j j 1 n denote the i th thruster and the j th fault mode respectively n is the total fault modes β is a diagonal matrix with its diagonal element 0 or 1 the bound of thruster stuck fault ϕ s t satisfies that ϕ s t 2 ϕ s t for clarity and conciseness we summarize the above unified thruster fault model including partial total time varying stuck hard over and bias failures as table 1 remark 1 for the umv equipped with thrusters how to cover various thruster faults in the umv operation and establish a comprehensive thruster failure model in the fault tolerant control are practically important and attractive in the literature throughout this paper we consider various thruster faults such as partial huang et al 2014 dos santos et al 2016 total zhu et al 2008 blanke and nguyen 2018 huang et al 2014 dos santos et al 2016 time varying stuck hao et al 2019a bias izadi zamanabadi and blanke 1999 edwards and spurgeon 2000 and hard over failures in comparison with the above literature the thruster fault model 2 in this paper is more unified which brings more practical application to some degree and 3 η t j ψ t ν t where j cos ψ t sin ψ t 0 sin ψ t c o s ψ t 0 0 0 1 taking the ocean external disturbance q t into account the umv system 1 is converted to 4 ν t t ν t l α ϕ t β ϕ s t q t v η t where t e 1 f l e 1 k and v e 1 r since the yaw angle ψ t is small enough it is obvious that c o s ψ t 1 s i n ψ t 0 and j ψ t i wang and han 2018 then 3 can be rewritten as 5 η t ν t define the umv system state error e t e η t e ν t η t η r e f ν t ν r e f and combine with 4 and 5 then we have 6 e t t e t l α ϕ t β ϕ s t y ξ t where t 0 i v t l 0 l a 1 0 i v 0 i e r e f η r e f ν r e f y ξ t t e r e f a 1 q t as observed from fig 1 the umv and the control station are linked together through the communication network note that communication network channel induced delays of the sensor to control station are unavoidable for the umv in the network environment thus the mathematical model of the umv system 6 is converted into 7 e t t e t t d e t d l α ϕ t β ϕ s t y ξ t e t 0 e 0 where t d is a known constant matrix of appropriate dimension d is a known time delay parameter t 0 denotes the initial instant e 0 r 6 is the initial condition this paper aims at reducing the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error so the controlled output z t can be defined as follows z t c e t where c 0 0 0 0 0 1 for guaranteeing the achievement of the control aim state information can be available and we assume that r a n k l α r a n k l is true and every pair t l ρ is completely stabilizable for all α δ α j j i 1 n 2 2 quantizer model the remote land based control station which is composed of the thruster allocation the adaptive sliding mode controller and the state error calculator is connected to umvs through communication networks before the state vectors η t and ν t pass through the network channel they should be quantized by the quantizer similarly the output φ t of the remote land based control station should be quantized before transmitting to the umv generally a quantizer can be considered as a piecewise constant function h r r h 1 h r where h 1 h r r r are quantization points which satisfies h y y δ i f y σ h y y δ i f y σ where h represents the quantizer y is the quantized variable δ and σ present the error bound and the range of h respectively based on it in this paper we use the single parameter family of quantizer h ρ y ρ h y ρ ρ r o u n d y ρ ρ 0 where h ρ is the uniform quantizer with the quantization parameter ρ if the quantizing level ρ is a fixed value h ρ y is a static quantizer if the quantization sensitivity ρ is a variable number h ρ y is a dynamic quantizer define quantization error e ρ h ρ y y we have 8 e ρ 1 h ρ 1 φ φ δ 1 ρ 1 e ρ 2 h ρ 2 e e δ 2 ρ 2 where h ρ 1 φ is a static quantizer h ρ 2 e is a dynamic quantizer remark 2 it should be mentioned that in this paper the static quantizer and the dynamic quantizer are simultaneously taken into consideration the existence of dynamic quantizers ensures that the states of the umv time delay system under the control laws can reach the sliding mode surface moreover the umv time delay system states can stay on the sliding surface if ρ 2 0 to get a whole definition of the quantizer we have h ρ 2 e 0 when ρ 2 0 2 3 control objective in this paper the control objective is to design a quantized sliding mode controller for attenuating the oscillation of the yaw velocity error of umvs in the presence of communication time delay and various thruster faults and a novel dynamic quantization adjustment range related to the thruster fault factors and time delay parameter is given to reduce the conservative to some degree 3 quantized sliding mode fault tolerant control strategy for umvs with time delay in this section we design an adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant controller for a umv by using quantized signals in the presence of state time delay and various thruster faults and the whole control strategy is shown in fig 1 3 1 switching surface function and stability analysis according to the full rank decomposition of the matrix the control input matrix l becomes 9 l l v n where l v r 6 3 and n r 3 6 to establish the quantized controller more conveniently the parameter ı 0 is introduced to increase design flexibility 10 l v 1 ı l v 0 n ı n 0 the switching surface function is chosen for the umv state time delay system 7 as follows 11 ξ e χ e s e t l v t m 1 e t 0 where m is a positive matrix to be designed in the following theorem which ensures the stability of the sliding motion theorem 1 supposed that the umv state time delay system 7 with thrusters employs the switching surface function 11 for a given scalar γ 0 0 if there is a positive matrix m and matrix x such that the lmi in 12 is feasible for all α j δ α j j i 1 n then the 3 reduced order sliding mode on the sliding surface χ e 0 is asymptotically stable and the h performance

1999 the above reduced order umv time delay system 14 is asymptotically stable and the h performance indicator is no larger than γ 0 if there exists a positive definite matrix p such that 15 holds for any g 0 15 t 11 p p t 11 t t d 11 g 1 t d 11 t p g p γ 0 2 y 1 y 1 t p c 1 t c 1 p 0 by defining p l v t m l v 0 g p 1 l v t m 2 l v p 1 we obtain l v t t m l v l v t m t t l v l v t m 2 l v l v t γ 0

affected by some factors such as the matrices x and m obtained by solving lmi upper bound of delay parameter the loss of effectiveness factors of thrusters and so on when it comes to the operational limits the wind wave and flow are the main restrictions which affect the performance of the umv system 3 2 adaptive quantized sliding mode ftc law design for the umv time delay system 7 with the effect of various thruster faults and quantization the quantized sliding mode fault tolerant controller is designed as follows 17 φ t φ 1 t φ 2 t φ 1 t k h ρ 2 e φ 2 t θ e t n t s i g n s h ρ 2 e where 18 θ e t 1 κ 1 ϒ 1 n δ 1 ρ 1 n x m 1 δ 2 ρ 2 i 1 m n i 1 β i t ϕ s i t ε where ϒ 1 μ λ 1 d κ 3 λ 2 d k x m 1 x and m are designed in theorem 1 λ 1 and λ 2 denote the smallest eigenvalue and the biggest eigenvalue of n n t respectively the design of μ and κ satisfies lemmas 1 and 4 respectively and ϕ s i t and β ˆ t are the estimate of ϕ s i t and β t respectively moreover they are updated by 19 ϕ ˆ s i t γ 1 i 1 ϒ 1 s h ρ 2 e 1 n i 1 20 β ˆ t γ 2 i 1 ϒ 1 s h ρ 2 e 1 n i 1 ϕ ˆ s i where i 1 m k 1 q γ 1 i and γ 2 i designed on the basis of practical application represent the adaptive law gains and the bounded initial values of ϕ ˆ s i and β ˆ are defined as ϕ ˆ s i 0 ϕ s i 0 and β ˆ 0 β i 0 respectively define 21 ϕ s t ϕ ˆ t ϕ s 22 β t β ˆ t β note that the derivatives of β i and ϕ s i are zero we have 23 ϕ s t ϕ ˆ s t 24 β t β ˆ t in what follows based on the quantized sliding mode fault tolerant controller 17 and the adaptive laws 19 20 the following theorem drives the umv time delay system state e into a band area and state e finally tends to the origin under the effect of dynamic quantization adjustment before giving the main results of this paper the former works of the authors have been shown to maintain the completeness here lemma 1 hao and yang 2013b for the full rank decomposition of matrix l l v n there exists a positive scalar μ such that 25 n α n t μ n n t for all α δ α j j i 1 n where l r p q l v r p x and n r x q lemma 2 hao and yang 2013b if the inequality 25 holds there exists α δ α j j i 1 n such that 26 χ t n α n t s i g n χ μ λ 1 χ 1 where λ 1 is the smallest eigenvalue of the positive matrix n n t based on the above lemmas the main results will be given in the following lemma 3 by noting that n n 0 and μ are given in 9 10 and 26 respectively there must exist positive numbers ι and κ such that 27 λ 1 ι 2 λ 10 28 μ κ λ 1 d 1 where λ 10 denotes the smallest eigenvalue of n 0 n 0 t proof according to the basic properties of a square matrix eigenvalue it is easy to get 27 holds if we choose any ι 0 one gets λ 1 by 27 then κ μ λ 1 d h 0 holds for arbitrary small positive scalar h from μ 0 1 it can be shown that κ μ λ 1 d λ 1 d where d is steady time delay parameter this concludes the proof lemma 4 considering δ 2 the matrix n and the sliding surface χ e in 8 9 and 11 respectively there exists a sufficient small scalar ρ 2 0 that satisfies 29 ρ 2 χ e 1 ϒ 2 s 1 δ 2 then the following inequality holds 30 s e ρ 2 1 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 ϒ 1 s h ρ 2 e 1 where ϒ 1 μ λ 1 d κ 3 λ 2 d ϒ 2 λ 1 d 3 λ 2 d μ λ 1 d κ proof since 8 holds it is not difficult to obtain 31 s e ρ 2 1 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 let the both sides of 29 multiply 3 λ 2 d λ 1 d s 1 δ 2 one has 32 3 λ 2 d λ 1 d s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 μ λ 1 d κ χ e 1 by 28 it follows that 33 3 λ 2 d μ λ 1 d κ s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 3 λ 2 d λ 1 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 taking 32 and 33 into account and dividing it by 3 λ 2 d we can get 34 1 ϒ 1 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 ϒ 1 χ e 1 subtracting ϒ 1 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 from both sides of 34 the following inequality can be obtained s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 ϒ 1 χ e 1 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 based on the virtue of the triangle basic inequality a b a b for a r b r it is derived from 8 that χ e 1 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 χ e 1 s 1 e ρ 2 1 s e e ρ 2 1 the following relation holds e e ρ 2 h ρ 2 e so one has 35 s e ρ 2 1 ϒ 1 s h ρ 2 e 1 combining 31 with 35 30 can be obtained hence the proof is completed remark 4 in this paper state time delay and quantization in the communication network are taken into account which is different from hao et al 2019b and yan and yu 2018 that only considering the influence of quantization on marine vehicle the range of quantization adjustment and the relation among s e ρ 2 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 and s h ρ 2 e 1 are given in lemma 4 because of the existence of steady time delay parameter the range of quantization adjustment parameter ρ 2 in this paper is d 3 μ λ 2 λ 1 3 1 κ χ e 1 3 λ 2 d λ 1 d 3 λ 2 λ 1 1 δ 2 larger than hao and yang 2013a it should be mentioned that when d 0 it reduces to the traditional results in hao and yang 2013a a larger quantization parameter adjustment range is good for the designer to choose and adjust the larger the range is the less the conservativeness is thus quantization adjustment parameter ρ 2 with state delay parameter d reduces the conservativeness of the umv system design to guarantee the reachability of the sliding mode we have the following theorem based on the above mentioned lemmas theorem 2 consider the umv state time delay system 7 with signal quantization based on the sliding surface is designed in 11 the quantized sliding mode ftc laws are

e t e t 2 ℑ ρ 2 t 0 under the dynamic adjustment of the quantization parameter ρ 2 t and the state of the umv time delay system will eventually tend to the origin once the umv time delay system state enters into the boundary layer region ℵ we have 46 χ e s e t 0 ϒ 2 s 1 δ 2 ρ 2 t 0 1 ε 0 where 0 0 1 combining the umv time delay system 7 with 46 one can obtain 47 e 1 t t 11 e 1 t t d 11 e 1 t d y 1

remark 5 in this section we design a quantized sliding mode fault tolerant controller for the umv time delay system 7 noting that the signals of umv system in network environments may occur state time delay and signal quantization however the above literature hao et al 2019b yan and yu 2018 only discuss the quantization effect on marine vehicles and neglect the consideration of time delay that is there is no research on quantized sliding mode control of umvs with various thruster faults and state time delay our work is inspired by hao and yang 2013a and owing to the introduction of the delay parameter d the adjustment range of the quantization parameter ρ 2 becomes larger than hao and yang 2013a 4 simulation analysis and discussion in this section similar to wang and han 2018 which has carried out actual experiments on umvs simulations are performed to demonstrate the validity of the controller proposed in this paper by a typical floating production ship based on the bis system

parameters of the umv are listed as follows ϕ ˆ s 0 0 5 0 03 1 0 3 5 1 β ˆ 0 0 1 0 01 0 1 0 001 0 01 0 001 in addition we choose the adaptive gains as γ 1 i 1 and γ 2 i 0 001 the quantizer parameters in this paper are set to ρ 1 0 02 δ 1 6 2 δ 2 6 2 and ℑ 407960 to reflect the effectiveness of the presented design of this paper more comprehensively we compare the effects of the controller in this paper with hao et al 2019b without considering state time delay in the simulation the thruster failures occur after t 15 s and the thruster fault case is that port main propeller works healthily starboard main propeller undergoes total fault the time varying thruster stuck fault with ϕ s t s i n 2 t occurs on aft tunnel thruster i aft tunnel thruster ii has been supposed to undergo hard over fault and the hard over fault is frozen at 0 2 bow tunnel thruster is loss of effectiveness 50 and bias fault occurs on bow azimuth thruster the comparison simulation results are shown in figs 2 7 in fig 2 we plot the umv time delay system state error response curves of this paper in red solid lines and the blue dotted lines are the existing results of hao et al 2019b by observing fig 2 it can be obvious that the state errors in this paper eventually tend to zero while the state errors of hao et al 2019b are generally diverging fig 3 shows the controller respectively using the method of hao et al 2019b and the method proposed here when considering the state time delay the designed controller works well in which various faults occur in the faults after 15s and the adjusting time may be longer compared to hao et al 2019b without considering state time delay which means the designed controller in this paper is robust to state time delays quantization and various thruster faults the comparison response curves of the sliding mode surface in this case are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from this picture that the sliding mode surfaces χ 1 χ 2 and χ 3 in this paper converge to small bounded regions around zero which better than hao et al 2019b the dynamic quantization parameter ρ 2 in this paper and hao et al 2019b are plotted in fig 5 which shows that the dynamic quantization parameter in this paper will converge better to zero asymptotically than hao et al 2019b figs 6 and 7 show the estimated values of ϕ ˆ s i and β ˆ i respectively according to these images we can see that the estimated values using the proposed scheme converge while these of hao et al 2019b diverge to some degree 5 conclusion this paper has presented a new sliding mode fault tolerant compensation strategy for umvs with quantization and time delay first a general thruster fault model including bias partial total time varying stuck and hard over faults has been built without the prior knowledge of the lower bound of fault information the quantization parameter adjustment scheme with time delay constant for umvs has been introduced to ensure the arrival condition of the sliding mode then based on sliding mode control theory an adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant controller independent of fault detection and diagnosis mechanism is designed to guarantee the gradual stabilization of the umv system while considering quantization and state time delay simultaneously finally the comparison simulation studies by a typical floating production ship verify the effectiveness of the proposed control law in the future some cyber attacks and quantization mismatch problems will be considered credit authorship contribution statement li ying hao conceptualization methodology he zhang writing

21574,the present study includes experimental and numerical investigations on propeller cavitation phenomena particularly the tip vortex cavitation for the test cases conducted with the model propeller of the newcastle university research vessel the princess royal these test cases were recommended recently as the benchmark data for cavitation observations and noise measurements by the ittc and have been tested in a major round robin campaign by eight cavitation tunnel basin facilities around the world this round robin test campaign included the newcastle emerson cavitation tunnel where

cavitation tunnel tests efd cfd 1 introduction cavitation is a complex fluid dynamics phenomenon that can be produced on a range of hydro power machines such as francis turbines and marine propellers carlton 2007 in certain circumstances such as the marine propeller this can result in propeller efficiency reduction together with underwater radiated noise erosion and vibration excitation problems cavitation phenomena should be investigated and observed accurately to predict propeller performance and underwater radiated noise although cfd methods are currently able to predict propeller powering performance in cavitating conditions thanks to continuing developments in software and computational power cavitation tunnel test experiments are still considered the most reliable and accurate way to investigate propeller cavitation in wake fields and the effects on propeller total performance in this research field various test results were published in open literature using a variety of procedures and approaches e g atlar et al 2013 aktas et al 2016a tani et al 2017a b etc the recently completed european framework fp7 included a collaborative research project sonic sonic 2012 which used the university of newcastle unew catamaran research vessel the princess royal atlar et al 2013 to investigate the underwater radiated noise from the vessel s cavitating propellers comprehensive model tests and full scale trials were conducted from which associated data were collected as the benchmark data for other researchers a continuation of this research saw the model propeller of the princess royal being tested by eight major cavitation tunnels and wave basin facilities around the world under a unique round robin test campaign which included the newcastle emerson cavitation tunnel ect where the first set of the round robin tests were conducted aktas et al 2015 results from the ect have been published and compared with tests conducted in the university of genoa unige cavitation tunnel by tani et al 2017a b similar cavitation tests and noise measurement studies using the princess royal propeller were published in a recent amt conference amt17 conference proceedings by the major cavitation tunnel and marine research facilities from all around the world lafeber and lloyd 2017 performed the tests in marin s depressurized wave basin to evaluate propeller performance in open water and cavitating conditions and to measure the underwater radiated noise characteristic of this propeller in addition to these measurements and calculations they have also evaluated the effect of cavitation nuclei which is one of the important scale effects beside the viscous scale effect on cavitation inception using an electrolysis system to generate the bubbles lafeber and lloyd 2017 tani et al conducted similar cavitation and noise measurement tests at the unige and compared results with those from the ect aktas et al 2016a b a similar study was also published by hallander 2017 including open water cavitation and noise measurement tests conducted in the large sspa cavitation tunnel as a part of the round robin test campaign recently the results of this round robin test programme was reported by tani et al 2019 with the aim of comparing results among several institutes i e university of genova unige university of newcastle unew nmri sspa kriso cnr inm and marin in order to compare the different approaches and cavitation observations and noise measurement capabilities further tests were conducted in non uniform flow in the ect using scaled models of the propeller a dummy demi hull model of the princess royal catamaran and its rudder these cavitation test results and noise measurement were published by aktas et al 2016 a b results from the cavitation

equation 3 and 3 cavitation numbers σ using j and kt equation 4 similarities the test conditions and test matrix from other institutions have been investigated and the new test matrix has been prepared for this study using the aforementioned j and kt similarities although the experimental approach is still the most reliable way the computational modelling of cavitation including tip and hub vortex cavitation in a propeller s slipstream is the dominant challenge for cfd users while the prediction of cavitation on the propeller blade surfaces has been tackled by many researchers there is a scarcity of efforts which have achieved extending the tip vortex cavitation from all blades simultaneously and reaching rudder especially at large rudder propeller separations hence the validation the cfd propeller cavitation modelling with efd results are so limited due to the lack of accurate modelling of the observed tip vortex cavitation there are many numerical studies in literature to predict tip vortex cavitation e g lee 2002 hsiao and pauley 1998 lee and kinnas 2004 hsiao and chahine 2008 park et al 2009 peng et al 2013 using especially cfd methods in which rans based models for the simulation of tip vortex cavitation of marine propellers are preferred gaggero et al 2014 although the rans model is recognised as a reliable method for sheet cavitation simulations further studies are still required particularly for accurate modelling of tip vortex cavitation gaggero et al 2014 recently numerical modelling of the tip vortex cavitation phenomenon has been the focal point by some researchers using cfd methods and commercial codes such modelling has created adapted mesh refinement regions around and downstream of the propeller tip area for capturing cavity bubbles in the slipstream amongst them windt and bosschers applied an adaptive mesh refinement approach for a wing and a propeller by using the jump based estimator with the in house cfd code refresco although this adaptive mesh refinement improved the accuracy of the predictions for the wing good results could not be obtained for the propeller which required further investigations windt and bosschers 2015 by using the same code another adaptive mesh refinement approach was recently used by lloyd et al 2017 for cavitation simulations on a propeller in this study the tip vortex cavitation was simulated for the key blade only and not for all the blades simultaneously viitanen and siikonen also simulated a single blade of a model scale marine propeller in cavitating conditions with a novel compressible homogenous flow model and by solving phase volume fractions viitanen and siikonen 2017 the results showed good agreement not only for the propeller performance coefficient and local flow phenomena but also the tip vortex cavitation extension in the propeller slipstream budich et al 2015 applied a mesh alignment technique to improve the accuracy of the propeller wake structure for capturing the tip vortex cavitation including compressible shock wave dynamics phillips and turnock have also applied an improved version of the vortfind algorithm increasing the mesh resolution to have sufficient mesh density for capturing vortex cores to investigate the propeller rudder and hull interaction phillips and turnock 2011 however this study is not for cavitating vortex flow zhu et al 2017 also tested several parameters of computational grid and numerical algorithm in order to predict the length of the tip vortex cavitation and validate a developed approach a key finding of this study was defined as the effect of the turbulence model and advanced grid methods for predicting tip vortex cavitation fujiyama et al 2011 also created a fine mesh region around the tip area of the pptc vp1304 propeller with a level shaft to capture tip vortex cavitation using a rans model and sc tetra cfd software with this mesh refinement the cavitation pattern was simulated on blade surfaces and moreover a small extension of tip vortex cavitation was observed to this end yilmaz et al 2019 proposed an advanced mesh refinement method marcs for capturing tip vortex cavitation in a propeller s slipstream in a study using the insean e779a propeller marcs allowed a further extension of the tvc in the propeller slipstream to be achieved in spite of these recent review studies of experimental and computational investigations of propeller cavitation phenomena an important research gap remains the open literature has not satisfactorily demonstrated the full simulation of propeller tip vortex cavitation from all propeller blades in a simultaneous manner in a wake field also although comprehensive experimental data in benchmark nature have been produced on the princess royal propeller there has not been a dedicated cfd study to compare these benchmark data to demonstrate the further capability of the cfd methods in challenging tip vortex modelling the present paper therefore aims to make such a contribution by modelling the tip vortex cavitation from all blades of the princess royal propeller simultaneously by developing a new and efficient meshing approach in combination with a state of the art commercial cfd code for validation with experimental results this paper also aims to make a contribution towards creating a methodology for propeller cavitation investigations including tip vortex cavitation extension by using experimental and numerical approaches with solution verification and validation methods finally the paper presents another set of experimental data based on the tests in the sjtu cavitation tunnel on the princess royal propeller to widen the range of the ongoing benchmark propeller cavitation and noise test data the paper continues with the presentation of the experimental investigations including details of the cavitation tunnel propeller details test conditions and procedures and tests results at 2 the numerical investigations of the propeller cavitation simulations are presented at 3 and include mesh generation marcs numerical methods and cavitation results concluding remarks and suggestions for future work are presented in 4 2 experimental investigations the princess royal propeller has been tested in the shanghai jiao tong university sjtu cavitation tunnel fig 1 for this study general dimensions specifications and limitations of the cavitation tunnel and main particulars of the princess royal propeller are given in 2 1 and 2 2 respectively 2 1 sjtu cavitation tunnel this modern cavitation tunnel has a test section which is 6 1 m in length and its cross section is 1 m 1 m with rounded corners the axial flow velocity range for the test section is from 0 5 m s to 15 8 m s and the range of the static pressure at the centreline of the test section can be varied from 25 kpa to 300 kpa the non uniformity of the axial flow velocity is below 1 the tunnel is equipped with a computer control and measurement system a general view of this new tunnel is shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows the close view of the testing section and the propeller dynamometer used in the cavitation tests the measuring ranges of the dynamometer are 1500 n for the thrust and 75 nm for the torque respectively the non linearity and non repeatability of measured thrust and torque are both below 0 2 fs the propeller model is driven by an ac servo motor via bevel geared shafts within a max rotating speed range of 1998 rpm the cavitation observations were achieved with camera recordings aided with stroboscopic lighting synchronized with a shaft position signal this enabled freezing the image due to the triggered flash provided by the strobe lights fig 3 shows the stroboscopic light and the camera used during the cavitation tests the water quality and temperature of the sjtu cavitation tunnel is monitored throughout all cavitation tests as it has a significant impact on the measurements the tunnel water is thus brought to 30 total gas content as suggested by the ittc 2011 1987 fig 3 also shows the equipment required for the cavitation observation tests a indicates the test section b and c respectively show the digital camera and stroboscopic light for recording and capturing cavitation images d indicates the plexiglas material thickness 80 mm for side and bottom windows between the test section and water tank and e indicates the water tank with a hydrophone which was situated below the test section and observation window at the bottom of the testing section the two environments tunnel and tank are separated by plexiglas which allows the environmental conditions of the water to remain the same for measuring noise as if the hydrophone were in the tunnel the noise data was measured by a brüel kjær 8103 hydrophone its frequency range is 0 1 hz 180 khz and the sensitivity is 211 db re 1 v μpa 2 db the lan xi model type 3161 made by brüel kjær is utilized for data acquisition and analysis although the results of the noise data are not included in this paper due to the scope of this research study the principal author also conducted noise measurements as part of this test programme 2 2 the princess royal propeller as stated in the introduction part of this paper the princess royal propeller was used in this study since it was recommended as a benchmark propeller for cavitation observations and noise measurements by ittc 2017 to complement this round robin campaign for cavitation tests and noise measurements the propeller model was manufactured by sjtu using propeller data table and cad file which was provided by the university of strathclyde uos as one of the members of this campaign the model propeller was manufactured to 3 41 scale factor resulting in a model propeller diameter of 0 22 m for sjtu model propeller main particulars of the propeller and image of the manufactured propeller are given in table 1 and fig 4 respectively atlar et al 2013 2 3 test conditions and procedures tests for open water performance cavitation observation and both tip vortex cavitation inception and desinence were conducted in this order noise measurements were carried out and recorded during the cavitation observation tests before starting open water tests a dummy hub without propeller blades was tested and thrust and torque values were recorded in order to calculate propeller performance coefficients correctly after that open water tests were conducted using 3 different shaft rotation speeds namely 18 25 and 33 3 rps the last being the maximum for the sjtu tunnel the open water results were evaluated and compared to each other as thrust coefficient kt torque coefficient 10kq equation 5 and open water efficiency η0 equation 6 although the open water tests are commonly conducted in a towing tank propeller performance coefficients can also be measured in cavitation tunnels under similar atmospheric conditions which are corrected by appropriate channel effect correction for the cavitation observations the model propeller was tested at 12 different cavitating conditions comprising 2 different advance coefficients j and 3 cavitation numbers σ using j and kt similarities also 3 different cavitation number pressure conditions were designated respectively as the atmospheric low and high vacuum conditions in order to complement the ongoing round robin tests the test conditions and test matrix of the participating institutions were investigated and the new test matrix was prepared for this study using j and kt similarity table 2 according to the capabilities of the sjtu tunnel the cavitation conditions correspond to cavitation numbers σ 13 9 8 1 and 4 5 5 5 respectively although the σ 4 5 condition can be tested for j 0 5 the same condition cannot be tested for j 0 4 due to the lowest pressure limit of the cavitation tunnel for this reason the lowest possible pressure for j 0 4 achieved a cavitation condition close to σ 5 5 the cavitation number based on rotational speed σ n of the propeller is calculated as in equation 1 1 σ n p p s a t 0 5 ρ n d 2 where p is the tunnel centreline pressure p sat is the vapour pressure ρ is the density of the fluid n is the rotation rate and d is the diameter of the propeller the reynolds number re at a reference point on the propeller blade generally accepted as the radius 0 7 r r is one of the essential non dimensional parameters for the cavitation tunnel tests equation 2 specifies this value the model scale re remains far from the full scale value but it is recommended to be as high as possible to ensure turbulent flow over the propeller blade surfaces thus minimising scale effects it is suggested that re should have a minimum value of 2 105 for the cavitation tests ittc 2011 2008 2 r e c 0 7 r v 2 0 7 π n d 2 ν finally the tip vortex cavitation inception and desinence tests were conducted using the naked eye in conjunction with video recordings the results were compared with those of unige and unew as presented by tani et al 2017a b 2 4 results the results of the cavitation tests including open water propeller performance cavitation inception and desinence and cavitation observations are presented in the following sections 2 4 1 propeller open water performance open water tests were also conducted before the cavitation observation tests the tests at three different propeller rates of revolutions show the results are largely independent of re effect tests performed at the unige cavitation tunnel allowed investigation of the effect of the reynolds number on delivered thrust and torque for values ranging from 7 6 105 to 1 9 106 tani et al 2017a b for calculating propeller performance coefficients kt 10kq and η0 and drawing propeller performance curves the advance ratio is defined as in equation 3 3 j v a n d where v a is the advance velocity of the flow thrust and torque coefficients were calculated from equations 4 and 5 4 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 5 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where t and q are thrust and torque values of the propeller respectively the propeller open water efficiency is defined as in equation 6 6 η 0 j 2 π k t k q fig 5 shows the open water performance curves of the model propeller which were plotted based on the measurements at three different re numbers averaged deviation of around 1 the results indicate somewhat consistent performance data regarding different re numbers for the three sets of shaft rpm and providing further confidence on the measurements for the re number effect 2 4 2 cavitation inception and desinence tests tip vortex cavitation inception and desinence tests were also conducted and the recordings were made by the naked eye the results of these tests are compared in fig 6 with the results of unige and unew recorded in the literature tani et al 2017a b this comparison shows a significant difference in terms of kt against cavitation number such differences are known to be sensitive to propeller leading edge finish gas contents water quality turbulent intensity of the cavitation tunnels and reynolds number effects e g korkut 1999 in addition the method of recording the inception and desinence points differs from one institute to another tani et al 2017a b at unige and unew cavitation images were recorded by high speed video camera while in the sjtu cavitation tunnel by the naked eye which often presents difficulties for recording inception in the propeller slipstream therefore inception and desinence can be described in three different ways the first is attaching the cavitation bubbles to the propeller surface or attached type and the second is the cavity bubbles appearing and disappearing in the propeller slipstream without attaching to the propeller blade travelling type and third is the vortex type arakeri 1978 in these tests tip vortex cavitation inception was recorded when the cavitating bubbles were seen to attach to the propeller tip as shown in fig 7 and recorded results were compared with the inception tests conducted at unige and unew s ec tunnels in spite of the different facilities different model sizes and different approaches the trend and correlations for the inception and desinence data from the three institutions are in respectable agreement this brings to the authors attention other possible effect related to the propeller whose speed profile may vary from one facility to another as the main flow characteristic of each facility a further aspect regarding the propeller inflow which may influence the cavitation inception significantly is the inflow turbulence intensity as discussed in korkut et al 2000 and korkut and atlar 2002 water quality is another aspect that significantly influences cavitation inception and desinence especially in the case of tip vortex cavitation overall differences observed seem remarkable especially keeping in mind that tests are carried out with relatively simple and easily repeatable uniform inflow configuration 2 4 3 cavitation tests and observations as stated above the cavitation observations were made by the naked eye using a still camera and stroboscopic lighting synchronized with a shaft position signal the images were captured and the data were recorded when the cavitation inception was seen by the naked eye from the side window of the cavitation tunnel the cavitation test matrix followed those of tani et al 2017a b table 2 although the comparisons do not exist in this paper it is planned to be published on upcoming papers the observed cavitation patterns on the blades and tip vortex cavitation extent showed good agreement when compared with results from marin sspa unige and unew hallander 2017 lafeber and lloyd 2017 tani et al 2017a b fig 8 shows cavitating propeller performance coefficients efd calculated from cavitation test results and compared to those obtained from the non cavitating open water tests thrust and torque values were measured during the cavitation observation tests where an extra axial force was generated in the opposite direction to the thrust force due to the presence of the dynamometer when the negative effect of the dynamometer on the propeller thrust was taken into account no significant difference was found between performance characteristics kt kq and η0 for non cavitating and cavitation conditions when the results were compared each other non cavitating vs cavitating kt kq and η0 showed a difference but with the same trend fig 8 figs 9 and 10 shows the observed cavitation images at j 0 4 and j 0 5 respectively for the same shaft speed n 33 3 rps while the tunnel flow velocity and vacuum were adjusted according to the test conditions specified in the test matrix as it was expected the extent and strength of the sheet and tip vortex cavitation were more intense at j 0 4 than j 0 5 due to the loading of the model propeller cavitation tunnel tests for condition c1 at j 0 4 kt equivalent of condition 7 and c4 at j 0 5 kt equivalent of condition c10 were conducted with the lightest vacuum level applied on the tunnel which corresponded to the highest cavitation number the observed cavitation in c1 condition therefore displayed the smallest sheet cavitation extent on the blades up to 0 9r with a just visible tip vortex cavitation in the propeller slipstream while c4 condition displayed hardly visible inception of tip vortex cavitation due to lighter loading when the cavitation number was decreased further in condition c2 and c3 at j 0 4 and for condition c5 and c6 at j 0 5 the extent and strength of the developed sheet and tip vortex cavitation were increased accordingly condition c3 displayed the most heavily loaded condition with the smallest cavitation number and hence the sheet cavitation extent and strength were at maximum almost like a supercavitating state for the model propeller as a result the regular helical pattern of the strong tip vortex cavitation observed in condition c2 was deformed and replaced in condition c3 by the dispersed and cloudy appearance of the tip vortex cavity sheet wrapped around the propeller s slipstream with reducing diameter at downstream the cavitation dynamics at this condition was extremely complex displaying the eventual bursting phenomenon when the strong sheet cavitation was trailed by the short and extremely thick bursting tip vortex cavitation which dispersed quickly wrapping around the propeller slipstream the above described cavitation patterns for a shaft inclination of zero degrees showed good agreement with the results at the same shaft angle published by other research facilities hallander 2017 lafeber and lloyd 2017 and tani et al 2017a b participating in the round robin tests of the htf these partners of the htf conducted further tests at different shaft inclination conditions while these could not be repeated in the sjtu tunnel due to the limitations of the test equipment at the facility 3 numerical investigations having conducted the model tests at the sjtu cavitation tunnel the next step was to simulate the same propeller s cavitation performance using cfd especially for the tip vortex cavitation by using the principal author s newly developed meshing refinement approach marcs yilmaz et al 2019 this is explained in detail in the following sections together with comparisons of the corresponding cfd results with the efd results 3 1 mesh generation mesh adaption refinement approach for cavitation simulations marcs an advanced mesh refinement approach for capturing tip vortex cavitation tvc in a propeller slipstream was proposed yilmaz et al 2017 and preliminary results were presented for a limited range of tvc extents for the benchmark propeller model of insean e779a in open water the proposed method was further developed by using the same propeller model and further extension of the tvc in the propeller slipstream was achieved yilmaz et al 2019 this new mesh adaptive mesh refinement approach which is called marcs mesh adaption and refinement approach to cavitation simulation subsequently was applied on the princess royal propeller model in open water allowing a greater extension of the tvc modelling in the slipstream the details of the marcs methods are given in yilmaz et al 2019 and yilmaz 2019 hence will not be repeated here since the reader can refer to those references while marcs had been applied successfully to simulate the tip vortex cavitation trajectories of the insean e779a propeller the approach needed to be improved further for the princess royal propeller the modification was required to reduce the total number of cells while the refinement region needed to be extended in the slipstream this was because of more demanding modelling requirements of the princess royal propeller due to the large clearance between the propeller and rudder for the modified version of marcs firstly the volumetric control region spiral geometry was removed from the settings of the mesh generation secondly having defined the required surface size less than 0 25 mm cell width was also removed from the refinement process the refinement field function therefore was modified as follows refinement absolutepressure 17000 absolutepressure 3800 0 00035 0 in marcs the adaptive mesh refinement was created only in the region where the tip vortex cavitation could occur at the beginning of this application the upper limit of absolute pressure in the solution was determined by creating a threshold region in star ccm fig 11 in such cavitation simulations the volume fraction of vapour shows the volume where the absolute pressure is below the saturation pressure of water thus identifying the volume in which cavitation is occurring a threshold region was created by increasing the saturation pressure from the default saturation pressure 3800 pa used by star ccm to a higher value 17 000 pa thus generating the pink region shown in fig 11 this artifice provided an indication of the volumetric trajectory on which to generate a fine mesh for accurately capturing the pressure drop correctly and tracking the cavity bubbles in the propeller slipstream following this modification figs 11 and 12 respectively show the threshold below 17000 pa and the subsequent mesh generated using the marcs approach the y value was around 1 for propeller blades and shaft by using 12 prism layers and approximately 1 mm total thickness fig 13 presents the modified flow chart summarising the new marcs approach for cavitation simulations after removing the volumetric control region and modifying the field function as stated earlier having conducted the modification on marcs for reducing total number of cells the next modification was made on the mechanism to detect the tendency for cavitation as stated earlier the initial mechanism used for this purpose was the increase in the default value of the saturated vapour pressure however this can be replaced by using a vorticity based approach q criterion according to the requirements of the simulations these include more complex applications e g flow non uniformity due to hull wake inclined shaft and propeller rudder hull interaction etc as well as better representation of the flow physics relating to the nature of cavitation inception these two modifications therefore were applied to marcs as further developments and the associated flow chart was updated as shown in fig 13 3 2 theoretical and numerical models for the cavitation simulations of the princess royal propeller different turbulence models were applied and compared with each other not only for the propeller performance coefficients but also for cavitation patterns and tip vortex cavitation extents although the rans turbulence model was sufficient for modelling the open water performance coefficients of the propellers the scale resolving models such as des and les were preferred for simulating cavitation details les is also recommended in the user guide of star ccm for complex turbulent flows such as in modelling cavitation and especially the tip vortex cavitation for the cavitation simulations the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale subgrid scale model was used in the les model after the selection of the suitable turbulence model for the tip vortex cavitation simulations of the princess royal propeller different time step values were tried based on the time steps recommended by ittc initially the time step was calculated such that the propeller rotates between 0 5 and 2 per time step ittc 2014 finally a time step value of δt 5x10 5 s corresponding to 0 648 deg of propeller rotation was used for the princess royal propeller a sliding mesh approach was used to model the motion describing the rotation of the propeller for cavitation modelling while a volume of fluid vof model was used in describing the multiphase flow the schnerr sauer model was used as a cavitation model in star ccm as described in the starccm user guide 2018 while the first order discretisation scheme was used for discretising the governing equations in time the bounded central differencing scheme was used for the same purpose in space this scheme is recommended for the les model to represent the complex turbulent flows such as cavitation in star ccm user guide 2018 the propeller performance coefficients were calculated by using the converged thrust and torque values corresponding to at least four revolutions of the propeller 3 3 results 3 3 1 grid and time step sensitivity a grid and time step sensitivity study was performed for the princess royal propeller in cavitating condition c2 table 2 four different grids coarse medium fine and very fine and three time step conditions for fine grid were simulated fig 14 shows images of the different computational grids while table 3 shows the details of these different grids for the grid sensitivity study this study was conducted at j 0 4 using r 2 and les turbulence model which gave the best results compared to the rans and des models relating to the extension of the tip vortex cavitation for the time step sensitivity study the three time step conditions were applied for the fine mesh coarse 2δt medium δt and fine δt 2 the fine time step was defined as δt 5x10 5 the results for the propeller performance coefficients from these studies for grid and time sensitivity are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively fig 15 also presents the convergence type for the grid sensitivity study in terms of kt it can be seen that while this study for coarse medium and fine meshes shows a monotonic type convergence the results for the medium fine and very fine mesh demonstrate an oscillatory convergence behaviour due to the differences of the convergence types the uncertainty values were calculated using the gre generalised richardson extrapolation for the monotonic convergence and the upper and lower limits for the oscillatory convergence table 6 shows the numerical uncertainty calculations for the grid and time step sensitivity studies in addition to kt and kq the numerical uncertainties have also been calculated for cavitation volume for the different types of cavitation as presented in table 7 complementary to the uncertainty calculations for cavity volume fig 16 shows the cavitation patterns including tip vortex cavitation extent in the propeller slipstream due to the different mesh refinements table 7 and fig 16 also demonstrate that the uncertainty values for the tip vortex cavitation predictions are much higher than the sheet cavitation and thus adaptive mesh refinement is required to solve the tip vortex cavitation accurately the images of the cavity extent also prove that smaller grid size refinement size 0 25 mm is essential to be able to extend tip vortex type cavitation the error between cfd and efd results e uncertainties of validation u v experimental tests u d and numerical simulations u sn were calculated for kt and kq where the equation u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 was used and previous data uncertainty and iterative uncertainty were neglected the deviations between calculated and measured values in cavitating conditions are not too great 2 8 for thrust and 6 2 for torque coefficients despite the deviation being small between efd and cfd results uncertainty for the experimental tests was assumed to be 2 e uv and as such kt and kq could not be validated for grid 1 c m and f and grid 2 m f and vf due to a small uv value on the other hand kt can be accepted for both grids due to the small error values between the efd and cfd results the simulations must be evaluated critically by taking into consideration the error in the kq value which is still higher than 5 although kt and kq values cannot be validated at the uv level fig 16 demonstrates that smaller surface size and mesh refinement where the cavitation may possibly occur in propeller slipstream helps to improve the accuracy of the tip vortex cavitation extent 3 3 2 propeller performance table 8 compares the propeller thrust coefficients from the efd and cfd simulations including the sheet and tip vortex cavitation it can be concluded that while the marcs approach could improve the tip vortex cavitation extension it did not help to improve the propeller thrust the propeller performance coefficients kt and kq were also compared between the efd and cfd results including the tip vortex cavitation while the comparisons showed good agreement for thrust 2 5 3 5 torque was underpredicted for these simulations with a 6 0 7 6 deviation on the other hand by using the marcs approach for this propeller no meaningful trend either increasing or decreasing could be found between cavitating conditions j and σ and propeller performance coefficients fig 17 also compares the extension of the tip vortex cavitation in the propeller slipstream for different turbulence models rans des and les from left middle and right respectively the images show that the les model with marcs approach produced the farthest extension of tip vortex cavitation when the rans and des results were compared with each other the des model provided more extended tvc cavitation due to the effect of resolving the turbulent flow outside of the wall region by les model the propeller performance coefficients kt and kq were also calculated from the rans des and les simulations with deviations between the efd and cfd results including the tip vortex cavitation while the comparisons showed very good agreement for the thrust less than 1 and torque coefficients less than 3 for the rans and des computations torque was less predicted using les 6 0 deviation nevertheless in any specific cfd simulation the main purpose of the modelling needs to be taken into account and hence the most appropriate turbulence model should be selected in accordance with the simulation for this study although the les model does not predict the propeller performance coefficients as successfully as the rans and des models les was still preferred due to its better modelling of the flow characteristics and the tip vortex cavitation extension in the propeller s slipstream 3 3 3 cavitation patterns sheet cavitation cfd investigations of the cavitation pattern of the model propeller were first conducted to simulate the sheet cavitation dynamics and hydrodynamic propeller performance fig 18 and fig 19 show the predicted sheet cavitation patterns obtained from the cfd simulations vf mesh without marcs using les model for two different j and three different σ values fig 18 j 0 4 and fig 19 j 0 5 shows the comparative efd results on the left and cfd simulation on the right for three gradually reducing cavitation numbers during the cavitation tests the revolution of the propeller was kept the same n 33 3 rps and the tunnel flow velocity was changed according to the cavitation test matrix and different test conditions at the lower j value 0 4 the efd results as expected displayed more sheet and stronger tip vortex cavitation on the propeller blades the cfd results without the use of marcs were in good agreement with the efd for the sheet cavitation pattern for condition c1 top fig 18 combined with the leading edge tvc the sheet cavitation can be observed unless the leading edge cavitation was of a distinct vortex type as cavitation number was reduced the sheet cavitation became thicker and extended more chord wise from c1 to c3 a thin but visible tip vortex was observed in the propeller slipstream for condition c2 middle fig 18 where the cavitation number was lower the sheet cavitation spread to lower radii and extended farther in the chord wise direction condition c2 also displayed a stronger more stable tip vortex with sheet cavitation rolling up into the tip vortex which extended far downstream for condition c3 bottom fig 18 the largest extent and thickness of the sheet cavitation was observed here the tip vortex cavitation and the super cavitating sheet were shed off the blade at slightly different pitches thus causing them to interact and produce mutual diffusion and dispersion condition c4 top fig 19 showed that the least amount of cavitation with incipient streak cavitation at about 0 95r c4 differed from c1 in that the j value is 0 5 and so the blade loading kt is less for both j values good agreement was achieved for sheet cavitation dynamics on the blade surfaces at the same j value while the cavitation number σ has been decreased sheet cavity extent increases fig 18 from top to bottom due to the nature of the cavitation phenomena also at the same σ sheet cavitation pattern decreases with increasing j values figs 18 and 19 3 3 4 cavitation pattern tip vortex following the sheet cavitation simulations the marcs approach was applied to the simulations to include the tip vortex cavitation tvc development in the propeller slipstream as shown in fig 20 and fig 21 this adaptive mesh refinement approach was applied only for three conditions c1 c2 and c3 where the tvc had been clearly observed c2 efd middle fig 20 shows the largest axial extent of the tip vortices due to the stronger and more stable tip vortex dynamics in the slipstream this was captured by cfd thanks to the marcs approach the less extended tip vortices for c1 and c3 were also simulated in fig 20 the cavitation images showed that c1 produced weaker tip vortex cavitation than that in c2 smaller diameter of the vortex core due to the difference of the tip vortex volume while the refined surface size 0 22 mm was sufficient to capture tip vortices for c2 this value was not small enough for capturing weaker cavity dynamics for c1 for c3 bottom fig 20 the efd showed a disappearing tip vortex cavitation in the dispersion and eventual dissipation phenomena with a cloudy cavitation phenomenon such dynamics could not be fully simulated in the cfd runs due to insufficient surface mesh size in the refinement region although the tip vortex cavitation could be simulated for all these 3 conditions using the marcs method as opposed to the much faster sheet cavitation simulation method the tip vortex cavitation could only be extended until the interface between the rotating and stationary domain for the c2 condition and with the limited extension for c1 and c3 however the comparisons shown in figs 20 and 21 demonstrated clearly that the marcs methodology could capture a substantial amount of the efd sheet and tip vortex characteristics 4 concluding remarks and future work the experimental and computational investigations of propeller cavitation were conducted and presented in this paper for the princess royal propeller which has been one of the latest benchmark propellers for the cavitation and urn investigations tip vortex cavitation was of particular interest but the work also included propeller performance in open water and cavitating conditions hence included the cavitation observations cavitation inception and desinence tests firstly the open water performance tests were conducted at atmospheric conditions for 3 different revolution rates and the results were compared with each other for the tunnel experimental investigations cavitation phenomenon was observed for 12 different test conditions the first 6 conditions were prepared using j similarity the remainder were tested according to kt similarity corresponding to the cavitation tunnel test performed previously at other institutions through an ongoing round robin tests for the urn investigations after the experimental investigations cfd simulations were performed for the same propeller in 6 different conditions for only sheet cavitation and 3 different conditions also including attention to tip vortex cavitation extension within the scope of the above summary this research study has led to the following remarks and conclusions during the experimental campaign efd the different types of cavitation such as sheet tip vortex and cloud were observed in a range of various j and σ values both the efd and cfd results at condition c2 showed strong tip vortex cavitation behaviour whereas condition c3 displayed mainly heavy sheet cavitation almost like supercavitation on the blade surfaces which was followed by the deformed and hence dispersed vortex cavitation sheet wrapping around the propeller slipstream cavitation inception and desinence tests were also conducted and compared with the results obtained from unige and unew the difference was observed when the results were plotted and compared each other this deviation can be explained with water quality turbulent intensity re and air content as well as test methodology and equipment while the inception and desinence tests were conducted using high speed video camera by unige and unew the results were recorded with naked eye in the sjtu cavitation tunnel cfd results in terms of propeller performance coefficients espesically kt and cavitation patterns including tip vortex cavitation showed a very good agreement with the experimental results obtained from sjtu cavitation tunnel kq accordingly η0 still needs to be improved when the les model is selected for modelling of the more extended tvc patterns tip vortex mesh generation as modified and further developed in this paper confirmed the adaptive mesh refinement method marcs to be an effective and accurate technique to simulate propeller tip vortex cavitation extending far into the propeller slipstream this new mesh refinement method gave the most accurate results for the isolated propeller simulations in uniform and cavitating flow conditions future work will involve comparing

cavitation tunnel tests efd cfd 1 introduction cavitation is a complex fluid dynamics phenomenon that can be produced on a range of hydro power machines such as francis turbines and marine propellers carlton 2007 in certain circumstances such as the marine propeller this can result in propeller efficiency reduction together with underwater radiated noise erosion and vibration excitation problems cavitation phenomena should be investigated and observed accurately to predict propeller performance and underwater radiated noise although cfd methods are currently able to predict propeller powering performance in cavitating conditions thanks to continuing developments in software and computational power cavitation tunnel test experiments are still considered the most reliable and accurate way to investigate propeller cavitation in wake fields and the effects on propeller total performance in this research field various test results were published in open literature using a variety of procedures and approaches e g atlar et al 2013 aktas et al 2016a tani et al 2017a b etc the recently completed european framework fp7 included a collaborative research project sonic sonic 2012 which used the university of newcastle unew catamaran research vessel the princess royal atlar et al 2013 to investigate the underwater radiated noise from the vessel s cavitating propellers comprehensive model tests and full scale trials were conducted from which associated data were collected as the benchmark data for other researchers a continuation of this research saw the model propeller of the

open water and cavitating conditions and to measure the underwater radiated noise characteristic of this propeller in addition to these measurements and calculations they have also evaluated the effect of cavitation nuclei which is one of the important scale effects beside the viscous scale effect on cavitation inception using an electrolysis system to generate the bubbles lafeber and lloyd 2017 tani et al conducted similar cavitation and noise measurement tests at the unige and compared results with those from the ect aktas et al 2016a b a similar study was also published by hallander 2017 including open water cavitation and noise measurement tests conducted in the large sspa cavitation tunnel as a part of the round robin test campaign recently the results of this round robin test programme was reported by tani et al 2019 with the aim of comparing results among several institutes i e university of genova unige university of newcastle unew nmri sspa kriso cnr inm and marin in order to compare the different approaches and cavitation observations and noise measurement capabilities further tests were conducted in non uniform flow in the ect using scaled models of the propeller a dummy demi hull model of the princess royal catamaran and its rudder these cavitation test results and noise measurement were published by aktas et al 2016 a b results from the cavitation tunnel have also been compared with results from full scale trials in the present study at sjtu the princess royal propeller was tested in 12 different cavitating conditions 2 advance coefficients j equation 3 and 3 cavitation numbers σ using j and kt equation 4 similarities the test conditions and test matrix from other institutions have been investigated and the new test matrix has been prepared for this study using the aforementioned j and kt similarities although the experimental approach is still the most reliable way the computational modelling of cavitation including tip and hub vortex cavitation in a propeller s slipstream is the dominant challenge for cfd users while the prediction of cavitation on the propeller blade surfaces has been tackled by many researchers there is a scarcity of efforts which have achieved extending the tip vortex cavitation from all blades simultaneously and reaching rudder especially at large rudder propeller separations hence the validation the cfd propeller cavitation modelling with efd results are so limited due to the lack of accurate modelling of the observed tip vortex cavitation there are many numerical studies in literature to predict tip vortex cavitation e g lee 2002 hsiao and pauley 1998 lee and kinnas 2004 hsiao and chahine 2008 park et al 2009 peng et al 2013 using especially cfd methods in which rans based models for the simulation of tip vortex cavitation of marine propellers are preferred gaggero et al 2014 although the rans model is recognised as a reliable method for sheet cavitation simulations further studies are still required particularly for accurate modelling of tip vortex cavitation gaggero et al 2014 recently numerical modelling of the tip vortex cavitation phenomenon has been the focal point by some researchers using cfd methods and commercial codes such modelling has created adapted mesh refinement regions around and downstream of the propeller tip area for capturing cavity bubbles in the slipstream amongst them windt and bosschers applied an adaptive mesh refinement approach for a wing and a propeller by using the jump based estimator with the in house cfd code refresco although this adaptive mesh refinement improved the accuracy of the predictions for the wing good results could not be obtained for the propeller which required further investigations windt and bosschers 2015 by using the same code another adaptive mesh refinement approach was recently used by lloyd et al 2017 for cavitation simulations on a propeller in this study the tip vortex cavitation was simulated for the key blade only and not for all the blades simultaneously viitanen and siikonen also simulated a single blade of a model scale marine propeller in cavitating conditions with a novel compressible homogenous flow model and by solving phase volume fractions viitanen and siikonen 2017 the results showed good agreement not only for the propeller performance coefficient and local flow phenomena but also the tip vortex cavitation extension in the propeller slipstream budich et al 2015 applied a mesh alignment technique to improve the accuracy of the propeller wake structure for capturing the tip vortex cavitation including compressible shock wave dynamics phillips and turnock have also applied an improved version of the vortfind algorithm increasing the mesh resolution to have sufficient mesh density for capturing vortex cores to investigate the propeller rudder and hull interaction phillips and turnock 2011 however this study is not for cavitating vortex flow zhu et al 2017 also tested several parameters of computational grid and numerical algorithm in order to predict the length of the tip vortex cavitation and validate a developed approach a key finding of this study was defined as the effect of the turbulence model and advanced grid methods for predicting tip vortex cavitation fujiyama et al 2011 also created a fine mesh region around the tip area of the pptc vp1304 propeller with a level shaft to capture tip vortex cavitation using a rans model and sc tetra cfd software with this mesh refinement the cavitation pattern was simulated on blade surfaces and moreover a small extension of tip vortex cavitation was observed to this end yilmaz et al 2019 proposed an advanced mesh refinement method marcs for capturing tip vortex cavitation in a propeller s slipstream in a study using the insean e779a propeller marcs allowed a further extension of the tvc in the propeller slipstream to be achieved in spite of these recent review studies of experimental and computational investigations of propeller cavitation phenomena an important research gap remains the open literature has not satisfactorily demonstrated the full simulation of propeller tip vortex cavitation from all propeller blades in a simultaneous manner in a wake field also although comprehensive experimental data in benchmark nature have been produced on the princess royal propeller there has not been a dedicated cfd study to compare these benchmark data to demonstrate the further capability of the cfd methods in challenging tip vortex modelling the present paper therefore aims to make such a contribution by modelling the tip vortex cavitation from all blades of the princess royal propeller simultaneously by developing a new and efficient meshing approach in combination with a state of the art commercial cfd code for validation with experimental results this paper also aims to make a contribution towards creating a methodology for propeller cavitation investigations including tip vortex cavitation extension by using experimental and numerical approaches with solution verification and validation methods finally the paper presents another set of experimental data based on the tests in the sjtu cavitation tunnel on the princess royal propeller to widen the range of the ongoing benchmark propeller cavitation and noise test data the paper continues with the presentation of the experimental investigations including details of the cavitation tunnel propeller details test conditions and procedures and tests results at 2 the numerical investigations of the propeller cavitation simulations are presented at 3 and include mesh generation marcs numerical methods and cavitation results concluding remarks and suggestions for future work are presented in 4 2 experimental investigations the princess royal propeller has been tested in the shanghai jiao tong university sjtu cavitation tunnel fig 1 for this study general dimensions specifications and limitations of the cavitation tunnel and main particulars of the princess royal propeller are given in 2 1 and 2 2 respectively 2 1 sjtu cavitation tunnel this modern cavitation tunnel has a test section which is 6 1 m in length and its cross section is 1 m 1 m with rounded corners the axial flow velocity range for the test section is from 0 5 m s to 15 8 m s and the range of the static pressure at the centreline of the test section can be varied from 25 kpa to 300 kpa the non uniformity of the axial flow velocity is below 1 the tunnel is equipped with a computer control and measurement system a general view of this new tunnel is shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows the close view of the testing section and the propeller dynamometer used in the cavitation tests the measuring ranges of the dynamometer are 1500 n for the thrust and 75 nm for the torque respectively the non linearity and non repeatability of measured thrust and torque are both below 0 2 fs the propeller model is driven by an ac servo motor via bevel geared shafts within a max rotating speed range of 1998 rpm the cavitation observations were achieved with camera recordings aided with stroboscopic lighting synchronized with a shaft position signal this enabled freezing the image due to the triggered flash provided by the strobe lights fig 3 shows the stroboscopic light and the camera used during the cavitation tests the water quality and temperature of the sjtu cavitation tunnel is monitored throughout all cavitation tests as it has a significant impact on the measurements the tunnel water is thus brought to 30 total gas content as suggested by the ittc 2011 1987 fig 3 also shows the equipment required for the cavitation observation tests a indicates the test section b and c respectively show the digital camera and stroboscopic light for recording and capturing cavitation images d indicates the plexiglas material thickness 80 mm for side and bottom windows between the test section and water tank and e indicates the water tank with a hydrophone which was situated below the test section and observation window at the bottom of the testing section the two environments tunnel and tank are separated by plexiglas which allows the environmental conditions of the water to remain the same for measuring noise as if the hydrophone were in the tunnel the noise data was measured by a brüel kjær 8103 hydrophone its frequency range is 0 1 hz 180 khz and the sensitivity is 211 db re 1 v μpa 2 db the lan xi model type 3161 made by brüel kjær is utilized for data acquisition and analysis although the results of the noise data are not included in this paper due to the scope of this research study the principal author also conducted noise measurements as part of this test programme 2 2 the princess royal propeller as stated in the introduction part of this paper the princess royal propeller was used in this study since it was recommended as a benchmark propeller for cavitation observations and noise measurements by ittc 2017 to complement this round robin campaign for cavitation tests and noise measurements the propeller model was manufactured by sjtu using propeller data table and cad file which was provided by the university of strathclyde uos as one of the members of this campaign the model propeller was manufactured to 3 41 scale factor resulting in a model propeller diameter of 0 22 m for sjtu model propeller main particulars of the propeller and image of the manufactured propeller are given in table 1 and fig 4 respectively atlar et al 2013 2 3 test conditions and procedures tests for open water performance cavitation observation and both tip vortex cavitation inception and desinence were conducted in this order noise measurements were carried out and recorded during the cavitation observation tests before starting open water tests a dummy hub without propeller blades was tested and thrust and torque values were recorded in order to calculate propeller performance coefficients correctly after that open water tests were conducted using 3 different shaft rotation speeds namely 18 25 and 33 3 rps the last being the maximum for the sjtu tunnel the open water results were evaluated and compared to each other as thrust coefficient kt torque coefficient 10kq equation 5 and open water efficiency η0 equation 6 although the open water tests are commonly conducted in a towing tank propeller performance coefficients can also be measured in cavitation tunnels under similar atmospheric conditions which are corrected by appropriate channel effect correction for the cavitation observations the model propeller was tested at 12 different cavitating conditions comprising 2 different advance coefficients j and 3 cavitation numbers σ using j and kt similarities also 3 different cavitation number pressure conditions were designated respectively as the atmospheric low and high vacuum conditions in order to complement the ongoing round robin tests the test conditions and test matrix of the participating institutions were investigated and the new test matrix was prepared for this study using j and kt similarity table 2 according to the capabilities of the sjtu tunnel the cavitation conditions correspond to cavitation numbers σ 13 9 8 1 and 4 5 5 5 respectively although the σ 4 5 condition can be tested for j 0 5 the same condition cannot be tested for j 0 4 due to the lowest pressure limit of the cavitation tunnel for this reason the lowest possible pressure for j 0 4 achieved a cavitation condition close to σ 5 5 the cavitation number based on rotational speed σ n of the propeller is calculated as in equation 1 1 σ n p p s a t 0 5 ρ n d 2 where p is the tunnel centreline pressure p sat is the vapour pressure ρ is the density of the fluid n is the rotation rate and d is the diameter of the propeller the reynolds number re at a reference point on the propeller blade generally accepted as the radius 0 7 r r is one of the essential non dimensional parameters for the cavitation tunnel tests equation 2 specifies this value the model scale re remains far from the full scale value but it is recommended to be as high as possible to ensure turbulent flow over the propeller blade surfaces thus minimising scale effects it is suggested that re should have a minimum value of 2 105 for the cavitation tests ittc 2011 2008 2 r e c 0 7 r v 2 0 7 π n d 2 ν finally the tip vortex cavitation inception and desinence tests were conducted using the naked eye in conjunction with video recordings the results were compared with those of unige and unew as presented by tani et al 2017a b 2 4 results the results of the cavitation tests including open water propeller performance cavitation inception and desinence and cavitation observations are presented in the following sections 2 4 1 propeller open water performance open water tests were also conducted before the cavitation observation tests the tests at three different propeller rates of revolutions show the results are largely independent of re effect tests performed at the unige cavitation tunnel allowed investigation of the effect of the reynolds number on delivered thrust and torque for values ranging from 7 6 105 to 1 9 106 tani et al 2017a b for calculating propeller performance coefficients kt 10kq and η0 and drawing propeller performance curves the advance ratio is defined as in equation 3 3 j v a n d where v a is the advance velocity of the flow thrust and torque coefficients were calculated from equations 4 and 5 4 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 5 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where t and q are thrust and torque values of the propeller respectively the propeller open water efficiency is defined as in equation 6 6 η 0 j 2 π k t k q fig 5 shows the open water performance curves of the model propeller which were plotted based on the measurements at three different re numbers averaged deviation of around 1 the results indicate somewhat consistent performance data regarding different re numbers for the three sets of shaft rpm and providing further confidence on the measurements for the re number effect 2 4 2 cavitation inception and desinence tests tip vortex cavitation inception and desinence tests were also conducted and the recordings were made by the naked eye the results of these tests are compared in fig 6 with the results of unige and unew recorded in the literature tani et al 2017a b this comparison shows a significant difference in terms of kt against cavitation number such differences are known to be sensitive to propeller leading edge finish gas contents water quality turbulent intensity of the cavitation tunnels and reynolds number effects e g korkut 1999 in addition the method of recording the inception and desinence points differs from one institute to another tani et al 2017a b at unige and unew cavitation images were recorded by high speed video camera while in the sjtu cavitation tunnel by the naked eye which often presents difficulties for recording inception in the propeller slipstream therefore inception and desinence can be described in three different ways the first is attaching the cavitation bubbles to the propeller surface or attached type and the second is the cavity bubbles appearing and disappearing in the propeller slipstream without attaching to the propeller blade travelling type and third is the vortex type arakeri 1978 in these tests tip vortex cavitation inception was recorded when the cavitating bubbles were seen to attach to the propeller tip as shown in fig 7 and recorded results were compared with the inception tests conducted at unige and unew s ec tunnels in spite of the different facilities different model sizes and different approaches the trend and correlations for the inception and desinence data from the three institutions are in respectable agreement this brings to the authors attention other possible effect related to the propeller whose speed profile may vary from one facility to another as the main flow characteristic of each facility a further aspect regarding the propeller inflow which may influence the cavitation inception significantly is the inflow turbulence intensity as discussed in korkut et al 2000 and korkut and atlar 2002 water quality is another aspect that significantly influences cavitation inception and desinence especially in the case of tip vortex cavitation overall differences observed seem remarkable especially keeping in mind that tests are carried out with relatively simple and easily repeatable uniform inflow configuration 2 4 3 cavitation tests and observations as stated above the cavitation observations were made by the naked eye using a still camera and stroboscopic lighting synchronized with a shaft position signal the images were captured and the data were recorded when the cavitation inception was seen by the naked eye from the side window of the cavitation tunnel the cavitation test matrix followed those of tani et al 2017a b table 2 although the comparisons do not exist in this paper it is planned to be published on upcoming papers the observed cavitation patterns on the blades and tip vortex cavitation extent showed good agreement when compared with results from marin sspa unige and unew hallander 2017 lafeber and lloyd 2017 tani et al 2017a b fig 8 shows cavitating propeller performance coefficients efd calculated from cavitation test results and compared to those obtained from the non cavitating open water tests thrust and torque values were measured during the cavitation observation tests where an extra axial force was generated in the opposite direction to the thrust force due to the presence of the dynamometer when the negative effect of the dynamometer on the propeller thrust was taken into account no significant difference was found between performance characteristics kt kq and η0 for non cavitating and cavitation conditions when the results were compared each other non cavitating vs cavitating kt kq and η0 showed a difference but with the same trend fig 8 figs 9 and 10 shows the observed cavitation images at j 0 4 and j 0 5 respectively for the same shaft speed n 33 3 rps while the tunnel flow velocity and vacuum were adjusted according to the test conditions specified in the test matrix as it was expected the extent and strength of the sheet and tip vortex cavitation were more intense at j 0 4 than j 0 5 due to the loading of the model propeller cavitation tunnel tests for condition c1 at j 0 4 kt equivalent of condition 7 and c4 at j 0 5 kt equivalent of condition c10 were conducted with the lightest vacuum level applied on the tunnel which corresponded to the highest cavitation number the observed cavitation in c1 condition therefore displayed the smallest sheet cavitation extent on the blades up to 0 9r with a just visible tip vortex cavitation in the propeller slipstream while c4 condition displayed hardly visible inception of tip vortex cavitation due to lighter loading when the cavitation number was decreased further in condition c2 and c3 at j 0 4 and for condition c5 and c6 at j 0 5 the extent and strength of the developed sheet and tip vortex cavitation were increased accordingly condition c3 displayed the most heavily loaded condition with the smallest cavitation number and hence the sheet cavitation extent and strength were at maximum almost like a supercavitating state for the model propeller as a result the regular helical pattern of the strong tip vortex cavitation observed in condition c2 was deformed and replaced in condition c3 by the dispersed and cloudy appearance of the tip vortex cavity sheet wrapped around the propeller s slipstream with reducing diameter at downstream the cavitation dynamics at this condition was extremely complex displaying the eventual bursting phenomenon when the strong sheet cavitation was trailed by the short and extremely thick bursting tip vortex cavitation which dispersed quickly wrapping around the propeller slipstream the above described cavitation patterns for a shaft inclination of zero degrees showed good agreement with the results at the same shaft angle published by other research facilities hallander 2017 lafeber and lloyd 2017 and tani et al 2017a b participating in the round robin tests of the htf these partners of the htf conducted further tests at different shaft inclination conditions while these could not be repeated in the sjtu tunnel due to the limitations of the test equipment at the facility 3 numerical investigations having conducted the model tests at the sjtu cavitation tunnel the next step was to simulate the same propeller s cavitation performance using cfd especially for the tip vortex cavitation by using the principal author s newly developed meshing refinement approach marcs yilmaz et al 2019 this is explained in detail in the following sections together with comparisons of the corresponding cfd results with the efd results 3 1 mesh generation mesh adaption refinement approach for cavitation simulations marcs an advanced mesh refinement approach for capturing tip vortex cavitation tvc in a propeller slipstream was proposed yilmaz et al 2017 and preliminary results were presented for a limited range of tvc extents for the benchmark propeller model of insean e779a in open water the proposed method was further developed by using the same propeller model and further extension of the tvc in the propeller slipstream was achieved yilmaz et al 2019 this new mesh adaptive mesh refinement approach which is called marcs mesh adaption and refinement approach to cavitation simulation subsequently was applied on the princess royal propeller model in open water allowing a greater extension of the tvc modelling in the slipstream the details of the marcs methods are given in yilmaz et al 2019 and yilmaz 2019 hence will not be repeated here since the reader can refer to those references while marcs had been applied successfully to simulate the tip vortex cavitation trajectories of the insean e779a propeller the approach needed to be improved further for the princess royal propeller the modification was required to reduce the total number of cells while the refinement region needed to be extended in the slipstream this was because of more demanding modelling requirements of the princess royal propeller due to the large clearance between the propeller and rudder for the modified version of marcs firstly the volumetric control region spiral geometry was removed from the settings of the mesh generation secondly having defined the required surface size less than 0 25 mm cell width was also removed from the refinement process the refinement field function therefore was modified as follows refinement absolutepressure 17000 absolutepressure 3800 0 00035 0 in marcs the adaptive mesh refinement was created only in the region where the tip vortex cavitation could occur at the beginning of this application the upper limit of absolute pressure in the solution was determined by creating a threshold region in star ccm fig 11 in such cavitation simulations the volume fraction of vapour shows the volume where the absolute pressure is below the saturation pressure of water thus identifying the volume in which cavitation is occurring a threshold region was created by increasing the saturation pressure from the default saturation pressure 3800 pa used by star ccm to a higher value 17 000 pa thus generating the pink region shown in fig 11 this artifice provided an indication of the volumetric trajectory on which to generate a fine mesh for accurately capturing the pressure drop correctly and tracking the cavity bubbles in the propeller slipstream following this modification figs 11 and 12 respectively show the threshold below 17000 pa and the subsequent mesh generated using the marcs approach the y value was around 1 for propeller blades and shaft by using 12 prism layers and approximately 1 mm total thickness fig 13 presents the modified flow chart summarising the new marcs approach for cavitation simulations after removing the volumetric control region and modifying the field function as stated earlier having conducted the modification on marcs for reducing total number of cells the next modification was made on the mechanism to detect the tendency for cavitation as stated earlier the initial mechanism used for this purpose was the increase in the default value of the saturated vapour pressure however this can be replaced by using a vorticity based approach q criterion according to the requirements of the simulations these include more complex applications e g flow non uniformity due to hull wake inclined shaft and propeller rudder hull interaction etc as well as better representation of the flow physics relating to the nature of cavitation inception these two modifications therefore were applied to marcs as further developments and the associated flow chart was updated as shown in fig 13 3 2 theoretical and numerical models for the cavitation simulations of the princess royal propeller different turbulence models were applied and compared with each other not only for the propeller performance coefficients but also for cavitation patterns and tip vortex cavitation extents although the rans turbulence model was sufficient for modelling the open water performance coefficients of the propellers the scale resolving models such as des and les were preferred for simulating cavitation details les is also recommended in the user guide of star ccm for complex turbulent flows such as in modelling cavitation and especially the tip vortex cavitation for the cavitation simulations the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale subgrid scale model was used in the les model after the selection of the suitable turbulence model for the tip vortex cavitation simulations of the princess royal propeller different time step values were tried based on the time steps recommended by ittc initially the time step was calculated such that the propeller rotates between 0 5 and 2 per time step ittc 2014 finally a time step value of δt 5x10 5 s corresponding to 0 648 deg of propeller rotation was used for the princess royal propeller a sliding mesh approach was used to model the motion describing the rotation of the propeller for cavitation modelling while a volume of fluid vof model was used in describing the multiphase flow the schnerr sauer model was used as a cavitation model in star ccm as described in the starccm user guide 2018 while the first order discretisation scheme was used for discretising the governing equations in time the bounded central differencing scheme was used for the same purpose in space this scheme is recommended for the les model to represent the complex turbulent flows such as cavitation in star ccm user guide 2018 the propeller performance coefficients were calculated by using the converged thrust and torque values corresponding to at least four revolutions of the propeller 3 3 results 3 3 1 grid and time step sensitivity a grid and time step sensitivity study was performed for the princess royal propeller in cavitating condition c2 table 2 four different grids coarse medium fine and very fine and three time step conditions for fine grid were simulated fig 14 shows images of the different computational grids while table 3 shows the details of these different grids for the grid sensitivity study this study was conducted at j 0 4 using r 2 and les turbulence model which gave the best results compared to the rans and des models relating to the extension of the tip vortex cavitation for the time step sensitivity study the three time step conditions were applied for the fine mesh coarse 2δt medium δt and fine δt 2 the fine time step was defined as δt 5x10 5 the results for the propeller performance coefficients from these studies for grid and time sensitivity are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively fig 15 also presents the convergence type for the grid sensitivity study in terms of kt it can be seen that while this study for coarse medium and fine meshes shows a monotonic type convergence the results for the medium fine and very fine mesh demonstrate an oscillatory convergence behaviour due to the differences of the convergence types the uncertainty values were calculated using the gre generalised richardson extrapolation for the monotonic convergence and the upper and lower limits for the oscillatory convergence table 6 shows the numerical uncertainty calculations for the grid and time step sensitivity studies in addition to kt and kq the numerical uncertainties have also been calculated for cavitation volume for the different types of cavitation as presented in table 7 complementary to the uncertainty calculations for cavity volume fig 16 shows the cavitation patterns including tip vortex cavitation extent in the propeller slipstream due to the different mesh refinements table 7 and fig 16 also demonstrate that the uncertainty values for the tip vortex cavitation predictions are much higher than the sheet cavitation and thus adaptive mesh refinement is required to solve the tip vortex cavitation accurately the images of the cavity extent also prove that smaller grid size refinement size 0 25 mm is essential to be able to extend tip vortex type cavitation the error between cfd and efd results e uncertainties of validation u v experimental tests u d and numerical simulations u sn were calculated for kt and kq where the equation u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 was used and previous data uncertainty and iterative uncertainty were neglected the deviations between calculated and measured values in cavitating conditions are not too great 2 8 for thrust and 6 2 for torque coefficients despite the deviation being small between efd and cfd results uncertainty for the experimental tests was assumed to be 2 e uv and as such kt and kq could not be validated for grid 1 c m and f and grid 2 m f and vf due to a small uv value on the other hand kt can be accepted for both grids due to the small error values between the efd and cfd results the simulations must be evaluated critically by taking into consideration the error in the kq value which is still higher than 5 although kt and kq values cannot be validated at the uv level fig 16 demonstrates that smaller surface size and mesh refinement where the cavitation may possibly occur in propeller slipstream helps to improve the accuracy of the tip vortex cavitation extent 3 3 2 propeller performance table 8 compares the propeller thrust coefficients from the efd and cfd simulations including the sheet and tip vortex cavitation it can be concluded that while the marcs approach could improve the tip vortex cavitation extension it did not help to improve the propeller thrust the propeller performance coefficients kt and kq were also compared between the efd and cfd results including the tip vortex cavitation while the comparisons showed good agreement for thrust 2 5 3 5 torque was underpredicted for these simulations with a 6 0 7 6 deviation on the other hand by using the marcs approach for this propeller no meaningful trend either increasing or decreasing could be found between cavitating conditions j and σ and propeller performance coefficients fig 17 also compares the extension of the tip vortex cavitation in the propeller slipstream for different turbulence models rans des and les from left middle and right respectively the images show that the les model with marcs approach produced the farthest extension of tip vortex cavitation when the rans and des results were compared with each other the des model provided more extended tvc cavitation due to the effect of resolving the turbulent flow outside of the wall region by les model the propeller performance coefficients kt and kq were also calculated from the rans des and les simulations with deviations between the efd and cfd results including the tip vortex cavitation while the comparisons showed very good agreement for the thrust less than 1 and torque coefficients less than 3 for the rans and des computations torque was less predicted using les 6 0 deviation nevertheless in any specific cfd simulation the main purpose of the modelling needs to be taken into account and hence the most appropriate turbulence model should be selected in accordance with the simulation for this study although the les model does not predict the propeller performance coefficients as successfully as the rans and des models les was still preferred due to its better modelling of the flow characteristics and the tip vortex cavitation extension in the propeller s slipstream 3 3 3 cavitation patterns sheet cavitation cfd investigations of the cavitation pattern of the model propeller were first conducted to simulate the sheet cavitation dynamics and hydrodynamic propeller performance fig 18 and fig 19 show the predicted sheet cavitation patterns obtained from the cfd simulations vf mesh without marcs using les model for two different j and three different σ values fig 18 j 0 4 and fig 19 j 0 5 shows the comparative efd results on the left and cfd simulation on the right for three gradually reducing cavitation numbers during the cavitation tests the revolution of the propeller was kept the same n 33 3 rps and the tunnel flow velocity was changed according to the cavitation test matrix and different test conditions at the lower j value 0 4 the efd results as expected displayed more sheet and stronger tip vortex cavitation on the propeller blades the cfd results without the use of marcs were in good agreement with the efd for the sheet cavitation pattern for condition c1 top fig 18 combined with the leading edge tvc the sheet cavitation can be observed unless the leading edge cavitation was of a distinct vortex type as cavitation number was reduced the sheet cavitation became thicker and extended more chord wise from c1 to c3 a thin but visible tip vortex was observed in the propeller slipstream for condition c2 middle fig 18 where the cavitation number was lower the sheet cavitation spread to lower radii and extended farther in the chord wise direction condition c2 also displayed a stronger more stable tip vortex with sheet cavitation rolling up into the tip vortex which extended far downstream for condition c3 bottom fig 18 the largest extent and thickness of the sheet cavitation was observed here the tip vortex cavitation and the super cavitating sheet were shed off the blade at slightly different pitches thus causing them to interact and produce mutual diffusion and dispersion condition c4 top fig 19 showed that the least amount of cavitation with incipient streak cavitation at about 0 95r c4 differed from c1 in that the j value is 0 5 and so the blade loading kt is less for both j values good agreement was achieved for sheet cavitation dynamics on the blade surfaces at the same j value while the cavitation number σ has been decreased sheet cavity extent increases fig 18 from top to bottom due to the nature of the cavitation phenomena also at the same σ sheet cavitation pattern decreases with increasing j values figs 18 and 19 3 3 4 cavitation pattern tip vortex following the sheet cavitation simulations the marcs approach was applied to the simulations to include the tip vortex cavitation tvc development in the propeller slipstream as shown in fig 20 and fig 21 this adaptive mesh refinement approach was applied only for three conditions c1 c2 and c3 where the tvc had been clearly observed c2 efd middle fig 20 shows the largest axial extent of the tip vortices due to the stronger and more stable tip vortex dynamics in the slipstream this was captured by cfd thanks to the marcs approach the less extended tip vortices for c1 and c3 were also simulated in fig 20 the cavitation images showed that c1 produced weaker tip vortex cavitation than that in c2 smaller diameter of the vortex core due to the difference of the tip vortex volume while the refined surface size 0 22 mm was sufficient to capture tip vortices for c2 this value was not small enough for capturing weaker cavity dynamics for c1 for c3 bottom fig 20 the efd showed a disappearing tip vortex cavitation in the dispersion and eventual dissipation phenomena with a cloudy cavitation phenomenon such dynamics could not be fully simulated in the cfd runs due to insufficient surface mesh size in the refinement region although the tip vortex cavitation could be simulated for all these 3 conditions using the marcs method as opposed to the much faster sheet cavitation simulation method the tip vortex cavitation could only be extended until the interface between the rotating and stationary domain for the c2 condition and with the limited extension for c1 and c3 however the comparisons shown in figs 20 and 21 demonstrated clearly that the marcs methodology could capture a substantial amount of the efd sheet and tip vortex characteristics 4 concluding remarks and future work the experimental and computational investigations of propeller cavitation were conducted and presented in this paper for the princess royal propeller which has been one of the latest benchmark propellers for the cavitation and urn investigations tip vortex cavitation was of particular interest but the work also included propeller performance in open water and cavitating conditions hence included the cavitation observations cavitation inception and desinence tests firstly the open water performance tests were conducted at atmospheric conditions for 3 different revolution rates and the results were compared with each other for the tunnel experimental investigations cavitation phenomenon was observed for 12 different test conditions the first 6 conditions were prepared using j similarity the remainder were tested according to kt similarity corresponding to the cavitation tunnel test performed previously at other institutions through an ongoing round robin tests for the urn investigations after the experimental investigations cfd simulations were performed for the same propeller in 6 different conditions for only sheet cavitation and 3 different conditions also including attention to tip vortex cavitation extension within the scope of the above summary this research study has led to the following remarks and conclusions during the experimental campaign efd the different types of cavitation such as sheet tip vortex and cloud were observed in a range of various j and σ values both the efd and cfd results at condition c2 showed strong tip vortex cavitation behaviour whereas condition c3 displayed mainly heavy sheet cavitation almost like supercavitation on the blade surfaces which was followed by the deformed and hence dispersed vortex cavitation sheet wrapping around the propeller slipstream cavitation inception and desinence tests were also conducted and compared with the results obtained from unige and unew the difference was observed when the results were plotted and compared each other this deviation can be explained with water quality turbulent intensity re and air content as well as test methodology and equipment while the inception and desinence tests were conducted using high speed video camera by unige and unew the results were recorded with naked eye in the sjtu cavitation tunnel cfd results in terms of propeller performance coefficients espesically kt and cavitation patterns including tip vortex cavitation showed a very good agreement with the experimental results obtained from sjtu cavitation tunnel kq accordingly η0 still needs to be improved when the les model is selected for modelling of the more extended tvc patterns tip vortex mesh generation as modified and further developed in this paper confirmed the adaptive mesh refinement method marcs to be an effective and accurate technique to simulate propeller tip vortex cavitation extending far into the propeller slipstream this new mesh refinement method gave the most accurate results for the isolated propeller simulations in uniform and cavitating flow conditions future work will involve comparing the cavitation observations and noise measurement from other institutes which conducted similar tests as a part of an international round robin test campaign to reveal the relative merits of the
