17200,bioindication has become an indispensable part of water quality monitoring in most countries of the world with the presence and abundance of bioindicator taxa mostly multicellular eukaryotes used for biotic indices in contrast microbes bacteria archaea and protists are seldom used as bioindicators in routine assessments although they have been recognized for their importance in environmental processes recently the use of molecular methods has revealed unexpected diversity within known functional groups and novel metabolic pathways that are particularly important in energy and nutrient cycling in various habitats microbial communities respond to eutrophication metals and natural or anthropogenic organic pollutants through changes in diversity and function in this review we evaluated the common trends in these changes documenting that they have value as bioindicators and can be used not only for monitoring but also for improving our understanding of the major processes in lotic and lentic environments current knowledge provides a solid foundation for exploiting microbial taxa community structures and diversity as well as functional genes in novel monitoring programs these microbial community measures can also be combined into biotic indices improving the resolution of individual bioindicators here we assess particular molecular approaches complemented by advanced bioinformatic analysis as these are the most promising with respect to detailed bioindication value we conclude that microbial community dynamics are a missing link important for our understanding of rapid changes in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems and should be addressed in the future environmental monitoring of freshwater ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction 1 1 freshwater ecosystems are rapidly altered by anthropogenic pressures freshwater environments support high species diversity and are more functionally diverse than other ecosystems surface freshwaters lakes ponds streams and rivers are among the most extensively and rapidly altered ecosystems encompassing changes in physical structure chemistry biotic characteristics and interactions carpenter et al 2011 this alteration increases threats to global biodiversity and thus also the processes modulating nutrient cycling community stability and food web structures grill et al 2019 vörösmarty et al 2010 ecosystem services provided by prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes have considerable impacts on rates of energy and nutrient flows as well as the intensity of many trophic interactions since aquatic microbes also possess high metabolic and growth rates they are highly responsive to local and global pressures and are directly influenced by changes in physico chemical characteristics including inputs of organic and inorganic compounds and pollutants caruso et al 2016 pernthaler 2017 šimek et al 2014 in addition rare microbes can act as a hidden backbone and provide resistance and resilience against disturbances garcia et al 2018 jousset et al 2017 therefore measurable responses to environmental stressors caused by human activities can be predicted through the changes in microbial community diversity dynamics and activity occurring in disturbed ecosystems fig 1 a microbe based bioindicators can be selected from a broad variety of taxonomic groups mediating processes such as oxygenic photosynthesis or the assimilation of carbon dioxide carried out by e g cyanobacteria and algae or complex microbial food webs forming networks that link many heterotrophic microorganisms to the dissolved carbon pool azam et al 1983 šimek et al 2019 šimek et al 2014 sommer et al 2012 however other ecosystem services that are not associated with particular taxa require the selection of appropriate bioindicators that target specific metabolic pathways examples of these pathways include anoxygenic photosynthesis provided by only few bacterial phyla nitrogen fixation carried out by only specialized prokaryotes and methanogenesis delivered by only syntrophic interactions of archaea compte port et al 2020 waidner and kirchman 2008 yao et al 2018 additionally genes coding for metal or antibiotic resistances might be used for bioindication of the respective pollutants roosa et al 2014 similarly biotic interactions can be reflected either in general trophic patterns bock et al 2020 or in very specialized host parasite endosymbiont relationships such as in chlamydiae and their amoebae hosts pizzetti et al 2012 since the beginning of world wide water biomonitoring reviewed in bonada et al 2006 santos et al 2019 environmental microbiology has experienced enormous conceptual and methodological developments with the implementation of cultivation independent molecular methods many tools have been applied including high throughput sequencing phylochip geochip quantitative pcr metagenomics metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics for details see supplementary files molecular approaches have considerably increased knowledge of aquatic microbial community richness diversity and functional variability mansfeldt et al 2020 however a systematic compilation of distinct microbial taxa and functional groups associated with water pollution measures is lacking novel strategies for including environmental genomics in water quality monitoring that reflect ecosystem functions have been previously proposed cordier et al 2020 regarding novel microbe based bioindication the strategies can be modified to provide assessments of both broad scale processes indicated by many prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa as well as narrow scale processes indicated by a limited number of specialized prokaryotes apothéloz perret gentil et al 2017 falk et al 2019 roosa et al 2014 tanentzap et al 2019 yao et al 2018 thus the strategies for assessments using microbial bioindicators include the following a tracking of specific taxa their quantification and precise taxonomic detection used e g in fecal coliform bacteria or water borne pathogens b novel community based bioindicators such as diversity indices employed in determining changes of broad ecosystem services and c functional community population assessments focused on specific metabolic pathways or specialized microbial activities furthermore the value of using microbial responses to environmental stressors compared to bioindication by multicellular eukaryotes or direct chemical measurements lies in the possibility to identify contamination transfers through aquatic ecosystems those are reflected in altered nutrient cycling metabolic pathways and trophic links which are then clearly attributable to specific microorganisms consequently this review aims to establish a solid foundation for the widespread adoption of microbes as bioindicators and or variables in biotic indices in freshwater ecosystems additionally we propose using microorganisms to distinguish the effects of environmental stressors that cannot be determined by other presently used indicators 2 current legislation deals only with cultivable pathogenic and toxic microorganisms current biomonitoring programs for aquatic ecosystems do not generally include both wide environmental screening and narrow critical pathways that are detectable only in certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms usually only selected microorganisms and their products are used in particular fecal indicator bacteria water borne pathogens or the quantification of toxins in europe the drinking water directive 2015 1787 98 83 ec ec 2015 1998 and the bathing water directive 2006 7 ec ec 2006 as well as related legislation in the usa epa 815 f 08 001 epa 600 r 12 551 epa 910 r 15 002 ccl4 2016 epa 2016 canada 1970 australian and new zealand environment and conservation council 2000 india 2012 south africa 2015 and state council of the people s republic of china 2015 include a limited number of pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria surveillance of bacteria such as escherichia coli and enterococci as well as protists such as cryptosporidium giardia and naegleria fowleri is mandatory in many countries in the eu and eee world health organization guidelines for drinking water quality who 2011 since gastrointestinal illnesses associated with exposure to contaminated waters can vary according to the host organism information on the origin of contamination is essential for risk mitigation therefore some directives also require the identification of contamination sources in international watercourses directive 95 308 ec ec 1995 for these organisms the directives rely on a cultivation based approach built on the counting and characterization of viable cells on differential selective media under defined cultivation conditions cyanobacteria are another microbial group included in legislation because they produce toxins scums and odors ferreira et al 2011 kahru and elmgren 2014 that negatively influence bathing water quality with some toxins also having severe effects on drinking water resources cheung et al 2013 li et al 2017 paerl et al 2011 the importance of certain cyanobacteria has been recognized by the world health organization guidelines for drinking water quality who 2011 which provides provisional guideline values for microcystin lr the most frequently occurring and toxic of microcystin congeners while in drinking water individual toxins are monitored risk assessments and management in recreational waters regulate just the presence of cyanobacteria quantified as cell numbers or biomass ibelings et al 2014 again the preferred approach suggested by the guidelines is a visual inspection including microscopy for potentially microcystin containing genera the drinking water directive of the eu does not address cyanobacterial toxins and health authorities have turned to the provisional who guideline values to assess whether the concentrations are hazardous li et al 2017 3 detection of pathogenic and toxic microbial contamination by cultivation independent methods 3 1 pathogen tracking important ecosystem services of natural water bodies includes the supply of clean drinking water often accumulated in dam reservoirs from wide catchment areas as well as recreational bathing waters the use of these water resources is regularly affected by microbiological contamination which is caused by potentially harmful microorganisms from intestinal flora various sources can contribute to fecal pollution including wildlife deer boar rodents birds farms and domestic animals poultry cattle sheep cats dogs and humans devane et al 2018 however the currently used methods do not appropriately assess the genetic variability of fecal microbes and resulting changes in their pathogenicity and in the activity of respective functional genes the most relevant present day pathogen tracking in freshwater ecosystems utilizes microbial source tracking mst a technique that uses quantitative pcr methods to detect and quantify gene markers associated with fecal microorganisms e g brooks et al 2020 mckee et al 2020 culture independent approaches have been introduced to provide a sensitive and specific detection of fecal contamination indicators such as e coli salmonella shigella and enterococcus spp as well as campylobacter spp bacteroides spp and viruses or eukaryotes such as giardia lamblia brooks et al 2020 verweij et al 2004 surveyed marker genes traditionally include taxonomic identification using 16s and 23s rrna genes for prokaryotes and 18s rrna genes for eukaryotes they have also been recently expanded to include functional genes that encode the activities traditionally used for identification by selective media such as lacz β galactosidase lamb maltose outer membrane porin and uida β d glucuronidase specific for e coli furthermore methods for the elimination of extracellular dna have been developed e g propidium monoazide to avoid the false positive detection of dead cells which is critical for the monitoring of water bacteriological quality gensberger et al 2014 truchado et al 2016 likewise due to the importance of water as a medium for disseminating human waterborne diseases environmental dna edna protocols have also been established and successfully applied for the detection of other pathogenic microbes causing severe parasite induced human diseases such as leptospira sato et al 2019 however none of these monitoring approaches for fecal contamination has yet provided information about geographic origin and fecal contamination sources as these indicators are universally and indiscriminately found in warm blooded animals recent research on the co evolution between hosts and their gut microbiota i e the host specific microbiome can provide a solution ley et al 2008 more specifically for some taxa such as clostridiales and bacteroidales host specific bacterial classifiers have been developed and used to differentiate the distributions of microbes among human cow deer pig cat and dog sources brooks et al 2020 mckee et al 2020 roguet et al 2018 3 2 cyanobacteria toxin tracking molecular studies of cyanobacteria have mainly focused on evaluating the spatial and temporal variability of cyanobacterial communities similarly to studies of other prokaryotes amplicon sequencing is used either for the identification of particular taxa or operational taxonomic units otus representing the sequence variability of marker gene s e g guedes et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 amplicon sequencing has the potential to monitor toxigenic genotypes of cyanobacteria kurmayer et al 2017 scherer et al 2017 although no single approach has been recommended in cyanobacterial bloom monitoring and cyanotoxin detection due to the variability in their resolution and comparability of results gaget et al 2017 srivastava et al 2012 in addition studies have included the detection of potentially toxic cyanobacteria using quantitative pcr based qpcr approaches e g al tebrineh et al 2010 chiu et al 2017 this method can be used for the quantification and distinction of toxin producing and non producing types of cyanobacteria e g microcystis zuo et al 2018 or the quantification of toxin biosynthesis genes that can be connected with toxin concentrations for assessing toxicity panksep et al 2020 scherer et al 2017 these methods together with traditional approaches microscopy cyanotoxin analysis have been employed for studying the effects of trophic status based on cyanobacterial community composition panksep et al 2020 wood et al 2017 and diversity eiler et al 2013 lee et al 2017 wood et al 2017 yoon et al 2016 table 1 4 microbial bioindicators of anthropogenic impacts 4 1 microbial eukaryotes protists for biomonitoring in the european water framework directive wfd phytoplankton and phytobenthos communities are acknowledged and integrated as biological quality elements bqe for the environmental monitoring of freshwater ecosystems ec 2000 even though many of these bioindicators have been applied in the context of scientific academic research predominantly diatoms phylum bacillariophyta have succeeded in making the transition as bqes from the academic world into the real world of applied freshwater mostly river biomonitoring for these bqes standard protocols have been established european committee for standardization 2016 similarly to the other already established microbial bioindicators the challenges of microscopic diatom surveys mostly include long analysis times and high demand on expert knowledge for taxon identification inevitably differences between individual approaches resulted in variation of taxa inventories among laboratories kahlert et al 2012 kelly et al 2018 this initiated the development of less expensive more efficient and robust edna metabarcoding protocols for diatoms especially in lotic ecosystems bailet et al 2020 kermarrec et al 2014 pérez burillo et al 2020 tapolczai et al 2019 vasselon et al 2019 visco et al 2015 zimmermann et al 2015 in contrast to the diatom edna metabarcoding protocols for river monitoring barely any of these protocols exist for other taxonomic groups of microbial eukaryotes pawlowski et al 2018 2016b 2016a this is surprising because numerous studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of various protistan taxonomic groups to environmental stressors in natural as well as artificial freshwater ecosystems foissner 2016 stoeck et al 2018b for example similar to diatoms green algae and chrysophytes are also excellent bioindicators of nutrient fortification this is due to their frequent species specific nutrient requirements for growth and reproduction gökçe 2016 as well as other environmental parameters such as conductivity çelekli and külköylüoǧlu 2007 oxygen and ph çelekli et al 2014 similarly dinoflagellates are also suitable indicators of nutrient conditions in freshwater systems moore et al 2013 furthermore non photosynthetic protists which are highly responsive to environmental disturbances are omitted in the wfd keck et al 2017 of these amoebas are highly sensitive to various forms of environmental change including sulfur nitrogen carbon dioxide heavy metals and particulate pollutants payne 2013 ciliates phylum ciliophora are sensitive to local environmental conditions including low oxygen concentrations organic enrichment phytoplankton composition acidification heavy metal pollution and various other chemical stressors see references in lynn 2008 accordingly ciliate morphospecies despite not being acknowledged as a bqe in the eu wfd are frequently used as suitable biological indicators for the applied environmental compliance monitoring of rivers in austria berger et al 1997 berger and foissner 2003 they are also used as indicators of activated sludge performance in many european countries foissner and berger 1996 madoni 2011 traditional methods for protist detection include staining and microscopy the diagnosis of protists for the purpose of environmental monitoring using high throughput sequencing technologies is still a relatively young research field pawlowski et al 2016b however the few available studies which have all focused on entire protistan communities rather than individual taxa have demonstrated the strengths of this approach for modern biomonitoring uyaguari diaz et al 2016 xie et al 2017 while for some taxonomic groups such as diatoms non ribosomal genes are preferred as genetic markers e g vasselon et al 2019 the taxonomic diversity of the whole community is best captured with ribosomal genes in the past the v4 and the v9 hypervariable region of the 18s rrna gene have proved suitable for the edna profiling of protistan communities debroas et al 2017 pawlowski et al 2012 stoeck et al 2010 a multiple primer approach has been recommended to capture the full protistan diversity bradley et al 2016 stoeck et al 2006 however this approach also increases the costs of monitoring as well as the complexity and time in sample and data analyses therefore the most suitable choice of pcr primers may have to be evaluated for each individual ecosystem e g lake pond river or creek and the specific monitoring target e g nutrient pollution organic enrichment heavy metal pollution two well known shortcomings in using edna metabarcoding of protistan communities for biomonitoring are taxonomic assignments of sequences and inferring relative abundances of individual indicator taxa from the sequence data due to incomplete reference databases large proportions of sequences remain taxonomically unassigned e g up to 70 of sequences mortágua et al 2019 however ecological quality inference from the remaining taxonomically assigned sequences results in highly similar biological quality status as that obtained from morphospecies data this has recently been demonstrated in river monitoring studies using diatoms mortágua et al 2019 rivera et al 2020 nevertheless a taxonomy free approach that allows descriptions of diatom community structure and diversity without assigning sequences to taxa seems preferable for the evaluation of the environmental health and quality status of water bodies apothéloz perret gentil et al 2017 cordier et al 2019 feio et al 2020 some studies have shown an acceptable agreement between morphospecies abundance or biomass and relative sequence abundance based on sequencing for at least some taxonomic groups pitsch et al 2019 weber and pawlowski 2013 yet variations in gene copy numbers and genome size among protists zhu et al 2005 can introduce artifacts that bias relative abundance estimates in protistan communities leray and knowlton 2016 piwosz et al 2020 a suggested solution to this problem is to focus on individual protistan taxon groups rather than on a whole community so as to reduce the impact of copy number variation stoeck et al 2018a furthermore it is much easier to avoid quantification bias for individual taxonomic groups through the application of a cell biovolume correction factor as has been successfully shown for diatoms vasselon et al 2018 accordingly relative sequence abundances can represent an efficient and reliable measure when inferring the ecological status of ecosystems based on individual protistan taxon groups such as ciliates forster et al 2019 stoeck et al 2018a or foraminiferans pawlowski et al 2016a 2014 moreover recent progress in sequencing allows for the cultivation independent specific targeting of other planktonic protists by newly designed fluorescence in situ hybridization fish probes e g massana et al 2009 šimek et al 2020 however while fish is a promising tool it is also laborious and thus only suitable for providing specific information this includes visualization of important but morphologically almost indistinguishable protistan taxa in situ as well as the inspection of food vacuoles to determine their feeding modes and major trophic interactions in conclusion a whole protistan community survey can encompass the taxonomic and potentially functional diversity thus providing a more complete picture of the ecosystem status a substantial amount of research remains to be done however before the broad application of either of these approaches in environmental monitoring can be initiated mortágua et al 2019 supplementary table s2 table 2 4 2 prokaryote taxa and functional genes for biomonitoring prokaryotes respond to environmental conditions by changes in their proportional abundances within the community and diversity as well as through expressing various functions these responses are characteristic of individual stressors due to the different physiology of various bacterial and archaeal lineages in various freshwater ecosystems e g garcia et al 2018 jacquiod et al 2018 newton et al 2011 4 2 1 nitrogen input high amounts of nitrogen added to the environment by synthetic and organic fertilizers as well as through the burning of fossil fuels heavily contribute to anthropogenic eutrophication in many studies concentrations of various nitrogen forms ammonium nitrite and nitrates and total nitrogen nh4 n nox n and tn accounted for considerable shifts in bacterial community structures in the sediments of both rivers and lakes fig 2 supplementary table s3 this indicates that nitrogen is particularly important in shaping the diversity patterns of bacterial communities in aquatic environments wan et al 2017 in the available literature mostly nitrospirae betaproteobacteriales chloroflexi and sphingobacteriales proportionally increased with nitrogen concentrations fig 2 supplementary table s3a nitrospirae are important nitrite oxidizers in freshwater lake sediments consequently these bacteria flourish in high nitrogen conditions wan et al 2017 and notably a higher concentrations of nh4 promote the growth of nitrospirales wan et al 2017 betaproteobacteriales former class betaprotobacteria are functionally diverse but this order encompasses the majority of ammonia oxidizing bacteria yang et al 2016a it seems that the chemolithoautotrophic members of this group may particularly benefit from increased concentrations of reduced inorganic nitrogen compounds including ammonium furthermore betaproteobacteriales play a role in nitrogen fixation occurring in sediments wu et al 2009 chloroflexi are nitrogen fixing bacteria dos santos et al 2012 and nitrate has been negatively correlated with chloroflexi communities zhang et al 2015 finally sphingobacteriales which also increase with elevated nitrogen are typically obligatory and facultative aerobic chemoorganotrophs their increased occurrence in the community is likely related to the conditions of waste water treatment plant effluents described below drury et al 2013 fig 2 supplementary table s3a b a large number of archaea are also active in processing nitrogen in surface waters and sediments wang et al 2018 interestingly while sediment nitrate contents can negatively affect bacterial diversity one study found that archaeal community diversity was not sensitive to any of the environmental factors measured zhang et al 2015 4 2 2 anthropogenic organic pollution the effects of waste water treatment plant wwtp effluents on microbial activity and diversity have frequently been studied especially in lotic environments all studies have found bacterial communities to be strongly influenced by wwtps or similar pollution sources chonova et al 2018 drury et al 2013 ibekwe et al 2016 commonly increases in the proportions of nitrospirae sphingobacteriales bacteroidetes and spirochaetes and a general decrease of actinobacteria see below have been observed in the communities downstream of wwtps fig 2 supplementary table s3b nitrospirae and some bacteroidetes are the dominant taxa of activated sludge huang et al 2017 wan et al 2017 therefore their increased proportion in microbial communities directly indicates the influence of wwtp effluents in contrast sphingobacteriales bacteroidetes seem to proliferate after the wwtp inflow possibly in response to increased resources for the river community which stimulates the growth of bacteria and higher organisms hladilek et al 2016 korajkic et al 2015 spirochaetes another commonly observed taxon increased in wwtp effluents are known as abundant endosymbionts often associated with invertebrate gut contents where they break down lignocellulose and fix nitrogen van de water et al 2016 actinobacteria might generally represent a good bioindicator because the proportion of their particular clades in microbial communities across all habitats are highly responsive to changing environmental factors meziti et al 2016 neuenschwander et al 2018 newton et al 2011 youssef and elshahed 2009 in particular pelagic actinobacteria seem to be sensitive to eutrophication e g liu et al 2019 although they are also capable of degrading complex organic compounds and pollutants in the sediment alvarez et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 fig 2 supplementary table s3b c 4 2 3 metals pharmaceuticals and personal care products river and lake sediments act as a sink for persistent anthropogenic contaminants such as heavy metals antibiotics other pharmaceuticals pesticides disinfectants and their residues these compounds are released slowly and pose potential threats to aquatic life and human health for an extended period of time kerrigan et al 2018 liao et al 2019 metals the toxicity of some metals is a result of their pro oxidative activity gauthier et al 2014 giner lamia et al 2014 the modification of conformation structures of nucleic acids and proteins and their interference with oxidative phosphorylation and osmotic balance nies 1999 although metals clearly interfere with microbial life no trend has been found for the effects of metal pollution on bacterial communities in the studies reviewed here fig 2 supplementary table s3d metal contamination of sediments results in the increased abundance of genes involved in metal homeostasis including genes for metal import mobilization storage and efflux efflux pumps along with other resistance mechanisms can be quite general since they transport many harmful substances from the cell chandrangsu et al 2017 roosa et al 2014 yin et al 2015 thus heavy metals can co select for resistance to antibiotics as documented in a study which retrospectively researched over a century s worth of anthropogenic pollution dickinson et al 2019 since metal resistance is often plasmid bound their presence does not correspond to a specific bacterial taxon due to the inherent ephemeral nature of these genetic elements and they should be assessed in a taxonomy independent way however this approach may be complicated by the common association of heavy metal and antibiotic resistance genes in the same plasmids rahube et al 2014 heavy metals also induce horizontal gene transfer and dna uptake by bacteria which is evidenced by increased integron activity and diversity nemergut et al 2004 offering another bioindication approach see below pharmaceuticals and personal care products pcps present particularly in wwtp effluents accumulate in sediments barra caracciolo et al 2015 resulting in response of local microbial communities supplementary table s3e the response of taxa seems to be dependent on both the chemical structure of the degraded compound as well as their relationship to oxygen concentration wolff et al 2018 antibiotic resistance genes args are either selected from the community aminov and mackie 2007 or transferred to the environment with bacteria in waste water amos et al 2014 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 for the major classes of antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine a variety of resistance determinants exist which makes their targeted assessment or quantitation difficult aminov et al 2002 gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga bacteroidetes increased in several systems in response to the presence of these chemicals while betaproteobacteriales decreased grenni et al 2014 kim et al 2017 the degradation of pharmaceuticals also usually increases nitrification which likely reflects the utilization of nitrogen from these compounds by various taxa men et al 2017 nsenga kumwimba and meng 2019 xu et al 2016 the most common group of enzymes degrading pharmaceuticals and pcps are monooxygenases these enzymes are relatively rare and not widespread among different bacterial species which makes them useful bioindicators achermann et al 2020 4 2 4 functional groups and marker genes monitoring the dynamics of functional groups is a preferred approach for study aquatic ecosystems because their assessment targets precisely the provided ecosystem services this approach is not generally used for eukaryotic microbes because they are not as metabolically diversified and also often difficult to cultivate so the metabolism of many taxa has not been examined likewise archaea are often only studied in specific situations so their use in functional diversity assessments needs to be researched further compte port et al 2020 zou et al 2019 traditionally bacteria are assigned to physiological groups according to substrate utilization products of metabolism growth condition preferences and biotic interactions however functions are unevenly distributed within prokaryotic taxa and thus need to be assessed by tools focusing directly on metabolic pathways e g falk et al 2019 yin et al 2015 moreover most taxonomic groups are not cultivable so molecular methods are the only cultivation independent option for their accurate quantification a variety of functional genes have already been extensively studied their activities are well characterized and primers for their direct quantification by qpcr have been validated by studies in different habitats table 3 in the future the selection of marker genes can be based on shotgun metagenomic analyses of contrasting sites to complement the knowledge on metabolic pathways assessed from isolated microbes their physiological studies and whole genome sequences 4 2 5 carbon cycling carbon dioxide and methane are currently responsible for approximately 80 of the radiative forcing from long lived greenhouse gasses these two gasses represent key metabolic pathways in carbon recycling because they represent a transfer link between inorganic and organic carbon forms levine et al 2011 in freshwater ecosystems heterotrophic bacteria despite their tiny size regulate the freshwater carbon cycle by processing globally significant amounts of carbon therefore it is essential to understand the factors that control microbial activity i e the underlying context for why freshwater ecosystems serve as hot spots for carbon cycling schmidt et al 2020 carbon sequestration the most important global carbon sink is photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation co2 however the chemolithotrophic fixation of co2 is also important and distributed through different phyla of bacteria and archaea berg 2011 since the known pathways of co2 fixation are respective to either phototrophic microorganisms or chemolithotrophic bacteria and archaea monitoring of genes specific to these pathways may reveal the different proportions of assimilated co2 between oxygenated and oxygen deficient environments alfreider et al 2017 table 3 methanogeny and methanotrophy methanogenesis contributes to the removal of organic matters and is the central process in the carbon cycle within anoxic layers of water and sediments lüders 2001 staley et al 2014 yang et al 2020 the methyl coenzyme m reductase α subunit encoding gene mcra has been used as a marker to assess the abundance and diversity of methanogen populations and the gene encoding monooxygenase subunit a pmoa as a marker of methanotrophic communities yang et al 2019b 2020 changes in the abundance of methanogens may indicate a limited oxygen availability in the sediments horton et al 2019 wang et al 2018 table 3 targeting methano and methylotrophy is essential for determining the potential of methane release knief 2015 4 2 6 nitrogen cycling pathways the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and carbon appear to be most heavily impacted by human activities gruber and galloway 2008 the high availability of various nitrogen forms in both sediment and water bodies is often reflected by an increased proportion and expression of genes encoding specific processes involved in nitrogen cycling for example nitrification anammox denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium have been detected by metagenomic metatranscriptomic and targeted quantitative studies fan et al 2019 pang et al 2019 yang et al 2016a yao et al 2018 yin et al 2019 table 3 the balance between n sinks e g denitrification riverine outputs and sediment burial and sources e g n2 fixation sediment release riverine inputs and atmospheric deposition determines the n budget in an ecosystem yao et al 2018 nitrogen fixation cyanobacteria include many n2 fixing taxa but heterotrophic chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic bacteria and archaea can also carry out n2 fixation thus the potential for sediment n2 fixation is widespread severin et al 2012 yao et al 2018 nitrogen fixation activities have been correlated with sediment water content density tn content and tp content as well as with the quantity and quality of organic matter in sediments newell et al 2016 in one study nitrogen fixation was significantly negatively correlated with nitrate levels dissolved inorganic n levels and denitrification rates caton et al 2018 while another study correlated n fixing nifh genes with nh4 fan et al 2019 interestingly it seems that decreased nitrogen fixation in sediments can predict cyanobacterial blooms yao et al 2018 nitrification and denitrification long term high n loading affects the central processes of the n cycle by increasing rates of nitrification and denitrification and decreasing the efficiency of n use by community members the relative abundances of denitrification genes nitrification genes and all p related genes have showed a significantly positive correlation with the levels of nutrients such as tn tp toc and nh4 fan et al 2019 the ammonia oxidizing genes of archaea and bacteria are involved in the nitrification process and bacterial ammonia oxidizers seem to be less sensitive to eutrophication than archaeal ones yang et al 2016a furthermore nitrate reduction and methanogenesis appear to be primary processes in the contaminant transformations of persistent organic pollutants falk et al 2019 4 2 7 phosphorus and sulfur cycling pathways phosphorus is a limiting factor for organisms in terrestrial oceanic and freshwater environments particularly during the growing season because biologically available inorganic phosphate tends to get depleted janssen et al 2019 under such circumstances microorganisms utilizing p containing organic compounds have an advantage the major enzymes required for this activity are alkaline phosphatases apases of phoa phox and phod families these differentiate the functional groups into phototrophic cyanobacteria and heterotrophic proteobacteria and firmicutes the other phyla possessing these enzyme activities kageyama et al 2011 table 3 different abundance distribution patterns of various phosphatases have been observed in summer and winter while phosphorus solubilization was shown to be one of the most important processes in summer fan et al 2019 sulfate reducers are key organisms in the decomposition of organic matter in anoxic environments because they have the highest affinity for acetate the final product of fermentation and recycle it to co2 while also releasing hydrogen sulfide lovley et al 1982 genes from sulfate reduction pathways in particular the apsa apra gene coding for adenosine phosphosulfate reductase and dsrab sulfite reductase have been proposed as bioindicators watanabe et al 2016 the increased occurrence of genes from sulfate reducing pathways is typically connected to metal pollution yin et al 2015 however the genes are also indicative of other pollutants such as microplastics pinnell and turner 2019 table 3 4 2 8 mobile genetic elements of the mobile elements participating in horizontal gene transfer integrons have received attention for reacting to different types of anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 they were first characterized as elements disseminating antibiotic resistance however molecular studies have revealed that integrons occur in all environments are able to move between species and lineages and appear to play a general role in bacterial adaptation and genome evolution gillings 2014 furthermore these genes reside in diverse bacterial species often on mobile genetic elements and are often linked to antibiotic resistance disinfectants and heavy metals quantification of a relatively conserved variant of class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 spreading in clinical environments was successfully used in the monitoring of anthropogenic pollution also gene abundance can rapidly change in response to a broad range of environmental pressures including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons wang et al 2017 and pesticides dealtry et al 2014 both integrases intl1 and intl2 also increased in biofilms colonizing microplastic particles wang et al 2020 5 microbial indices microbial indices based on eukaryotes are mainly focused on diatoms in streams and rivers rimet 2012 stevenson et al 2010 the standardized indices are based on traditional morphological identifications kelly et al 2009 recently edna based approaches have been developed a curated reference database has been established e g rimet et al 2019 and up scaling for monitoring networks has been processed e g vasselon et al 2019 standardization is now in progress at the european committee for standardization cen 2018a 2018b however these approaches are mostly based on existing morpho taxonomic indices changing only the methodology used to obtain species lists di moltaxfree apothéloz perret gentil et al 2017 based on amplicon sequencing of 18s rrna is the only currently proposed taxonomy free diatom index table 2 several types of prokaryotic indices have been proposed to date based on abundances or proportions of selected taxa responsive to certain environmental conditions or on taxa providing a specific function in the water column or sediment table 4 the indices have already been used for the identification of characteristics such as nutrient levels urbanization intensity land use etc and have successfully been correlated with those based on eukaryotic taxonomic groups such as macrophytes macroinvertebrates or fishes however as different taxonomic indicators may highlight distinct stressors on aquatic systems indicators based on different biological groups can conflict in their assessment of ecosystem health status horton et al 2019 in freshwater environments yang et al 2016a observed a difference in the proportion of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob in lakes differing in their trophic status with aob being more abundant in a hypertrophic lake niu et al 2018 proposed a complex microbial community based index of biotic integrity mcibi for assessment of the ecological status of rivers based on prokaryotic communities in the sediment the index includes five core metrics table 4 among the included metrics the highest discriminative power is provided by log aob aoa log of the ratio of ammonium oxidizing bacteria to ammonium oxidizing archaea and bfg a the ratio of bacteroidetes firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria to alphaproteobacteria followed by fca percentage of firmicutes chloroflexi and acidobacteria ji et al 2019 proposed a bacterial eutrophic index bei to quantitatively describe water quality which was defined as the ratio of the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and actinobacteria otus in the water column at the studied sites the bei index ranged between 0 55 and 2 65 for lakes of the lowest and the highest trophic levels respectively novel indices can be proposed using a combination of the above mentioned taxa with high bioindication values and functional genes in such indices general variables such as microbial diversity or the relative proportion of primary producers or their quantity defined by chlorophyll a concentration might be combined with more specific indicators reflecting individual functional groups together these may then more precisely assess the quality of an environment niu et al 2018 yang et al 2019a 6 microbial communities 6 1 responses to multiple stressors environmental stressors and disturbances include impacts from diffuse sources for example the runoff of inorganic nutrients from agriculture and other land use natural organic compounds arising from animal husbandry or urbanized areas or more specific compounds coming from storm water runoff wwtp effluents ground water or even underground constructions such as pipes or trenches hatt et al 2004 ibekwe et al 2016 lemaire et al 2020 wiest et al 2018 these stressors co occur in ecosystems and often interact to produce effects that can be less than the sum of their individual effects antagonistic overall decreased stress or greater than the sum of their individual effects synergistic overall increased stress birk et al 2020 folt et al 1999 piggott et al 2015b non additive effects are frequent often being the rule rather than the exception in aquatic systems orr et al 2020 however current legislation on biomonitoring and the management of aquatic ecosystems is often based on the assumption that the effects of multiple stressors are additive villar argaiz et al 2018 jackson et al 2016 crain et al 2008 which may result in an underestimation of impacts multiple stressors may depend on an organism s mode of nutrition i e autotrophs may tend to respond antagonistically while heterotrophs tend to respond more synergistically nuy et al 2018 antagonistic effects of stressors seem more common in primary producers and freshwaters while a synergy of stressors is more common in marine environments synergistic responses still occur in freshwater systems but need further investigations to ensure sufficient management crain et al 2008 jackson et al 2016 antagonisms seem to be the more common stressor induced interaction at the community level likely due to the co tolerance of taxa nuy et al 2018 salis et al 2017 as a tolerance to one stressor can improve the tolerance to a second stressor that acts through similar mechanisms vinebrooke et al 2004 many microbes are substrate flexible and metabolize both inorganic and organic compounds of anthropogenic origin e g pollutants mitigating some of the anthropogenic impact kiersztyn et al 2019 however the degradation byproducts of pollutants can sometimes be more toxic than the original compound varjani et al 2017 so specialized microbes with appropriate metabolic capabilities may be needed for their further biodegradation chakraborty and das 2016 the synergy or antagonism of multiple stressors must be considered when searching for bioindicators because some stressors may produce common effects the response of organisms to multiple stressors seems to be dependent on the environmental conditions of aquatic systems richardson et al 2018 in line with this effects of stressors on biofilm formation were found to depend on sediment and nutrient conditions piggott et al 2015a similarly ecosystem processes were observed to be more vulnerable to stress in naturally harsh environments usually inhabited by specialized microbes tolkkinen et al 2015 since microbes are abundant and functionally diversified even a small change in the composition of primary producers leads to significant changes in the quality of their metabolites and exudates and thus may cause large changes in specialized microbes in such situations specialized groups may be used for disentangling the combined effects of various stressors e g horňák et al 2017 6 2 biotic interactions microbial community patterns are strongly influenced by complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors as well as typical doubling times of microbes of hours to days pernthaler 2017 šimek et al 2014 environmental and geographic factors explain only a part of the biological variation bock et al 2020 for example interactions include the bacterial incorporation of organic carbon exudated by phytoplankton horňák et al 2017 sarmento et al 2016 šimek et al 2011 woodhouse et al 2018 or grazing by heterotrophic protists grossart et al 2008 grujčić et al 2018 pernthaler 2005 salcher et al 2016 šimek et al 2013 notably even small changes in characteristics of the bacterial prey community have been found to rapidly cascade up to the food chain via a considerable alteration in the trophic level of protistan predator communities grujčić et al 2018 šimek et al 2020 2013 moreover heterotrophic bacteria can produce growth promoting compounds such as vitamins and can improve nutrient supplies for phytoplankton cole 1982 croft et al 2005 the presence and abundance of distinct species thus affects the occurrence of other species due to biotic interactions including trophic relationships symbiosis parasitism allelopathy or chemical communication some species with similar preferences may co occur in the same habitats or exclude each other by competition in micro niches and some replace each other by chance grossmann et al 2016 louca et al 2018 which complicates the interpretation of co occurrence patterns due to the significance of random processes in community assemblies multi species and community approaches are likely to be more reproducible and more reliable for biomonitoring than single species approaches assigning otus to trophic guilds or functional traits is a straightforward basis for tracking down groups of otus that have a similar bioindication value however such assignments are currently limited to very general traits ramond et al 2019 while only a very minor fraction of amplicon diversity can be linked to more specific traits given the vast gaps in linking microbial sequences to species and species to ecology co occurrence networks and related tools are indicative of interactions without an a priori knowledge about the species identity and ecology behind distinct otus bock et al 2020 steele et al 2011 furthermore parameters elucidated by network analyses such as the connectedness and the presence or absence of certain interactive links might be strong indicators for habitat characteristics schloter et al 2018 7 recommendations for biomonitoring molecular methods based on the extraction of nucleic acids or proteins from environmental samples enable a complex view of microbial communities as a result their composition structure and diversity have been connected to environmental traits and stressors newton and mclellan 2015 tanentzap et al 2019 with these measures able to be used as broad scale bioindicators however even in this broad scheme sediment or water column habitats should be sampled separately because their microbial communities differ substantially ibekwe et al 2016 zeglin 2015 in addition the responses to stressors differ according to long term and short term events long term continuous impacts typically lead to a changes in community compositions e g gillan et al 2015 the effects of combined stressors on microbial community are also clearly influenced by functional redundancy and various resistance mechanisms which differ considerably between taxonomic and functional groups delgado baquerizo et al 2017 deng et al 2020 jacquiod et al 2018 thus functions commonly provided by many taxa are less affected by the community composition in comparison shared resistance within related taxonomic groups may ensure group survival which can result in differences in the resistance and resilience of various taxa also leading to community alteration cabrerizo et al 2019 finally different growth rates reflecting optimal conditions for non affected taxa may further modify the resulting community composition pernthaler 2017 for more precise bioindication the methodological approach should be selected depending on the goal i e the type of assessed pollution achermann et al 2020 therefore the expected driver s of environmental changes such as water level fluctuations eutrophication from agriculture wwtp effluents diffuse pollution metals etc should be identified a priori for adequate water quality evaluation apart from the already mentioned monitoring strategy focusing on measures of community composition structure and diversity see introduction strategy b the tracking and quantification of individual microbial taxa strategy a or the targeting of specific functional groups or genes strategy c may also be used depending on the particular situation strategy a possibly represents the easiest modification to current routine protocols because monitoring of those organisms is already part of legislation the other strategies can be applied to various sources of pollution bioindication as follows eutrophication and diffuse pollution seem to be most appropriately monitored using the bacterial community structure in the water column in both lakes and rivers eutrophication leads to an increase in bacteria otu richness henson et al 2018 ibekwe et al 2016 kiersztyn et al 2019 which implies that community richness is a general bioindicator of eutrophication the taxonomic composition of bacteria is strongly influenced by the presence of planktonic cyanobacteria which proportionally increase with eutrophication for european lakes see kiersztyn et al 2019 while pelagic actinobacteria prefer oligotrophic habitats and decrease with eutrophication zeglin 2015 this suggests the ratio between cyanobacteria and actinobacteria otus in open water is another community bioindicator which has been already tested in the monitoring of some chinese lakes ji et al 2019 yet only the short term impacts of eutrophication can be appropriately determined using bacterial communities that is due to the fact that longer exposure to eutrophication leads to the adaption of bacteria to increased nutrient levels which stabilizes the bacterial community and the influence of eutrophication is diminished jacquiod et al 2018 kiersztyn et al 2019 despite this the long term effect of continuous eutrophication can result in loss of beta diversity monchamp et al 2018 in addition to eutrophication augmented levels of nitrogen can be indicated using the bacterial community structure in both lakes and rivers in particular betaproteobacteriales increase proportionally with n concentrations horton et al 2019 wan et al 2017 in both rivers and lakes nitrospirae seem to systematically positively correlate to increased nitrogen not only with respect to dispersed pollution but also in response to wwtp or point source effluents which makes them a good indicator of hidden inputs of waste water e g chu et al 2018 drury et al 2013 huang et al 2019 organic pollution and compounds associated with organic matter such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics seem to be best monitored in sediments where both natural organic compounds and anthropogenic organic pollutants accumulate making sediments an accumulation hotspot jacquiod et al 2018 in sediment prokaryotic communities the proportion of actinobacteria may be the simplest indicator of organic pollution since actinobacteria are adapted to high concentrations of organic matter zeglin 2015 and consistently increase with organic contamination deposited in sediments beale et al 2017 ibekwe et al 2016 furthermore a decrease in richness and other diversity measures can be a measure of organic pollution because the reduced taxonomic and potentially also functional diversity is a result of biotic homogenization arising from major pollutant discharges or through the introduction of non indigenous bacteria drury et al 2013 a more specific approach in the determination of organic pollution could use the class 1 integron integrase inti1 gene as a marker of horizontal gene transfer the frequency of which increases in organically polluted waters gillings et al 2015 microbial functional groups offer an elegant de novo approach to biomonitoring through the quantification of individual nutrient cycling pathways the most important are the carbon and nitrogen flows and sinks methane production is a key pathway in the carbon cycle and methane metabolism is correlated to organic pollution through oxygen availability quantification of mcra and pmoa genes which respectively mark methanogeny and methanotrophy have already been applied in the ba ibi index yang et al 2019a our suggestion is to add measures proxies of primary production either by the respective genes or simply by quantifying chlorophyll a to assess the proportion of co2 fixation to the methane cycle as a measure of carbon flow since euryarchaeota are the only methanogens their proportion in the prokaryotic community may be used instead of gene quantification for the community structure based approach for nitrogen the key pathways include n2 fixation and denitrification and thus the proportional quantity of the respective genes may represent a novel bioindicator of nitrogen flow metal pollution can be determined using either community structure particularly by the increased proportion of betaproteobacteriales together with an altered proportion of other taxa see fig 2 or bacteria typical for sulfur metabolism from the class deltaproteobacteria desulfomicrobiaceae desulfobacteraceae hatam et al 2019 liao et al 2019 metal pollution can also be detected by genes coding for metal homeostasis the gene apsa coding for adenylyl sulfate reductase or other genes involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway li et al 2018 see fig 2 pharmaceuticals cosmetics and other anthropogenic organic molecules appear to be most challenging for bioindication because their individual characteristics cause specific changes in microbial communities which may be difficult to observe in complex samples ecological studies have revealed chronic long term negative impacts on aquatic habitats rather than immediate toxicity barra caracciolo et al 2015 interactions among enzymes and such pollutants have identified several groups of potentially indicative taxa and genes however our current knowledge remains limited achermann et al 2020 for routine applications therefore specific bioindication may only be possible through functional community metrics of metagenomics metatranscriptomics fig 1b 8 future possibilities for biomonitoring studies metagenomics metatranscriptomics can predict community functions even if the function is rare achermann et al 2020 these approaches are thus promising but relatively few reference datasets are currently available and they often lack a sufficient number of replicates achermann et al 2020 cordier et al 2020 consequently we propose that the construction of large scale spatial and temporal metagenomic metatranscriptomic reference data sets covering habitats relevant to water quality bioindication should proceed including references to methodologies and data storage using this approach co variations of functional genes species and environmental variables can be identified thus facilitating the selection of appropriate bioindicators the focus might be placed on 1 genes indicating trophic status that participate in major nutrient pathways particularly those that enable transitions between inorganic and organic forms e g methanogens and methanotrophs or nitrogen fixators and denitrifies or 2 genes indicating toxic pollution i e those participating in horizontal gene transfer particularly of various resistances furthermore shallow metagenomic techniques are becoming financially more efficient than multiple quantitative pcr though the results are more complex however manipulative laboratory studies targeting the effects of individual and multiple stressors on various parameters of aquatic environments should also be conducted to gain additional insights into the functioning of aquatic microbial communities using metagenomics metatranscriptomics finally the identification of keystone taxa and rare community members should be included in environmental evaluations to assess aquatic ecosystem stability long term adaptation and the resolution of functional redundancy herren and mcmahon 2018 pernthaler 2017 poursat et al 2019 a further recommended approach to improve the application of environmental genomics based bioindication by microorganisms is to introduce novel bioinformatic tools firstly network analyses can identify taxa with similar habitat requirements and or interacting taxa banerjee et al 2016 bock et al 2020 and also establish sets of sequence variants indicative of certain habitat characteristics similar to the current use of indicator morphospecies in e g macrozoobenthos or diatoms similarly supervised machine learning is currently the best solution to classification problems involving multidimensional and noisy datasets libbrecht and noble 2015 and its use could significantly improve the reliability of microbial community patterns analyses cordier et al 2020 2019 the application of such techniques requires training datasets for which model metagenomic metatranscriptomic studies are most useful because of the unbiased quantification of both community structure and the presence activity of bioindicating metabolic pathways 9 outlook practical applications the still incomplete list of case studies presented in this review highlight the immense added value of microbial indicators for environmental monitoring and process understanding in freshwater ecosystems while for many important stressors the pressure response functions are well known a profound understanding of the indication value of microbial taxa in the context of novel and multiple stressors is still in need of further validation prior to inclusion in formal regulatory biomonitoring programs such method plausibility checks and data validation are needed in the context of larger transdisciplinary networks based on the derived results formal implementation can be initiated here case studies should target long term ecological monitoring sites e g haase et al 2018 mirtl et al 2018 routine monitoring sites of regulatory monitoring programs as well as operational monitoring sites from e g sewage plants or aquacultures e g pawlowski et al 2016a 2014 for such sites a wealth of information on other environmental parameters in particular stressors typically exist this creates a unique set of metadata to fuel synergies when it comes to developing novel diagnostic tools as part of so called weight of evidence approaches e g höss et al 2011 wolfram et al 2012 besides such coordinated approaches to derive indicators formal standardization is of critical importance scientific standards of microbial community analysis using high throughput amplicon sequencing have previously been proposed e g for soil samples within the earth microbiome project https earthmicrobiome org including dna isolation marotz et al 2017 minich et al 2018 amplification and sequencing caporaso et al 2012 2011 and for marine water column samples jeunen et al 2019 however when considering the application of novel indicators into future regulatory monitoring formal standardization e g via the international organization for standardization iso or in parallel the european committee for standardization cen cenelec is a pivotal step this starts with decisions on where and how to sample because great variability exists due to seasons and various unexpected point sources of contaminated water lemaire et al 2020 meziti et al 2019 wan et al 2017 yao et al 2018 here however traditional standards for sampling and propositions for novel edna based methods are in the process of development cen tc 230 wg 28 with respect to laboratory analysis it is known that the reproducibility of molecular techniques largely depends on the quality and representativeness of environmental dna including cell lysis and purification steps furthermore the quantification of marker genes by real time qpcr are especially sensitive to template edna quality including fragmentation and the presence of inhibitors which may be site and sample specific hargreaves et al 2013 many formal standards for traditional biomontioring programs exist and are intercalibrated the same holds true for medical forensic or classical ecotoxicological analyses for example iso 11063 describes standards for dna extraction for assessing microbial abundance and community structure in soils and iso 22119 on procedures for qpcr validation of food borne pathogens in addition to field and lab standards the standardization of bioinformatic pipelines will be also needed to achieve inter laboratory comparability of results as existing pipelines have been shown to provide different outputs bailet et al 2020 by co extracting variable types and amounts of inhibitory substances limitations may be diminished by using digital droplet pcr ddpcr dingle et al 2013 for details see methodological annex again a comparability of results among laboratories requires rigorous standards which may be inspired by the proposed minimum information for the publication of quantitative pcr experiments for real time pcr bustin et al 2011 and ddpcr huggett et al 2013 10 conclusions in conclusion our review demonstrates that the inclusion of microbial bioindicators can provide improved assessments of water quality including both general and specific stressor diagnostics although bioindicators of processes such as eutrophication have already been established by other approaches the use of microbes and prokaryotes in particular represents not only a monitoring tool but also a path toward the deeper understanding of processes underlying water quality parameters using microbes for the regular observation of major nutrient pathways and recycling allows the quantification of flows and sinks in the biosphere over long time periods finally studies on microbes have proposed various bioindicators that can be used to create biotic indices specifically targeting the most important stressors in various regions and habitats the indices developed so far have shown that a combination of taxon dependent markers with functional markers is possible which makes them more powerful than currently used traditional indices based only on the identification of taxa considering all currently available results we advise that decisions be made towards including microbes with their high growth and community dynamics in biomonitoring programs of freshwater environments declaration of

17200,bioindication has become an indispensable part of water quality monitoring in most countries of the world with the presence and abundance of bioindicator taxa mostly multicellular eukaryotes used for biotic indices in contrast microbes bacteria archaea and protists are seldom used as bioindicators in routine assessments although they have been recognized for their importance in environmental processes recently the use of molecular methods has revealed unexpected diversity within known functional groups and novel metabolic pathways that are particularly important in energy and nutrient cycling in various habitats microbial communities respond to eutrophication metals and natural or anthropogenic organic pollutants through changes in diversity and function in this review we evaluated the common trends in these changes documenting that they have value as bioindicators and can be used not only for monitoring but also for improving our understanding of the major processes in lotic and lentic environments current knowledge provides a solid foundation for exploiting microbial taxa community structures and diversity as well as functional genes in novel monitoring programs these microbial community measures can also be combined into biotic indices improving the resolution of individual bioindicators here we assess particular molecular approaches complemented by advanced bioinformatic analysis as these are the most promising with respect to detailed bioindication value we conclude that microbial community dynamics are a missing link important for our understanding of rapid changes in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems and should be addressed in the future environmental monitoring of freshwater ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction 1 1 freshwater ecosystems are rapidly altered by anthropogenic pressures freshwater environments support high species diversity and are more functionally diverse than other ecosystems surface freshwaters lakes ponds streams and rivers are among the most extensively and rapidly altered ecosystems encompassing changes in physical structure chemistry biotic characteristics and interactions carpenter et al 2011 this alteration increases threats to global biodiversity and thus also the processes modulating nutrient cycling community stability and food web structures grill et al 2019 vörösmarty et al 2010 ecosystem services provided by prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes have considerable impacts on rates of energy and nutrient flows as well as the intensity of many trophic interactions since aquatic microbes also possess high metabolic and growth rates they are highly responsive to local and global pressures and are directly influenced by changes in physico chemical characteristics including inputs of organic and inorganic compounds and pollutants caruso et al 2016 pernthaler 2017 šimek et al 2014 in addition rare microbes can act as a hidden backbone and provide resistance and resilience against disturbances garcia et al 2018 jousset et al 2017 therefore measurable responses to environmental stressors caused by human activities can be predicted through the changes in microbial community diversity dynamics and activity occurring in disturbed ecosystems fig 1 a microbe based bioindicators can be selected from a broad variety of taxonomic groups mediating processes such as oxygenic photosynthesis or the assimilation of carbon dioxide carried out by e g cyanobacteria and algae or complex microbial food webs forming networks that link many heterotrophic microorganisms to the dissolved carbon pool azam et al 1983 šimek et al 2019 šimek et al 2014 sommer et al 2012 however other ecosystem services that are not associated with particular taxa require the selection of appropriate bioindicators that target specific metabolic pathways examples of these pathways include anoxygenic photosynthesis provided by only few bacterial phyla nitrogen fixation carried out by only specialized prokaryotes and methanogenesis delivered by only syntrophic interactions of archaea compte port et al 2020 waidner and kirchman 2008 yao et al 2018 additionally genes coding for metal or antibiotic resistances might be used for bioindication of the respective pollutants roosa et al 2014 similarly biotic interactions can be reflected either in general trophic patterns bock et al 2020 or in very specialized host parasite endosymbiont relationships such as in chlamydiae and their amoebae hosts pizzetti et al 2012 since the beginning of world wide water biomonitoring reviewed in bonada et al 2006 santos et al 2019 environmental microbiology has experienced enormous conceptual and methodological developments with the implementation of cultivation independent molecular methods many tools have been applied including high throughput sequencing phylochip geochip quantitative pcr metagenomics metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics for details see supplementary files molecular approaches have considerably increased knowledge of aquatic microbial community richness diversity and functional variability mansfeldt et al 2020 however a systematic compilation of distinct microbial taxa and functional groups associated with water pollution measures is lacking novel strategies for including environmental genomics in water quality monitoring that reflect ecosystem functions have been previously proposed cordier et al 2020 regarding novel microbe based bioindication the strategies can be modified to provide assessments of both broad scale processes indicated by many prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa as well as narrow scale processes indicated by a limited number of specialized prokaryotes apothéloz perret gentil et al 2017 falk et al 2019 roosa et al 2014 tanentzap et al 2019 yao et al 2018 thus the strategies for assessments using microbial bioindicators include the following a tracking of specific taxa their quantification and precise taxonomic detection used e g in fecal coliform bacteria or water borne pathogens b novel community based bioindicators such as diversity indices employed in determining changes of broad ecosystem services and c functional community population assessments focused on specific metabolic pathways or specialized microbial activities furthermore the value of using microbial responses to environmental stressors compared to bioindication by multicellular eukaryotes or direct chemical measurements lies in the possibility to identify contamination transfers through aquatic ecosystems those are reflected in altered nutrient cycling metabolic pathways and trophic links which are then clearly attributable to specific microorganisms consequently this review aims to establish a solid foundation for the widespread adoption of microbes as bioindicators and or variables in biotic indices in freshwater ecosystems additionally we propose using microorganisms to distinguish the effects of environmental stressors that cannot be determined by other presently used indicators 2 current legislation deals only with cultivable pathogenic and toxic microorganisms current biomonitoring programs for aquatic ecosystems do not generally include both wide environmental screening and narrow critical pathways that are detectable only in certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms usually only selected microorganisms and their products are used in particular fecal indicator bacteria water borne pathogens or the quantification of toxins in europe the drinking water directive 2015 1787 98 83 ec ec 2015 1998 and the bathing water directive 2006 7 ec ec 2006 as well as related legislation in the usa epa 815 f 08 001 epa 600 r 12 551 epa 910 r 15 002 ccl4 2016 epa 2016 canada 1970 australian and new zealand environment and conservation council 2000 india 2012 south africa 2015 and state council of the people s republic of china 2015 include a limited number of pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria surveillance of bacteria such as escherichia coli and enterococci as well as protists such as cryptosporidium giardia and naegleria fowleri is mandatory in many countries in the eu and eee world health organization guidelines for drinking water quality who 2011 since gastrointestinal illnesses associated with exposure to contaminated waters can vary according to the host organism information on the origin of contamination is essential for risk mitigation therefore some directives also require the identification of contamination sources in international watercourses directive 95 308 ec ec 1995 for these organisms the directives rely on a cultivation based approach built on the counting and characterization of viable cells on differential selective media under defined cultivation conditions cyanobacteria are another microbial group included in legislation because they produce toxins scums and odors ferreira et al 2011 kahru and elmgren 2014 that negatively influence bathing water quality with some toxins also having severe effects on drinking water resources cheung et al 2013 li et al 2017 paerl et al 2011 the importance of certain cyanobacteria has been recognized by the world health organization guidelines for drinking water quality who 2011 which provides provisional guideline values for microcystin lr the most frequently occurring and toxic of microcystin congeners while in drinking water individual toxins are monitored risk assessments and management in recreational waters regulate just the presence of cyanobacteria quantified as cell numbers or biomass ibelings et al 2014 again the preferred approach suggested by the guidelines is a visual inspection including microscopy for potentially microcystin containing genera the drinking water directive of the eu does not address cyanobacterial toxins and health authorities have turned to the provisional who guideline values to assess whether the concentrations are hazardous li et al 2017 3 detection of pathogenic and toxic microbial contamination by cultivation independent methods 3 1 pathogen tracking important ecosystem services of natural water bodies includes the supply of clean drinking water often accumulated in dam reservoirs from wide catchment areas as well as recreational bathing waters the use of these water resources is regularly affected by microbiological contamination which is caused by potentially harmful microorganisms from intestinal flora various sources can contribute to fecal pollution including wildlife deer boar rodents birds farms and domestic animals poultry cattle sheep cats dogs and humans devane et al 2018 however the currently used methods do not appropriately assess the genetic variability of fecal microbes and resulting changes in their pathogenicity and in the activity of respective functional genes the most relevant present day pathogen tracking in freshwater ecosystems utilizes microbial source tracking mst a technique that uses quantitative pcr methods to detect and quantify gene markers associated with fecal microorganisms e g brooks et al 2020 mckee et al 2020 culture independent approaches have been introduced to provide a sensitive and specific detection of fecal contamination indicators such as e coli salmonella shigella and enterococcus spp as well as campylobacter spp bacteroides spp and viruses or eukaryotes such as giardia lamblia brooks et al 2020 verweij et al 2004 surveyed marker genes traditionally include taxonomic identification using 16s and 23s rrna genes for prokaryotes and 18s rrna genes for eukaryotes they have also been recently expanded to include functional genes that encode the activities traditionally used for identification by selective media such as lacz β galactosidase lamb maltose outer membrane porin and uida β d glucuronidase specific for e coli furthermore methods for the elimination of extracellular dna have been developed e g propidium monoazide to avoid the false positive detection of dead cells which is critical for the monitoring of water bacteriological quality gensberger et al 2014 truchado et al 2016 likewise due to the importance of water as a medium for disseminating human waterborne diseases environmental dna edna protocols have also been established and successfully applied for the detection of other pathogenic microbes causing severe parasite induced human diseases such as leptospira sato et al 2019 however none of these monitoring approaches for fecal contamination has yet provided information about geographic origin and fecal contamination sources as these indicators are universally and indiscriminately found in warm blooded animals recent research on the co evolution between hosts and their gut microbiota i e the host specific microbiome can provide a solution ley et al 2008 more specifically for some taxa such as clostridiales and bacteroidales host specific bacterial classifiers have been developed and used to differentiate the distributions of microbes among human cow deer pig cat and dog sources brooks et al 2020 mckee et al 2020 roguet et al 2018 3 2 cyanobacteria toxin tracking molecular studies of cyanobacteria have mainly focused on evaluating the spatial and temporal variability of cyanobacterial communities similarly to studies of other prokaryotes amplicon sequencing is used either for the identification of particular taxa or operational taxonomic units otus representing the sequence variability of marker gene s e g guedes et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 amplicon sequencing has the potential to monitor toxigenic genotypes of cyanobacteria kurmayer et al 2017 scherer et al 2017 although no single approach has been recommended in cyanobacterial bloom monitoring and cyanotoxin detection due to the variability in their resolution and comparability of results gaget et al 2017 srivastava et al 2012 in addition studies have included the detection of potentially toxic cyanobacteria using quantitative pcr based qpcr approaches e g al tebrineh et al 2010 chiu et al 2017 this method can be used for the quantification and distinction of toxin producing and non producing types of cyanobacteria e g microcystis zuo et al 2018 or the quantification of toxin biosynthesis genes that can be connected with toxin concentrations for assessing toxicity panksep et al 2020 scherer et al 2017 these methods together with traditional approaches microscopy cyanotoxin analysis have been employed for studying the effects of trophic status based on cyanobacterial community composition panksep et al 2020 wood et al 2017 and diversity eiler et al 2013 lee et al 2017 wood et al 2017 yoon et al 2016 table 1 4 microbial bioindicators of anthropogenic impacts 4 1 microbial eukaryotes protists for biomonitoring in the european water framework directive wfd phytoplankton and phytobenthos communities are acknowledged and integrated as biological quality elements bqe for the environmental monitoring of freshwater ecosystems ec 2000 even though many of these bioindicators have been applied in the context of scientific academic research predominantly diatoms phylum bacillariophyta have succeeded in making the transition as bqes from the academic world into the real world of applied freshwater mostly river biomonitoring for these bqes standard protocols have been established european committee for standardization 2016 similarly to the other already established microbial bioindicators the challenges of microscopic diatom surveys mostly include long analysis times and high demand on expert knowledge for taxon identification inevitably differences between individual approaches resulted in variation of taxa inventories among laboratories kahlert et al 2012 kelly et al 2018 this initiated the development of less expensive more efficient and robust edna metabarcoding protocols for diatoms especially in lotic ecosystems bailet et al 2020 kermarrec et al 2014 pérez burillo et al 2020 tapolczai et al 2019 vasselon et al 2019 visco et al 2015 zimmermann et al 2015 in contrast to the diatom edna metabarcoding protocols for river monitoring barely any of these protocols exist for other taxonomic groups of microbial eukaryotes pawlowski et al 2018 2016b 2016a this is surprising because numerous studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of various protistan taxonomic groups to environmental stressors in natural as well as artificial freshwater ecosystems foissner 2016 stoeck et al 2018b for example similar to diatoms green algae and chrysophytes are also excellent bioindicators of nutrient fortification this is due to their frequent species specific nutrient requirements for growth and reproduction gökçe 2016 as well as other environmental parameters such as conductivity çelekli and külköylüoǧlu 2007 oxygen and ph çelekli et al 2014 similarly dinoflagellates are also suitable indicators of nutrient conditions in freshwater systems moore et al 2013 furthermore non photosynthetic protists which are highly responsive to environmental disturbances are omitted in the wfd keck et al 2017 of these amoebas are highly sensitive to various forms of environmental change including sulfur nitrogen carbon dioxide heavy metals and particulate pollutants payne 2013 ciliates phylum ciliophora are sensitive to local environmental conditions including low oxygen concentrations organic enrichment phytoplankton composition acidification heavy metal pollution and various other chemical stressors see references in lynn 2008 accordingly ciliate morphospecies despite not being acknowledged as a bqe in the eu wfd are frequently used as suitable biological indicators for the applied environmental compliance monitoring of rivers in austria berger et al 1997 berger and foissner 2003 they are also used as indicators of activated sludge performance in many european countries foissner and berger 1996 madoni 2011 traditional methods for protist detection include staining and microscopy the diagnosis of protists for the purpose of environmental monitoring using high throughput sequencing technologies is still a relatively young research field pawlowski et al 2016b however the few available studies which have all focused on entire protistan communities rather than individual taxa have demonstrated the strengths of this approach for modern biomonitoring uyaguari diaz et al 2016 xie et al 2017 while for some taxonomic groups such as diatoms non ribosomal genes are preferred as genetic markers e g vasselon et al 2019 the taxonomic diversity of the whole community is best captured with ribosomal genes in the past the v4 and the v9 hypervariable region of the 18s rrna gene have proved suitable for the edna profiling of protistan communities debroas et al 2017 pawlowski et al 2012 stoeck et al 2010 a multiple primer approach has been recommended to capture the full protistan diversity bradley et al 2016 stoeck et al 2006 however this approach also increases the costs of monitoring as well as the complexity and time in sample and data analyses therefore the most suitable choice of pcr primers may have to be evaluated for each individual ecosystem e g lake pond river or creek and the specific monitoring target e g nutrient pollution organic enrichment heavy metal pollution two well known shortcomings in using edna metabarcoding of protistan communities for biomonitoring are taxonomic assignments of sequences and inferring relative abundances of individual indicator taxa from the sequence data due to incomplete reference databases large proportions of sequences remain taxonomically unassigned e g up to 70 of sequences mortágua et al 2019 however ecological quality inference from the remaining taxonomically assigned sequences results in highly similar biological quality status as that obtained from morphospecies data this has recently been demonstrated in river monitoring studies using diatoms mortágua et al 2019 rivera et al 2020 nevertheless a taxonomy free approach that allows descriptions of diatom community structure and diversity without assigning sequences to taxa seems preferable for the evaluation of the environmental health and quality status of water bodies apothéloz perret gentil et al 2017 cordier et al 2019 feio et al 2020 some studies have shown an acceptable agreement between morphospecies abundance or biomass and relative sequence abundance based on sequencing for at least some taxonomic groups pitsch et al 2019 weber and pawlowski 2013 yet variations in gene copy numbers and genome size among protists zhu et al 2005 can introduce artifacts that bias relative abundance estimates in protistan communities leray and knowlton 2016 piwosz et al 2020 a suggested solution to this problem is to focus on individual protistan taxon groups rather than on a whole community so as to reduce the impact of copy number variation stoeck et al 2018a furthermore it is much easier to avoid quantification bias for individual taxonomic groups through the application of a cell biovolume correction factor as has been successfully shown for diatoms vasselon et al 2018 accordingly relative sequence abundances can represent an efficient and reliable measure when inferring the ecological status of ecosystems based on individual protistan taxon groups such as ciliates forster et al 2019 stoeck et al 2018a or foraminiferans pawlowski et al 2016a 2014 moreover recent progress in sequencing allows for the cultivation independent specific targeting of other planktonic protists by newly designed fluorescence in situ hybridization fish probes e g massana et al 2009 šimek et al 2020 however while fish is a promising tool it is also laborious and thus only suitable for providing specific information this includes visualization of important but morphologically almost indistinguishable protistan taxa in situ as well as the inspection of food vacuoles to determine their feeding modes and major trophic interactions in conclusion a whole protistan community survey can encompass the taxonomic and potentially functional diversity thus providing a more complete picture of the ecosystem status a substantial amount of research remains to be done however before the broad application of either of these approaches in environmental monitoring can be initiated mortágua et al 2019 supplementary table s2 table 2 4 2 prokaryote taxa and functional genes for biomonitoring prokaryotes respond to environmental conditions by changes in their proportional abundances within the community and diversity as well as through expressing various functions these responses are characteristic of individual stressors due to the different physiology of various bacterial and archaeal lineages in various freshwater ecosystems e g garcia et al 2018 jacquiod et al 2018 newton et al 2011 4 2 1 nitrogen input high amounts of nitrogen added to the environment by synthetic and organic fertilizers as well as through the burning of fossil fuels heavily contribute to anthropogenic eutrophication in many studies concentrations of various nitrogen forms ammonium nitrite and nitrates and total nitrogen nh4 n nox n and tn accounted for considerable shifts in bacterial community structures in the sediments of both rivers and lakes fig 2 supplementary table s3 this indicates that nitrogen is particularly important in shaping the diversity patterns of bacterial communities in aquatic environments wan et al 2017 in the available literature mostly nitrospirae betaproteobacteriales chloroflexi and sphingobacteriales proportionally increased with nitrogen concentrations fig 2 supplementary table s3a nitrospirae are important nitrite oxidizers in freshwater lake sediments consequently these bacteria flourish in high nitrogen conditions wan et al 2017 and notably a higher concentrations of nh4 promote the growth of nitrospirales wan et al 2017 betaproteobacteriales former class betaprotobacteria are functionally diverse but this order encompasses the majority of ammonia oxidizing bacteria yang et al 2016a it seems that the chemolithoautotrophic members of this group may particularly benefit from increased concentrations of reduced inorganic nitrogen compounds including ammonium furthermore betaproteobacteriales play a role in nitrogen fixation occurring in sediments wu et al 2009 chloroflexi are nitrogen fixing bacteria dos santos et al 2012 and nitrate has been negatively correlated with chloroflexi communities zhang et al 2015 finally sphingobacteriales which also increase with elevated nitrogen are typically obligatory and facultative aerobic chemoorganotrophs their increased occurrence in the community is likely related to the conditions of waste water treatment plant effluents described below drury et al 2013 fig 2 supplementary table s3a b a large number of archaea are also active in processing nitrogen in surface waters and sediments wang et al 2018 interestingly while sediment nitrate contents can negatively affect bacterial diversity one study found that archaeal community diversity was not sensitive to any of the environmental factors measured zhang et al 2015 4 2 2 anthropogenic organic pollution the effects of waste water treatment plant wwtp effluents on microbial activity and diversity have frequently been studied especially in lotic environments all studies have found bacterial communities to be strongly influenced by wwtps or similar pollution sources chonova et al 2018 drury et al 2013 ibekwe et al 2016 commonly increases in the proportions of nitrospirae sphingobacteriales bacteroidetes and spirochaetes and a general decrease of actinobacteria see below have been observed in the communities downstream of wwtps fig 2 supplementary table s3b nitrospirae and some bacteroidetes are the dominant taxa of activated sludge huang et al 2017 wan et al 2017 therefore their increased proportion in microbial communities directly indicates the influence of wwtp effluents in contrast sphingobacteriales bacteroidetes seem to proliferate after the wwtp inflow possibly in response to increased resources for the river community which stimulates the growth of bacteria and higher organisms hladilek et al 2016 korajkic et al 2015 spirochaetes another commonly observed taxon increased in wwtp effluents are known as abundant endosymbionts often associated with invertebrate gut contents where they break down lignocellulose and fix nitrogen van de water et al 2016 actinobacteria might generally represent a good bioindicator because the proportion of their particular clades in microbial communities across all habitats are highly responsive to changing environmental factors meziti et al 2016 neuenschwander et al 2018 newton et al 2011 youssef and elshahed 2009 in particular pelagic actinobacteria seem to be sensitive to eutrophication e g liu et al 2019 although they are also capable of degrading complex organic compounds and pollutants in the sediment alvarez et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 fig 2 supplementary table s3b c 4 2 3 metals pharmaceuticals and personal care products river and lake sediments act as a sink for persistent anthropogenic contaminants such as heavy metals antibiotics other pharmaceuticals pesticides disinfectants and their residues these compounds are released slowly and pose potential threats to aquatic life and human health for an extended period of time kerrigan et al 2018 liao et al 2019 metals the toxicity of some metals is a result of their pro oxidative activity gauthier et al 2014 giner lamia et al 2014 the modification of conformation structures of nucleic acids and proteins and their interference with oxidative phosphorylation and osmotic balance nies 1999 although metals clearly interfere with microbial life no trend has been found for the effects of metal pollution on bacterial communities in the studies reviewed here fig 2 supplementary table s3d metal contamination of sediments results in the increased abundance of genes involved in metal homeostasis including genes for metal import mobilization storage and efflux efflux pumps along with other resistance mechanisms can be quite general since they transport many harmful substances from the cell chandrangsu et al 2017 roosa et al 2014 yin et al 2015 thus heavy metals can co select for resistance to antibiotics as documented in a study which retrospectively researched over a century s worth of anthropogenic pollution dickinson et al 2019 since metal resistance is often plasmid bound their presence does not correspond to a specific bacterial taxon due to the inherent ephemeral nature of these genetic elements and they should be assessed in a taxonomy independent way however this approach may be complicated by the common association of heavy metal and antibiotic resistance genes in the same plasmids rahube et al 2014 heavy metals also induce horizontal gene transfer and dna uptake by bacteria which is evidenced by increased integron activity and diversity nemergut et al 2004 offering another bioindication approach see below pharmaceuticals and personal care products pcps present particularly in wwtp effluents accumulate in sediments barra caracciolo et al 2015 resulting in response of local microbial communities supplementary table s3e the response of taxa seems to be dependent on both the chemical structure of the degraded compound as well as their relationship to oxygen concentration wolff et al 2018 antibiotic resistance genes args are either selected from the community aminov and mackie 2007 or transferred to the environment with bacteria in waste water amos et al 2014 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 for the major classes of antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine a variety of resistance determinants exist which makes their targeted assessment or quantitation difficult aminov et al 2002 gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga bacteroidetes increased in several systems in response to the presence of these chemicals while betaproteobacteriales decreased grenni et al 2014 kim et al 2017 the degradation of pharmaceuticals also usually increases nitrification which likely reflects the utilization of nitrogen from these compounds by various taxa men et al 2017 nsenga kumwimba and meng 2019 xu et al 2016 the most common group of enzymes degrading pharmaceuticals and pcps are monooxygenases these enzymes are relatively rare and not widespread among different bacterial species which makes them useful bioindicators achermann et al 2020 4 2 4 functional groups and marker genes monitoring the dynamics of functional groups is a preferred approach for study aquatic ecosystems because their assessment targets precisely the provided ecosystem services this approach is not generally used for eukaryotic microbes because they are not as metabolically diversified and also often difficult to cultivate so the metabolism of many taxa has not been examined likewise archaea are often only studied in specific situations so their use in functional diversity assessments needs to be researched further compte port et al 2020 zou et al 2019 traditionally bacteria are assigned to physiological groups according to substrate utilization products of metabolism growth condition preferences and biotic interactions however functions are unevenly distributed within prokaryotic taxa and thus need to be assessed by tools focusing directly on metabolic pathways e g falk et al 2019 yin et al 2015 moreover most taxonomic groups are not cultivable so molecular methods are the only cultivation independent option for their accurate quantification a variety of functional genes have already been extensively studied their activities are well characterized and primers for their direct quantification by qpcr have been validated by studies in different habitats table 3 in the future the selection of marker genes can be based on shotgun metagenomic analyses of contrasting sites to complement the knowledge on metabolic pathways assessed from isolated microbes their physiological studies and whole genome sequences 4 2 5 carbon cycling carbon dioxide and methane are currently responsible for approximately 80 of the radiative forcing from long lived greenhouse gasses these two gasses represent key metabolic pathways in carbon recycling because they represent a transfer link between inorganic and organic carbon forms levine et al 2011 in freshwater ecosystems heterotrophic bacteria despite their tiny size regulate the freshwater carbon cycle by processing globally significant amounts of carbon therefore it is essential to understand the factors that control microbial activity i e the underlying context for why freshwater ecosystems serve as hot spots for carbon cycling schmidt et al 2020 carbon sequestration the most important global carbon sink is photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation co2 however the chemolithotrophic fixation of co2 is also important and distributed through different phyla of bacteria and archaea berg 2011 since the known pathways of co2 fixation are respective to either phototrophic microorganisms or chemolithotrophic bacteria and archaea monitoring of genes specific to these pathways may reveal the different proportions of assimilated co2 between oxygenated and oxygen deficient environments alfreider et al 2017 table 3 methanogeny and methanotrophy methanogenesis contributes to the removal of organic matters and is the central process in the carbon cycle within anoxic layers of water and sediments lüders 2001 staley et al 2014 yang et al 2020 the methyl coenzyme m reductase α subunit encoding gene mcra has been used as a marker to assess the abundance and diversity of methanogen populations and the gene encoding monooxygenase subunit a pmoa as a marker of methanotrophic communities yang et al 2019b 2020 changes in the abundance of methanogens may indicate a limited oxygen availability in the sediments horton et al 2019 wang et al 2018 table 3 targeting methano and methylotrophy is essential for determining the potential of methane release knief 2015 4 2 6 nitrogen cycling pathways the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and carbon appear to be most heavily impacted by human activities gruber and galloway 2008 the high availability of various nitrogen forms in both sediment and water bodies is often reflected by an increased proportion and expression of genes encoding specific processes involved in nitrogen cycling for example nitrification anammox denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium have been detected by metagenomic metatranscriptomic and targeted quantitative studies fan et al 2019 pang et al 2019 yang et al 2016a yao et al 2018 yin et al 2019 table 3 the balance between n sinks e g denitrification riverine outputs and sediment burial and sources e g n2 fixation sediment release riverine inputs and atmospheric deposition determines the n budget in an ecosystem yao et al 2018 nitrogen fixation cyanobacteria include many n2 fixing taxa but heterotrophic chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic bacteria and archaea can also carry out n2 fixation thus the potential for sediment n2 fixation is widespread severin et al 2012 yao et al 2018 nitrogen fixation activities have been correlated with sediment water content density tn content and tp content as well as with the quantity and quality of organic matter in sediments newell et al 2016 in one study nitrogen fixation was significantly negatively correlated with nitrate levels dissolved inorganic n levels and denitrification rates caton et al 2018 while another study correlated n fixing nifh genes with nh4 fan et al 2019 interestingly it seems that decreased nitrogen fixation in sediments can predict cyanobacterial blooms yao et al 2018 nitrification and denitrification long term high n loading affects the central processes of the n cycle by increasing rates of nitrification and denitrification and decreasing the efficiency of n use by community members the relative abundances of denitrification genes nitrification genes and all p related genes have showed a significantly positive correlation with the levels of nutrients such as tn tp toc and nh4 fan et al 2019 the ammonia oxidizing genes of archaea and bacteria are involved in the nitrification process and bacterial ammonia oxidizers seem to be less sensitive to eutrophication than archaeal ones yang et al 2016a furthermore nitrate reduction and methanogenesis appear to be primary processes in the contaminant transformations of persistent organic pollutants falk et al 2019 4 2 7 phosphorus and sulfur cycling pathways phosphorus is a limiting factor for organisms in terrestrial oceanic and freshwater environments particularly during the growing season because biologically available inorganic phosphate tends to get depleted janssen et al 2019 under such circumstances microorganisms utilizing p containing organic compounds have an advantage the major enzymes required for this activity are alkaline phosphatases apases of phoa phox and phod families these differentiate the functional groups into phototrophic cyanobacteria and heterotrophic proteobacteria and firmicutes the other phyla possessing these enzyme activities kageyama et al 2011 table 3 different abundance distribution patterns of various phosphatases have been observed in summer and winter while phosphorus solubilization was shown to be one of the most important processes in summer fan et al 2019 sulfate reducers are key organisms in the decomposition of organic matter in anoxic environments because they have the highest affinity for acetate the final product of fermentation and recycle it to co2 while also releasing hydrogen sulfide lovley et al 1982 genes from sulfate reduction pathways in particular the apsa apra gene coding for adenosine phosphosulfate reductase and dsrab sulfite reductase have been proposed as bioindicators watanabe et al 2016 the increased occurrence of genes from sulfate reducing pathways is typically connected to metal pollution yin et al 2015 however the genes are also indicative of other pollutants such as microplastics pinnell and turner 2019 table 3 4 2 8 mobile genetic elements of the mobile elements participating in horizontal gene transfer integrons have received attention for reacting to different types of anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 they were first characterized as elements disseminating antibiotic resistance however molecular studies have revealed that integrons occur in all environments are able to move between species and lineages and appear to play a general role in bacterial adaptation and genome evolution gillings 2014 furthermore these genes reside in diverse bacterial species often on mobile genetic elements and are often linked to antibiotic resistance disinfectants and heavy metals quantification of a relatively conserved variant of class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 spreading in clinical environments was successfully used in the monitoring of anthropogenic pollution also gene abundance can rapidly change in response to a broad range of environmental pressures including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons wang et al 2017 and pesticides dealtry et al 2014 both integrases intl1 and intl2 also increased in biofilms colonizing microplastic particles wang et al 2020 5 microbial indices microbial indices based on eukaryotes are mainly focused on diatoms in streams and rivers rimet 2012 stevenson et al 2010 the standardized indices are based on traditional morphological identifications kelly et al 2009 recently edna based approaches have been developed a curated reference database has been established e g rimet et al 2019 and up scaling for monitoring networks has been processed e g vasselon et al 2019 standardization is now in progress at the european committee for standardization cen 2018a 2018b however these approaches are mostly based on existing morpho taxonomic indices changing only the methodology used to obtain species lists di moltaxfree apothéloz perret gentil et al 2017 based on amplicon sequencing of 18s rrna is the only currently proposed taxonomy free diatom index table 2 several types of prokaryotic indices have been proposed to date based on abundances or proportions of selected taxa responsive to certain environmental conditions or on taxa providing a specific function in the water column or sediment table 4 the indices have already been used for the identification of characteristics such as nutrient levels urbanization intensity land use etc and have successfully been correlated with those based on eukaryotic taxonomic groups such as macrophytes macroinvertebrates or fishes however as different taxonomic indicators may highlight distinct stressors on aquatic systems indicators based on different biological groups can conflict in their assessment of ecosystem health status horton et al 2019 in freshwater environments yang et al 2016a observed a difference in the proportion of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob in lakes differing in their trophic status with aob being more abundant in a hypertrophic lake niu et al 2018 proposed a complex microbial community based index of biotic integrity mcibi for assessment of the ecological status of rivers based on prokaryotic communities in the sediment the index includes five core metrics table 4 among the included metrics the highest discriminative power is provided by log aob aoa log of the ratio of ammonium oxidizing bacteria to ammonium oxidizing archaea and bfg a the ratio of bacteroidetes firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria to alphaproteobacteria followed by fca percentage of firmicutes chloroflexi and acidobacteria ji et al 2019 proposed a bacterial eutrophic index bei to quantitatively describe water quality which was defined as the ratio of the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and actinobacteria otus in the water column at the studied sites the bei index ranged between 0 55 and 2 65 for lakes of the lowest and the highest trophic levels respectively novel indices can be proposed using a combination of the above mentioned taxa with high bioindication values and functional genes in such indices general variables such as microbial diversity or the relative proportion of primary producers or their quantity defined by chlorophyll a concentration might be combined with more specific indicators reflecting individual functional groups together these may then more precisely assess the quality of an environment niu et al 2018 yang et al 2019a 6 microbial communities 6 1 responses to multiple stressors environmental stressors and disturbances include impacts from diffuse sources for example the runoff of inorganic nutrients from agriculture and other land use natural organic compounds arising from animal husbandry or urbanized areas or more specific compounds coming from storm water runoff wwtp effluents ground water or even underground constructions such as pipes or trenches hatt et al 2004 ibekwe et al 2016 lemaire et al 2020 wiest et al 2018 these stressors co occur in ecosystems and often interact to produce effects that can be less than the sum of their individual effects antagonistic overall decreased stress or greater than the sum of their individual effects synergistic overall increased stress birk et al 2020 folt et al 1999 piggott et al 2015b non additive effects are frequent often being the rule rather than the exception in aquatic systems orr et al 2020 however current legislation on biomonitoring and the management of aquatic ecosystems is often based on the assumption that the effects of multiple stressors are additive villar argaiz et al 2018 jackson et al 2016 crain et al 2008 which may result in an underestimation of impacts multiple stressors may depend on an organism s mode of nutrition i e autotrophs may tend to respond antagonistically while heterotrophs tend to respond more synergistically nuy et al 2018 antagonistic effects of stressors seem more common in primary producers and freshwaters while a synergy of stressors is more common in marine environments synergistic responses still occur in freshwater systems but need further investigations to ensure sufficient management crain et al 2008 jackson et al 2016 antagonisms seem to be the more common stressor induced interaction at the community level likely due to the co tolerance of taxa nuy et al 2018 salis et al 2017 as a tolerance to one stressor can improve the tolerance to a second stressor that acts through similar mechanisms vinebrooke et al 2004 many microbes are substrate flexible and metabolize both inorganic and organic compounds of anthropogenic origin e g pollutants mitigating some of the anthropogenic impact kiersztyn et al 2019 however the degradation byproducts of pollutants can sometimes be more toxic than the original compound varjani et al 2017 so specialized microbes with appropriate metabolic capabilities may be needed for their further biodegradation chakraborty and das 2016 the synergy or antagonism of multiple stressors must be considered when searching for bioindicators because some stressors may produce common effects the response of organisms to multiple stressors seems to be dependent on the environmental conditions of aquatic systems richardson et al 2018 in line with this effects of stressors on biofilm formation were found to depend on sediment and nutrient conditions piggott et al 2015a similarly ecosystem processes were observed to be more vulnerable to stress in naturally harsh environments usually inhabited by specialized microbes tolkkinen et al 2015 since microbes are abundant and functionally diversified even a small change in the composition of primary producers leads to significant changes in the quality of their metabolites and exudates and thus may cause large changes in specialized microbes in such situations specialized groups may be used for disentangling the combined effects of various stressors e g horňák et al 2017 6 2 biotic interactions microbial community patterns are strongly influenced by complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors as well as typical doubling times of microbes of hours to days pernthaler 2017 šimek et al 2014 environmental and geographic factors explain only a part of the biological variation bock et al 2020 for example interactions include the bacterial incorporation of organic carbon exudated by phytoplankton horňák et al 2017 sarmento et al 2016 šimek et al 2011 woodhouse et al 2018 or grazing by heterotrophic protists grossart et al 2008 grujčić et al 2018 pernthaler 2005 salcher et al 2016 šimek et al 2013 notably even small changes in characteristics of the bacterial prey community have been found to rapidly cascade up to the food chain via a considerable alteration in the trophic level of protistan predator communities grujčić et al 2018 šimek et al 2020 2013 moreover heterotrophic bacteria can produce growth promoting compounds such as vitamins and can improve nutrient supplies for phytoplankton cole 1982 croft et al 2005 the presence and abundance of distinct species thus affects the occurrence of other species due to biotic interactions including trophic relationships symbiosis parasitism allelopathy or chemical communication some species with similar preferences may co occur in the same habitats or exclude each other by competition in micro niches and some replace each other by chance grossmann et al 2016 louca et al 2018 which complicates the interpretation of co occurrence patterns due to the significance of random processes in community assemblies multi species and community approaches are likely to be more reproducible and more reliable for biomonitoring than single species approaches assigning otus to trophic guilds or functional traits is a straightforward basis for tracking down groups of otus that have a similar bioindication value however such assignments are currently limited to very general traits ramond et al 2019 while only a very minor fraction of amplicon diversity can be linked to more specific traits given the vast gaps in linking microbial sequences to species and species to ecology co occurrence networks and related tools are indicative of interactions without an a priori knowledge about the species identity and ecology behind distinct otus bock et al 2020 steele et al 2011 furthermore parameters elucidated by network analyses such as the connectedness and the presence or absence of certain interactive links might be strong indicators for habitat characteristics schloter et al 2018 7 recommendations for biomonitoring molecular methods based on the extraction of nucleic acids or proteins from environmental samples enable a complex view of microbial communities as a result their composition structure and diversity have been connected to environmental traits and stressors newton and mclellan 2015 tanentzap et al 2019 with these measures able to be used as broad scale bioindicators however even in this broad scheme sediment or water column habitats should be sampled separately because their microbial communities differ substantially ibekwe et al 2016 zeglin 2015 in addition the responses to stressors differ according to long term and short term events long term continuous impacts typically lead to a changes in community compositions e g gillan et al 2015 the effects of combined stressors on microbial community are also clearly influenced by functional redundancy and various resistance mechanisms which differ considerably between taxonomic and functional groups delgado baquerizo et al 2017 deng et al 2020 jacquiod et al 2018 thus functions commonly provided by many taxa are less affected by the community composition in comparison shared resistance within related taxonomic groups may ensure group survival which can result in differences in the resistance and resilience of various taxa also leading to community alteration cabrerizo et al 2019 finally different growth rates reflecting optimal conditions for non affected taxa may further modify the resulting community composition pernthaler 2017 for more precise bioindication the methodological approach should be selected depending on the goal i e the type of assessed pollution achermann et al 2020 therefore the expected driver s of environmental changes such as water level fluctuations eutrophication from agriculture wwtp effluents diffuse pollution metals etc should be identified a priori for adequate water quality evaluation apart from the already mentioned monitoring strategy focusing on measures of community composition structure and diversity see introduction strategy b the tracking and quantification of individual microbial taxa strategy a or the targeting of specific functional groups or genes strategy c may also be used depending on the particular situation strategy a possibly represents the easiest modification to current routine protocols because monitoring of those organisms is already part of legislation the other strategies can be applied to various sources of pollution bioindication as follows eutrophication and diffuse pollution seem to be most appropriately monitored using the bacterial community structure in the water column in both lakes and rivers eutrophication leads to an increase in bacteria otu richness henson et al 2018 ibekwe et al 2016 kiersztyn et al 2019 which implies that community richness is a general bioindicator of eutrophication the taxonomic composition of bacteria is strongly influenced by the presence of planktonic cyanobacteria which proportionally increase with eutrophication for european lakes see kiersztyn et al 2019 while pelagic actinobacteria prefer oligotrophic habitats and decrease with eutrophication zeglin 2015 this suggests the ratio between cyanobacteria and actinobacteria otus in open water is another community bioindicator which has been already tested in the monitoring of some chinese lakes ji et al 2019 yet only the short term impacts of eutrophication can be appropriately determined using bacterial communities that is due to the fact that longer exposure to eutrophication leads to the adaption of bacteria to increased nutrient levels which stabilizes the bacterial community and the influence of eutrophication is diminished jacquiod et al 2018 kiersztyn et al 2019 despite this the long term effect of continuous eutrophication can result in loss of beta diversity monchamp et al 2018 in addition to eutrophication augmented levels of nitrogen can be indicated using the bacterial community structure in both lakes and rivers in particular betaproteobacteriales increase proportionally with n concentrations horton et al 2019 wan et al 2017 in both rivers and lakes nitrospirae seem to systematically positively correlate to increased nitrogen not only with respect to dispersed pollution but also in response to wwtp or point source effluents which makes them a good indicator of hidden inputs of waste water e g chu et al 2018 drury et al 2013 huang et al 2019 organic pollution and compounds associated with organic matter such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics seem to be best monitored in sediments where both natural organic compounds and anthropogenic organic pollutants accumulate making sediments an accumulation hotspot jacquiod et al 2018 in sediment prokaryotic communities the proportion of actinobacteria may be the simplest indicator of organic pollution since actinobacteria are adapted to high concentrations of organic matter zeglin 2015 and consistently increase with organic contamination deposited in sediments beale et al 2017 ibekwe et al 2016 furthermore a decrease in richness and other diversity measures can be a measure of organic pollution because the reduced taxonomic and potentially also functional diversity is a result of biotic homogenization arising from major pollutant discharges or through the introduction of non indigenous bacteria drury et al 2013 a more specific approach in the determination of organic pollution could use the class 1 integron integrase inti1 gene as a marker of horizontal gene transfer the frequency of which increases in organically polluted waters gillings et al 2015 microbial functional groups offer an elegant de novo approach to biomonitoring through the quantification of individual nutrient cycling pathways the most important are the carbon and nitrogen flows and sinks methane production is a key pathway in the carbon cycle and methane metabolism is correlated to organic pollution through oxygen availability quantification of mcra and pmoa genes which respectively mark methanogeny and methanotrophy have already been applied in the ba ibi index yang et al 2019a our suggestion is to add measures proxies of primary production either by the respective genes or simply by quantifying chlorophyll a to assess the proportion of co2 fixation to the methane cycle as a measure of carbon flow since euryarchaeota are the only methanogens their proportion in the prokaryotic community may be used instead of gene quantification for the community structure based approach for nitrogen the key pathways include n2 fixation and denitrification and thus the proportional quantity of the respective genes may represent a novel bioindicator of nitrogen flow metal pollution can be determined using either community structure particularly by the increased proportion of betaproteobacteriales together with an altered proportion of other taxa see fig 2 or bacteria typical for sulfur metabolism from the class deltaproteobacteria desulfomicrobiaceae desulfobacteraceae hatam et al 2019 liao et al 2019 metal pollution can also be detected by genes coding for metal homeostasis the gene apsa coding for adenylyl sulfate reductase or other genes involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway li et al 2018 see fig 2 pharmaceuticals cosmetics and other anthropogenic organic molecules appear to be most challenging for bioindication because their individual characteristics cause specific changes in microbial communities which may be difficult to observe in complex samples ecological studies have revealed chronic long term negative impacts on aquatic habitats rather than immediate toxicity barra caracciolo et al 2015 interactions among enzymes and such pollutants have identified several groups of potentially indicative taxa and genes however our current knowledge remains limited achermann et al 2020 for routine applications therefore specific bioindication may only be possible through functional community metrics of metagenomics metatranscriptomics fig 1b 8 future possibilities for biomonitoring studies metagenomics metatranscriptomics can predict community functions even if the function is rare achermann et al 2020 these approaches are thus promising but relatively few reference datasets are currently available and they often lack a sufficient number of replicates achermann et al 2020 cordier et al 2020 consequently we propose that the construction of large scale spatial and temporal metagenomic metatranscriptomic reference data sets covering habitats relevant to water quality bioindication should proceed including references to methodologies and data storage using this approach co variations of functional genes species and environmental variables can be identified thus facilitating the selection of appropriate bioindicators the focus might be placed on 1 genes indicating trophic status that participate in major nutrient pathways particularly those that enable transitions between inorganic and organic forms e g methanogens and methanotrophs or nitrogen fixators and denitrifies or 2 genes indicating toxic pollution i e those participating in horizontal gene transfer particularly of various resistances furthermore shallow metagenomic techniques are becoming financially more efficient than multiple quantitative pcr though the results are more complex however manipulative laboratory studies targeting the effects of individual and multiple stressors on various parameters of aquatic environments should also be conducted to gain additional insights into the functioning of aquatic microbial communities using metagenomics metatranscriptomics finally the identification of keystone taxa and rare community members should be included in environmental evaluations to assess aquatic ecosystem stability long term adaptation and the resolution of functional redundancy herren and mcmahon 2018 pernthaler 2017 poursat et al 2019 a further recommended approach to improve the application of environmental genomics based bioindication by microorganisms is to introduce novel bioinformatic tools firstly network analyses can identify taxa with similar habitat requirements and or interacting taxa banerjee et al 2016 bock et al 2020 and also establish sets of sequence variants indicative of certain habitat characteristics similar to the current use of indicator morphospecies in e g macrozoobenthos or diatoms similarly supervised machine learning is currently the best solution to classification problems involving multidimensional and noisy datasets libbrecht and noble 2015 and its use could significantly improve the reliability of microbial community patterns analyses cordier et al 2020 2019 the application of such techniques requires training datasets for which model metagenomic metatranscriptomic studies are most useful because of the unbiased quantification of both community structure and the presence activity of bioindicating metabolic pathways 9 outlook practical applications the still incomplete list of case studies presented in this review highlight the immense added value of microbial indicators for environmental monitoring and process understanding in freshwater ecosystems while for many important stressors the pressure response functions are well known a profound understanding of the indication value of microbial taxa in the context of novel and multiple stressors is still in need of further validation prior to inclusion in formal regulatory biomonitoring programs such method plausibility checks and data validation are needed in the context of larger transdisciplinary networks based on the derived results formal implementation can be initiated here case studies should target long term ecological monitoring sites e g haase et al 2018 mirtl et al 2018 routine monitoring sites of regulatory monitoring programs as well as operational monitoring sites from e g sewage plants or aquacultures e g pawlowski et al 2016a 2014 for such sites a wealth of information on other environmental parameters in particular stressors typically exist this creates a unique set of metadata to fuel synergies when it comes to developing novel diagnostic tools as part of so called weight of evidence approaches e g höss et al 2011 wolfram et al 2012 besides such coordinated approaches to derive indicators formal standardization is of critical importance scientific standards of microbial community analysis using high throughput amplicon sequencing have previously been proposed e g for soil samples within the earth microbiome project https earthmicrobiome org including dna isolation marotz et al 2017 minich et al 2018 amplification and sequencing caporaso et al 2012 2011 and for marine water column samples jeunen et al 2019 however when considering the application of novel indicators into future regulatory monitoring formal standardization e g via the international organization for standardization iso or in parallel the european committee for standardization cen cenelec is a pivotal step this starts with decisions on where and how to sample because great variability exists due to seasons and various unexpected point sources of contaminated water lemaire et al 2020 meziti et al 2019 wan et al 2017 yao et al 2018 here however traditional standards for sampling and propositions for novel edna based methods are in the process of development cen tc 230 wg 28 with respect to laboratory analysis it is known that the reproducibility of molecular techniques largely depends on the quality and representativeness of environmental dna including cell lysis and purification steps furthermore the quantification of marker genes by real time qpcr are especially sensitive to template edna quality including fragmentation and the presence of inhibitors which may be site and sample specific hargreaves et al 2013 many formal standards for traditional biomontioring programs exist and are intercalibrated the same holds true for medical forensic or classical ecotoxicological analyses for example iso 11063 describes standards for dna extraction for assessing microbial abundance and community structure in soils and iso 22119 on procedures for qpcr validation of food borne pathogens in addition to field and lab standards the standardization of bioinformatic pipelines will be also needed to achieve inter laboratory comparability of results as existing pipelines have been shown to provide different outputs bailet et al 2020 by co extracting variable types and amounts of inhibitory substances limitations may be diminished by using digital droplet pcr ddpcr dingle et al 2013 for details see methodological annex again a comparability of results among laboratories requires rigorous standards which may be inspired by the proposed minimum information for the publication of quantitative pcr experiments for real time pcr bustin et al 2011 and ddpcr huggett et al 2013 10 conclusions in conclusion our review demonstrates that the inclusion of microbial bioindicators can provide improved assessments of water quality including both general and specific stressor diagnostics although bioindicators of processes such as eutrophication have already been established by other approaches the use of microbes and prokaryotes in particular represents not only a monitoring tool but also a path toward the deeper understanding of processes underlying water quality parameters using microbes for the regular observation of major nutrient pathways and recycling allows the quantification of flows and sinks in the biosphere over long time periods finally studies on microbes have proposed various bioindicators that can be used to create biotic indices specifically targeting the most important stressors in various regions and habitats the indices developed so far have shown that a combination of taxon dependent markers with functional markers is possible which makes them more powerful than currently used traditional indices based only on the identification of taxa considering all currently available results we advise that decisions be made towards including microbes with their high growth and community dynamics in biomonitoring programs of freshwater environments declaration of

covid 19 low income countries sars cov 2 wash water sanitation and hygiene 1 introduction coronavirus disease of 2019 covid 19 which was first detected in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 has spread globally and declared a pandemic by who wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 who 2020 by november 2020 there were more than 51 million confirmed cases globally with over 37 million recoveries and more than a million deaths according to data compiled by john hopkins university coronavirus resource centre the virus responsible for covid 19 has been identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 gorbalenya et al 2020 li et al 2020 sars cov 2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus in the sub family orthocoronavirinae of the family coronaviridae together with other three genera which

measure like proper hand washing with clean water and soap could interrupt the transmission of several disease causing bacteria and viruses thus reducing the general burden of disease however the wash sector is typically least prioritized and underfunded in low income countries despite its importance for economic growth and even more critically for the control of infectious diseases sophie et al 2016 roche et al 2017 majority of the world s population lacking access to wash facilities are in low income countries especially in rural settlements and unplanned urban population clusters for instance in 2017 nine out of ten of the 785 million people who still used limited services unimproved sources or surface water lived in three regions sub saharan africa 400 million eastern and south eastern asia 161 million and central and south asia 145 million who unicef 2019 as the global spread of the pandemic became obvious in the first quarter of 2020 there was a sense of apprehension about what would happen when the pandemic gets to low income countries blake et al 2020 the combination of poor wash conditions and overstretched healthcare systems in those countries during a global public health emergency was a genuine reason for the apprehension in this article we reviewed literature on sars cov 2 transmission and control and discussed the challenges of focusing on wash as a critical control measure in low income countries with poor wash conditions in addition we discussed the critical importance of water sanitation and hygiene for preventing infectious diseases and presented some arguments for the global disparities in codid 19 related morbidity and mortality between low income and high income countries 2 sars cov 2 transmission morbidity and mortality the exact animal reservoir of sars cov 2 has not been ascertained fully but it is suspected to be from bats of the genus rhinolophus as it shares 96 sequence similarity with betacoronaviruses isolated from multiple species of bats from this genus han et al 2019 the sars cov 2 isolated from humans shared 92 sequence similarity with sars like viruses that were circulating in bats and 90 of the sars like viruses from bats have been isolated from the rhinolophus genus which is widely distributed across asia the middle east africa and europe csorba et al 2003 han et al 2019 the comparatively strong genetic sequence similarity between sars cov 2 and beta coronavirus isolated from bats batcov ratg13 suggests that ancestors of the former were circulating in bats in the rhinolophus genus han et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 other studies have confirmed possible animal to human and human to human transmissions but the intermediate host for the transmission of sars cov 2 is still not known with full certainty guo et al 2020 muhammad et al 2020 many respiratory infections have previously been linked to human interaction with wildlife and livestock but tracing a similar source of sars cov 2 remains a big challenge han et al 2019 li et al 2020 covid 19 is the third zoonotic coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades after sars severe acute respiratory syndrome was reported in singapore in 2003 and mers middle east respiratory syndrome in saudi arabia in 2012 yi et al 2019 xie and chen 2020 like other coronavirus outbreaks human to human transmission of sars cov 2 occurs primarily when respiratory droplets containing the virus reaches the mucosa of the eyes nose and mouth lai et al 2020 sars cov 2 can spread quickly in healthcare facilities public places and family settings when the recommended containment measures are not strictly followed who 2020 the virus spreads when people infected with the virus sneeze cough on or touch surfaces or objects such as tables doorknobs and handrails chan et al 2020 kampf et al 2020 jin et al 2020 shen et al 2020 who 2020 other people can be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching their eyes noses or mouths afterwards

respiratory tract infections urtis resembling the common cold to lower respiratory tract infections lrtis such as bronchitis pneumonia and even severe acute respiratory syndrome sars corman et al 2019 schoeman and fielding 2019 infected persons especially those with underlying health conditions are generally susceptible to sars cov 2 within an incubation period of 2 to 14 days singhal 2020 however some sars cov 2 infected persons do not show any symptoms and are likely to go unnoticed xu et al 2020 such individuals may trigger community spread of covid 19 and are of public health interest to contain the pandemic bai et al 2020 gao et al 2020 currently both morbidity and mortality rates from covid 19 remain relatively low in many low income countries compared to some high income countries fig 1 a significantly higher prevalence of sars cov 2 infection and covid 19 related deaths has been observed in many high income countries like the united states of america and other countries in europe and asia regardless of advanced medical facilities in these countries it is still not fully understood why morbidity and mortality remain relatively low fig 1 d in many low income countries although covid 19 risk has been diametrically associated with certain demographic characteristics such as household size age structure level of income and social economic status walker et al 2020 on 29 september 2020 the world passed the grim milestone of one million reported deaths on the same day the total mortality count for africa was 35 954 marsh and alobo 2020 africa accounts for 17 of the global population but only 3 5 of the reported global covid 19 deaths there has been much discussion on what could be responsible for the relatively lower morbidity and mortality rates in sub saharan africa factors such as limited travel inadequate covid 19 testing capacities and widespread challenges with data collection have been mentioned marsh and alobo 2020 but decisive and timely measures like the early lockdown that were put in place by many governments in the region borne from experience with previous outbreaks like ebola may have contributed to fewer confirmed cases and deaths compared to other regions gaye et al 2020 in addition marsh and alobo 2020 argued that the age structure in africa dominated by a much younger population explains a very large part of the apparent difference and suggested that some of the remaining gap is probably due to underreporting of events however there are a number of other plausible explanations these range from climatic differences pre existing immunity genetic factors and behavioural differences among cultures and regions doshi 2020 maecenas et al 2020 marsh and alobo 2020 tso et al 2020 urashima et al 2020 zeberg and pääbo 2020 one hypothesis is that the population in sub saharan africa could have been previously exposed to other coronaviruses prior to the covid 19 pandemic this may have resulted in some degree of cross protection against sars cov 2 infection and pathogenesis in a recent study a significantly higher prevalence of sars cov 2 serological cross reactivity was detected in blood samples from sub saharan africa compared to usa europe and asia tso et al 2020 the authors suggested that prior exposure to common human coronaviruses may be the reason behind the low susceptibility in sub saharan africa clearly there is no single reason for the observed differences in covid 19 related morbidity and mortality rates but a combination of the factors discussed above could help in our understanding as more studies are undertaken and reported 3 sars cov 2 control under poor wash conditions a major challenge for the control of sars cov 2 transmission has been the lack of effective drugs or vaccine qu et al 2020 like sars and mers there is still no specific licensed antiviral treatment for covid 19 clinical management of covid 19 patients has been mainly supportive to manage symptoms however some treatment medications or procedures are under investigation and positive results from various vaccine trials indicates that the virus can be stopped for example by december 2020 three of the six vaccine candidates supported by the u s government have reported promising data with high efficacy with emergency use authorization for two vaccines being issued already nevertheless the path ahead is still very uncertain considering the costs and huge logistics needed to produce distribute and administer vaccines according to who 4 3 billion is needed immediately to lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of vaccines and a further 23 9 billion is required for 2021 address to the first high level session of the u n general assembly on the pandemic on december 4 2020 by who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus until that time when effective treatment and universal vaccination is possible the underlying health and immunity status of exposed population and the measures recommended by who to prevent sars cov 2 transmission will play a critical role in containing the pandemic mohamed and josef 2020 who 2020 xu et al 2020 current who recommendations on preventing the transmission of sars cov 2 promote good hygiene especially regular hand washing with clean water and soap who 2020 in addition who recommends social distancing practices wearing of face mask in public places and situations where social distancing is not possible and the use of personal protective equipment by frontline health service providers who 2020 wearing of masks prevents the wearer from transmitting sars cov 2 to others and the practice may provide some protection to the wearer howard et al 2020 given that transmission of sars cov 2 can occur through contaminated surfaces and contaminated hands proper hand hygiene is extremely important to stop transmission hand hygiene is well known to interrupt transmission of other viruses and bacteria causing common colds flu and pneumonia such as rhinoviruses coronavirus influenza a or b virus arainfluenza virus respiratory syncytial virus adenovirus enterovirus chlamydia pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae streptococcus pneumoniae mycoplasma pneumoniae mäkelä et al 1998 prüss ustün et al 2014 chen et al 2020 hopman et al 2020 zunyou and jennifer 2020 handwashing with soap is a cost effective public health intervention in reducing diarrhea disease burden costing us 3 35 per disability adjusted life year daly averted cairncross and valdamanis 2006 the duration of survival of human coronaviruses in general depends on several factors including the type of surface temperature relative humidity and the specific strain of the virus kampf et al 2020 sars cov 2 is an enveloped virus with a fragile outer membrane hence it is less stable in the environment although like sars cov 1 it can persist on aerosols and other similar surfaces van doremalen et al 2020 the virus is susceptible to detergents and oxidants such as chlorine and it is reported to be inactivated significantly faster than non enveloped waterborne human enteric viruses salido et al 2020 who unicef 2020 therefore who has put hand hygiene as a key pillar for stopping the transmission of sars cov 2 however access to adequate wash facilities is a challenge in low income countries especially in rural areas and low income urban settlements donde et al 2013 jeuland et al 2013 behnke et al 2018 gudda et al 2019 kumwenda 2019 owassa et al 2020 robert et al 2014 furthermore the promotion of other covid 19 control measures such as social distancing self isolation and avoidance of public places has been more challenging in low income countries given that people from different households in rural areas and densely populated urban clusters use the same water points and share bathrooms and pit latrines which are often in poor conditions guy et al 2020 organizations like world vision have continued to work with local institutions such as schools and universities to improve the wash conditions during the pandemic however implementing and sustaining even a basic hand washing facility with soap is still difficult to achieve in many parts of africa asia and south america it is estimated that universal access to wash services to achieve sdg 6 targets by 2030 would require an estimated 0 13 to 1 of the gross regional product grp of low income and middle income counties in southern asia and sub saharan africa hutton and varughese 2016 this will be difficult to achieve from public funds which are now constrained by additional and urgent budgetary needs like containing covid 19 therefore external development assistance would be required to support the wash sector at a critical time when resources are being channeled towards the global fight against the pandemic a rational allocation of resources to respond to the pandemic could include the wash sector which is typically least prioritized and underfunded in low income countries waterborne transmission for sars cov 2 has been ruled out but some particles of sars cov 2 have been detected in feces and urine of covid 19 patients as well as in the wastewater streams of urban areas where covid 19 outbreaks have occurred chavarria miró et al 2020 haramoto et al 2020 medema et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 wu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 in addition a surrogate human coronavirus has been reported to survive for several days in tap water and sewage at 4 c 25 c ahmed et al 2020 although there is currently no evidence for sars cov 2 transmission via drinking water wastewater or through the fecal oral route these findings nevertheless highlight the need for adequate wash services and care in handling human excreta and wastes especially from healthcare facilities handling covid 19 patients furthermore the discovery of sars cov 2 viral particles in wastewater has emerged as a potential effective approach for identifying and tracing the spread of the virus thompson et al 2020 initial results and analysis indicate that monitoring wastewater influents at community or municipality scale may provide insights into how widespread the outbreak has occurred in certain population clusters especially in communities where mass testing of the entire population may be difficult to achieve mallapaty 2020 such analysis could reveal the true scale of a covid 19 outbreak that is associated with a particular population cluster medema et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 the approach could be helpful in low income countries with limited resources to undertake mass covid 19 testing and tracing some additional challenges have since emerged with regards to meeting the required standards for disposal and management of wastes from healthcare facilities handing covid 19 patients management of healthcare wastes following standard procedures is a challenge in most low income countries and this increases the potential for sars cov 2 transmission nzediegwu and chang 2020 rhee 2020 a major concern includes proper management of the personal protective equipment ppe used to protect frontline health workers and handling biocidal agents used to fumigate surfaces at healthcare facilities handling covid 19 patients several countries have thus far instituted policies to ensure sustainable management of waste while protecting the safety of waste handlers sarkodie and owusu 2020 however most countries have proceeded with the establishment of testing treatment centers and isolation facilities with little or no attention towards establishment of safe disposal facilities for the infectious waste generated ugom 2020 strict sanitation procedures are to be followed when handling wastes from confirmed covid 19 patients such wastes should be handled with care and treated as biohazards who unicef 2020 it is required to provide separate flush toilets or latrines that should be cleaned and disinfected at least twice daily by a trained cleaner wearing appropriate ppe rhee 2020 toilets should be flushed with the lids down to avoid droplets splattering around as well as to prevent aerosols from being generated johnson et al 2013 gudda et al 2019 furthermore the plumbing system should be well maintained to avoid leakages and prevent aerosolized droplets from entering the plumbing or ventilation systems rhee 2020 when pit latrines are used care must be taken to prevent contamination of the environment with excreta including groundwater gudda et al 2019 4 conclusions and recommendations the covid 19 pandemic underscores the critical importance of wash for preventing infectious diseases and reinforces previous pronouncements that adequate wash is crucial for public health however key wash recommendations put forward by who to effectively contain the pandemic has been difficult to undertake in low income countries wash policy and action can be transformed and scaled more quickly through appropriate political involvement to address current needs while preparing for future public health emergencies this would require high level political attention and closer coordination between public health and wash sectors at the level of implementation wash is central to the covid 19 response and recovery strategy sufficient funding is necessary to provide and maintain adequate wash services and support

2016 roche et al 2017 majority of the world s population lacking access to wash facilities are in low income countries especially in rural settlements and unplanned urban population clusters for instance in 2017 nine out of ten of the 785 million people who still used limited services unimproved sources or surface water lived in three regions sub saharan africa 400 million eastern and south eastern asia 161 million and central and south asia 145 million who unicef 2019 as the global spread of the pandemic became obvious in the first quarter of 2020 there was a sense of apprehension about what would happen when the pandemic gets to low income countries blake et al 2020 the combination of poor wash conditions and overstretched healthcare systems in those countries during a global public health emergency was a genuine reason for the apprehension in this article we reviewed literature on sars cov 2 transmission and control and discussed the challenges of focusing on wash as a critical control measure in low income countries with poor wash conditions in addition we discussed the critical importance of water sanitation and hygiene for preventing infectious diseases and presented some arguments for the global disparities in codid 19 related morbidity and mortality between low income and high income countries 2 sars cov 2 transmission morbidity and mortality the exact animal reservoir of sars cov 2 has not been ascertained fully but it is suspected to be from bats of the genus rhinolophus as it shares 96 sequence similarity with betacoronaviruses isolated from multiple species of bats from this genus han et al 2019 the sars cov 2 isolated from humans shared 92 sequence similarity with sars like viruses that were circulating in bats and 90 of the sars like viruses from bats have been isolated from the rhinolophus genus which is widely distributed across asia the middle east africa and europe csorba et al 2003 han et al 2019 the comparatively strong genetic sequence similarity between sars cov 2 and beta coronavirus isolated from bats batcov ratg13 suggests that ancestors of the former were circulating in bats in the rhinolophus genus han et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 other studies have confirmed possible animal to human and human to human transmissions but the intermediate host for the transmission of sars cov 2 is still not known with full certainty guo et al 2020 muhammad et al 2020 many respiratory infections have previously been linked to human interaction with wildlife and livestock but tracing a similar source of sars cov 2 remains a big challenge han et al 2019 li et al 2020 covid 19 is the third zoonotic coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades after sars severe acute respiratory syndrome was reported in singapore in 2003 and mers middle east respiratory syndrome in saudi arabia in 2012 yi et al 2019 xie and chen 2020 like other coronavirus outbreaks human to human transmission of sars cov 2 occurs primarily when respiratory droplets containing the virus reaches the mucosa of the eyes nose and mouth lai et al 2020 sars cov 2 can spread quickly in healthcare facilities public places and family settings when the recommended containment measures are not strictly followed who 2020 the virus spreads when people infected with the virus sneeze cough on or touch surfaces or objects such as tables doorknobs and handrails chan et al 2020 kampf et al 2020 jin et al 2020 shen et al 2020 who 2020 other people can be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching their eyes noses or mouths afterwards without cleaning their hands aerosol transmission may occur in indoor crowded and poorly ventilated spaces such as restaurants choir practice rooms gyms nightclubs offices or places of worship where infected person s spend long periods of time with others jayaweera et al 2020 stadnytskyi et al al 2020 who 2020 once the virus infects humans it causes disease to varying degrees from upper respiratory tract infections urtis resembling the common cold to lower respiratory tract infections lrtis such as bronchitis pneumonia and even severe acute respiratory syndrome sars corman et al 2019 schoeman and fielding 2019 infected persons especially those with underlying health conditions are generally susceptible to sars cov 2 within an incubation period of 2 to 14 days singhal 2020 however some sars cov 2 infected persons do not show any symptoms and are likely to go unnoticed xu et al 2020 such individuals may trigger community spread of covid 19 and are of public health interest to contain the pandemic bai et al 2020 gao et al 2020 currently both morbidity and mortality rates from covid 19 remain relatively low in many low income countries compared to some high income countries fig 1 a significantly higher prevalence of sars cov 2 infection and covid 19 related deaths has been observed in many high income countries like the united states of america and other countries in europe and asia regardless of advanced medical facilities in these countries it is still not fully understood why morbidity and mortality remain relatively low fig 1 d in many low income countries although covid 19 risk has been diametrically associated with certain demographic characteristics such as household size age structure level of income and social economic status walker et al 2020 on 29 september 2020 the world passed the grim milestone of one million reported deaths on the same day the total mortality count for africa was 35 954 marsh and alobo 2020 africa accounts for 17 of the global population but only 3 5 of the reported global covid 19 deaths there has been much discussion on what could be responsible for the relatively lower morbidity and mortality rates in sub saharan africa factors such as limited travel inadequate covid 19 testing capacities and widespread challenges with data collection have been mentioned marsh and alobo 2020 but decisive and timely measures like the early lockdown that were put in place by many governments in the region borne from experience with previous outbreaks like ebola may have contributed to fewer confirmed cases and deaths compared to other regions gaye et al 2020 in addition marsh and alobo 2020 argued that the age structure in africa dominated by a much younger population explains a very large part of the apparent difference and suggested that some of the remaining gap is probably due to underreporting of events however there are a number of other plausible explanations these range from climatic differences pre existing immunity genetic factors and behavioural differences among cultures and regions doshi 2020 maecenas et al 2020 marsh and alobo 2020 tso et al 2020 urashima et al 2020 zeberg and pääbo 2020 one hypothesis is that the population in sub saharan africa could have been previously exposed to other coronaviruses prior to the covid 19 pandemic this may have resulted in some degree of cross protection against sars cov 2 infection and pathogenesis in a recent study a significantly higher prevalence of sars cov 2 serological cross reactivity was detected in blood samples from sub saharan africa compared to usa europe and asia tso et al 2020 the authors suggested that prior exposure to common human coronaviruses may be the reason behind the low susceptibility in sub saharan africa clearly there is no single reason for the observed differences in covid 19 related morbidity and mortality rates but a combination of the factors discussed above could help in our understanding as more studies are undertaken and reported 3 sars cov 2 control under poor wash conditions a major challenge for the control of sars cov 2 transmission has been the lack of effective drugs or vaccine qu et al 2020 like sars and mers there is still no specific licensed antiviral treatment for covid 19 clinical management of covid 19 patients has been mainly supportive to manage symptoms however some treatment medications or procedures are under investigation and positive results from various vaccine trials indicates that the virus can be stopped for example by december 2020 three of the six vaccine candidates supported by the u s government have reported promising data with high efficacy with emergency use authorization for two vaccines being issued already nevertheless the path ahead is still very uncertain considering the costs and huge logistics needed to produce distribute and administer vaccines according to who 4 3 billion is needed immediately to lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of vaccines and a further 23 9 billion is required for 2021 address to the first high level session of the u n general assembly on the pandemic on december 4 2020 by who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus until that time when effective treatment and universal vaccination is possible the underlying health and immunity status of exposed population and the measures recommended by who to prevent sars cov 2 transmission will play a critical role in containing the pandemic mohamed and josef 2020 who 2020 xu et al 2020 current who recommendations on preventing the transmission of sars cov 2 promote good hygiene especially regular hand washing with clean water and soap who 2020 in addition who recommends social distancing practices wearing of face mask in public places and situations where social distancing is not possible and the use of personal protective equipment by frontline health service providers who 2020 wearing of masks prevents the wearer from transmitting sars cov 2 to others and the practice may provide some protection to the wearer howard et al 2020 given that transmission of sars cov 2 can occur through contaminated surfaces and contaminated hands proper hand hygiene is extremely important to stop transmission hand hygiene is well known to interrupt transmission of other viruses and bacteria causing common colds flu and pneumonia such as rhinoviruses coronavirus influenza a or b virus arainfluenza virus respiratory syncytial virus adenovirus enterovirus chlamydia pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae streptococcus pneumoniae mycoplasma pneumoniae mäkelä et al 1998 prüss ustün et al 2014 chen et al 2020 hopman et al 2020 zunyou and jennifer 2020 handwashing with soap is a cost effective public health intervention in reducing diarrhea disease burden costing us 3 35 per disability adjusted life year daly averted cairncross and valdamanis 2006 the duration of survival of human coronaviruses in general depends on several factors including the type of surface temperature relative humidity and the specific strain of the virus kampf et al 2020 sars cov 2 is an enveloped virus with a fragile outer membrane hence it is less stable in the environment although like sars cov 1 it can persist on aerosols and other similar surfaces van doremalen et al 2020 the virus is susceptible to detergents and oxidants such as chlorine and it is reported to be inactivated significantly faster than non enveloped waterborne human enteric viruses salido et al 2020 who unicef 2020 therefore who has put hand hygiene as a key pillar for stopping the transmission of sars cov 2 however access to adequate wash facilities is a challenge in low income countries especially in rural areas and low income urban settlements donde et al 2013 jeuland et al 2013 behnke et al 2018 gudda et al 2019 kumwenda 2019 owassa et al 2020 robert et al 2014 furthermore the promotion of other covid 19 control measures such as social distancing self isolation and avoidance of public places has been more challenging in low income countries given that people from different households in rural areas and densely populated urban clusters use the same water points and share bathrooms and pit latrines which are often in poor conditions guy et al 2020 organizations like world vision have continued to work with local institutions such as schools and universities to improve the wash conditions during the pandemic however implementing and sustaining even a basic hand washing facility with soap is still difficult to achieve in many parts of africa asia and south america it is estimated that universal access to wash services to achieve sdg 6 targets by 2030 would require an estimated 0 13 to 1 of the gross regional product grp of low income and middle income counties in southern asia and sub saharan africa hutton and varughese 2016 this will be difficult to achieve from public funds which are now constrained by additional and urgent budgetary needs like containing covid 19 therefore external development assistance would be required to support the wash sector at a critical time when resources are being channeled towards the global fight against the pandemic a rational allocation of resources to respond to the pandemic could include the wash sector which is typically least prioritized and underfunded in low income countries waterborne transmission for sars cov 2 has been ruled out but some particles of sars cov 2 have been detected in feces and urine of covid 19 patients as well as in the wastewater streams of urban areas where covid 19 outbreaks have occurred chavarria miró et al 2020 haramoto et al 2020 medema et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 wu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 in addition a surrogate human coronavirus has been reported to survive for several days in tap water and sewage at 4 c 25 c ahmed et al 2020 although there is currently no evidence for sars cov 2 transmission via drinking water wastewater or through the fecal oral route these findings nevertheless highlight the need for adequate wash services and care in handling human excreta and wastes especially from healthcare facilities handling covid 19 patients furthermore the discovery of sars cov 2 viral particles in wastewater has emerged as a potential effective approach for identifying and tracing the spread of the virus thompson et al 2020 initial results and analysis indicate that monitoring wastewater influents at community or municipality scale may provide insights into how widespread the outbreak has occurred in certain population clusters especially in communities where mass testing of the entire population may be difficult to achieve mallapaty 2020 such analysis could reveal the true scale of a covid 19 outbreak that is associated with a particular population cluster medema et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 the approach could be helpful in low income countries with limited resources to undertake mass covid 19 testing and tracing some additional challenges have since emerged with regards to meeting the required standards for disposal and management of wastes from healthcare facilities handing covid 19 patients management of healthcare wastes following standard procedures is a challenge in most low income countries and this increases the potential for sars cov 2 transmission nzediegwu and chang 2020 rhee 2020 a major concern includes proper management of the personal protective equipment ppe used to protect frontline health workers and handling biocidal agents used to fumigate surfaces at healthcare facilities handling covid 19 patients several countries have thus far instituted policies to ensure sustainable management of waste while protecting the safety of waste handlers sarkodie and owusu 2020 however most countries have proceeded with the establishment of testing treatment centers and isolation facilities with little or no attention towards establishment of safe disposal facilities for the infectious waste generated ugom 2020 strict sanitation procedures are to be followed when handling wastes from confirmed covid 19 patients such wastes should be handled with care and treated as biohazards who unicef 2020 it is required to provide separate flush toilets or latrines that should be cleaned and disinfected at least twice daily by a trained cleaner wearing appropriate ppe rhee 2020 toilets should be flushed with the lids down to avoid droplets splattering around as well as to prevent aerosols from being generated johnson et al 2013 gudda et al 2019 furthermore the plumbing system should be well maintained to avoid leakages and prevent aerosolized droplets from entering the plumbing or ventilation systems rhee 2020 when pit latrines are used care must be taken to prevent contamination of the environment with excreta including groundwater gudda et al 2019 4 conclusions and recommendations the covid 19 pandemic underscores the critical importance of wash for preventing infectious diseases and reinforces previous pronouncements that adequate wash is crucial for public health however key wash recommendations put forward by who to effectively contain the pandemic has been difficult to undertake in low income countries wash policy and action can be transformed and scaled more quickly through appropriate political involvement to address current needs while preparing for future public health emergencies this would require high level political attention and closer coordination between public health and wash sectors at the level of implementation wash is central to the covid 19 response and recovery strategy sufficient funding is necessary to provide and maintain adequate wash services and support countrywide advocacy programmes on science based messaging this will ensure that who recommendations on regular handwashing with clean water and soap are achieved universally contributions each author

17202,public health is attracting increasing attention due to the current global pandemic and wastewater based epidemiology wbe has emerged as a powerful tool for monitoring of public health by analysis of a variety of biomarkers e g chemicals and pathogens in wastewater rapid development of wbe requires rapid and on site analytical tools for monitoring of sewage biomarkers to provide immediate decision and intervention biosensors have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and selective tools for the analysis of sewage biomarkers due to their fast response ease to use low cost and the potential for field testing this paper presents biosensors as effective tools for wastewater analysis of potential biomarkers and monitoring of public health via wbe in particular we discuss the use of sewage sensors for rapid detection of a range of targets including rapid monitoring of community wide illicit drug consumption and pathogens for early warning of infectious diseases outbreaks finally we provide a perspective on the future use of the biosensor technology for wbe to enable rapid on site monitoring of sewage which will provide nearly real time data for public health assessment and effective intervention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biosensors wastewater based epidemiology biomarkers public health infectious diseases 1 introduction public health issues are gaining increasing attention including drug abuse food safety heavy metal and pesticide exposure infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases being able to assess these threats in a timely manner and implement the corresponding countermeasures will have a significant impact on public health human biomonitoring is a powerful tool for public health assessment by analysis of various biomarkers in human specimens however this approach has certain limitations including sampling biases extended time requirements need for complex data elaboration to extrapolate the results to the whole population high costs and ethical issues gracia lor et al 2018 wastewater based epidemiology wbe is an effective biomonitoring tool that is receiving increasing attention due to low cost and near real time response wbe is an emerging emergingemerging technique related to the extraction analysis data processing and interpretation of the targets excreted in faeces urine and wastewater to provide public health information in certain areas wbe has been extensively used in the evaluation of drug abuse zuccato et al 2008 zuccato et al 2005 food safety choi et al 2019 assessment of exposure to poisons such as heavy metals markosian and mirzoyan 2019 and pesticides devault and karolak 2020 and in other public health aspects such as prevention of infectious disease outbreaks bivins et al 2020 murakami et al 2020 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 for example environmental surveillance of poliovirus in wastewater has been performed in finland hovi et al 2011 and israel roberts 2013 to assess the levels of poliovirus circulating within the populations world health organization who has released guidelines for environmental sampling to monitor poliovirus in wastewater sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 in addition antiviral drugs have been detected in wastewater prasse et al 2010 and the consumption of antiviral drug oseltamivir has been evaluated using wbe singer et al 2013 these approaches can be potentially extended for additional applications for public health assessment rapid development of wbe has increased the importance of appropriate analytical tools for accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis of various targets in wastewater choi et al 2018 gracia lor et al 2017 the analytical tools used to evaluate these targets are mainly based on expensive instruments that must be located in a laboratory and operated by professional technicians such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms for the detection of heavy metal ions liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms for the detection of small organic chemicals or their metabolites and polymerase chain reaction pcr for the detection of nucleic acids and genetic information these methods are characterised by high sensitivity selectivity and stability hernández et al 2018 however the requirements for an expensive instrument and restriction of the analysis to a laboratory limit the broad applications of these techniques mao et al 2017 additionally in some cases dynamic changes in pollutants in wastewater have to be measured over time and at different locations therefore traditional laboratory analysis is unable to meet the requirements of on site wastewater monitoring thus limiting the development of wbe ejeian et al 2018 there is a need to develop rapid and portable assays that enable to perform the analysis at the site of sample collection biosensors have recently emerged as effective alternatives that demonstrated potential ability to test sewage in the field hernández et al 2018 biosensors are powerful analytical tools that have received considerable attention due to their excellent characteristics and are becoming increasingly important in healthcare environmental monitoring mao et al 2020b food safety rebe raz et al 2010 and drug discovery mao et al 2020a biosensors are small devices that utilize biochemical reactions mediated by a biological receptor biorecognition element such as nucleic acids antibodies enzymes cells and even microorganisms and usually detect targets based on optical electrical thermal and other signals chen et al 2019 biosensors are characterized by a fast response low cost and potential miniaturization with other portable devices that can be operated by nontechnical personnel to measure target parameters using a small number of samples on site ejeian et al 2018 biosensors have played an important role in quantification of drugs pharmaceuticals biomolecules and microorganisms in wastewater for assessment of drug pharmaceutical consumption in a community and population health furthermore biosensors for analysis of sewage can potentially provide real time data for government agencies to monitor trends in drug consumption and establish an effective early warning system to prevent community based disease outbreaks mao et al 2020c therefore the results obtained by biosensors can reasonably reflect the toxic effects of various pollutants in wastewater this information provides strong technical support for the on line detection of wastewater and the development of an early warning sensing system this paper discussed that wbe based biosensor technology can be used to assess public health summarizes the latest progress in the research field and discusses the feasibility of future applications of the technology in public health initially we briefly introduce wbe as an effective tool for biomonitoring of drug abuse evaluation of population exposure and other aspects and discuss the feasibility of monitoring of numerous pollutants in sewage as wbe biomarkers for public health assessment shown in supporting information then we review various recent progress of biosensors in wastewater analysis and discuss their great potential for the detection of wastewater biomarkers in various areas of public health finally we discuss the possibility and potential of wbe based biosensor technology for expanded use in public health assessment including applications relevant to the covid 19 pandemic 2 biosensors for wastewater analysis of potential biomarkers this section is focused on expanded applications of biosensors for the detection of various pollutants and sewage biomarkers in wastewater that can be potentially used for wbe based public health assessment 2 1 inorganic ions heavy metals are not degradable and are frequently detected in wastewater markosian and mirzoyan 2019 the use of biosensors is becoming a potential choice for the detection of heavy metal ions in wastewater shtenberg et al 2015 a detailed description is provided in table s1 mainly including hg fig 1 a ezhil vilian et al 2017 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2016 tan et al 2016 as fig 1b gu et al 2018 mao et al 2020b song et al 2016 pb fig 1c li et al 2019 cr tsai et al 2003 wu et al 2017 cu fig 1d and several other heavy metal ions khan et al 2020 mao et al 2015 sekhon et al 2017 aptamers are the main recognition elements used in heavy metal analysis in sewage aptamers are highly specific nucleic acid sequences that can recognize heavy metals and detect the corresponding heavy metal ions liu et al 2009 at present the main structures with known affinity to heavy metal ions include t hg t wang et al 2018b c ag c mao et al 2015 and pb g quadruplex yang et al 2013 certain nucleic acid sequences for the detection of some other metal ions can be identified by screening using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment selex technology these sequences can be used as aptamers with high affinity to the target ions zhou et al 2017 for example an aptamer for arsenic is a fragment of a nucleic acid sequence mao et al 2020b previous studies on the analysis of inorganic targets have focused on the detection of heavy metal ions however interest in monitoring of nonmetallic ions is also increasing including a microbial biosensor for sulfide liu et al 2017 a cell biosensor for cyanide virender et al 2018 and a microfluidics device for ammonium levels gallardo gonzalez et al 2019 these biosensors rapidly and reliably provide real time data and demonstrate good robustness and anti interference performance in wastewater generally inorganic ion sensors are rarely used in wastewater analysis due to their limits of detection lod because the target inorganic ions are usually present at a very low concentration in sewage in addition the complex wastewater matrix may lead to serious interference which will affect the accuracy of detection current efforts investigate the use of these biosensors in wastewater analysis however only initial laboratory experiments are being performed and additional verification is required only a few publications are related to these areas although potential application of biosensors for the detection of various inorganic components in wastewater has been preliminarily demonstrated 2 2 organic pollutants and pharmaceuticals various organic pollutants have been detected in wastewater detection of these pollutants has been reported to involve numerous low cost easy and point of use sensors using highly specific chemical binding agents coupled to colorimetric fluorescence or electrochemical biosensing platforms as shown in table 1 and table s2 biosensors are used for the detection of various organic small molecules and sensors for organic molecules in sewage are mainly focused on pesticides pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs since illicit drug sensors are mainly related to drug abuse and consumption the application of drug biomarkers in wbe is discussed in section 3 of this paper and pesticides and pharmaceuticals are mainly discussed in this section various organic pollutants have been detected in industrial and agricultural wastewater rousis et al 2017 table s2 the majority of reported biosensors are pesticide biosensors such as a biosensor shown in fig 2 a rousis et al 2016 2017 biosensors for pesticides mainly target herbicides fan et al 2016 saberi et al 2019 and insecticides kardaş et al 2017 shetti et al 2019 the most frequently reported organic pollutant biosensors target phenolic compounds akbulut et al 2015 mendes et al 2017 sanchez paniagua lopez and lopez ruiz 2018 sekretaryova et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 mainly including bisphenol a allsop et al 2019 lim et al 2018 qi et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zehani et al 2015 catechol liu et al 2019c wee et al 2019 and chlorophenols mendes et al 2017 yashas et al 2019 most of biosensors for phenolic compounds were built based on aptamers seen in fig 2b allsop et al 2019 lim et al 2018 qi et al 2019 and bioactive enzymes mainly laccase and tyrosinase rahimi mohseni et al 2019 sekretaryova et al 2016 additionally biosensors for organophosphorus pesticides bao et al 2017 gothwal et al 2014 kaur et al 2015 montes et al 2018 and some other pesticides such as nereistoxin carbofuran acephate ametryn and thiram have received some attention recently grawe et al 2015 qian et al 2014 takahashi et al 2018 numerous publications described the detection of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in wastewater mainly including antibiotics benzodiazepines antidepressants pharmaceutical opioids asthma medicines and antihistamines choi et al 2018 lai et al 2011 petrie et al 2015 phung et al 2017 thai et al 2016 biosensors for monitoring of pharmaceuticals including drugs antibiotics and antimicrobials in wastewater are listed in table 1 antibiotics are one the major classes of antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of bacterial diseases and are the most frequently detected traditional pharmaceuticals in sewage biosensors are efficient analytical tools for the detection of various antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs in wastewater such as ofloxacin pilehvar et al 2017 ciprofloxacin gayen and chaplin 2016 quinine qiu et al 2018 oxytetracycline fig 2c zhou et al 2019 tetracycline liu et al 2018b malik and iyer 2017 zhou et al 2018 sulfonamide antibiotics zhu et al 2018 quinolone reinemann et al 2016 furazolidone and nitrofurazone wang et al 2018a the main biological receptors of these biosensors are aptamers due to their specificity and stability pilehvar et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 as an example fig 2c shows an unlabelled aptamer biosensor used to determine oxytetracycline levels in wastewater zhou et al 2019 aptamers offer considerable advantages over other biosensors and various aptamers have been synthesised and screened for the detection of a wide range of antibiotics such as quinolones pilehvar et al 2017 reinemann et al 2016 the signal detection strategies of biosensors for antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs mainly include electrochemistry gayen and chaplin 2016 fluorescence wang et al 2018a zhu et al 2018 colorimetry ramos et al 2019 and luminescence liu et al 2018b zhou et al 2018 in addition qiu et al integrated biosensors into portable devices and used a glucose meter for signal detection to improve visibility and provide easy on site use qiu et al 2018 some nanomaterials such as metal organic frameworks mofs fig 2c have been widely used in antibiotic biosensors liu et al 2018b zhu et al 2018 application of these materials improves the analytical performance of the sensors in target detection the presence of conventional drugs such as anticancer anti inflammatory antidiabetic drugs and bronchodilator fig 2d in wastewater in addition to antibiotics is also a matter of increasing concern choi et al 2018 biosensors have been developed to measure the levels of these pharmaceuticals in wastewater including nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac schirmer et al 2019 and antidiabetic drug metformin machini et al 2019 cell biosensors fang et al 2019 pham et al 2015 and dna biosensors congur et al 2015 machini et al 2019 prado et al 2017 are the two main types of conventional pharmaceutical biosensors for example ezgi et al bayram and akyilmaz 2016 developed a new microbial sensor based on a polyaniline carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt complex and bacillus subtilis for the electrochemical determination of paracetamol levels this biosensor is characterised by rapid detection time and excellent overall performance compared with other biosensors used for paracetamol detection 2 3 biomolecules wastewater represents an ideal milieu for epidemiological studies of biomolecules because it contains a wide range of biomolecules such as specific human nucleic acids peptides proteins and antimicrobial resistance markers bartsch et al 2016 costán longares et al 2008 dolejska et al 2011 goñi urriza et al 2000 montazeri et al 2015 rodriguez manzano et al 2009 shannon et al 2007 yang et al 2015b currently an increasing number of biosensors are being used to detect these biomolecules in wastewater 2 3 1 human nucleic acids although dna has not been compared with other population marker criteria scientists have started to detect and quantify the levels of dna in wastewater nearly in real time using dna specific biosensors guo et al 2018 yang et al 2015a yang et al described the use of an electrochemical biosensor with a ferrocenyl dsdna intercalator as a redox marker to monitor human specific mitochondrial dna mtdna in wastewater yang et al 2015a the results confirmed the possibility of the analysis of human dna in wastewater using designed biosensors to improve the portability and user friendliness a rapid visual platform was used for quantitative monitoring of mtdna in community wastewater fig 3 a based on loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp with a minimal level of user intervention within 45 minutes yang et al 2017 2 3 2 peptides and proteins recently peptides and proteins have attracted increasing attention as human biomarkers in wbe prostate specific antigen psa is a marker widely used to diagnose prostate cancer and numerous studies focused on the development of a rapid sensing based assay yang et al initially constructed novel dna directed immobilization based aptamer biosensors for psa assay yang et al 2015c then for ease of use and portability this electrochemical biosensor was improved to yield a paper device modified using graphene nanocomposites and aptamers wei et al 2018 the paper device was developed using wax printing to generate hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers that formed a microfluidic channel and three electrodes were subsequently screen printed as shown in fig 3b synthetic nanocomposites were used for aptamer immobilization on working electrodes to enhance the sensitivity of the detection of psa a practical sample test indicated that the biosensor can potentially become a sensitive and cost effective diagnostic platform for prostate cancer through wbe 2 3 3 antibiotic resistance genes args antimicrobial resistance poses a substantial risk to human health o neill and humphreys 2005 resistant microorganisms and their args are frequently present in wastewater which makes args the most extensively investigated contaminants in wastewater berendonk et al 2015 michael et al 2013 moura et al 2010 rizzo et al 2013 szczepanowski et al 2009 varela and manaia 2013 biosensors have also been applied to arg analysis fig 3d describes a stable oligonucleotide functionalized gold nanosensor for monitoring of meca arg riquelme et al 2017 in practical wastewater analysis the meca specific nanosensor was stabile under environmental conditions and at high ionic strength and demonstrated high selectivity in the presence of target interference this contribution supported the environmental applicability of a novel low cost and field deployable tool for wide scale arg analyses in summary various biosensors including optical and electrochemical sensors have been used in wastewater analysis in general colorimetric and fluorescent sensors have poorer lods than electrochemical sensors although surface enhanced raman scattering spectroscopy sers has a high sensitivity it lacks stability which limits its application in practical wastewater analysis colorimetric and fluorescence sensors are based on optical detection and are easily disrupted by coloured or turbid samples additionally fluorescent sensor aptamers need to be labelled which increases their complexity and cost electrochemical aptasensor performance appears to be more reliable in wastewater matrices these sensors have the lowest lods and can be reused in some cases after regeneration of the electrode surface for example if an aptamer is directly immobilized onto the electrode surface the chip can be reused after binding the target by inducing careful dissociation of the target because recognition of the molecules is based on a conformational change the process is reversible however electrochemical detection often involves immobilization of aptamers onto electrodes which can cause a reduction in or complete loss of the binding affinity of an aptamer rendering the sensor ineffective although optical and electrochemical sensors are the two main types of sensors some other sensors such as piezoelectric nanomechanical and mass sensitive sensors have been reported mao et al 2019b yang et al 2015b biological receptor is another main element of a biosensor that has a critical influence on the selectivity and lod currently recognition elements mainly include aptamers antibodies enzymes and microorganisms the advantages and disadvantages of various components have been reported in previous publications aragay et al 2011 fu et al 2017 liu et al 2009 schirhagl 2014 in general sensors assembled from these recognition elements demonstrate good potential in the laboratory however most of the currently available biosensors require significant improvements in sensitivity selectivity functionality and other characteristics before they can be applied for commercial use in wastewater thus introduction of effective biological receptors such as whole microorganisms or biomolecules can improve applicability of biosensors for the detection of the analytes particularly in complex wastewater samples considering increasing complexity and diversification of sewage pollutants development of additional biological receptors requires high specificity and affinity to detect as many targets as possible 3 biosensors for monitoring public health via wbe this section discusses the available wbe based biosensor technologies for public health assessment mainly including the analysis of drug biomarkers population markers and health markers using biosensors and the potential use of wbe based biosensors for surveillance and early warning in infectious disease outbreaks details on potential biomarkers are presented in table 2 3 1 evaluation of community wide drug consumption drug abuse is a global problem that is difficult to monitor and evaluate because of its illegality wbe is the widely used method of drug analysis and evaluation of drug consumption and abuse numerous drug biosensors have been described kumar et al 2018 mokhtarzadeh et al 2015 however only a few reports described the use of biosensors for the analysis of drugs in wastewater in this section we introduce several biosensors for drugs in wastewater in 2016 yang et al reported a novel electrochemical aptamer sensor for the assessment of community cocaine consumption through wbe fig 4 a yang et al 2016 the biosensor was used to detect and evaluate the cocaine concentration in wastewater from a city in south western england for one week higher concentrations were measured on the weekend than on workdays thus the biosensor was useful for rapid on site assessment of a drug use trend in the area a cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine can be detected in urine based wastewater by a microbial fuel cell biosensor catal et al 2019 which can be potentially used to monitor the levels of cocaine metabolites in wastewater usually various illicit drugs methamphetamine cocaine and others are widely distributed and transported in wastewater therefore a rapid duplexed colorimetric detection method for the detection of illicit drugs in wastewater was based on aptamers and noble metal nanoparticles mao et al 2019a synthesized au ag nanoparticles were functionalized with dna reporter probes for methamphetamine and cocaine respectively fig 4b two capture probes for methamphetamine and cocaine were attached to magnetic beads higher affinity of an illicit drug to aptamer than that of a reporter probe and aptamer induced disassembly of the sandwich structure in the presence of illicit drugs resulting in colour changes the designed biosensor was able to analyse both methamphetamine and cocaine at a trace level within a wide dynamic range confirming the potential application of wbe to evaluate drug consumption mao et al 2021 3 2 population markers use wbe for quantitative or per capita evaluation of environmental factors or other health related information about the exposure requires an estimate of the population size of the target area in contrast to the usual methods for the estimation of the size of a population contributing to each sample based on the de facto population size castiglioni et al 2013 o brien et al 2014 the levels of certain molecules in wastewater including endocrine substances nucleic acid biomarkers peptides and proteins can be used as alternative markers biomarkers of the population level these molecules should possess the following characteristics 1 ease of measurement 2 a sewer mass load related to population size 3 negligible degradation and 4 a short mean residence time in the sewer network o brien et al 2017 therefore the fabrication of the tools for rapid and effective analytical methods for the detection of these human population markers is important and scientists are committed to using the advantages of biosensors to detect these biomarkers in this section we discuss biosensors used to detect human population markers in wastewater 3 2 1 endocrine substances ideal markers of the human population level include endogenous substances specific to human metabolism and characterised by homogenous excretion throughout the community and low variance been et al 2014 liu et al 2013 thai et al 2014 biosensors have been used to detect these target substances such as an electrochemical biosensor for the determination of dopamine levels yuan et al 2018 total oestrogens are ubiquitous endocrine substances that have been detected by sers based biosensors in wastewater liu et al 2019b assays of single oestrogen substances based on biosensors have also been reported fig 4c for example the analysis of 17 β oestradiol may involve the biological receptors of biosensors including protein liu et al 2019a and aptamer rather et al 2018 and fluorescent lee et al 2017 or electrochemical rather et al 2018 biosensor signals rather et al fabricated a femtosensitive aptasensor based on graphene amplified strategy for electrochemical analysis of 17β oestradiol rather et al 2018 3 2 2 exogenous markers excretion of exogenous biomarkers such as carbamazepine gabapentin and ibuprofen is consistent through different populations and can be used as a population marker o brien et al 2017 biosensors have been applied to detect these exogenous compounds in wastewater ramos et al developed an automated method for the detection of carbamazepine ramos et al 2019 a miniaturized and automated portable device based on an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa rapidly detects carbamazepine in sewage the proposed method combines the advantages of micro bead injection spectroscopy and a flow based lab on valve platform for automatic immunosorbent renewal providing a new recognition surface for each sample in addition pharmaceuticals have been reported as markers of population size lai et al 2011 o brien et al 2014 rico et al 2017 detailed discussion of the analysis of various pharmaceuticals using biosensors is provided in section 2 3 3 health markers the monitoring and evaluation of public health is an important component of regional health programs designed to map the current level of health in certain areas and thus help to improve human health wbe can provide a potentially reliable and rapid evaluation of the overall population health through determination of health markers in addition to analysis of pathogens biomarkers are also used to analyse general public health indicators such as obesity high blood pressure and diabetes yang et al 2015b according to a recent report the obesity level can be predicted by wastewater analysis newton et al 2015 a number of biosensors have been used to develop efficient analytical methods for the detection of health biomarkers pathogen and disease biomarkers in wastewater fig 4d ejeian et al 2018 yang et al reported an efficient point of care platform for the detection of genetic biomarkers within communities based on wastewater analysis yang et al 2017 therefore certain community sensors can be fabricated and used to evaluate the wastewater profiles and patterns of factors related to health and disease within populations within the framework of wbe additionally biosensors can be miniaturized to fit a portable device for on site analyses which may facilitate diagnostics of infectious disease in developing countries with extremely high occurrence of certain diseases e g tuberculosis mcnerney and daley 2011 and malaria xu et al 2016 these biosensors have potential applications in wastewater analysis as sewage sensors to evaluate urinary and faecal pathogens monitor public health based on wbe and collect the data and information for epidemiological and socioeconomic studies community sewage sensors are widely used to monitor various disease pathogens in a single assay the use of these sensors may have considerable economic and social impacts particularly in the areas with limited resources for example yang et al developed a rapid diagnostic platform for multiple infectious diseases utilizing a paper device yang et al 2018 moreover biosensor platforms can collect information about community wide health to implement effective interventions by health agencies and early prevention measures although the selectivity and long term stability of community sensors and the environmental susceptibility to deterioration of the biorecognition elements are the problems that are yet to be solved we suggest that efficient monitoring of health in communities will be possible in the future 3 4 biosensors for testing sewage for early warning of infectious disease outbreaks infectious disease outbreaks have become one of the main threats to public health for example the current covid 19 pandemic caused by sars cov 2 has led to a global disaster mao et al 2020d wbe is a powerful tool with huge potential for the surveillance and early warning of infectious disease outbreaks and transmission orive et al 2020 the characteristics of infectious diseases in the associated area or community can be monitored by the analysis of infectious disease biomarkers in wastewater samples from wwtp influents and community wastewater seen in fig 5 wastewater provides growth conditions for various microorganisms these microorganisms are frequently detected in wastewater produced from domestic activities and the food industry and are characterized by substantial changes in organic composition the levels of pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms vary depending on their sources a wide range of aquatic microbial diseases cause significant mortality and morbidity worldwide moreover the detection of microorganisms in wastewater is important for the elimination and control of their harmful pathogenic effects in the current wastewater treatment process microorganisms are difficult to completely remove from wastewater and are resistant to disinfectants due to their small size and chemical properties rapid and sensitive analytical tools are required to detect microorganisms these tools can assist with the investigations of the outbreaks and development of prevention strategies generally for infectious diseases information about a pathogen and host response is very important reddy et al 2018 pathogens may include viruses and bacteria that cause serious infections the determination of the pathogens in wastewater influent through wbe can be used to trace the pathogen source in the case of the covid 19 pandemic mao et al tried to use wbe to analyse sars cov 2 in urban sewage to identify potential virus carriers and provide early warning of covid 19 outbreaks mao et al 2020d important host response information in infectious diseases includes inflammatory processes and immune functions for example urinary protein and genetic information related to the diseases has been analysed in wastewater and these parameters can be potential disease biomarkers for wbe mao et al 2020d information about pathogens and host responses obtained in wastewater can be evaluated by wbe which will provide new insight for public health of a community and may have important implications for potential infectious diseases however the complexity of the wastewater matrix makes it challenging to perform the analysis of pathogenic and host response information available techniques for microorganism assays include culture based methods elisa and pcr altintas et al 2015 these methods can be categorized into two mechanisms of microorganism detection one of the mechanisms involves specific recognition of an element such as bacterial aptamers antibodies host guest relationships between bacteriophages and modification with chemical groups in this section we provide several examples of recognition of the elements abbaspour et al developed an aptamer modified silver nanoparticle for the electrochemical dual aptamer based sandwich detection of staphylococcus aureus which causes numerous diseases abbaspour et al 2015 ertürk et al used bacteriophages as a recognition element in capacitive biosensors for a phage and host bacteria assay ertürk and lood 2018 the sensing mechanism depends on the binding of the target phage to specific cavities on the surface of an electrode leading to a change in capacitance this method provides a simple and rapid onsite measurement of the levels of a bacteriophage and its host bacteria modification with chemical groups has also been reported as a biological receptor for microorganism detection rengaraj et al developed an impedimetric paper based biosensor by screen printing carbon electrodes onto hydrophobic paper for determination of bacteria in contaminated water rengaraj et al 2018 due to its cost efficiency simplicity and biodegradability this biosensor can be used as a portable test kit that overcomes the limitations of traditional expensive and time consuming laboratory based analyses biosensing techniques using smart affinity materials and nanomaterials can be used to measure microorganisms present in wastewater for example the levels of the ms2 phage in a water supply affected by wastewater can be determined prieto simón et al prieto simón et al 2015 developed an immunosensor that fixes a captured antibody on diazonium salt electrografted swcnts through chemical assembly or magnetic capture orientation the sensitivity of immunosensor was sufficient to determine the presence of ms2 at the level often encountered in the environment affected by wastewater which is an important step in application of this biosensor for environmental analyses subsequently reta et al reta et al 2016 designed an unmarked ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor based on a nanoporous silicon membrane for detection of the ms2 phage this study was the first to report a biosensor based on a nanoporous silicon membrane that uses the blocking effect of a nanochannel to transduce analyte binding another method for the measurement of microorganisms involves the detection of specific nucleic acid sequences of a microorganism because each microorganism possesses a species specific nucleic acid sequence nucleic acid testing is widely employed for environmental monitoring and disease diagnosis to confirm the presence of certain pathogens or microorganisms the main method for pathogen nucleic acid analysis is nucleic acid based pcr however various pcr inhibitors are present in wastewater and may affect subsequent pcr analysis in addition when dna rna is extracted from the pcr inhibitor rich samples various commercial extraction kits sometimes show variable efficiency and consistency mao et al 2020d this variability challenges meaningful comparisons across the studies and determination of spatiotemporal trends in the pathogens to solve this problem progress in the methods of molecular biology has provided new technologies for the analysis of genetic material including digital pcr dpcr and next generation sequencing in dpcr the absolute quantification of the target genes is determined using poisson distribution statistics via the partitioning of dna rna samples into tens and thousands of reaction wells sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 this distribution diminishes the effects of pcr inhibitors in wastewater on the results of dpcr racki et al 2014 next generation sequencing is another promising technology that provides substantial information about the complex microbial communities in the samples to enable identification of various pathogens petrie et al 2016 however the ultimate goal of wbe is to achieve on site monitoring and provide real time data which is required to provide timely early warning of infectious disease outbreaks analytical tools have to be simple rapid cost effective sensitive selective and multiplexed the latest developments in nucleic acid based sensor methods enable field measurements thus a system can provide real time information about infectious diseases and public health since the nucleic acid concentration in the samples is typically very low the amplification protocol is very important for the subsequent detection process currently nucleic acid testing mainly involves nucleic acid extraction amplification and determination that require large instruments and trained personnel thus these tests are costly time consuming and inappropriate for point of care analysis ajonina et al developed a lamp based biosensor for entamoeba histolytica and toxoplasma gondii in wastewater ajonina et al 2018 lamp is a rapid and stable nucleic acid detection method with ideal characteristics for point of care testing because it does not require thermal cycling similar to pcr lin et al modified the lamp technique and developed a digital lamp method on a commercial membrane that does not require complex fabrication or specialized equipment lin et al 2019 to facilitate the detection and improve portability nucleic acid amplification techniques are successfully integrated into portable devices such as mobile phones and paper devices huang et al fabricated a smartphone based in gel lamp system that enabled rapid quantification of the ms2 coliphage in wastewater samples huang et al 2018 the results of in gel lamp were highly tolerant to the inhibitors naturally present in wastewater in contrast rt qpcr was completely inhibited simplicity speed sensitivity and versatility of the in gel lamp approach indicate its great potential for microbial wastewater quality analysis particularly in low income areas development of paper based microfluidic techniques resulted in recent fabrication of a variety of paper devices for nucleic acid testing fig 3c shows a paper origami device based on nucleic acid amplification for the point of care colorimetric identification of live cells trieu and lee 2019 however these analytical methods using paper devices require off chip reagent storage complex operation steps and equipment dependent nucleic acid amplification restricting their use in point of care testing tang et al developed a completely disposable and integrated sample in answer out device for nucleic acid testing by integrating various processes for naked eye detection into a paper device to overcome these limitations tang et al 2017 this simple device allowed on chip dried reagent storage and equipment free nucleic acid amplification with simple operation steps and could be used by untrained people mao et al have recently proposed to trace covid 19 sources through sewage analysis using an efficient and inexpensive paper based biosensor mao et al 2020c since paper based sensors can measure the genetic material in wastewater a paper sensor is a small analytical device with various functional areas that integrates all processes extraction enrichment purification elution amplification and visual detection required for nucleic acid testing into an inexpensive paper material the whole testing process can be completed by simple folding of a paper based device in various steps without a pump or power supply overall the research in this area is highly demanding unfortunately only several research groups have performed related studies yang et al 2015b this lack of effective analytical tools is an important challenge for the wide application of wbe to provide early warning of infectious diseases and more efficient biosensors must be developed to acquire enough information about infectious diseases from wastewater 4 conclusion and perspectives a variety of pollutants widely distributed in wastewater can efficiently provide information that reflects drug consumption chemical exposure food safety and public health using wbe as discussed in this review biosensors represent a reliable alternative for tracking environmental pollutants by detection of various targets simplicity and reliability of detection of various contaminants by biosensors resulted in the development of an increasing number of biosensor based methods we have reviewed biosensors with various biological receptors such as aptamers and antibodies and various signal strategies such as optical and electrochemical signals which have been used to detect various targets in wastewater furthermore interdisciplinary collaborations between analytical scientists and researchers in other areas e g engineering have provided some good examples of miniaturized and portable biosensors furthermore these devices can analyse the targets on site critical interdisciplinary success has been reported in this area including the development of paper device based and personal glucose meter based biosensors although biosensors have broad application prospects in wastewater analysis their application remains a few challenges re first the prediction of the physical and chemical properties of various components of wastewater at various time points and conditions is difficult the complex matrix of wastewater may affect the prediction of various parameters in a sample and interfere with the detection of the required target because this dynamic matrix precludes the inclusion of an adequate blank secondly a new biosensor system with an expanded detection range and the ability to simultaneously detect many components is necessary to detect all types of contaminants in wastewater thirdly the stability of fixed biological elements such as enzymes cells antibodies tissues etc during shipment storage and operating conditions is another major consideration fourth this modern technology must also be evaluated by comparison with common analytical methods used to monitor wastewater moreover quantitative and qualitative analytic guidelines must be established and standardized thus certain technical and practical limitations and complexities are associated with this method in the future we should overcome these limitations to construct more effective biosensors for various applications in addition application of wbe has enormous potential for the analysis and monitoring of the pathogens and pollution health at the community level wastewater is a complex matrix therefore careful consideration of the microbes present in wastewater and certain standardization of analytical methods will form the basis for future studies and evaluation of wastewater as a tool for monitoring the microbial health and antimicrobial resistance scientists are trying to solve these problems and technical limitations for example two major strategies are being developed to overcome the main obstacles caused by the use of biomolecules as the recognition elements to ensure high sensitivity of biosensors and improve their stability during long term storage these strategies include i the production of recombinant target specific fragments and definition of the fixed characteristics of antibodies and enzymes to promote the development of tools to quickly and cost effectively analyse the levels of organic pollutants in wastewater in in situ screening and ii the use of a combination of nanomaterials and nanotechnology to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of biosensors miniaturization and introduction of multiplexed sensor array devices to improve the detection efficiency current progress in nanotechnology can be used to increase the detection performance of biosensors wastewater biosensors will become an innovative approach for the simple and rapid monitoring of various targets in wastewater even to the extent of field detection these devices will provide strong technical support for the wide application of wbe in assessments of environmental pollution drug abuse trends and public health and in surveillance and early warning of infectious disease outbreaks in the future biosensors for various biomarkers in wastewater must be sufficiently sensitive and selective to overcome the commercialization challenges by demonstrating stability reproducibility robustness ease of use portability and low cost thus we have proposed that sewage sensors can achieve the ultimate goal of on site monitoring and providing real time data within the framework of wbe we believe that sewage sensors can be widely and rapidly applied in the near future to obtain high volume of information related to public health including surveillance and early warning of infectious disease outbreaks pathogen sources tracking drug consumption toxic substance

17202,public health is attracting increasing attention due to the current global pandemic and wastewater based epidemiology wbe has emerged as a powerful tool for monitoring of public health by analysis of a variety of biomarkers e g chemicals and pathogens in wastewater rapid development of wbe requires rapid and on site analytical tools for monitoring of sewage biomarkers to provide immediate decision and intervention biosensors have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and selective tools for the analysis of sewage biomarkers due to their fast response ease to use low cost and the potential for field testing this paper presents biosensors as effective tools for wastewater analysis of potential biomarkers and monitoring of public health via wbe in particular we discuss the use of sewage sensors for rapid detection of a range of targets including rapid monitoring of community wide illicit drug consumption and pathogens for early warning of infectious diseases outbreaks finally we provide a perspective on the future use of the biosensor technology for wbe to enable rapid on site monitoring of sewage which will provide nearly real time data for public health assessment and effective intervention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biosensors wastewater based epidemiology biomarkers public health infectious diseases 1 introduction public health issues are gaining increasing attention including drug abuse food safety heavy metal and pesticide exposure infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases being able to assess these threats in a timely manner and implement the corresponding countermeasures will have a significant impact on public health human biomonitoring is a powerful tool for public health assessment by analysis of various biomarkers in human specimens however this approach has certain limitations including sampling biases extended time requirements need for complex data elaboration to extrapolate the results to the whole population high costs and ethical issues gracia lor et al 2018 wastewater based epidemiology wbe is an effective biomonitoring tool that is receiving increasing attention due to low cost and near real time response wbe is an emerging emergingemerging technique related to the extraction analysis data processing and interpretation of the targets excreted in faeces urine and wastewater to provide public health information in certain areas wbe has been extensively used in the evaluation of drug abuse zuccato et al 2008 zuccato et al 2005 food safety choi et al 2019 assessment of exposure to poisons such as heavy metals markosian and mirzoyan 2019 and pesticides devault and karolak 2020 and in other public health aspects such as prevention of infectious disease outbreaks bivins et al 2020 murakami et al 2020 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 for example environmental surveillance of poliovirus in wastewater has been performed in finland hovi et al 2011 and israel roberts 2013 to assess the levels of poliovirus circulating within the populations world health organization who has released guidelines for environmental sampling to monitor poliovirus in wastewater sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 in addition antiviral drugs have been detected in wastewater prasse et al 2010 and the consumption of antiviral drug oseltamivir has been evaluated using wbe singer et al 2013 these approaches can be potentially extended for additional applications for public health assessment rapid development of wbe has increased the importance of appropriate analytical tools for accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis of various targets in wastewater choi et al 2018 gracia lor et al 2017 the analytical tools used to evaluate these targets are mainly based on expensive instruments that must be located in a laboratory and operated by professional technicians such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms for the detection of heavy metal ions liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms for the detection of small organic chemicals or their metabolites and polymerase chain reaction pcr for the detection of nucleic acids and genetic information these methods are characterised by high sensitivity selectivity and stability hernández et al 2018 however the requirements for an expensive instrument and restriction of the analysis to a laboratory limit the broad applications of these techniques mao et al 2017 additionally in some cases dynamic changes in pollutants in wastewater have to be measured over time and at different locations therefore traditional laboratory analysis is unable to meet the requirements of on site wastewater monitoring thus limiting the development of wbe ejeian et al 2018 there is a need to develop rapid and portable assays that enable to perform the analysis at the site of sample collection biosensors have recently emerged as effective alternatives that demonstrated potential ability to test sewage in the field hernández et al 2018 biosensors are powerful analytical tools that have received considerable attention due to their excellent characteristics and are becoming increasingly important in healthcare environmental monitoring mao et al 2020b food safety rebe raz et al 2010 and drug discovery mao et al 2020a biosensors are small devices that utilize biochemical reactions mediated by a biological receptor biorecognition element such as nucleic acids antibodies enzymes cells and even microorganisms and usually detect targets based on optical electrical thermal and other signals chen et al 2019 biosensors are characterized by a fast response low cost and potential miniaturization with other portable devices that can be operated by nontechnical personnel to measure target parameters using a small number of samples on site ejeian et al 2018 biosensors have played an important role in quantification of drugs pharmaceuticals biomolecules and microorganisms in wastewater for assessment of drug pharmaceutical consumption in a community and population health furthermore biosensors for analysis of sewage can potentially provide real time data for government agencies to monitor trends in drug consumption and establish an effective early warning system to prevent community based disease outbreaks mao et al 2020c therefore the results obtained by biosensors can reasonably reflect the toxic effects of various pollutants in wastewater this information provides strong technical support for the on line detection of wastewater and the development of an early warning sensing system this paper discussed that wbe based biosensor technology can be used to assess public health summarizes the latest progress in the research field and discusses the feasibility of future applications of the technology in public health initially we briefly introduce wbe as an effective tool for biomonitoring of drug abuse evaluation of population exposure and other aspects and discuss the feasibility of monitoring of numerous pollutants in sewage as wbe biomarkers for public health assessment shown in supporting information then we review various recent progress of biosensors in wastewater analysis and discuss their great potential for the detection of wastewater biomarkers in various areas of public health finally we discuss the possibility and potential of wbe based biosensor technology for expanded use in public health assessment including applications relevant to the covid 19 pandemic 2 biosensors for wastewater analysis of potential biomarkers this section is focused on expanded applications of biosensors for the detection of various pollutants and sewage biomarkers in wastewater that can be potentially used for wbe based public health assessment 2 1 inorganic ions heavy metals are not degradable and are frequently detected in wastewater markosian and mirzoyan 2019 the use of biosensors is becoming a potential choice for the detection of heavy metal ions in wastewater shtenberg et al 2015 a detailed description is provided in table s1 mainly including hg fig 1 a ezhil vilian et al 2017 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2016 tan et al 2016 as fig 1b gu et al 2018 mao et al 2020b song et al 2016 pb fig 1c li et al 2019 cr tsai et al 2003 wu et al 2017 cu fig 1d and several other heavy metal ions khan et al 2020 mao et al 2015 sekhon et al 2017 aptamers are the main recognition elements used in heavy metal analysis in sewage aptamers are highly specific nucleic acid sequences that can recognize heavy metals and detect the corresponding heavy metal ions liu et al 2009 at present the main structures with known affinity to heavy metal ions include t hg t wang et al 2018b c ag c mao et al 2015 and pb g quadruplex yang et al 2013 certain nucleic acid sequences for the detection of some other metal ions can be identified by screening using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment selex technology these sequences can be used as aptamers with high affinity to the target ions zhou et al 2017 for example an aptamer for arsenic is a fragment of a nucleic acid sequence mao et al 2020b previous studies on the analysis of inorganic targets have focused on the detection of heavy metal ions however interest in monitoring of nonmetallic ions is also increasing including a microbial biosensor for sulfide liu et al 2017 a cell biosensor for cyanide virender et al 2018 and a microfluidics device for ammonium levels gallardo gonzalez et al 2019 these biosensors rapidly and reliably provide real time data and demonstrate good robustness and anti interference performance in wastewater generally inorganic ion sensors are rarely used in wastewater analysis due to their limits of detection lod because the target inorganic ions are usually present at a very low concentration in sewage in addition the complex wastewater matrix may lead to serious interference which will affect the accuracy of detection current efforts investigate the use of these biosensors in wastewater analysis however only initial laboratory experiments are being performed and additional verification is required only a few publications are related to these areas although potential application of biosensors for the detection of various inorganic components in wastewater has been preliminarily demonstrated 2 2 organic pollutants and pharmaceuticals various organic pollutants have been detected in wastewater detection of these pollutants has been reported to involve numerous low cost easy and point of use sensors using highly specific chemical binding agents coupled to colorimetric fluorescence or electrochemical biosensing platforms as shown in table 1 and table s2 biosensors are used for the detection of various organic small molecules and sensors for organic molecules in sewage are mainly focused on pesticides pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs since illicit drug sensors are mainly related to drug abuse and consumption the application of drug biomarkers in wbe is discussed in section 3 of this paper and pesticides and pharmaceuticals are mainly discussed in this section various organic pollutants have been detected in industrial and agricultural wastewater rousis et al 2017 table s2 the majority of reported biosensors are pesticide biosensors such as a biosensor shown in fig 2 a rousis et al 2016 2017 biosensors for pesticides mainly target herbicides fan et al 2016 saberi et al 2019 and insecticides kardaş et al 2017 shetti et al 2019 the most frequently reported organic pollutant biosensors target phenolic compounds akbulut et al 2015 mendes et al 2017 sanchez paniagua lopez and lopez ruiz 2018 sekretaryova et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 mainly including bisphenol a allsop et al 2019 lim et al 2018 qi et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zehani et al 2015 catechol liu et al 2019c wee et al 2019 and chlorophenols mendes et al 2017 yashas et al 2019 most of biosensors for phenolic compounds were built based on aptamers seen in fig 2b allsop et al 2019 lim et al 2018 qi et al 2019 and bioactive enzymes mainly laccase and tyrosinase rahimi mohseni et al 2019 sekretaryova et al 2016 additionally biosensors for organophosphorus pesticides bao et al 2017 gothwal et al 2014 kaur et al 2015 montes et al 2018 and some other pesticides such as nereistoxin carbofuran acephate ametryn and thiram have received some attention recently grawe et al 2015 qian et al 2014 takahashi et al 2018 numerous publications described the detection of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in wastewater mainly including antibiotics benzodiazepines antidepressants pharmaceutical opioids asthma medicines and antihistamines choi et al 2018 lai et al 2011 petrie et al 2015 phung et al 2017 thai et al 2016 biosensors for monitoring of pharmaceuticals including drugs antibiotics and antimicrobials in wastewater are listed in table 1 antibiotics are one the major classes of antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of bacterial diseases and are the most frequently detected traditional pharmaceuticals in sewage biosensors are efficient analytical tools for the detection of various antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs in wastewater such as ofloxacin pilehvar et al 2017 ciprofloxacin gayen and chaplin 2016 quinine qiu et al 2018 oxytetracycline fig 2c zhou et al 2019 tetracycline liu et al 2018b malik and iyer 2017 zhou et al 2018 sulfonamide antibiotics zhu et al 2018 quinolone reinemann et al 2016 furazolidone and nitrofurazone wang et al 2018a the main biological receptors of these biosensors are aptamers due to their specificity and stability pilehvar et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 as an example fig 2c shows an unlabelled aptamer biosensor used to determine oxytetracycline levels in wastewater zhou et al 2019 aptamers offer considerable advantages over other biosensors and various aptamers have been synthesised and screened for the detection of a wide range of antibiotics such as quinolones pilehvar et al 2017 reinemann et al 2016 the signal detection strategies of biosensors for antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs mainly include electrochemistry gayen and chaplin 2016 fluorescence wang et al 2018a zhu et al 2018 colorimetry ramos et al 2019 and luminescence liu et al 2018b zhou et al 2018 in addition qiu et al integrated biosensors into portable devices and used a glucose meter for signal detection to improve visibility and provide easy on site use qiu et al 2018 some nanomaterials such as metal organic frameworks mofs fig 2c have been widely used in antibiotic biosensors liu et al 2018b zhu et al 2018 application of these materials improves the analytical performance of the sensors in target detection the presence of conventional drugs such as anticancer anti inflammatory antidiabetic drugs and bronchodilator fig 2d in wastewater in addition to antibiotics is also a matter of increasing concern choi et al 2018 biosensors have been developed to measure the levels of these pharmaceuticals in wastewater including nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac schirmer et al 2019 and antidiabetic drug metformin machini et al 2019 cell biosensors fang et al 2019 pham et al 2015 and dna biosensors congur et al 2015 machini et al 2019 prado et al 2017 are the two main types of conventional pharmaceutical biosensors for example ezgi et al bayram and akyilmaz 2016 developed a new microbial sensor based on a polyaniline carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt complex and bacillus subtilis for the electrochemical determination of paracetamol levels this biosensor is characterised by rapid detection time and excellent overall performance compared with other biosensors used for paracetamol detection 2 3 biomolecules wastewater represents an ideal milieu for epidemiological studies of biomolecules because it contains a wide range of biomolecules such as specific human nucleic acids peptides proteins and antimicrobial resistance markers bartsch et al 2016 costán longares et al 2008 dolejska et al 2011 goñi urriza et al 2000 montazeri et al 2015 rodriguez manzano et al 2009 shannon et al 2007 yang et al 2015b currently an increasing number of biosensors are being used to detect these biomolecules in wastewater 2 3 1 human nucleic acids although dna has not been compared with other population marker criteria scientists have started to detect and quantify the levels of dna in wastewater nearly in real time using dna specific biosensors guo et al 2018 yang et al 2015a yang et al described the use of an electrochemical biosensor with a ferrocenyl dsdna intercalator as a redox marker to monitor human specific mitochondrial dna mtdna in wastewater yang et al 2015a the results confirmed the possibility of the analysis of human dna in wastewater using designed biosensors to improve the portability and user friendliness a rapid visual platform was used for quantitative monitoring of mtdna in community wastewater fig 3 a based on loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp with a minimal level of user intervention within 45 minutes yang et al 2017 2 3 2 peptides and proteins recently peptides and proteins have attracted increasing attention as human biomarkers in wbe prostate specific antigen psa is a marker widely used to diagnose prostate cancer and numerous studies focused on the development of a rapid sensing based assay yang et al initially constructed novel dna directed immobilization based aptamer biosensors for psa assay yang et al 2015c then for ease of use and portability this electrochemical biosensor was improved to yield a paper device modified using graphene nanocomposites and aptamers wei et al 2018 the paper device was developed using wax printing to generate hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers that formed a microfluidic channel and three electrodes were subsequently screen printed as shown in fig 3b synthetic nanocomposites were used for aptamer immobilization on working electrodes to enhance the sensitivity of the detection of psa a practical sample test indicated that the biosensor can potentially become a sensitive and cost effective diagnostic platform for prostate cancer through wbe 2 3 3 antibiotic resistance genes args antimicrobial resistance poses a substantial risk to human health o neill and humphreys 2005 resistant microorganisms and their args are frequently present in wastewater which makes args the most extensively investigated contaminants in wastewater berendonk et al 2015 michael et al 2013 moura et al 2010 rizzo et al 2013 szczepanowski et al 2009 varela and manaia 2013 biosensors have also been applied to arg analysis fig 3d describes a stable oligonucleotide functionalized gold nanosensor for monitoring of meca arg riquelme et al 2017 in practical wastewater analysis the meca specific nanosensor was stabile under environmental conditions and at high ionic strength and demonstrated high selectivity in the presence of target interference this contribution supported the environmental applicability of a novel low cost and field deployable tool for wide scale arg analyses in summary various biosensors including optical and electrochemical sensors have been used in wastewater analysis in general colorimetric and fluorescent sensors have poorer lods than electrochemical sensors although surface enhanced raman scattering spectroscopy sers has a high sensitivity it lacks stability which limits its application in practical wastewater analysis colorimetric and fluorescence sensors are based on optical detection and are easily disrupted by coloured or turbid samples additionally fluorescent sensor aptamers need to be labelled which increases their complexity and cost electrochemical aptasensor performance appears to be more reliable in wastewater matrices these sensors have the lowest lods and can be reused in some cases after regeneration of the electrode surface for example if an aptamer is directly immobilized onto the electrode surface the chip can be reused after binding the target by inducing careful dissociation of the target because recognition of the molecules is based on a conformational change the process is reversible however electrochemical detection often involves immobilization of aptamers onto electrodes which can cause a reduction in or complete loss of the binding affinity of an aptamer rendering the sensor ineffective although optical and electrochemical sensors are the two main types of sensors some other sensors such as piezoelectric nanomechanical and mass sensitive sensors have been reported mao et al 2019b yang et al 2015b biological receptor is another main element of a biosensor that has a critical influence on the selectivity and lod currently recognition elements mainly include aptamers antibodies enzymes and microorganisms the advantages and disadvantages of various components have been reported in previous publications aragay et al 2011 fu et al 2017 liu et al 2009 schirhagl 2014 in general sensors assembled from these recognition elements demonstrate good potential in the laboratory however most of the currently available biosensors require significant improvements in sensitivity selectivity functionality and other characteristics before they can be applied for commercial use in wastewater thus introduction of effective biological receptors such as whole microorganisms or biomolecules can improve applicability of biosensors for the detection of the analytes particularly in complex wastewater samples considering increasing complexity and diversification of sewage pollutants development of additional biological receptors requires high specificity and affinity to detect as many targets as possible 3 biosensors for monitoring public health via wbe this section discusses the available wbe based biosensor technologies for public health assessment mainly including the analysis of drug biomarkers population markers and health markers using biosensors and the potential use of wbe based biosensors for surveillance and early warning in infectious disease outbreaks details on potential biomarkers are presented in table 2 3 1 evaluation of community wide drug consumption drug abuse is a global problem that is difficult to monitor and evaluate because of its illegality wbe is the widely used method of drug analysis and evaluation of drug consumption and abuse numerous drug biosensors have been described kumar et al 2018 mokhtarzadeh et al 2015 however only a few reports described the use of biosensors for the analysis of drugs in wastewater in this section we introduce several biosensors for drugs in wastewater in 2016 yang et al reported a novel electrochemical aptamer sensor for the assessment of community cocaine consumption through wbe fig 4 a yang et al 2016 the biosensor was used to detect and evaluate the cocaine concentration in wastewater from a city in south western england for one week higher concentrations were measured on the weekend than on workdays thus the biosensor was useful for rapid on site assessment of a drug use trend in the area a cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine can be detected in urine based wastewater by a microbial fuel cell biosensor catal et al 2019 which can be potentially used to monitor the levels of cocaine metabolites in wastewater usually various illicit drugs methamphetamine cocaine and others are widely distributed and transported in wastewater therefore a rapid duplexed colorimetric detection method for the detection of illicit drugs in wastewater was based on aptamers and noble metal nanoparticles mao et al 2019a synthesized au ag nanoparticles were functionalized with dna reporter probes for methamphetamine and cocaine respectively fig 4b two capture probes for methamphetamine and cocaine were attached to magnetic beads higher affinity of an illicit drug to aptamer than that of a reporter probe and aptamer induced disassembly of the sandwich structure in the presence of illicit drugs resulting in colour changes the designed biosensor was able to analyse both methamphetamine and cocaine at a trace level within a wide dynamic range confirming the potential application of wbe to evaluate drug consumption mao et al 2021 3 2 population markers use wbe for quantitative or per capita evaluation of environmental factors or other health related information about the exposure requires an estimate of the population size of the target area in contrast to the usual methods for the estimation of the size of a population contributing to each sample based on the de facto population size castiglioni et al 2013 o brien et al 2014 the levels of certain molecules in wastewater including endocrine substances nucleic acid biomarkers peptides and proteins can be used as alternative markers biomarkers of the population level these molecules should possess the following characteristics 1 ease of measurement 2 a sewer mass load related to population size 3 negligible degradation and 4 a short mean residence time in the sewer network o brien et al 2017 therefore the fabrication of the tools for rapid and effective analytical methods for the detection of these human population markers is important and scientists are committed to using the advantages of biosensors to detect these biomarkers in this section we discuss biosensors used to detect human population markers in wastewater 3 2 1 endocrine substances ideal markers of the human population level include endogenous substances specific to human metabolism and characterised by homogenous excretion throughout the community and low variance been et al 2014 liu et al 2013 thai et al 2014 biosensors have been used to detect these target substances such as an electrochemical biosensor for the determination of dopamine levels yuan et al 2018 total oestrogens are ubiquitous endocrine substances that have been detected by sers based biosensors in wastewater liu et al 2019b assays of single oestrogen substances based on biosensors have also been reported fig 4c for example the analysis of 17 β oestradiol may involve the biological receptors of biosensors including protein liu et al 2019a and aptamer rather et al 2018 and fluorescent lee et al 2017 or electrochemical rather et al 2018 biosensor signals rather et al fabricated a femtosensitive aptasensor based on graphene amplified strategy for electrochemical analysis of 17β oestradiol rather et al 2018 3 2 2 exogenous markers excretion of exogenous biomarkers such as carbamazepine gabapentin and ibuprofen is consistent through different populations and can be used as a population marker o brien et al 2017 biosensors have been applied to detect these exogenous compounds in wastewater ramos et al developed an automated method for the detection of carbamazepine ramos et al 2019 a miniaturized and automated portable device based on an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa rapidly detects carbamazepine in sewage the proposed method combines the advantages of micro bead injection spectroscopy and a flow based lab on valve platform for automatic immunosorbent renewal providing a new recognition surface for each sample in addition pharmaceuticals have been reported as markers of population size lai et al 2011 o brien et al 2014 rico et al 2017 detailed discussion of the analysis of various pharmaceuticals using biosensors is provided in section 2 3 3 health markers the monitoring and evaluation of public health is an important component of regional health programs designed to map the current level of health in certain areas and thus help to improve human health wbe can provide a potentially reliable and rapid evaluation of the overall population health through determination of health markers in addition to analysis of pathogens biomarkers are also used to analyse general public health indicators such as obesity high blood pressure and diabetes yang et al 2015b according to a recent report the obesity level can be predicted by wastewater analysis newton et al 2015 a number of biosensors have been used to develop efficient analytical methods for the detection of health biomarkers pathogen and disease biomarkers in wastewater fig 4d ejeian et al 2018 yang et al reported an efficient point of care platform for the detection of genetic biomarkers within communities based on wastewater analysis yang et al 2017 therefore certain community sensors can be fabricated and used to evaluate the wastewater profiles and patterns of factors related to health and disease within populations within the framework of wbe additionally biosensors can be miniaturized to fit a portable device for on site analyses which may facilitate diagnostics of infectious disease in developing countries with extremely high occurrence of certain diseases e g tuberculosis mcnerney and daley 2011 and malaria xu et al 2016 these biosensors have potential applications in wastewater analysis as sewage sensors to evaluate urinary and faecal pathogens monitor public health based on wbe and collect the data and information for epidemiological and socioeconomic studies community sewage sensors are widely used to monitor various disease pathogens in a single assay the use of these sensors may have considerable economic and social impacts particularly in the areas with limited resources for example yang et al developed a rapid diagnostic platform for multiple infectious diseases utilizing a paper device yang et al 2018 moreover biosensor platforms can collect information about community wide health to implement effective interventions by health agencies and early prevention measures although the selectivity and long term stability of community sensors and the environmental susceptibility to deterioration of the biorecognition elements are the problems that are yet to be solved we suggest that efficient monitoring of health in communities will be possible in the future 3 4 biosensors for testing sewage for early warning of infectious disease outbreaks infectious disease outbreaks have become one of the main threats to public health for example the current covid 19 pandemic caused by sars cov 2 has led to a global disaster mao et al 2020d wbe is a powerful tool with huge potential for the surveillance and early warning of infectious disease outbreaks and transmission orive et al 2020 the characteristics of infectious diseases in the associated area or community can be monitored by the analysis of infectious disease biomarkers in wastewater samples from wwtp influents and community wastewater seen in fig 5 wastewater provides growth conditions for various microorganisms these microorganisms are frequently detected in wastewater produced from domestic activities and the food industry and are characterized by substantial changes in organic composition the levels of pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms vary depending on their sources a wide range of aquatic microbial diseases cause significant mortality and morbidity worldwide moreover the detection of microorganisms in wastewater is important for the elimination and control of their harmful pathogenic effects in the current wastewater treatment process microorganisms are difficult to completely remove from wastewater and are resistant to disinfectants due to their small size and chemical properties rapid and sensitive analytical tools are required to detect microorganisms these tools can assist with the investigations of the outbreaks and development of prevention strategies generally for infectious diseases information about a pathogen and host response is very important reddy et al 2018 pathogens may include viruses and bacteria that cause serious infections the determination of the pathogens in wastewater influent through wbe can be used to trace the pathogen source in the case of the covid 19 pandemic mao et al tried to use wbe to analyse sars cov 2 in urban sewage to identify potential virus carriers and provide early warning of covid 19 outbreaks mao et al 2020d important host response information in infectious diseases includes inflammatory processes and immune functions for example urinary protein and genetic information related to the diseases has been analysed in wastewater and these parameters can be potential disease biomarkers for wbe mao et al 2020d information about pathogens and host responses obtained in wastewater can be evaluated by wbe which will provide new insight for public health of a community and may have important implications for potential infectious diseases however the complexity of the wastewater matrix makes it challenging to perform the analysis of pathogenic and host response information available techniques for microorganism assays include culture based methods elisa and pcr altintas et al 2015 these methods can be categorized into two mechanisms of microorganism detection one of the mechanisms involves specific recognition of an element such as bacterial aptamers antibodies host guest relationships between bacteriophages and modification with chemical groups in this section we provide several examples of recognition of the elements abbaspour et al developed an aptamer modified silver nanoparticle for the electrochemical dual aptamer based sandwich detection of staphylococcus aureus which causes numerous diseases abbaspour et al 2015 ertürk et al used bacteriophages as a recognition element in capacitive biosensors for a phage and host bacteria assay ertürk and lood 2018 the sensing mechanism depends on the binding of the target phage to specific cavities on the surface of an electrode leading to a change in capacitance this method provides a simple and rapid onsite measurement of the levels of a bacteriophage and its host bacteria modification with chemical groups has also been reported as a biological receptor for microorganism detection rengaraj et al developed an impedimetric paper based biosensor by screen printing carbon electrodes onto hydrophobic paper for determination of bacteria in contaminated water rengaraj et al 2018 due to its cost efficiency simplicity and biodegradability this biosensor can be used as a portable test kit that overcomes the limitations of traditional expensive and time consuming laboratory based analyses biosensing techniques using smart affinity materials and nanomaterials can be used to measure microorganisms present in wastewater for example the levels of the ms2 phage in a water supply affected by wastewater can be determined prieto simón et al prieto simón et al 2015 developed an immunosensor that fixes a captured antibody on diazonium salt electrografted swcnts through chemical assembly or magnetic capture orientation the sensitivity of immunosensor was sufficient to determine the presence of ms2 at the level often encountered in the environment affected by wastewater which is an important step in application of this biosensor for environmental analyses subsequently reta et al reta et al 2016 designed an unmarked ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor based on a nanoporous silicon membrane for detection of the ms2 phage this study was the first to report a biosensor based on a nanoporous silicon membrane that uses the blocking effect of a nanochannel to transduce analyte binding another method for the measurement of microorganisms involves the detection of specific nucleic acid sequences of a microorganism because each microorganism possesses a species specific nucleic acid sequence nucleic acid testing is widely employed for environmental monitoring and disease diagnosis to confirm the presence of certain pathogens or microorganisms the main method for pathogen nucleic acid analysis is nucleic acid based pcr however various pcr inhibitors are present in wastewater and may affect subsequent pcr analysis in addition when dna rna is extracted from the pcr inhibitor rich samples various commercial extraction kits sometimes show variable efficiency and consistency mao et al 2020d this variability challenges meaningful comparisons across the studies and determination of spatiotemporal trends in the pathogens to solve this problem progress in the methods of molecular biology has provided new technologies for the analysis of genetic material including digital pcr dpcr and next generation sequencing in dpcr the absolute quantification of the target genes is determined using poisson distribution statistics via the partitioning of dna rna samples into tens and thousands of reaction wells sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 this distribution diminishes the effects of pcr inhibitors in wastewater on the results of dpcr racki et al 2014 next generation sequencing is another promising technology that provides substantial information about the complex microbial communities in the samples to enable identification of various pathogens petrie et al 2016 however the ultimate goal of wbe is to achieve on site monitoring and provide real time data which is required to provide timely early warning of infectious disease outbreaks analytical tools have to be simple rapid cost effective sensitive selective and multiplexed the latest developments in nucleic acid based sensor methods enable field measurements thus a system can provide real time information about infectious diseases and public health since the nucleic acid concentration in the samples is typically very low the amplification protocol is very important for the subsequent detection process currently nucleic acid testing mainly involves nucleic acid extraction amplification and determination that require large instruments and trained personnel thus these tests are costly time consuming and inappropriate for point of care analysis ajonina et al developed a lamp based biosensor for entamoeba histolytica and toxoplasma gondii in wastewater ajonina et al 2018 lamp is a rapid and stable nucleic acid detection method with ideal characteristics for point of care testing because it does not require thermal cycling similar to pcr lin et al modified the lamp technique and developed a digital lamp method on a commercial membrane that does not require complex fabrication or specialized equipment lin et al 2019 to facilitate the detection and improve portability nucleic acid amplification techniques are successfully integrated into portable devices such as mobile phones and paper devices huang et al fabricated a smartphone based in gel lamp system that enabled rapid quantification of the ms2 coliphage in wastewater samples huang et al 2018 the results of in gel lamp were highly tolerant to the inhibitors naturally present in wastewater in contrast rt qpcr was completely inhibited simplicity speed sensitivity and versatility of the in gel lamp approach indicate its great potential for microbial wastewater quality analysis particularly in low income areas development of paper based microfluidic techniques resulted in recent fabrication of a variety of paper devices for nucleic acid testing fig 3c shows a paper origami device based on nucleic acid amplification for the point of care colorimetric identification of live cells trieu and lee 2019 however these analytical methods using paper devices require off chip reagent storage complex operation steps and equipment dependent nucleic acid amplification restricting their use in point of care testing tang et al developed a completely disposable and integrated sample in answer out device for nucleic acid testing by integrating various processes for naked eye detection into a paper device to overcome these limitations tang et al 2017 this simple device allowed on chip dried reagent storage and equipment free nucleic acid amplification with simple operation steps and could be used by untrained people mao et al have recently proposed to trace covid 19 sources through sewage analysis using an efficient and inexpensive paper based biosensor mao et al 2020c since paper based sensors can measure the genetic material in wastewater a paper sensor is a small analytical device with various functional areas that integrates all processes extraction enrichment purification elution amplification and visual detection required for nucleic acid testing into an inexpensive paper material the whole testing process can be completed by simple folding of a paper based device in various steps without a pump or power supply overall the research in this area is highly demanding unfortunately only several research groups have performed related studies yang et al 2015b this lack of effective analytical tools is an important challenge for the wide application of wbe to provide early warning of infectious diseases and more efficient biosensors must be developed to acquire enough information about infectious diseases from wastewater 4 conclusion and perspectives a variety of pollutants widely distributed in wastewater can efficiently provide information that reflects drug consumption chemical exposure food safety and public health using wbe as discussed in this review biosensors represent a reliable alternative for tracking environmental pollutants by detection of various targets simplicity and reliability of detection of various contaminants by biosensors resulted in the development of an increasing number of biosensor based methods we have reviewed biosensors with various biological receptors such as aptamers and antibodies and various signal strategies such as optical and electrochemical signals which have been used to detect various targets in wastewater furthermore interdisciplinary collaborations between analytical scientists and researchers in other areas e g engineering have provided some good examples of miniaturized and portable biosensors furthermore these devices can analyse the targets on site critical interdisciplinary success has been reported in this area including the development of paper device based and personal glucose meter based biosensors although biosensors have broad application prospects in wastewater analysis their application remains a few challenges re first the prediction of the physical and chemical properties of various components of wastewater at various time points and conditions is difficult the complex matrix of wastewater may affect the prediction of various parameters in a sample and interfere with the detection of the required target because this dynamic matrix precludes the inclusion of an adequate blank secondly a new biosensor system with an expanded detection range and the ability to simultaneously detect many components is necessary to detect all types of contaminants in wastewater thirdly the stability of fixed biological elements such as enzymes cells antibodies tissues etc during shipment storage and operating conditions is another major consideration fourth this modern technology must also be evaluated by comparison with common analytical methods used to monitor wastewater moreover quantitative and qualitative analytic guidelines must be established and standardized thus certain technical and practical limitations and complexities are associated with this method in the future we should overcome these limitations to construct more effective biosensors for various applications in addition application of wbe has enormous potential for the analysis and monitoring of the pathogens and pollution health at the community level wastewater is a complex matrix therefore careful consideration of the microbes present in wastewater and certain standardization of analytical methods will form the basis for future studies and evaluation of wastewater as a tool for monitoring the microbial health and antimicrobial resistance scientists are trying to solve these problems and technical limitations for example two major strategies are being developed to overcome the main obstacles caused by the use of biomolecules as the recognition elements to ensure high sensitivity of biosensors and improve their stability during long term storage these strategies include i the production of recombinant target specific fragments and definition of the fixed characteristics of antibodies and enzymes to promote the development of tools to quickly and cost effectively analyse the levels of organic pollutants in wastewater in in situ screening and ii the use of a combination of nanomaterials and nanotechnology to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of biosensors miniaturization and introduction of multiplexed sensor array devices to improve the detection efficiency current progress in nanotechnology can be used to increase the detection performance of biosensors wastewater biosensors will become an innovative approach for the simple and rapid monitoring of various targets in wastewater even to the extent of field detection these devices will provide strong technical support for the wide application of wbe in assessments of environmental pollution drug abuse trends and public health and in surveillance and early warning of infectious disease outbreaks in the future biosensors for various biomarkers in wastewater must be sufficiently sensitive and selective to overcome the commercialization challenges by demonstrating stability reproducibility robustness ease of use portability and low cost thus we have proposed that sewage sensors can achieve the ultimate goal of on site monitoring and providing real time data within the framework of wbe we believe that sewage sensors can be widely and rapidly applied in the near future to obtain high volume of information related to public health including surveillance and early warning of infectious disease outbreaks pathogen sources tracking drug consumption toxic substance

17203,ammonium is an undesirable substance in the abstracted water of riverbank filtration rbf schemes due mainly to the complications it causes during post treatment based on the investigation of case studies from 40 sites around the world an overview of the sources and behavior of ammonium during rbf is given typical concentrations of ammonium in the bank filtrate bf are between 0 1 and 1 7 mg l the most common source of ammonium in bf is the mineralization of organic nitrogen occurring in the riverbed while the most common sink of ammonium is nitrification in the riverbed ammonium surface water concentrations do not directly translate to abstracted concentrations transformations in the riverbed play a critical role in determining ammonium concentrations whereby riverbeds with high amounts of organic material will have more electron donor competitors for oxygen thus limiting ammonium attenuation via nitrification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords riverbank filtration ammonium water quality well management hyporheic zone nitrate abbreviations anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation aw abstracted water bf bank filtrate dnra dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium do dissolved oxygen doc dissolved organic carbon don dissolved organic nitrogen gw groundwater rbf riverbank filtration poc particulate organic carbon pon particulate organic nitrogen sw surface water sir subsurface iron removal 1 introduction riverbank filtration rbf is a well established water treatment process in which surface water is subjected to subsurface flow prior to extraction attenuation of river water contaminants is expected to occur during subsurface flow through filtration biodegradation sorption and redox reactions however as a result of changing redox conditions undesirable effects of bank filtration on water quality can also occur including increases in hardness dissolved manganese and iron concentrations and the formation of hydrogen sulfide hiscock and grischek 2002 since nitrogen has a wide range of oxidation states 3 0 1 3 and 5 changing redox conditions can also change nitrogen speciation and thus play a significant role in attenuation and transformation of inorganic nitrogen in water environments at rbf sites across the world bank filtrate bf might be contaminated by ammonium doussan et al 1998 groeschke et al 2017 vet et al 2010 nitrate dragon et al 2018 nagy kovács et al 2019 pan et al 2018 and in some rare cases nitrite groeschke et al 2017 the major health concern regarding nitrate and nitrite is methemoglobinemia a blood disorder in which too little oxygen is delivered to cells the world health organization has set the recommended limits of 50 mg l for nitrate and to 3 mg l for nitrite who 2011 ammonium is not toxic for humans therefore the who has not set any limits for drinking water however it is a problematic compound during post treatment where for example it can compromise chlorination efficiency and cause failure of filters in the removal of manganese who 2011 furthermore 1 mg l of ammonium in water leads to the consumption of around 3 6 mg l of dissolved oxygen do thus the presence of ammonium may cause anoxic conditions in the distribution system which has further implications for water taste the recommended limit for ammonium in germany according to the drinking water regulations is 0 5 mg l trinkwasserverordnung 2001 consumption of oxygen by ammonium during rbf leads to stronger reducing conditions in the aquifer which can in turn have negative consequences such as the release of manganese and iron from the aquifer sediments thus requiring additional post treatment of abstracted raw water the cost efficient operation of an rbf system is therefore affected by the concentration and behavior of nitrogen species particularly ammonium 2 sources of ammonium ammonium present in surface and groundwater can have both natural and anthropogenic sources ammonium from natural sources mostly originates from the mineralization eq 1 table 1 of organic matter by which organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium by microorganisms natural sources such as peat can in some cases be responsible for ammonium concentrations above 10 mg l in aquifers du et al 2020 hinkle et al 2007 mastrocicco et al 2013 anthropogenic sources of ammonium include fertilizers livestock manure leachate from landfills and septic tanks and industrial and domestic wastewater ammonium can also be formed from nitrate under reducing conditions by a process called dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium or dnra eq 2 nitrate originates in water through anthropogenic sources such as fertilizers but also through nitrification of ammonium which occurs under oxidizing conditions under reducing conditions besides the dnra process denitrification eq 3 occurs which is usually the dominant process for nitrate removal korom 1992 rivett et al 2008 usually organic matter serves as electron donor for denitrification and dnra heterotrophic process however there can be other electron donors chemoautotrophic process such as fe ii h2s and fes2 burgin and hamilton 2007 couturier et al 2017 one difference concerning dnra and denitrification is that in denitrification nitrogen is lost to the system in the form of diatomic nitrogen or nitrogen oxide gases dnra was once assumed to be a marginal process regarding nitrate transformation however many recent studies show that dnra can play an important role with rates equivalent to denitrification in different types of aquatic habitats such as estuaries an and gardner 2002 bernard et al 2015 domangue and mortazavi 2018 dong et al 2011 paddy soils pandey et al 2019 yin et al 2002 forest soils bengtsson and bergwall 2000 rütting et al 2008 and lake sediments brunet and garcia gil 1996 palacin lizarbe et al 2019 pang and ji 2019 robertson and thamdrup 2017 less research has been done on freshwater stream sediments and groundwater nevertheless a few authors describe cases where dnra outcompeted denitrification in these environments such as in the sediments of a river in ireland kelso et al 1997 and in the groundwater of an alluvial aquifer in serbia perović et al 2017 storey et al 2004 did column experiments with sediments from the hyporheic zone of a small stream in canada and found that dnra outcompeted denitrification in nitrate removal they recorded increases of up to 0 6 mg l of ammonium of which around 40 of it was attributed to dnra and the rest to mineralization the exact factors influencing portioning between dnra and denitrification are still not fully understood but it is hypothesized that a high c n ratio as well as the presence of labile carbon reducedsulfur and reduced iron are positively correlated with higher dnra rates burgin and hamilton 2007 tiedje 1982 attenuation of ammonium can happen in many ways buss et al 2004 the most common process is nitrification eq 4 5 in which ammonium is oxidized by microorganisms to form nitrate with nitrite as an intermediate product anaerobic ammonium degradation can also occur in which substances other than oxygen serve as electron acceptors for ammonium such as iron iii hydroxide feammox eq 6 or nitrite anammox eq 7 during anammox ammonium is combined with nitrite producing nitrogen gas and thus contributing to permanent nitrogen removal from the system this process is known to play an important role in anoxic wastewater oxygen depleted zones of the ocean temperate shelf sediments sea ice arctic shelf sediments burgin and hamilton 2007 and highly contaminated aquifers wang et al 2020 there is ample evidence of anammox occurring in freshwater streams akbarzadeh et al 2018 kim et al 2016 shelley et al 2017 but to a much lesser extent compared to denitrification and rarely being recognized as an important ammonium sink few rbf studies even considered the possibility of anammox and its role during rbf therefore remains unclear anammox requires both nitrate and ammonium in the water to occur and it is strongly inhibited by the presence of oxygen dalsgaard et al 2005 postulated that anammox bacteria grow slowly and thus the process is probably only significant in stable environments where there is a prolonged time for the bacterial population to develop while denitrifiers have much higher growth rates which gives them a competitive advantage over anammox bacteria in fluctuating environments riverbeds are heterogeneous environments where redox conditions can spatially oscillate thus likely do not offer such stable conditions it is also assumed that environments with higher electron donor availability e g organic matter which is the case for organic rich bed sediments create a higher demand for electron acceptors such as nitrate and nitrite limiting oxidation of ammonium by nitrite dalsgaard et al 2005 furthermore anammox is hypothesized to be inhibited by many organic compounds including pyruvate ethanol and glucose jetten et al 1998 which are often present in freshwater sediments that support high biological productivity which may limit its occurrence in such environments burgin and hamilton 2007 ammonium can be immobilized by microorganisms during decomposition of organic residues in a process called assimilation or immobilization haynes 1986 assimilation of inorganic nitrogen normally plays a secondary role in the amounts of attenuated nitrogen in addition bacteria die off releases nitrogen back into the system rivett et al 2008 table 1 presents the major reactions considered relevant to the behavior of ammonium in aquatic environments the reactions presented are in most cases simplifications or generalizations of the processes they describe ammonium in water is also present in its non ionized form ammonia at higher temperatures and higher ph values ammonia can be volatized and thus lost to the system ammonia volatilization follows henry s law therefore it depends on the temperature and proportions of ammonia in the aqueous solution freney et al 1983 the proportion of ammonium and ammonia in an aqueous solution depends mostly on ph and temperature where the proportion of ammonia increases with both ph and temperature however even at relatively high ph values e g ph 8 and temperatures e g 30 c ammonia concentrations are below 10 of total ammonium ammonia in the solution emerson et al 1975 most studies do not consider ammonia volatilization as a relevant ammonium sink in water environments desimone and howes 1998 found it to have a very low 0 5 contribution to ammonium sink at ph 7 2 li et al 2012 found ammonia losses from volatilization to be considerable only at ph greater than 8 5 at a temperature of 23 c during laboratory experiments at most rbf sites the ph of surface water ranges from ph 7 6 to ph 8 1 and abstracted water ranges from ph 7 1 to ph 7 5 table a1 the temperature in surface water at rbf sites presented in the review made by paufler and grischek 2018 mostly fell in the range from 12 to 27 c with a mean of 15 5 c therefore ammonia volatilization does not play a significant role in the large majority of rbf sites the processes of nitrification denitrification anammox dnra mineralization and assimilation are all biochemical processes driven by a number of microorganisms therefore the rate of each process also depends on the local microbial community environmental conditions such as redox potential dissolved organic carbon doc concentration ph and temperature control these processes and thus also control nitrogen speciation rivett et al 2008 ammonium can also be attenuated by sorption sorption of ammonium is primarily caused by cation exchange since ammonium is positively charged it can be held by negatively charged sediment surfaces this does not remove ammonium from the system considering no other process occurs leading only to retardation of ammonium breakthrough the strength by which cations bond to a sediment surface is determined by their selectivity coefficients although selectivity varies by the adsorbent and ph matthess 1973 the following order has been offered in order of decreasing affinity for cation exchange sites al3 ca2 mg2 nh4 k h na domenico and schwartz 1998 sorption of ammonium does not always occur by an exchange mechanism ammonium can for example be fixated within clay lattices such as illite and other 2 1 type clay minerals which can be an irreversible process because the ammonium ion fits into the intra layer clay lattice buss et al 2004 a summary of the possible transformations of nitrogen in aquatic systems is shown in fig 1 3 strategies to determine ammonium source and behavior measuring ammonium concentrations alone is often not enough to determine ammonium sources and occurring reactions to that end there are several complemental strategies which can be used including the use of 15n isotopes assessing the microbiological community and numericalmodeling different sources of ammonium may display different isotopic footprints therefore it is possible to speculate the nitrogen source from isotopic measurements several studies have inferred the ammonium source with this strategy gooddy et al 2014 hinkle et al 2007 lingle et al 2017 scheiber et al 2016 however ammonium isotopic footprints of different sources e g animal manure industrial effluents domestic sewage and buried organic matter are largely overlapping xuan et al 2020 thus making it hard to pinpoint the source hence other substances had to be utilized in conjecture with isotopic concentrations such as tritium boron chloride etc inferring ammonium sources exclusively based on isotopic concentrations yields questionable results different techniques are used to trace nitrogen reactions by means of isotopic measurements the isotope paring technique ipt has been developed by nielsen 1992 to quantify nitrification and denitrification rates in intact sediment cores spiked with 15n labelled nitrate the technique was modified by christensen et al 2000 to include dnra rates and later by risgaard petersen et al 2003 and thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 using slurry incubations to assess anammox rates the ipt and its variants techniques have been widely used and mainly applied in estuarine sediments an and gardner 2002 domangue and mortazavi 2018 dong et al 2011 mccarthy et al 2008 but also in sediments from constructed wetlands rahman et al 2019 lakes pang and ji 2019 and riparian zones revsbech et al 2005 reinhardt et al 2006 used a isotope mass balance approach based on natural isotopic concentrations to quantify mineralization nitrification and denitrification in undisturbed sediment cores from a constructed wetland in switzerland laboratory techniques are mostly used because they allow for the use of labelled 15n substrates e g nitrate while onsite analyses rely on sufficiently different isotopic footprints from the different nitrogen species in order to be successful and therefore are less frequently used techniques such as the ones described have potential to improve understanding of nitrogen pathways during riverbed passage at rbf sites but at moment of writing labelled 15n substrates have not yet been applied in an rbf context biochemical reactions can lead to isotopic fractionations usually lighter isotopes are favored thus leading to a 15n depleted product and 15n enriched substrate denitrification for example leads to a depletion of 15n in the formed nitrogen gas and enrichment of 15n in the remaining nitrate mariotti 1981 assumptions regarding fractionation based on onsite isotopic measurements have been used to trace occurring ammonium reactions ding et al 2015 norrman et al 2015 however a few processes such as mineralization hinkle et al 2007 and sorption böhlke et al 2006 have been shown to present little to no isotopic fractionation furthermore not knowing the initial isotopic concentration of the substrate can cloud the judgement and lead to precipitate conclusions 15n isotopes have been used at rbf sites to follow denitrification rates buzek et al 2012 fukada et al 2003 but have not been used to trace ammonium reactions numerical models have also been applied to predict ammonium behavior in different aquatic environments also during bank filtration such models generally include three components a flow model e g modflow 2005 code harbaugh 2005 a non reactive transport model e g mt3dms code zheng and wang 1999 and a reactive model e g phreeqcv3 code parkhurst and appelo 2013 reactive models are facing limitations in current understanding of some biogeochemical processes and reaction kinetics thus cannot be expected to cover every single reaction occurring during bank filtration furthermore simulation of processes during rbf using numerical models is difficult due to spatial and temporal heterogeneities of the system to deal with it these models typically use a single representative flow path and discount seasonal annual variations in travel time portion of bank filtrate temperature and ammonium input groeschke et al 2017 jacobs et al 1988 lee et al 2020 a few studies at rbf sites have chosen to use only flow and non reactive models doussan et al 1998 groeschke et al 2017 focusing on the movement of the ammonium plume trough the aquifer and the effects of cation exchange mechanisms this approach is representative of anoxic conditions in the aquifer regarding ammonium but does not accurately describe riverbed infiltration recently isotopic values have been integrated to reactive model codes parkhurst and appelo 2013 rodríguez escales et al 2014 seibert et al 2019 coupling numerical models and stable isotopes can improve the model boundary conditions constrain model parameterization and elucidate shortcomings in the model structure jensen et al 2018 nonetheless this technique is yet to be used to trace ammonium reactions the microbial community in riverbed and riparian sediments is influenced by the sediments redox conditions and nitrogen species availability and in turn also influences the nitrogen reaction rates and products liu et al 2017 hence nitrogen pathways can be projected based on the microbial community in the sediments this is done by quantifying the functional genes responsible for different reactions such as nitrification amoa denitrification nirs nirk nosz anammox hdh and dnra nrfa in the microbial population kim et al 2016 liu et al 2017 palacin lizarbe et al 2019 stoliker et al 2016 wang et al 2019 although this strategy does not allow for determination of exact reaction rates it does permit qualitative assessments to occurring reactions liu et al 2017 indicate that the microbial community function potential is stable through daily variations but may adapt after a period of only six days of changed conditions therefore assessments based on microbial communities will reflect only the recent hyporheic exchange history riverbeds and riparian sediments are usually subject to changing conditions of redox state and nitrogen availability causes include river stage fluctuations seasonal effects sediment erosion and deposition conditions also change drastically in the initial phase of rbf this needs to be taken into account in the planning of sampling and interpretation of results from this approach there is no single strategy which can determine nitrogen reaction rates exactly but the above described approaches are valuable ways to assess nitrogen pathways which can be used to make practical aquifer management decisions the future of nitrogen pathways determination lies on combining these approaches which have been for long investigated independently permutations of these strategies include incorporating isotopes to reactive models as mentioned above rodríguez escales et al 2014 seibert et al 2019 correlating isotopic measurements to microbial populations palacin lizarbe et al 2019 and quantifying functional genes of microbial populations in 15n tracing experiments wang et al 2019 although these strategies have been widely applied in different freshwater environments such as lake riparian and hyporheic sediments they are still largely underutilized in bank filtration research with exception of numericalmodeling the application of these strategies could improve current understanding of biochemical reactions during water infiltration not only for ammonium but for other redox relevant parameters 4 origin and behavior of ammoniumduringbank filtration an rbf system can comprise three types of water with different characteristics and origin bf infiltrated surface water landside groundwater and groundwater flowing beneath the surface water body from the opposite side of the surface water body having another catchment and different nitrogen input fig 2 nitrogen can be transported to the system from both the surface water and groundwater as different species such as ammonium nitrate or organic nitrogen alternatively organic nitrogen or adsorbed ammonium can be present in the riverbed material and released transformed during rbf bourg and bertin 1993 the behavior of nitrogen species varies according to the chemical physical and biological conditions and rbf is characterized by changing conditions between its different zones doussan et al 1998 jacobs et al 1988 thus an evaluation of ammonium behavior in rbf must be assessed for each zone namely the river 4 1 the riverbed 4 2 the aquifer on the bankside 4 3 the vadose zone the aquifer on the groundwater side 4 4 and the mixing zone in the vicinity of the abstraction well 4 5 each zone also interacts with the others in particular ways river water infiltrates into the riverbed where it moves through the aquifer reaching the well where bf from different layers and groundwater mix water in the vadose zone leaches to the aquifer in the bankside and groundwater side thus the water composition and physicochemical transformations in each zone influence what happens in the other zones fig 2 illustrates the zones and the physical biochemical interactions between them this already includes a simplification as the zones are assumed to be fairly homogeneous this is not the case for the riverbed where infiltration rates are heterogeneous and thus cannot be regarded as constant schubert 2002 this also applies for the aquifer at the bankside which is vertically stratified with respect to redox conditions and in which the boundaries between water coming from the opposite side and infiltrating from the river are fuzzy as seen at the rbf site in torgau germany grischek et al 1998 4 1 river the river is a common source of nitrogen during rbf nitrogen is mostly present in rivers as nitrate ammonium and organic nitrogen both dissolved and particulate nitrogen reaches the river as diffuse pollution from groundwater as baseflow from surface runoff including soil erosion or as point pollution from domestic or industrial sewage input in europe diffuse loads are the main source of nitrogen in surface water addiscott et al 1991 agricultural activity plays a large role in nitrogen loading as seen in herrman et al 2008 and caschetto et al 2014 point loads can be locally important groeschke et al 2017 found high levels of inorganic nitrogen caused by sewage discharge upstream of an rbf study site in india with up to 20 mg l of ammonium in the river water major rivers in europe such as the danube rhine and elbe where large rbf schemes are operated have total inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the range of 2 to 5 mg n l with nitrate as the major portion of nitrogen species grischek et al 1998 kussmaul and mühlhausen 1979 nagy kovács et al 2019 stuyfzand 1989 aside from being a nitrogen source river water quality has direct influence on the redox processes occurring in the riverbed and bankside after infiltration thus river water temperature ph do and doc concentrations are relevant for nitrogen speciation during rbf rivers are usually oxic environments leading to the nitrification of ammonium and formation of nitrate mulholland et al 2000 rivers with low do concentrations usually below 0 5 mg l start nitrate attenuation via denitrification piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 the role of the hyporheic zone and surface and subsurface water exchange in the river chemistry must not be underemphasized findlay 1995 due the high rates of biological processes in the riverbed see section 4 2 4 2 riverbed the riverbed is a biologically highly active layer boulton et al 1998 krause et al 2013 during rbf most attenuation processes occur within the first meters after infiltration a large part of it in the riverbed itself bourg and bertin 1993 hiscock and grischek 2002 massmann et al 2008 nitrogen behavior in the riverbed depends largely on the river water quality see section 4 1 sediment composition permeability clogging of the riverbed and organic carbon and organic nitrogen contents in the bed sediments boulton et al 1998 comer warner et al 2020 riverbed composition is heavily affected by the presence of macrophytes schulz and gücker 2005 macrophytes tend to lower the stream flow velocity increase fine sediment deposition and decrease sediment resuspension which consequently increases the organic content of the sediments this in turn leads to higher oxygen consumption and higher mineralization rates which result in ammonium accumulation in the riverbed chambers and prepas 1994 jones et al 2012 macrophytes also release oxygen to the rhizosphere which could theoretically increase nitrification rates barko et al 1991 however oxygen release sufficient to overcome the reducing conditions of most bed sediments has rarely been observed chambers and prepas 1994 riverbed permeability depends mostly on the grain size of the sediments and on clogging grischek and bartak 2016 schubert 2002 the presence of macrophytes also reduces bed infiltration velocity thus raising water residence time schulz et al 2002 the low flow velocity of infiltrating water caused by a low permeability of the riverbed coupled with a high organic carbon content result in a quick consumption of do and accumulation of ammonium within the bed doussan et al 1998 massmann et al 2008 higher permeability of the riverbed allows do to enter further in the aquifer while the riverbed is oxic there is attenuation of ammonium via nitrification which also raises nitrate concentration if all do is consumed denitrification starts happening as long as nitrate and biologically available organic carbon are present be it dissolved doc in the infiltrated water or particulate poc in the riverbed grischek et al 1998 denitrification is usually observed as the dominant process taking place in an anoxic riverbed however reducing conditions can also induce dnra see section 2 mineralization of organic nitrogen mainly occurs in the riverbed and has been identified as the main source of ammonium in the bed s pore water at several sites li et al 2017 pan et al 2018 stoliker et al 2016 sorption of ammonium by cation exchange and fixation within clay lattices occur in the riverbed because the bed frequently has a higher portion of fine sediments rich in minerals and organic carbon as seen for example at the rbf site described by doussan et al 1998 sorption by cation exchange will only result in retardation of ammonium which will eventually break through and reach the aquifer unless it is transformed by other reactions doussan et al 1998 the small spatial variations vertically stratified conditions and high number of reactions make it hard to measure and determine exactly which processes are taking place in a riverbed comer warner et al 2020 massmann et al 2008 4 3 aquifer bankside infiltrated river water moves through the aquifer until it reaches the abstraction well s dominating processes during the flow path depend on the resulting redox conditions after riverbed passage and the composition of the aquifer material reducing conditions are likely to prevail thus consuming the remaining do and nitrate as long as electron donors are present in the bf this leads to a so called reduced zone in the riverbank bourg and bertin 1993 depending on hydrogeological conditions within the aquifer oxygen may reach the aquifer with rain water percolating through the vadose zone or by diffusion through the unsaturated zone as seepage water massmann et al 2008 in such cases an oxidizing zone of limited thickness may form in the upper part of the aquifer after the reducing zone near the river prompting nitrification of ammonium if present as found at the rbf site in the lot river france described by bourg and bertin 1993 however the portion of seepage water between a riverbank and a rbf well is commonly less than 5 of abstracted water or negligible thus rarely meaningfully affecting do concentrations in the aquifer trettin et al 1999 for example the rbf site at torgau germany has 42 vertical wells at an average distance from the riverbank of 300 m over a river reach about 15 km long with total abstraction capacity of150 000 m3 d and a portion of about 50 bf grischek and paufler 2017 assuming a recharge rate of 100 mm a the portion of seepage water 300 m 15 000 m 0 1 m a 365 d a 1233 m3 d would be less than 2 of the abstracted bf the thickness of an oxidizing zone in the aquifer also depends on water level fluctuations in the river caused by the pumping regime this may have an effect at rbf sites with low thickness aquifers 6 m but very little effect in aquifers having a thickness between 12 m and 120 m which are more commonly chosen for rbf sites grischek et al 2002 kruc et al 2020 4 4 aquifer landside groundwaterand deep groundwater from opposite side groundwater from the landside or deep groundwater from the opposite side of the river may reach the abstraction well and mix with the bf during abstraction see section 4 5 thus affecting the abstracted water quality groundwater can also be source of nitrogen during rbf nitrogen mostly reaches the aquifer through leaching organic nitrogen mineralized in the vadose zone and transported to the aquifer by seepage is a common source of inorganic nitrogen in groundwater couturier et al 2017 schilling 2002 nitrate is more mobile than ammonium and thus reaches the aquifer more easily haynes 1986 while positively chargedammonium may rarely reach groundwater through seepage high inorganic nitrogen concentrations are found beneath agricultural fields with application of nitrogen fertilizer and manure kohl et al 1971 nikolenko et al 2018 additionally landfill leachate septic tank effluent and industrial waste can be a local source of very high concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the groundwater böhlke et al 2006 gooddy et al 2014 gu et al 2013 hinkle et al 2007 but of less relevance for rbf as wells for drinking water supply are normally not installed in polluted areas an exception is the bank filtration scheme at friedrichshagen in berlin germany there specific treatment schemes are in operation to remove ammonium from landside groundwater that was affected by the former disposal of domestic and industrial sewage as well as sludge from a wastewater treatment plant rössner et al 2000 mineralization of organic matter from peat sediments leaching into the aquifer can also be responsible for high local concentrations 10 mg l of ammonium mastrocicco et al 2013 norrman et al 2015 4 5 vicinity of an abstraction well there are two processes relevant for nitrogen speciation that occur in an abstraction well and its vicinity mixing of water with different characteristics bourg and bertin 1993 and oxidation farnsworth and hering 2011 during abstraction bf from lower and upper layers which usually have distinct oxidizing conditions mix grischek et al 1998 furthermore bf and groundwater also mix depending on the position of the well and hydrogeological conditions the mixing of bf and groundwater can start tens of meters from the well bourg and bertin 1993 the consequences of mixing depend on the characteristics of the waters and therefore lead to a variety of physical e g dilution and chemical e g nitrification processes the second process that may arise is aeration in the well vicinity due to processes such as diffusive flux from the overlying unsaturated zone or gas entrapment due to water table oscillations induced by intermittent abstraction farnsworth and hering 2011 however oxidation due to an oscillating water table will rarely have a significant impact on the ammonium concentration because the amount of abstracted water in a day usually by far surpasses the volume of the cone of depression leading to only small amounts of oxygen proportional to the abstracted water in some cases oxidation near the abstraction well caused by turbulent abstraction enhance nitrification of ammonium as observed at the rbf site described by doussan et al 1998 5 comparison of ammonium concentrations in bank filtration worldwide ammonium has been measured in the abstracted water of several rbf sites across the world the fate of ammonium is linked with other nitrogen species and the reactions occurring in the different zones of rbf thus data was collected from the literature including water composition regarding ammonium and nitrate table 2 nitrite do and ph table a1 from surface water groundwater riverbed table a2 bf from observation wells in the bankside and abstracted water of several rbf sites furthermore the distances from the river to observation and abstraction wells travel times table a1 and proportion of bf and groundwater in the abstraction wells were also collected as not all publications about investigated sites contained all information missing data is listed as not available na in the tables detection limits for ammonium lie between 0 02 to 0 1 mg l 5 1 data analysis 20 of 37 investigated sites from the literature had ammonium concentrations in the abstracted water above the set limit of 0 5 mg l while 17 of 40 sites had higher than 0 5 mg l in the surface water compared to surface water ammonium increased in concentration in the abstracted water n 37 in 51 of the cases median of 1 mg l increase and decreased in 49 median of 0 6 mg l decrease nitrate n 33 on the other hand increased in only 27 of sites median of 3 2 mg l increase and decreased in 73 median of 8 8 mg l decrease the main cause for increase in nitrate concentrations is mixing with groundwater containing nitrate and the main cause for decrease is attenuation via denitrification surface water and bf characteristics e g ph do and nitrate concentrations distance from the riverbank travel time and portion of bf are influencing parameters in the ammonium content of abstracted water fig 3 and fig 4 using spearman s rank correlation no surface water parameter has shown a significant correlation p 0 05 with ammonium in the abstraction well except for ammonium itself rs 0 4 p 0 05 using mann whitney u test none of the ammonium populations from surface water parameters on fig 4 were significantly different from each other α 0 05 on the other hand ammonium concentrations at sites with above median nitrate and do in the abstracted water were significantly higher than below median sites α 0 01 there is also a strong negative correlation between nitrate rs 0 71 p 0 001 and do rs 0 77 p 0 001 in the abstraction well and ammonium concentrations sites with remaining do or nitrate have higher redox potential thus at those sites most or all of the ammonium has been nitrified which explains the strong correlations ammonium concentrations for ph in the abstracted water and bf were not significantly different between above and below median values α 0 05 greater than median distances and travel times to the abstraction wells tended to yield ammonium concentrations which were significantly higher than below median α 0 05 there are also positive correlations between travel time rs 0 64 p 0 05 and distance to abstraction well rs 0 35 p 0 05 with ammonium concentrations this might be explained by a few sites where bf interacts with polder water having a high ammonium content where rbf wells are located very far from the bank massmann et al 2004 pekdeger 2010 stuyfzand et al 2006 vet et al 2010 ammonium behavior is complex and thus difficulties arise in the analysis of its behavior during rbf the first difficulties derive from the lack of data in every zone most of the publications presented data for only some of the relevant zones frequently just surface and abstracted water this leaves part of the nitrogen story left untold and requires assumptions to infer which reactions are occurring and to which extent for example groundwater data is frequently absent leaving unanswered questions such as whether the source of ammonium is the groundwater or a reaction occurring during infiltration also few authors have investigated riverbed pore water quality table a2 and riverbed composition not shown which is where most reactions are occurring a proper evaluation of the biochemical characteristics of an rbf site must at least contain surface ground and abstracted water qualities with riverbed and or observation wells near the river being of great advantage secondly there is a great number of possible reactions and some of them have similar end results making it difficult to differentiate between two processes without more information such as isotopic concentrations for example simultaneous decrease of nitrate and increase of ammonium as observed at several sites boyd 1999 doussan et al 1998 dragon et al 2018 massmann et al 2004 pekdeger 2010 shamsuddin et al 2014 stuyfzand 1989 can be explained by two different sets of phenomena 1 denitrification of nitrate and mineralization of organic nitrogen to ammonium in the riverbed or 2 denitrification and dnra attenuating nitrate and dnra leading to an increase in ammonium it is also possible that both processes occur simultaneously but it is unclear whether both especially dnra have contributed significantly to an increase in ammonium concentration the effects of nitrification followed by denitrification also have the same observable result in the abstraction well as the sorption of ammonium which is decreased ammonium concentration these problems lead to uncertainties in the exact determination of ammonium behavior such that some of the rbf sites have more than one possibility for ammonium development 5 2 typical courses of ammonium concentration development during rbf it is likely that many of the processes occur to some extent at most of the sites for example mineralization of ammonium likely occurs at all sites although in many cases it did not happen to the degree as to noticeably increase the ammonium concentration in the bf alternatively mineralization can form ammonium which is quickly transformed to nitrate via nitrification or adsorbed onto riverbed aquifer material and is therefore undetectable in the abstraction wells e g pan et al 2018 the same is true for other processes such as sorption nitrification assimilation and anammox nevertheless the development of the ammonium concentration along the flow path from the surface water to the wells can be divided into seven typical courses for most bank filtration sites fig 5 of the 40 reviewed rbf sites 14 saw an ammonium increase in the bf relative to the river water due to mineralization in the riverbed but possibly also due to dnra six other locations might also have had the same behavior but lack of groundwater information makes the source of ammonium increase unclear of those 20 sites 15 maintained higher ammonium levels until abstraction with a median increase from surface to abstracted water of 0 8 mg l a fig 5 at two sites ammonium formed in the riverbed was partly or completely nitrified or adsorbed still in the riverbed b1 and at three sites ammonium was nitrified or adsorbed in the aquifer b2 14 sites had ammonium in the river which was partly or completely nitrified or adsorbed either in the riverbed or in the aquifer c the high oxygen levels in surface water and occasional increases in nitrate concentration in the bf of many sites leads to the assumption that nitrification plays a larger role than adsorption in ammonium attenuation in such cases on the other hand low oxygen and high nitrite concentration in the river water at the site described by sprenger and lorenzen 2014 point to anammox rather than nitrification being responsible for ammonium attenuation five sites had near zero ammonium concentration in surface water and saw no increase in the bf d additionally this might be the case for six other sites of those 11 sites only four contained little to no ammonium in the abstracted water while the others mixed with ammonium containing groundwater of all sites mixing with groundwater led to a noticeable increase in ammonium concentration in the abstracted water e1 at three to eight sites and to a decreased concentration e2 at two to three sites the assessed ammonium concentration development for each site is presented in table 2 of the 20 cases with ammonium concentrations higher than 0 5 mg l in the abstracted water five have mineralization and or dnra as the primary source of ammonium two have ammonium in the groundwater as a source seven had ammonium in the river water which was not attenuated below 0 5 mg l during subsurface flow and six had ammonium higher than 0 5 mg l in surface water after which mineralization dnra led to even higher ammonium concentrations although mineralization is the most often cause of ammonium increase it generally does not leads to very high ammonium concentrations while heavily polluted groundwater rössner et al 2000 vet et al 2010 and surface water doussan et al 1998 groeschke et al 2017 sprenger and lorenzen 2014 are a more often the cause of very high concentrations 6 implications for rbf operation and design there are four possible sources of ammonium at a given rbf site the groundwater leaching from the vadose zone the river water and reactions in the riverbed at sites where high ammonium concentrations pose challenges for post treatment knowing the source of ammonium can help determine optimal operation practices at the site if the source of ammonium is the groundwater e g vet et al 2010 abstraction of a higher portion of bf in abstracted water should be aimed if ammonium originates in reactions in the riverbed e g stuyfzand 1989 wells located near parts of the river with sufficient shear stress which causes erosion of the clogging layer schubert 2002 should be prioritized when this is not an alternative removal of the clogging layer as done in the nile egypt ghodeif et al 2018 paufler et al 2018a is an option for higher abstraction rates however the clogging layer has a very high efficiency for pathogen removal and pollution attenuation during rbf hiscock and grischek 2002 thus its removal must be considered with extreme caution if the source of ammonium is the river water e g sprenger and lorenzen 2014 there is little which can be done nonetheless the use of rbf may offer partial attenuation of ammonium and other pollutants and result in a less onerous post treatment compared to direct surface water abstraction during rbf anoxic conditions in the bankside aquifer inhibit nitrification thus preserving ammonium in the bf at a few rbf sites bourg and bertin 1993 doussan et al 1998 shamsuddin et al 2014 reintroduction of do to the anoxic bf causes nitrification and attenuates ammonium section 4 5 one might be inclined to attempt to operate an rbf scheme to reproduce such mechanisms in order to attenuate ammonium however some of them are not possible to reproduce as they depend on very specific aquifer conditions and may rarely occur e g oxygen input from the vadose zone mixing with oxic groundwater and turbulent flow during abstraction purposefully oscillating the water table by means of intermittent pumping is possible however in order for this to meaningfully impact do in abstracted water the thickness of the aquifer must be shallow drawdowns must be large and the pumping discontinuity must be frequent such conditions are unlikely to lead to a cost efficient operation and therefore this strategy is not recommended one alternative is infiltrating oxygenated water into the aquifer as is done during subsurface iron removal sir which has been proposed in combination with rbf in the past grischek et al 2013 during sir infiltrated water with do oxidizes reduced iron in the bf forming iron iii hydroxides which precipitate in the aquifer the efficiency of sir is driven up because reduced iron ions are adsorbed to the recently formed iron iii hydroxides the adsorption effect would not occur to the same extent with ammonium thus the efficiency of ammonium removal is expected to be much lower than iron removal site selection is critical for the cost efficient operation of rbf when it comes to ammonium surface water concentrations do not directly translate to abstracted water concentrations as seen in section 5 1 surface water parameters are largely uncorrelated with abstracted ammonium concentrations which highlights that decision makers must be careful not to overweight surface water quality in site selection decisions riverbed composition plays a critical role in resulting redox conditions and potential formation attenuation of ammonium and thus should be more often taken into consideration during decision making riverbeds with high amounts of organic material have more electron donor competitors for oxygen which limits attenuation of ammonium by nitrification furthermore particulate organic nitrogen pon present in the riverbed can be a source of ammonium through mineralization thus to avoid higher ammonium concentrations river reaches with low accumulation of organic matter are preferred and depositional reaches where organic matter is frequently replenished should be avoided the presence of macrophytes in streams leads to organic matter accumulation in the riverbed section 4 2 and therefore location with high amounts of macrophytes should also be avoided longer travel times to the abstraction well are usually preferred because it offers higher attenuation of most pollutants however this is not the case for ammonium in fact there is even a positive correlation between travel times and well distances with ammonium concentrations of the investigated data with longer travel times reducing conditions tend to prevail thus ammonium is not further attenuated in the bankside aquifer additionally longer well distances usually go together with lower bf portions in the abstracted water which can lead to higher ammonium concentrations dragon et al 2018 vet et al 2010 nitrogen pathways in freshwater river and riverbed environments are still not fully understood and the partitioning of competing nitrogen processes occurring in the riverbed during rbf has not yet been investigated in depth the relevance of the dnra process in ammonium formation during rbf is still unclear dnra is an undesirable process since it preserves nitrogen in the water as opposed to denitrification if dnra occurs at a substantial rate during rbf sites with high concentrations of nitrate in river water have the potential to form ammonium independently of mineralization potential in the riverbed however many authors suggest that dnra is only relevant when a high c n ratio is present thus high ammonium formation by dnra may only be possible at sites with very high organic content in the riverbed which would also have high mineralization potential a better understanding of which conditions favor dnra over denitrification can aid the prediction of ammonium formation during bank filtration anammox is a favorable process since it removes both nitrite and ammonium sites with high nitrate and ammonium in the river water could have both attenuated during bank filtration if anammox occurs even with low do concentration in the river however the conditions which allow for anammox occurrence during rbf are still poorly understood in order to provide more robust answers to these questions more research on the partition of the different pathways of ammonium oxidation and nitrate reduction in freshwater environments and during rbf is necessary the initial phase of rbf operation 15 months generally produces changing abstracted water quality wahaab et al 2019 found that it took 2 to 8 months until stable water quality was observed for selected hydrochemical parameters and 2 to 14 months for microbiological parameters at 3 rbf sites in egypt for one of the sites ammonium concentration was around 0 5 mg l during the first months of operation and later decreased to around 0 1 to 0 2 mg l remaining in this range in the following months it is possible that for this and other rbf sites the change in flow conditions induced by bank filtration results in increased mineralization during the initial phase of rbf which later decreases as easily degradable organic matter in the riverbed gets consumed this does not apply to sites with constant replenishment of organic matter such as depositional reaches in rivers nonetheless to determine suitability and necessary post treatment regarding ammonium at potential rbf sites the authors suggest operating a pilot well for the period of up to one year or until stable water quality conditions are reached discontinuous pumping can have negative effects on the quality of abstracted water during rbf especially with regard to manganese and iron bartak et al 2015 grischek and paufler 2017 ammonium concentrations can also be undesirably affected by intermittent pumping when the pumping is interrupted the water level gradient towards the well slowly decreases eventually reaching pre pumping rates resulting in longer residence times in the hyporheic zone as a consequence of longer residence times stronger reducing conditions are established in the riverbed comer warner et al 2020 and the rate of mineralization of organic nitrogen is increased wang et al 2018 when pumping is restarted water which remained longer in the riverbed is abstracted and ammonium concentrations might be temporarily higher in a portion of the water before returning to normal levels of course mixing of bf portions of different age in the aquifer before abstraction via the well will buffer such an effect few studies offer results from long term operation of rbf with respect to ammonium doussan et al 1998 showed how sorption of ammonium in the aquifer material can result in lower concentrations of ammonium in the abstracted water for many years but it will eventually break through however none of the other reviewed studies showed a similar trend perhaps because ammonium sorption or long term operation were not examined but likely also because rbf sites do not tend to be selected for locations with high sorption capacity e g high amounts of clay in the aquifer ammonium and nitrate concentrations tend to fluctuate in the river due to variations in runoff river discharge fertilizer application sewage disposal and biological activity inorganic nitrogen concentrations in surface water tend to be higher during winter dragon et al 2018 grischek et al 1998 massmann et al 2004 regnery et al 2015 although other factors might be at play lower biological activity and consequently lower removal rates during the winter months is one likely cause regnery et al 2015 reaction rates in the riverbed are also seasonally influenced higher biological activity at higher temperatures has reportedly led to higher denitrification nitrification and mineralization potentials during rbf grischek et al 1998 gross wittke et al 2010 massmann et al 2008 pan et al 2018 higher temperatures are linked to higher oxygen consumption in riverbed sediments diem et al 2013 paufler et al 2018b rohr et al 2014 much higher attenuation rates of ammonium via nitrification during rbf have been observed in winter dash et al 2008 regnery et al 2015 higher increases of ammonium in the riverbed and abstraction wells have also been observed in summer compared to winter dragon et al 2018 pan et al 2018 combining those observations lead to the assumption that warmer seasons and warmer regions are more susceptible to ammonium increase during rbf therefore seasonal variations are expected to play a larger role then long term operation trends 7 conclusion ammonium is an undesirable substance in the abstracted water of rbf schemes due mainly to the complications it causes during post treatment ammonium concentrations of infiltrated surface water may both increase or decrease during bank filtration because the fate of ammonium during rbf is the result of a large number of variables and reactions the review of 40 rbf sites allows the following conclusions typical concentrations of ammonium in the abstracted water of rbf sites vary from 0 1 to 1 7 mg l median of 0 6 mg l while typical concentrations in the surface water vary from 0 06 to 0 8 mg l median of 0 22 mg l the most frequentlyobserved source of ammonium in bank filtrate is mineralization of organic nitrogen in the riverbed followed by ammonium content in the surface water the most common sink of ammonium during rbf is nitrification in the riverbed other processes potentially affecting ammonium concentrations during rbf areassimilation sorption anammox and dnra ammonium concentrations can have implications for the operation and planning of rbf schemes riverbeds with high organic matter content can lead to the formation of ammonium during surface water infiltration so wells should be located along parts of the river with sufficient shear stress to avoid deposition of fine sediments rich in organic carbon and nitrogen stable conditions of ammonium concentrations might be achieved only after many months of operation thus further decisions about operation and post treatment should be considered only after operation of a pilot well for several months continuous pumping should be practiced in orderto avoid temporary increases in ammonium concentrations upon restarting pumping activities in most cases seasonal variations were found to play a larger role than long term operational trends in

17203,ammonium is an undesirable substance in the abstracted water of riverbank filtration rbf schemes due mainly to the complications it causes during post treatment based on the investigation of case studies from 40 sites around the world an overview of the sources and behavior of ammonium during rbf is given typical concentrations of ammonium in the bank filtrate bf are between 0 1 and 1 7 mg l the most common source of ammonium in bf is the mineralization of organic nitrogen occurring in the riverbed while the most common sink of ammonium is nitrification in the riverbed ammonium surface water concentrations do not directly translate to abstracted concentrations transformations in the riverbed play a critical role in determining ammonium concentrations whereby riverbeds with high amounts of organic material will have more electron donor competitors for oxygen thus limiting ammonium attenuation via nitrification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

nitrogen sw surface water sir subsurface iron removal 1 introduction riverbank filtration rbf is a well established water treatment process in which surface water is subjected to subsurface flow prior to extraction attenuation of river water contaminants is expected to occur during subsurface flow through filtration biodegradation sorption and redox reactions however as a result of changing redox conditions undesirable effects of bank filtration on water quality can also occur including increases in hardness dissolved manganese and iron concentrations and the formation of hydrogen sulfide hiscock and grischek 2002 since nitrogen has a wide range of oxidation states 3 0 1 3 and 5 changing redox conditions can also change nitrogen speciation and thus play a significant role in attenuation and transformation of inorganic nitrogen in water environments at rbf sites across the world bank filtrate bf might be contaminated by ammonium doussan et al 1998 groeschke et al 2017 vet et al 2010 nitrate dragon et al 2018 nagy kovács et al 2019 pan et al 2018 and in some rare cases nitrite groeschke et al 2017 the major health concern regarding nitrate and nitrite is methemoglobinemia a blood disorder in which too little oxygen is delivered to cells the world health organization has set the recommended limits of 50 mg l for nitrate and to 3 mg l for nitrite who 2011 ammonium is not toxic for humans therefore the who has not set any limits for drinking water however it is a problematic compound during post treatment where for example it can compromise chlorination efficiency and cause failure of filters in the removal of manganese who 2011 furthermore 1 mg l of ammonium in water leads to the consumption of around 3 6 mg l of dissolved oxygen do thus the presence of ammonium may cause anoxic conditions in the distribution system which has further implications for water taste the recommended limit for ammonium in germany according to the drinking water regulations is 0 5 mg l trinkwasserverordnung 2001 consumption of oxygen by ammonium during rbf leads to stronger reducing conditions in the aquifer which can in turn have negative consequences such as the release of manganese and iron from the aquifer sediments thus requiring additional post treatment of abstracted raw water the cost efficient operation of an rbf system is therefore affected by the concentration and behavior of nitrogen species particularly ammonium 2 sources of ammonium ammonium present in surface and groundwater can have both natural and anthropogenic sources ammonium from natural sources mostly originates from the mineralization eq 1 table 1 of organic matter by which organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium by microorganisms natural sources such as peat can in some cases be responsible for ammonium concentrations above 10 mg l in aquifers du et al 2020 hinkle et al 2007 mastrocicco et al 2013 anthropogenic sources of ammonium include fertilizers livestock manure leachate from landfills and septic tanks and industrial and domestic wastewater ammonium can also be formed from nitrate under reducing conditions by a process called dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium or dnra eq 2 nitrate originates in water through anthropogenic sources such as fertilizers but also through nitrification of ammonium which occurs under oxidizing conditions under reducing conditions besides the dnra process denitrification eq 3 occurs which is usually the dominant process for nitrate removal korom 1992 rivett et al 2008 usually organic matter serves as electron donor for denitrification and dnra heterotrophic process however there can be other electron donors chemoautotrophic process such as fe ii h2s and fes2 burgin and hamilton 2007 couturier et al 2017 one difference concerning dnra and denitrification is that in denitrification nitrogen is lost to the system in the form of diatomic nitrogen or nitrogen oxide gases dnra was once assumed to be a marginal process regarding nitrate transformation however many recent studies show that dnra can play an important role with rates equivalent to denitrification in different types of aquatic habitats such as estuaries an and gardner 2002 bernard et al 2015 domangue and mortazavi 2018 dong et al 2011 paddy soils pandey et al 2019 yin et al 2002 forest soils bengtsson and bergwall 2000 rütting et al 2008 and lake sediments brunet and garcia gil 1996 palacin lizarbe et al 2019 pang and ji 2019 robertson and thamdrup 2017 less research has been done on freshwater stream sediments and groundwater nevertheless a few authors describe cases where dnra outcompeted denitrification in these environments such as in the sediments of a river in ireland kelso et al 1997 and in the groundwater of an alluvial aquifer in serbia perović et al 2017 storey et al 2004 did column experiments with sediments from the hyporheic zone of a small stream in canada and found that dnra outcompeted denitrification in nitrate removal they recorded increases of up to 0 6 mg l of ammonium of which around 40 of it was attributed to dnra and the rest to mineralization the exact factors influencing portioning between dnra and denitrification are still not fully understood but it is hypothesized that a high c n ratio as well as the presence of labile carbon reducedsulfur and reduced iron are positively correlated with higher dnra rates burgin and hamilton 2007 tiedje 1982 attenuation of ammonium can happen in many ways buss et al 2004 the most common process is nitrification eq 4 5 in which ammonium is oxidized by microorganisms to form nitrate with nitrite as an intermediate product anaerobic ammonium degradation can also occur in which substances other than oxygen serve as electron acceptors for ammonium such as iron iii hydroxide feammox eq 6 or nitrite anammox eq 7 during anammox ammonium is combined with nitrite producing nitrogen gas and thus contributing to permanent nitrogen removal from the system this process is known to play an important role in anoxic wastewater oxygen depleted zones of the ocean temperate shelf sediments sea ice arctic shelf sediments burgin and hamilton 2007 and highly contaminated aquifers wang et al 2020 there is ample evidence of anammox occurring in freshwater streams akbarzadeh et al 2018 kim et al 2016 shelley et al 2017 but to a much lesser extent compared to denitrification and rarely being recognized as an important ammonium sink few rbf studies even considered the possibility of anammox and its role during rbf therefore remains unclear anammox requires both nitrate and ammonium in the water to occur and it is strongly inhibited by the presence of oxygen dalsgaard et al 2005 postulated that anammox bacteria grow slowly and thus the process is probably only significant in stable environments where there is a prolonged time for the bacterial population to develop while denitrifiers have much higher growth rates which gives them a competitive advantage over anammox bacteria in fluctuating environments riverbeds are heterogeneous environments where redox conditions can spatially oscillate thus likely do not offer such stable conditions it is also assumed that environments with higher electron donor availability e g organic matter which is the case for organic rich bed sediments create a higher demand for electron acceptors such as nitrate and nitrite limiting oxidation of ammonium by nitrite dalsgaard et al 2005 furthermore anammox is hypothesized to be inhibited by many organic compounds including pyruvate ethanol and glucose jetten et al 1998 which are often present in freshwater sediments that support high biological productivity which may limit its occurrence in such environments burgin and hamilton 2007 ammonium can be immobilized by microorganisms during decomposition of organic residues in a process called assimilation or immobilization haynes 1986 assimilation of inorganic nitrogen normally plays a secondary role in the amounts of attenuated nitrogen in addition bacteria die off releases nitrogen back into the system rivett et al 2008 table 1 presents the major reactions considered relevant to the behavior of ammonium in aquatic environments the reactions presented are in most cases simplifications or generalizations of the processes they describe ammonium in water is also present in its non ionized form ammonia at higher temperatures and higher ph values ammonia can be volatized and thus lost to the system ammonia volatilization follows henry s law therefore it depends on the temperature and proportions of ammonia in the aqueous solution freney et al 1983 the proportion of ammonium and ammonia in an aqueous solution depends mostly on ph and temperature where the proportion of ammonia increases with both ph and temperature however even at relatively high ph values e g ph 8 and temperatures e g 30 c ammonia concentrations are below 10 of total ammonium ammonia in the solution emerson et al 1975 most studies do not consider ammonia volatilization as a relevant ammonium sink in water environments desimone and howes 1998 found it to have a very low 0 5 contribution to ammonium sink at ph 7 2 li et al 2012 found ammonia losses from volatilization to be considerable only at ph greater than 8 5 at a temperature of 23 c during laboratory experiments at most rbf sites the ph of surface water ranges from ph 7 6 to ph 8 1 and abstracted water ranges from ph 7 1 to ph 7 5 table a1 the temperature in surface water at rbf sites presented in the review made by paufler and grischek 2018 mostly fell in the range from 12 to 27 c with a mean of 15 5 c therefore ammonia volatilization does not play a significant role in the large majority of rbf sites the processes of nitrification denitrification anammox dnra mineralization and assimilation are all biochemical processes driven by a number of microorganisms therefore the rate of each process also depends on the local microbial community environmental conditions such as redox potential dissolved organic carbon doc concentration ph and temperature control these processes and thus also control nitrogen speciation rivett et al 2008 ammonium can also be attenuated by sorption sorption of ammonium is primarily caused by cation exchange since ammonium is positively charged it can be held by negatively charged sediment surfaces this does not remove ammonium from the system considering no other process occurs leading only to retardation of ammonium breakthrough the strength by which cations bond to a sediment surface is determined by their selectivity coefficients although selectivity varies by the adsorbent and ph matthess 1973 the following order has been offered in order of decreasing affinity for cation exchange sites al3 ca2 mg2 nh4 k h na domenico and schwartz 1998 sorption of ammonium does not always occur by an exchange mechanism ammonium can for example be fixated within clay lattices such as illite and other 2 1 type clay minerals which can be an irreversible process because the ammonium ion fits into the intra layer clay lattice buss et al 2004 a summary of the possible transformations of nitrogen in aquatic systems is shown in fig 1 3 strategies to determine ammonium source and behavior measuring ammonium concentrations alone is often not enough to determine ammonium sources and occurring reactions to that end there are several complemental strategies which can be used including the use of 15n isotopes assessing the microbiological community and numericalmodeling different sources of ammonium may display different isotopic footprints therefore it is possible to speculate the nitrogen source from isotopic measurements several studies have inferred the ammonium source with this strategy gooddy et al 2014 hinkle et al 2007 lingle et al 2017 scheiber et al 2016 however ammonium isotopic footprints of different sources e g animal manure industrial effluents domestic sewage and buried organic matter are largely overlapping xuan et al 2020 thus making it hard to pinpoint the source hence other substances had to be utilized in conjecture with isotopic concentrations such as tritium boron chloride etc inferring ammonium sources exclusively based on isotopic concentrations yields questionable results different techniques are used to trace nitrogen reactions by means of isotopic measurements the isotope paring technique ipt has been developed by nielsen 1992 to quantify nitrification and denitrification rates in intact sediment cores spiked with 15n labelled nitrate the technique was modified by christensen et al 2000 to include dnra rates and later by risgaard petersen et al 2003 and thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 using slurry incubations to assess anammox rates the ipt and its variants techniques have been widely used and mainly applied in estuarine sediments an and gardner 2002 domangue and mortazavi 2018 dong et al 2011 mccarthy et al 2008 but also in sediments from constructed wetlands rahman et al 2019 lakes pang and ji 2019 and riparian zones revsbech et al 2005 reinhardt et al 2006 used a isotope mass balance approach based on natural isotopic concentrations to quantify mineralization nitrification and denitrification in undisturbed sediment cores from a constructed wetland in switzerland laboratory techniques are mostly used because they allow for the use of labelled 15n substrates e g nitrate while onsite analyses rely on sufficiently different isotopic footprints from the different nitrogen species in order to be successful and therefore are less frequently used techniques such as the ones described have potential to improve understanding of nitrogen pathways during riverbed passage at rbf sites but at moment of writing labelled 15n substrates have not yet been applied in an rbf context biochemical reactions can lead to isotopic fractionations usually lighter isotopes are favored thus leading to a 15n depleted product and 15n enriched substrate denitrification for example leads to a depletion of 15n in the formed nitrogen gas and enrichment of 15n in the remaining nitrate mariotti 1981 assumptions regarding fractionation based on onsite isotopic measurements have been used to trace occurring ammonium reactions ding et al 2015 norrman et al 2015 however a few processes such as mineralization hinkle et al 2007 and sorption böhlke et al 2006 have been shown to present little to no isotopic fractionation furthermore not knowing the initial isotopic concentration of the substrate can cloud the judgement and lead to precipitate conclusions 15n isotopes have been used at rbf sites to follow denitrification rates buzek et al 2012 fukada et al 2003 but have not been used to trace ammonium reactions numerical models have also been applied to predict ammonium behavior in different aquatic environments also during bank filtration such models generally include three components a flow model e g modflow 2005 code harbaugh 2005 a non reactive transport model e g mt3dms code zheng and wang 1999 and a reactive model e g phreeqcv3 code parkhurst and appelo 2013 reactive models are facing limitations in current understanding of some biogeochemical processes and reaction kinetics thus cannot be expected to cover every single reaction occurring during bank filtration furthermore simulation of processes during rbf using numerical models is difficult due to spatial and temporal heterogeneities of the system to deal with it these models typically use a single representative flow path and discount seasonal annual variations in travel time portion of bank filtrate temperature and ammonium input groeschke et al 2017 jacobs et al 1988 lee et al 2020 a few studies at rbf sites have chosen to use only flow and non reactive models doussan et al 1998 groeschke et al 2017 focusing on the movement of the ammonium plume trough the aquifer and the effects of cation exchange mechanisms this approach is representative of anoxic conditions in the aquifer regarding ammonium but does not accurately describe riverbed infiltration recently isotopic values have been integrated to reactive model codes parkhurst and appelo 2013 rodríguez escales et al 2014 seibert et al 2019 coupling numerical models and stable isotopes can improve the model boundary conditions constrain model parameterization and elucidate shortcomings in the model structure jensen et al 2018 nonetheless this technique is yet to be used to trace ammonium reactions the microbial community in riverbed and riparian sediments is influenced by the sediments redox conditions and nitrogen species availability and in turn also influences the nitrogen reaction rates and products liu et al 2017 hence nitrogen pathways can be projected based on the microbial community in the sediments this is done by quantifying the functional genes responsible for different reactions such as nitrification amoa denitrification nirs nirk nosz anammox hdh and dnra nrfa in the microbial population kim et al 2016 liu et al 2017 palacin lizarbe et al 2019 stoliker et al 2016 wang et al 2019 although this strategy does not allow for determination of exact reaction rates it does permit qualitative assessments to occurring reactions liu et al 2017 indicate that the microbial community function potential is stable through daily variations but may adapt after a period of only six days of changed conditions therefore assessments based on microbial communities will reflect only the recent hyporheic exchange history riverbeds and riparian sediments are usually subject to changing conditions of redox state and nitrogen availability causes include river stage fluctuations seasonal effects sediment erosion and deposition conditions also change drastically in the initial phase of rbf this needs to be taken into account in the planning of sampling and interpretation of results from this approach there is no single strategy which can determine nitrogen reaction rates exactly but the above described approaches are valuable ways to assess nitrogen pathways which can be used to make practical aquifer management decisions the future of nitrogen pathways determination lies on combining these approaches which have been for long investigated independently permutations of these strategies include incorporating isotopes to reactive models as mentioned above rodríguez escales et al 2014 seibert et al 2019 correlating isotopic measurements to microbial populations palacin lizarbe et al 2019 and quantifying functional genes of microbial populations in 15n tracing experiments wang et al 2019 although these strategies have been widely applied in different freshwater environments such as lake riparian and hyporheic sediments they are still largely underutilized in bank filtration research with exception of numericalmodeling the application of these strategies could improve current understanding of biochemical reactions during water infiltration not only for ammonium but for other redox relevant parameters 4 origin and behavior of ammoniumduringbank filtration an rbf system can comprise three types of water with different characteristics and origin bf infiltrated surface water landside groundwater and groundwater flowing beneath the surface water body from the opposite side of the surface water body having another catchment and different nitrogen input fig 2 nitrogen can be transported to the system from both the surface water and groundwater as different species such as ammonium nitrate or organic nitrogen alternatively organic nitrogen or adsorbed ammonium can be present in the riverbed material and released transformed during rbf bourg and bertin 1993 the behavior of nitrogen species varies according to the chemical physical and biological conditions and rbf is characterized by changing conditions between its different zones doussan et al 1998 jacobs et al 1988 thus an evaluation of ammonium behavior in rbf must be assessed for each zone namely the river 4 1 the riverbed 4 2 the aquifer on the bankside 4 3 the vadose zone the aquifer on the groundwater side 4 4 and the mixing zone in the vicinity of the abstraction well 4 5 each zone also interacts with the others in particular ways river water infiltrates into the riverbed where it moves through the aquifer reaching the well where bf from different layers and groundwater mix water in the vadose zone leaches to the aquifer in the bankside and groundwater side thus the water composition and physicochemical transformations in each zone influence what happens in the other zones fig 2 illustrates the zones and the physical biochemical interactions between them this already includes a simplification as the zones are assumed to be fairly homogeneous this is not the case for the riverbed where infiltration rates are heterogeneous and thus cannot be regarded as constant schubert 2002 this also applies for the aquifer at the bankside which is vertically stratified with respect to redox conditions and in which the boundaries between water coming from the opposite side and infiltrating from the river are fuzzy as seen at the rbf site in torgau germany grischek et al 1998 4 1 river the river is a common source of nitrogen during rbf nitrogen is mostly present in rivers as nitrate ammonium and organic nitrogen both dissolved and particulate nitrogen reaches the river as diffuse pollution from groundwater as baseflow from surface runoff including soil erosion or as point pollution from domestic or industrial sewage input in europe diffuse loads are the main source of nitrogen in surface water addiscott et al 1991 agricultural activity plays a large role in nitrogen loading as seen in herrman et al 2008 and caschetto et al 2014 point loads can be locally important groeschke et al 2017 found high levels of inorganic nitrogen caused by sewage discharge upstream of an rbf study site in india with up to 20 mg l of ammonium in the river water major rivers in europe such as the danube rhine and elbe where large rbf schemes are operated have total inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the range of 2 to 5 mg n l with nitrate as the major portion of nitrogen species grischek et al 1998 kussmaul and mühlhausen 1979 nagy kovács et al 2019 stuyfzand 1989 aside from being a nitrogen source river water quality has direct influence on the redox processes occurring in the riverbed and bankside after infiltration thus river water temperature ph do and doc concentrations are relevant for nitrogen speciation during rbf rivers are usually oxic environments leading to the nitrification of ammonium and formation of nitrate mulholland et al 2000 rivers with low do concentrations usually below 0 5 mg l start nitrate attenuation via denitrification piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 the role of the hyporheic zone and surface and subsurface water exchange in the river chemistry must not be underemphasized findlay 1995 due the high rates of biological processes in the riverbed see section 4 2 4 2 riverbed the riverbed is a biologically highly active layer boulton et al 1998 krause et al 2013 during rbf most attenuation processes occur within the first meters after infiltration a large part of it in the riverbed itself bourg and bertin 1993 hiscock and grischek 2002 massmann et al 2008 nitrogen behavior in the riverbed depends largely on the river water quality see section 4 1 sediment composition permeability clogging of the riverbed and organic carbon and organic nitrogen contents in the bed sediments boulton et al 1998 comer warner et al 2020 riverbed composition is heavily affected by the presence of macrophytes schulz and gücker 2005 macrophytes tend to lower the stream flow velocity increase fine sediment deposition and decrease sediment resuspension which consequently increases the organic content of the sediments this in turn leads to higher oxygen consumption and higher mineralization rates which result in ammonium accumulation in the riverbed chambers and prepas 1994 jones et al 2012 macrophytes also release oxygen to the rhizosphere which could theoretically increase nitrification rates barko et al 1991 however oxygen release sufficient to overcome the reducing conditions of most bed sediments has rarely been observed chambers and prepas 1994 riverbed permeability depends mostly on the grain size of the sediments and on clogging grischek and bartak 2016 schubert 2002 the presence of macrophytes also reduces bed infiltration velocity thus raising water residence time schulz et al 2002 the low flow velocity of infiltrating water caused by a low permeability of the riverbed coupled with a high organic carbon content result in a quick consumption of do and accumulation of ammonium within the bed doussan et al 1998 massmann et al 2008 higher permeability of the riverbed allows do to enter further in the aquifer while the riverbed is oxic there is attenuation of ammonium via nitrification which also raises nitrate concentration if all do is consumed denitrification starts happening as long as nitrate and biologically available organic carbon are present be it dissolved doc in the infiltrated water or particulate poc in the riverbed grischek et al 1998 denitrification is usually observed as the dominant process taking place in an anoxic riverbed however reducing conditions can also induce dnra see section 2 mineralization of organic nitrogen mainly occurs in the riverbed and has been identified as the main source of ammonium in the bed s pore water at several sites li et al 2017 pan et al 2018 stoliker et al 2016 sorption of ammonium by cation exchange and fixation within clay lattices occur in the riverbed because the bed frequently has a higher portion of fine sediments rich in minerals and organic carbon as seen for example at the rbf site described by doussan et al 1998 sorption by cation exchange will only result in retardation of ammonium which will eventually break through and reach the aquifer unless it is transformed by other reactions doussan et al 1998 the small spatial variations vertically stratified conditions and high number of reactions make it hard to measure and determine exactly which processes are taking place in a riverbed comer warner et al 2020 massmann et al 2008 4 3 aquifer bankside infiltrated river water moves through the aquifer until it reaches the abstraction well s dominating processes during the flow path depend on the resulting redox conditions after riverbed passage and the composition of the aquifer material reducing conditions are likely to prevail thus consuming the remaining do and nitrate as long as electron donors are present in the bf this leads to a so called reduced zone in the riverbank bourg and bertin 1993 depending on hydrogeological conditions within the aquifer oxygen may reach the aquifer with rain water percolating through the vadose zone or by diffusion through the unsaturated zone as seepage water massmann et al 2008 in such cases an oxidizing zone of limited thickness may form in the upper part of the aquifer after the reducing zone near the river prompting nitrification of ammonium if present as found at the rbf site in the lot river france described by bourg and bertin 1993 however the portion of seepage water between a riverbank and a rbf well is commonly less than 5 of abstracted water or negligible thus rarely meaningfully affecting do concentrations in the aquifer trettin et al 1999 for example the rbf site at torgau germany has 42 vertical wells at an average distance from the riverbank of 300 m over a river reach about 15 km long with total abstraction capacity of150 000 m3 d and a portion of about 50 bf grischek and paufler 2017 assuming a recharge rate of 100 mm a the portion of seepage water 300 m 15 000 m 0 1 m a 365 d a 1233 m3 d would be less than 2 of the abstracted bf the thickness of an oxidizing zone in the aquifer also depends on water level fluctuations in the river caused by the pumping regime this may have an effect at rbf sites with low thickness aquifers 6 m but very little effect in aquifers having a thickness between 12 m and 120 m which are more commonly chosen for rbf sites grischek et al 2002 kruc et al 2020 4 4 aquifer landside groundwaterand deep groundwater from opposite side groundwater from the landside or deep groundwater from the opposite side of the river may reach the abstraction well and mix with the bf during abstraction see section 4 5 thus affecting the abstracted water quality groundwater can also be source of nitrogen during rbf nitrogen mostly reaches the aquifer through leaching organic nitrogen mineralized in the vadose zone and transported to the aquifer by seepage is a common source of inorganic nitrogen in groundwater couturier et al 2017 schilling 2002 nitrate is more mobile than ammonium and thus reaches the aquifer more easily haynes 1986 while positively chargedammonium may rarely reach groundwater through seepage high inorganic nitrogen concentrations are found beneath agricultural fields with application of nitrogen fertilizer and manure kohl et al 1971 nikolenko et al 2018 additionally landfill leachate septic tank effluent and industrial waste can be a local source of very high concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the groundwater böhlke et al 2006 gooddy et al 2014 gu et al 2013 hinkle et al 2007 but of less relevance for rbf as wells for drinking water supply are normally not installed in polluted areas an exception is the bank filtration scheme at friedrichshagen in berlin germany there specific treatment schemes are in operation to remove ammonium from landside groundwater that was affected by the former disposal of domestic and industrial sewage as well as sludge from a wastewater treatment plant rössner et al 2000 mineralization of organic matter from peat sediments leaching into the aquifer can also be responsible for high local concentrations 10 mg l of ammonium mastrocicco et al 2013 norrman et al 2015 4 5 vicinity of an abstraction well there are two processes relevant for nitrogen speciation that occur in an abstraction well and its vicinity mixing of water with different characteristics bourg and bertin 1993 and oxidation farnsworth and hering 2011 during abstraction bf from lower and upper layers which usually have distinct oxidizing conditions mix grischek et al 1998 furthermore bf and groundwater also mix depending on the position of the well and hydrogeological conditions the mixing of bf and groundwater can start tens of meters from the well bourg and bertin 1993 the consequences of mixing depend on the characteristics of the waters and therefore lead to a variety of physical e g dilution and chemical e g nitrification processes the second process that may arise is aeration in the well vicinity due to processes such as diffusive flux from the overlying unsaturated zone or gas entrapment due to water table oscillations induced by intermittent abstraction farnsworth and hering 2011 however oxidation due to an oscillating water table will rarely have a significant impact on the ammonium concentration because the amount of abstracted water in a day usually by far surpasses the volume of the cone of depression leading to only small amounts of oxygen proportional to the abstracted water in some cases oxidation near the abstraction well caused by turbulent abstraction enhance nitrification of ammonium as observed at the rbf site described by doussan et al 1998 5 comparison of ammonium concentrations in bank filtration worldwide ammonium has been measured in the abstracted water of several rbf sites across the world the fate of ammonium is linked with other nitrogen species and the reactions occurring in the different zones of rbf thus data was collected from the literature including water composition regarding ammonium and nitrate table 2 nitrite do and ph table a1 from surface water groundwater riverbed table a2 bf from observation wells in the bankside and abstracted water of several rbf sites furthermore the distances from the river to observation and abstraction wells travel times table a1 and proportion of bf and groundwater in the abstraction wells were also collected as not all publications about investigated sites contained all information missing data is listed as not available na in the tables detection limits for ammonium lie between 0 02 to 0 1 mg l 5 1 data analysis 20 of 37 investigated sites from the literature had ammonium concentrations in the abstracted water above the set limit of 0 5 mg l while 17 of 40 sites had higher than 0 5 mg l in the surface water compared to surface water ammonium increased in concentration in the abstracted water n 37 in 51 of the cases median of 1 mg l increase and decreased in 49 median of 0 6 mg l decrease nitrate n 33 on the other hand increased in only 27 of sites median of 3 2 mg l increase and decreased in 73 median of 8 8 mg l decrease the main cause for increase in nitrate concentrations is mixing with groundwater containing nitrate and the main cause for decrease is attenuation via denitrification surface water and bf characteristics e g ph do and nitrate concentrations distance from the riverbank travel time and portion of bf are influencing parameters in the ammonium content of abstracted water fig 3 and fig 4 using spearman s rank correlation no surface water parameter has shown a significant correlation p 0 05 with ammonium in the abstraction well except for ammonium itself rs 0 4 p 0 05 using mann whitney u test none of the ammonium populations from surface water parameters on fig 4 were significantly different from each other α 0 05 on the other hand ammonium concentrations at sites with above median nitrate and do in the abstracted water were significantly higher than below median sites α 0 01 there is also a strong negative correlation between nitrate rs 0 71 p 0 001 and do rs 0 77 p 0 001 in the abstraction well and ammonium concentrations sites with remaining do or nitrate have higher redox potential thus at those sites most or all of the ammonium has been nitrified which explains the strong correlations ammonium concentrations for ph in the abstracted water and bf were not significantly different between above and below median values α 0 05 greater than median distances and travel times to the abstraction wells tended to yield ammonium concentrations which were significantly higher than below median α 0 05 there are also positive correlations between travel time rs 0 64 p 0 05 and distance to abstraction well rs 0 35 p 0 05 with ammonium concentrations this might be explained by a few sites where bf interacts with polder water having a high ammonium content where rbf wells are located very far from the bank massmann et al 2004 pekdeger 2010 stuyfzand et al 2006 vet et al 2010 ammonium behavior is complex and thus difficulties arise in the analysis of its behavior during rbf the first difficulties derive from the lack of data in every zone most of the publications presented data for only some of the relevant zones frequently just surface and abstracted water this leaves part of the nitrogen story left untold and requires assumptions to infer which reactions are occurring and to which extent for example groundwater data is frequently absent leaving unanswered questions such as whether the source of ammonium is the groundwater or a reaction occurring during infiltration also few authors have investigated riverbed pore water quality table a2 and riverbed composition not shown which is where most reactions are occurring a proper evaluation of the biochemical characteristics of an rbf site must at least contain surface ground and abstracted water qualities with riverbed and or observation wells near the river being of great advantage secondly there is a great number of possible reactions and some of them have similar end results making it difficult to differentiate between two processes without more information such as isotopic concentrations for example simultaneous decrease of nitrate and increase of ammonium as observed at several sites boyd 1999 doussan et al 1998 dragon et al 2018 massmann et al 2004 pekdeger 2010 shamsuddin et al 2014 stuyfzand 1989 can be explained by two different sets of phenomena 1 denitrification of nitrate and mineralization of organic nitrogen to ammonium in the riverbed or 2 denitrification and dnra attenuating nitrate and dnra leading to an increase in ammonium it is also possible that both processes occur simultaneously but it is unclear whether both especially dnra have contributed significantly to an increase in ammonium concentration the effects of nitrification followed by denitrification also have the same observable result in the abstraction well as the sorption of ammonium which is decreased ammonium concentration these problems lead to uncertainties in the exact determination of ammonium behavior such that some of the rbf sites have more than one possibility for ammonium development 5 2 typical courses of ammonium concentration development during rbf it is likely that many of the processes occur to some extent at most of the sites for example mineralization of ammonium likely occurs at all sites although in many cases it did not happen to the degree as to noticeably increase the ammonium concentration in the bf alternatively mineralization can form ammonium which is quickly transformed to nitrate via nitrification or adsorbed onto riverbed aquifer material and is therefore undetectable in the abstraction wells e g pan et al 2018 the same is true for other processes such as sorption nitrification assimilation and anammox nevertheless the development of the ammonium concentration along the flow path from the surface water to the wells can be divided into seven typical courses for most bank filtration sites fig 5 of the 40 reviewed rbf sites 14 saw an ammonium increase in the bf relative to the river water due to mineralization in the riverbed but possibly also due to dnra six other locations might also have had the same behavior but lack of groundwater information makes the source of ammonium increase unclear of those 20 sites 15 maintained higher ammonium levels until abstraction with a median increase from surface to abstracted water of 0 8 mg l a fig 5 at two sites ammonium formed in the riverbed was partly or completely nitrified or adsorbed still in the riverbed b1 and at three sites ammonium was nitrified or adsorbed in the aquifer b2 14 sites had ammonium in the river which was partly or completely nitrified or adsorbed either in the riverbed or in the aquifer c the high oxygen levels in surface water and occasional increases in nitrate concentration in the bf of many sites leads to the assumption that nitrification plays a larger role than adsorption in ammonium attenuation in such cases on the other hand low oxygen and high nitrite concentration in the river water at the site described by sprenger and lorenzen 2014 point to anammox rather than nitrification being responsible for ammonium attenuation five sites had near zero ammonium concentration in surface water and saw no increase in the bf d additionally this might be the case for six other sites of those 11 sites only four contained little to no ammonium in the abstracted water while the others mixed with ammonium containing groundwater of all sites mixing with groundwater led to a noticeable increase in ammonium concentration in the abstracted water e1 at three to eight sites and to a decreased concentration e2 at two to three sites the assessed ammonium concentration development for each site is presented in table 2 of the 20 cases with ammonium concentrations higher than 0 5 mg l in the abstracted water five have mineralization and or dnra as the primary source of ammonium two have ammonium in the groundwater as a source seven had ammonium in the river water which was not attenuated below 0 5 mg l during subsurface flow and six had ammonium higher than 0 5 mg l in surface water after which mineralization dnra led to even higher ammonium concentrations although mineralization is the most often cause of ammonium increase it generally does not leads to very high ammonium concentrations while heavily polluted groundwater rössner et al 2000 vet et al 2010 and surface water doussan et al 1998 groeschke et al 2017 sprenger and lorenzen 2014 are a more often the cause of very high concentrations 6 implications for rbf operation and design there are four possible sources of ammonium at a given rbf site the groundwater leaching from the vadose zone the river water and reactions in the riverbed at sites where high ammonium concentrations pose challenges for post treatment knowing the source of ammonium can help determine optimal operation practices at the site if the source of ammonium is the groundwater e g vet et al 2010 abstraction of a higher portion of bf in abstracted water should be aimed if ammonium originates in reactions in the riverbed e g stuyfzand 1989 wells located near parts of the river with sufficient shear stress which causes erosion of the clogging layer schubert 2002 should be prioritized when this is not an alternative removal of the clogging layer as done in the nile egypt ghodeif et al 2018 paufler et al 2018a is an option for higher abstraction rates however the clogging layer has a very high efficiency for pathogen removal and pollution attenuation during rbf hiscock and grischek 2002 thus its removal must be considered with extreme caution if the source of ammonium is the river water e g sprenger and lorenzen 2014 there is little which can be done nonetheless the use of rbf may offer partial attenuation of ammonium and other pollutants and result in a less onerous post treatment compared to direct surface water abstraction during rbf anoxic conditions in the bankside aquifer inhibit nitrification thus preserving ammonium in the bf at a few rbf sites bourg and bertin 1993 doussan et al 1998 shamsuddin et al 2014 reintroduction of do to the anoxic bf causes nitrification and attenuates ammonium section 4 5 one might be inclined to attempt to operate an rbf scheme to reproduce such mechanisms in order to attenuate ammonium however some of them are not possible to reproduce as they depend on very specific aquifer conditions and may rarely occur e g oxygen input from the vadose zone mixing with oxic groundwater and turbulent flow during abstraction purposefully oscillating the water table by means of intermittent pumping is possible however in order for this to meaningfully impact do in abstracted water the thickness of the aquifer must be shallow drawdowns must be large and the pumping discontinuity must be frequent such conditions are unlikely to lead to a cost efficient operation and therefore this strategy is not recommended one alternative is infiltrating oxygenated water into the aquifer as is done during subsurface iron removal sir which has been proposed in combination with rbf in the past grischek et al 2013 during sir infiltrated water with do oxidizes reduced iron in the bf forming iron iii hydroxides which precipitate in the aquifer the efficiency of sir is driven up because reduced iron ions are adsorbed to the recently formed iron iii hydroxides the adsorption effect would not occur to the same extent with ammonium thus the efficiency of ammonium removal is expected to be much lower than iron removal site selection is critical for the cost efficient operation of rbf when it comes to ammonium surface water concentrations do not directly translate to abstracted water concentrations as seen in section 5 1 surface water parameters are largely uncorrelated with abstracted ammonium concentrations which highlights that decision makers must be careful not to overweight surface water quality in site selection decisions riverbed composition plays a critical role in resulting redox conditions and potential formation attenuation of ammonium and thus should be more often taken into consideration during decision making riverbeds with high amounts of organic material have more electron donor competitors for oxygen which limits attenuation of ammonium by nitrification furthermore particulate organic nitrogen pon present in the riverbed can be a source of ammonium through mineralization thus to avoid higher ammonium concentrations river reaches with low accumulation of organic matter are preferred and depositional reaches where organic matter is frequently replenished should be avoided the presence of macrophytes in streams leads to organic matter accumulation in the riverbed section 4 2 and therefore location with high amounts of macrophytes should also be avoided longer travel times to the abstraction well are usually preferred because it offers higher attenuation of most pollutants however this is not the case for ammonium in fact there is even a positive correlation between travel times and well distances with ammonium concentrations of the investigated data with longer travel times reducing conditions tend to prevail thus ammonium is not further attenuated in the bankside aquifer additionally longer well distances usually go together with lower bf portions in the abstracted water which can lead to higher ammonium concentrations dragon et al 2018 vet et al 2010 nitrogen pathways in freshwater river and riverbed environments are still not fully understood and the partitioning of competing nitrogen processes occurring in the riverbed during rbf has not yet been investigated in depth the relevance of the dnra process in ammonium formation during rbf is still unclear dnra is an undesirable process since it preserves nitrogen in the water as opposed to denitrification if dnra occurs at a substantial rate during rbf sites with high concentrations of nitrate in river water have the potential to form ammonium independently of mineralization potential in the riverbed however many authors suggest that dnra is only relevant when a high c n ratio is present thus high ammonium formation by dnra may only be possible at sites with very high organic content in the riverbed which would also have high mineralization potential a better understanding of which conditions favor dnra over denitrification can aid the prediction of ammonium formation during bank filtration anammox is a favorable process since it removes both nitrite and ammonium sites with high nitrate and ammonium in the river water could have both attenuated during bank filtration if anammox occurs even with low do concentration in the river however the conditions which allow for anammox occurrence during rbf are still poorly understood in order to provide more robust answers to these questions more research on the partition of the different pathways of ammonium oxidation and nitrate reduction in freshwater environments and during rbf is necessary the initial phase of rbf operation 15 months generally produces changing abstracted water quality wahaab et al 2019 found that it took 2 to 8 months until stable water quality was observed for selected hydrochemical parameters and 2 to 14 months for microbiological parameters at 3 rbf sites in egypt for one of the sites ammonium concentration was around 0 5 mg l during the first months of operation and later decreased to around 0 1 to 0 2 mg l remaining in this range in the following months it is possible that for this and other rbf sites the change in flow conditions induced by bank filtration results in increased mineralization during the initial phase of rbf which later decreases as easily degradable organic matter in the riverbed gets consumed this does not apply to sites with constant replenishment of organic matter such as depositional reaches in rivers nonetheless to determine suitability and necessary post treatment regarding ammonium at potential rbf sites the authors suggest operating a pilot well for the period of up to one year or until stable water quality conditions are reached discontinuous pumping can have negative effects on the quality of abstracted water during rbf especially with regard to manganese and iron bartak et al 2015 grischek and paufler 2017 ammonium concentrations can also be undesirably affected by intermittent pumping when the pumping is interrupted the water level gradient towards the well slowly decreases eventually reaching pre pumping rates resulting in longer residence times in the hyporheic zone as a consequence of longer residence times stronger reducing conditions are established in the riverbed comer warner et al 2020 and the rate of mineralization of organic nitrogen is increased wang et al 2018 when pumping is restarted water which remained longer in the riverbed is abstracted and ammonium concentrations might be temporarily higher in a portion of the water before returning to normal levels of course mixing of bf portions of different age in the aquifer before abstraction via the well will buffer such an effect few studies offer results from long term operation of rbf with respect to ammonium doussan et al 1998 showed how sorption of ammonium in the aquifer material can result in lower concentrations of ammonium in the abstracted water for many years but it will eventually break through however none of the other reviewed studies showed a similar trend perhaps because ammonium sorption or long term operation were not examined but likely also because rbf sites do not tend to be selected for locations with high sorption capacity e g high amounts of clay in the aquifer ammonium and nitrate concentrations tend to fluctuate in the river due to variations in runoff river discharge fertilizer application sewage disposal and biological activity inorganic nitrogen concentrations in surface water tend to be higher during winter dragon et al 2018 grischek et al 1998 massmann et al 2004 regnery et al 2015 although other factors might be at play lower biological activity and consequently lower removal rates during the winter months is one likely cause regnery et al 2015 reaction rates in the riverbed are also seasonally influenced higher biological activity at higher temperatures has reportedly led to higher denitrification nitrification and mineralization potentials during rbf grischek et al 1998 gross wittke et al 2010 massmann et al 2008 pan et al 2018 higher temperatures are linked to higher oxygen consumption in riverbed sediments diem et al 2013 paufler et al 2018b rohr et al 2014 much higher attenuation rates of ammonium via nitrification during rbf have been observed in winter dash et al 2008 regnery et al 2015 higher increases of ammonium in the riverbed and abstraction wells have also been observed in summer compared to winter dragon et al 2018 pan et al 2018 combining those observations lead to the assumption that warmer seasons and warmer regions are more susceptible to ammonium increase during rbf therefore seasonal variations are expected to play a larger role then long term operation trends 7 conclusion ammonium is an undesirable substance in the abstracted water of rbf schemes due mainly to the complications it causes during post treatment ammonium concentrations of infiltrated surface water may both increase or decrease during bank filtration because the fate of ammonium during rbf is the result of a large number of variables and reactions the review of 40 rbf sites allows the following conclusions typical concentrations of ammonium in the abstracted water of rbf sites vary from 0 1 to 1 7 mg l median of 0 6 mg l while typical concentrations in the surface water vary from 0 06 to 0 8 mg l median of 0 22 mg l the most frequentlyobserved source of ammonium in bank filtrate is mineralization of organic nitrogen in the riverbed followed by ammonium content in the surface water the most common sink of ammonium during rbf is nitrification in the riverbed other processes potentially affecting ammonium concentrations during rbf areassimilation sorption anammox and dnra ammonium concentrations can have implications for the operation and planning of rbf schemes riverbeds with high organic matter content can lead to the formation of ammonium during surface water infiltration so wells should be located along parts of the river with sufficient shear stress to avoid deposition of fine sediments rich in organic carbon and nitrogen stable conditions of ammonium concentrations might be achieved only after many months of operation thus further decisions about operation and post treatment should be considered only after operation of a pilot well for several months continuous pumping should be practiced in orderto avoid temporary increases in ammonium concentrations upon restarting pumping activities in most cases seasonal variations were found to play a larger role than long term operational trends in

anammox bacteria utilize nitrite as the electron acceptor and ammonium as the electron donor to produce dinitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions van de graaf et al 1996 in the past two decades this process has evolved as an efficient and cost effective technique for wastewater nitrogen removal significantly reducing energy consumption chemical requirement and sludge production compared with the conventional nitrification denitrification process kartal et al 2010 thus far several hundred full scale anammox treatment systems have been implemented worldwide for treating high strength ammonium wastewater such as digestate poultry and pharmaceutical wastewater lackner et al 2014 lotti et al 2012 shi et al 2016 more recently mainstream anammox is proposed as a novel technology to achieve carbon and energy neutral treatment of domestic wastewater wett et al 2013 organics are chemically complicated and present in a broad range of concentrations in both domestic and industrial wastewater they have drawn much attention in wastewater anammox studies due to their significant impacts on the efficiency and stability of anammox processes fig s1a particularly the number of publications on wastewater anammox increased by 14 annually during the past 10 years and approximately 27 of these articles involved organics as one of the keywords fig s1a among them exogenous organics have been overwhelmingly studied fig s1b mainly focusing on how biodegradable and recalcitrant compounds affect anammox nitrogen removal from an engineering perspective the roles of biodegradable organics in driving coupled denitrification anammox cao et al 2020 partial nitritation anammox denitrification li et al 2020 and denitratation anammox processes du et al 2019b ma et al 2020 have been reviewed recently however the different responses of diverse microbial groups in anammox reactors to endogenous and exogenous organics which are fundamentally important to maintain stable microbial communities have not been reviewed this review aims to bring on the stage the hidden effects of organics on wastewater anammox communities from a microbial ecology perspective it synthesizes the metabolic interactions between anaob and a broad range of coexisting populations that have been largely overlooked discusses the roles of endogenous organics in determining anammox biofilm granule structure and function and also reveals the microbial interactions within complex wastewater anammox communitities by meta analysis on the massive 16s rrna gene sequencing data collected from literature this information would be useful to understand the organic drivers of community assembly enhance the activity of anaob and maintain the stability of anammox communities in the end the importance of organics management in enhancing the efficiency of wastewater anammox treatment is restated and perspectives on future research needs are discussed 2 effects of exogenous organics on anammox communities exogenous organics are widely present in wastewater anammox systems in domestic wastewater the concentrations of ammonia and cod are typically in the range of 20 45 mg n l 1 and 180 500 mg

can improve quorum sensing and stimulate anammox growth liu et al 2020 excessive rcod would otherwise promote heterotrophic growth competing with anaob for nitrite kraiem et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b 2 1 metabolic versatility of anaob on organics anaob were initially considered to be obligate chemolithoautotrophic organisms which later on were found capable of mixotrophic growth via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra kartal et al 2012 when ammonia is limited anaob can use h2 fe2 monoamine dimethylamine and a variety of simple organic compounds e g formate acetate and propionate as alternative electron donors to replenish electrons for growth guven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007a kartal et al 2007b kartal et al 2008 strous et al 2006 in general candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadiaand candidatus jettenia were the dominant anaob in mainstream anammox systems nlr 0 6 kg n m 3d 1 with relative abundances of 0 1 38 0 1 13 6 1 3 37 6 respectively akaboci et al 2018 ding et al 2018 feng et al 2018 liang et al 2018 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 genomic analyses suggested that five out of the six anammox genera discovered so far are capable of oxidizing simple organic acids candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis strous et al 2006 candidatus brocadia fulgida gori et al 2011 candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus kartal et al 2007b candidatus jettenia caeni ali et al 2015 and candidatus scalindua profunda van de vossenberg et al 2013 mixotrophic growth with the addition of simple organic acids resulted in higher biomass yield of anaob than autotrophic growth feng et al 2018 during full dnra eq 1 nitrite reduction to ammonium is the rate limiting step limited organics promote partial dnra nitrate to nitrite only over full dnra by anaob eq 2 castro barros et al 2017 from a thermodynamic point of view partial dnra yields more energy than full dnra 552 vs 500 kj mol acetate partial dnra in combination with anammox further enhances energy production 1984 kj mol

min 1 g 1 of protein ali et al 2015 kartal et al 2007b kartal et al 2008 van de vossenberg et al 2008 there are two possible explanations for the discrepancy 1 thermodynamically formate is more favorable than acetate and propionate as electron donors the δgo values of organics oxidation are 80 8 69 0 and 69 3 kj e eq respectively rittmann and mccarty 2012 2 formate can be directly incorporated into cellular metabolites by anaob via the methyl branch of the wood ljungdahl pathway whereas acetate needs to be fully oxidized to co2 and re assimilated lawson et al 2020 candidatus brocadia fulgida consumed acetate more efficiently than other organics 61 vs 20 51 μg cod min 1 g 1 protein kartal et al 2007b kartal et al 2008 van de vossenberg et al 2008 their up regulated dnra and acetate metabolic pathways can explain their superiority in acetate utilization and the stimulated growth upon acetate addition feng et al 2019 despite of the widely reported versatility of anaob in using small molecule organics there is a lack of experimentally determined growth rates and yields for different anaob populations growing on different organics mixotrophy gives anaob growth advantages especially under nutrient limited conditions and could be one of the reasons explaining their prevalence in diverse environment 2 2 inhibition of organics on anaob alcohols aldehydes phenols antibiotics can exert inhibitory effects on enriched anaob or wastewater anammox processes table 1 generally the inhibitory effects of phenols and antibiotics are reversible but the toxicity of methanol is stronger and mostly irreversible anammox granules and biofilm exhibit higher tolerance to toxicants than flocculent cultures methanol is widely used to facilitate denitrification at wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to its low cost hellinga et al 1998 however it is one of the most potent inhibitors to anaob and thus challenges may emerge if mainstream anammox and methanol facilitated denitrification are implemented in sequence at wwtps the effects and mechanisms of methanol inhibition of anaob have been summarized in a previous review jin et al 2012 briefly candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis exhibited higher methanol resistance than candidatus brocadia fulgida isaka et al 2008 oshiki et al 2011 formaldehyde from methanol oxidation by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao in anaob could be the actual inhibitor causing protein damage by irreversible cross linking with peptides metz et al 2004 schalk et al 2000 methanol inhibition was stronger for anaob in reactors with higher nlr where hao activity was also higher table 1 phenolic compounds especially phenol and p nitrophenol are the major constituents of wastewater from coal gasification plants and anaerobic digesters collins et al 2005 anaob inhibition by phenol is rapid and reversible lyu et al 2018 yang et al 2013a specifically phenol can bind to the α and γ subunits of hydrazine synthase hzs leading to competition with haem and the inhibition can be alleviated once phenol is detached the specific anammox activity saa of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis decreased by 56 in 18 h with 4 3 mmol l 1 phenol and 26 in 7 days with 4 3 mmol l 1 phenol lyu et al 2018 surprisingly the saa of an anammox biofilm gradually increased from 5 to 62 kg nh4 n m 3d 1 as the phenol concentration increased from 0 5 to 5 9 mmol l 1 in 480 days toh and ashbolt 2002 indicating potential acclimation of anaob to phenol or degradation detoxification of the toxicant by other microbes in the community antibiotics are commonly found in high strength veterinary and pharmaceutical wastewaters exerting inhibitory effect by disrupting cell wall synthesis protein synthesis or dna replication and repair fu et al 2020 lotti et al 2012 roose amsaleg and laverman 2016 oxytetracycline has been reported to exert the greatest inhibition on anammox activity inhibition rate 91 oxytetracycline 50 mg l 1 duration 7 days yang et al 2013b nevertheless it s concluded so far that the inhibition effects on anammox activity vary upon anammox species types and concentrations of antibiotics as well as exposure duration fernández et al 2009 lotti et al 2012 sguanci et al 2017 compared with short term inhibitory tests 6 24 h greater inhibition on anaob activities by antibiotics has been observed during long term tests 12 100 days table 1 though short term inhibitory effects may be underestimated because of the rapid adsorption of antibiotics onto anammox biofilm or granules moreover the positively charged enrofloxacin can be imported into anaob anammoxosome through channel forming proteins more efficiently than the negatively charged doxycycline kartal et al 2013 leading to more rapid and profound inhibition on anaob sguanci et al 2017 a more standard procedure is required for testing the inhibitory effects of inhibitory compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations roose amsaleg and laverman 2016 the inhibition by organic compounds can be relieved by granulation bioaugmentation and or detoxification table 1 biofilm growth and granulation can increase the resistance of anammox cultures to inhibitory compounds for example the estimated half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 values of doxycycline were 121 and 378 mg l 1 for granular and flocculent anammox sludge respectively alvarino et al 2014 sguanci et al 2017 this was potentially because of the higher adsorption and bioconversion rates of organics on anammox granule surface and biofilm exterior compared with flocculent sludge jiang et al 2002 yap et al 1999 there were studies showing that lab scale wastewater anammox reactors regularly bioaugmented with fresh and enriched anammox cultures showed high robustness tang et al 2011a zhang et al 2018a similarly full scale mainstream anammox processes regularly bioaugmented with sidestream anammox granules are expected to be more resistant to stressors wett et al 2013 anaob are also potentially prevented from organic inhibition by coexisting microbes which are capable of degrading inhibitory compounds e g the denitrifier klebsiella sp sqy5 can degrade tetracycline shao et al 2018 and ammonia oxidizers can co oxidize antibiotics with ammonia men et al 2017 2 3 effects of organics on other functional populations combined processes such as pn a and partial denitrification anammox pd a rely on extensive metabolic cooperation between anaob and other microbial groups to achieve efficient nitrogen removal mainstream anammox reactors can achieve desired nitrogen removal efficiency nre 70 with the addition of acetate c n 0 5 1 4 table 2 in any anammox reactors especially those under mainstream conditions anaob accounted only for 0 1 38 of the whole community leaving the rest dominated by other populations therefore the effects of organics on the metabolism of coexisting populations and their metabolic interactions with anaob have been paid more attention currently 2 3 1 effects of organics on autotrophs in one stage pn a reactor ideally ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonium oxidizing archaea aoa convert about half of the influent ammonia to nitrite which is then utilized by anaob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob compete with anaob for nitrite causing nitrate accumulation moreover complete ammonium oxidizing comammox bacteria show an high affinity for ammonia km 0 7 μg nh4 n l 1 and produce nitrate kits et al 2017 these autotrophic nitrifying microorganisms albeit less abundant than anaob are drastically influenced by organics leading to fluctuations in community composition and total nitrogen removal in one stage pn a process nitrosomonas spp were the predominant aob with relative abundances of 1 5 in pn a reactors gilbert et al 2014 liu et al 2017 the presence of organics in pn a systems can exacerbate the washout of aob and thus deteriorate reactor performance organics would stimulate heterotrophic growth that competes with aob for limited oxygen although aob such as nitrosomonas europaea can utilize a variety of organics including pyruvate lactate and acetate for anaerobic growth their maximum growth rates are much lower than denitrifiers growing on acetate e g μmax 0 03 0 05 d 1 vs 3 7 d 1 mokhayeri et al 2006 schmidt 2009 with the addition of glucose c n 1 both the relative abundance and activity of aob in pn a reactors decreased substantially wen et al 2016 moreover recalcitrant organics e g humic acids in anaerobic digestion effluent could cause the enzyme deactivation or diffusion limitation of aob in pn a process zhang et al 2018b candidatus nitrososphaera are the predominant aoa in anammox systems which could be enriched up to 3 44 of the community in an intermittently aerated sequencing batch reactor qiu et al 2019 small organics e g malate succinate and pyruvate could accelerate the growth of aoa sauder et al 2017 tourna et al 2011 these organics likely act by detoxifying hydrogen peroxide produced during ammonia oxidation rather than direct assimilation by aoa kim et al 2016 the overgrowth of nob nitrospira has been frequently reported in mainstream pn a reactors accounting for 3 16 of the total microbial community akaboci et al 2018 liu et al 2017 compared with nitrite oxidation nob nitrospira growing on formate leads to higher biomass yield 0 57 gvss cod 1 vs 0 07 gvss no2 n 1 and maximum growth rate 3 4 d 1 vs 0 76 d 1 button 1998 koch et al 2015 winkler et al 2012 the metabolic versatility on formate brings additional difficulties in nob suppression in pn a reactors miao et al 2018 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2014 comammox bacteria can be unintentionally enriched in pn a reactors especially in those receiving low concentrations of ammonia and operated at low do and long srt camejo et al 2017 roots et al 2019 similar to nob nitrospira genomic analysis of comammox nitrospira suggested their capability of oxidizing formate poghosyan et al 2019 their high affinities to ammonia and nitrite and potential metabolic versatility in utilizing formate may explain their overgrowth in pn a reactors under mainstream conditions with organics 2 3 2 effects of organics on heterotrophs heterotrophs are generally much more abundant than anaob in anammox communities du et al 2017 gonzalez gil et al 2015 hu et al 2018 growing on a wide range of organics in wastewater influent and or externally added laureni et al 2016 le et al 2019 complete denitrifiers fermentative dnra bacteria and nitrite dependent methane oxidation n damo bacteria compete with anaob for nitrite whereas partial denitrifiers and nitrate dependednt methane oxidation n damo archaea facilitate anaob growth by providing nitrite denitrifiers in anammox reactors are represented by denitratisoma dokdonella limnobacter and thauera fig 2 and their relative abundances range from 0 3 to 23 6 of anammox communities akaboci et al 2018 cao et al 2016 pereira et al 2017 by controlling organics types e g acetate or glycerol and or c no3 n ratio 2 3 5 some denitrifiers can perform stable denitratation reduction of nitrate to nitrite that enhance anammox activity cao et al 2013 du et al 2017 du et al 2019a ji et al 2018 le et al 2019 lu and chandran 2010a lu et al 2011 there are two reasons explaining acetate glycerol facilitated denitratation 1 acetate and glycerol are mostly converted to poly 3 hydroxybutyrate as a storage compound rather than being used for biosynthesis yielding more electrons to sustain the activity of the electron costly nitrate reductase majone et al 2001 2 acetate and glycerol donate electrons to cytochrome b or ubiquinone preferentially accepted by nitrate reductase in the upstream of the electron transfer chain rather than nitrite reductase downstream van rijn et al 1996 though limited influent organics can induce denitratation they can also trigger n2o production in anammox reactors e g n2o emission factor 0 46 at c n 0 1 jia et al 2018 kampschreur et al 2009 lu and chandran 2010b heterotrophic dnra bacteria in anammox reactors are dominated by fermentative anaerolineaceae and ignavibacteria oxidizing organic macromolecules to small organic acids and h2 while reducing nitrate to nitrite and then ammonium du et al 2017 gonzalez gil et al 2015 hu et al 2018 a recent study suggested that excessive fermentative dnra bacteria led to deteriorated anammox performance by competing with anaob for nitrite and other metabolic necessities keren et al 2020 organics types can influence anaob fermentative dnra bacteria interactions in an anammox reactor supplied with glucose anaerolineaceae and ignavibacteria increased from 34 to 54 and overgrew conventional denitrifiers when c n ratio increased from 0 to 2 whereas the relative abundance of anaob decrease substantially wang et al 2019a in comparison acetate reduced the abundances of fermentative dnra bacteria in anammox reactors wang et al 2018 n damo can be been coupled with anammox process to achieve simultaneous removal of nitrogen and methane from landfill leachate where n damo bacteria and archaea accounted for up to 7 18 and 3 37 of the anammox community respectively nie et al 2019 nie et al 2020 xie et al 2018 methane as an alternative carbon source e g dissolved concentration 20 mg l 1 can be used by n damo archaea to reduce nitrate and the produced nitrite is sebsequently utilized by anaob and n damo bacteria wang et al 2019b 3 endogenous organics and their effects on anammox communities endogenous organicsare derived from microbial metabolism mainly in the forms of eps and smp with complex compositions eps are the backbones of anammox biofilm granule influencing the mass transfer efficiency adsorption ability structural stability and stress tolerance hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 sheng et al 2010 smp determine the metabolic interactions between anaob and coexisting heterotrophs lawson et al 2017 sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 understanding the dynamics and roles of endogenous organics is a part of the continuing efforts to optimize the start up and operation of wastewater anammox reactors 3 1 effects of eps on anammox biofilm structure and function compared with anaerobic and nitrifying granules eps in anammox granules exhibited higher content 111 410 mg gvss 1 vs 60 74 mg gvss 1 martinez et al 2004 ni et al 2015 tang et al 2011b wu et al 2009 zhu et al 2018 lower polysaccharide to protein ratio 0 8 2 3 vs 2 5 3 1 and lower hydrophilic to hydrophobic ratio 0 2 0 7 vs 3 13 chen et al 2019 hou et al 2015 niu et al 2016 sheng et al 2010 sun et al 2018 anammox growth rate in biofilm system is determined by mass transfer including free diffusion and the lung like breathing diffusion in pore water eps may serve as the ion transport tunnel between biofilm and bulk liquid sustaining lung like breathing behavior that enhances mass transfer efficiency xu et al 2019 excessive eps synthesized in heavily loaded anammox granular systems tang et al 2011b otherwise may adversely influence mass transfer by occupying the substrate transport tunnel eps control the retention efficiency of anaob by influencing the mechanical strength of biofilms and settleability of granules decreased eps were often associated with granule disintegration and or low settleability wang et al 2019c zhu et al 2018 adding proteinase k β amylase and cellulose also caused reductions in eps content and mechanical strength of anammox granules lin and wang 2017 moreover high nlr in an anammox granular reactor led to excessive eps production poor sludge settleability and granule floating possibly due to decreased porosity and permeability of granules to release n2 chen et al 2014 lu et al 2012 eps protect anammox communities against stresses such as low temperature heavy metals and high salinity in a columned anammox sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr eps content increased from 118 to 234 mg gvss 1 when temperature decreased from 19 7 to 13 7 c which was probably beneficial to maintain the tn removal of 87 5 2 2 zhang et al 2020a to better cope with low temperature 16 c pulsed electric field was applied in anammox reactors to enhance eps secretion and saa zhang et al 2019 anammox granules exhibited higher ic50 values for copper nanoparticles cu nps than flocs 4 64 1 24 vs 3 27 0 79 mg gvss 1 presumably due to cu nps adsorption by eps zhang et al 2017 polysaccharide eps increased from 2 to 6 mg gvss 1 when salinity increased from 0 to 30 g l 1 in an anammox reactor and this again helped to maintain the desired nitrogen removal at 86 88 fang et al 2018 polysaccharide eps can regulate cell membrane permeability by acting as a hydrogel reducing water loss and maintaining saa lotti et al 2019 3 2 effects of smp on the interactions between anaob and heterotrophs the heterotrophic communities in wastewater anammox reactors are to a certain extent similar in composition regardless of their drastically varied operating conditions probably due to the anaob heterotroph interactions based on smp gonzalez gil et al 2015 hu et al 2018 pereira et al 2017 smp consist of biodegradable organics e g polysaccharides and proteins signaling molecules e g acylated homoserine lactones ahls and secondary metabolites e g vitamin b12 soh et al 2020 smp secreted by anaob support heterotrophic growth via cross feeding which in turn benefits the growth of anaob most heterotrophs in anammox communities lack catabolic pathways for amino acids with a high biosynthetic cost and therefore are selected to degrade those that are less costly to synthesize and directly incorporate costly amino acids into protein synthesis lawson et al 2017 candidatusbrocadia are able to synthesize vitamins b1 b7 and b12 which are the auxotrophic necessities for fermentative dnra bacteria e g populations in chloroflexi and chlorobi keren et al 2020 lawson et al 2017 in return most anaob lack genes for synthesizing molybdenum cofactor moco and folate that are essential for co2 fixation but heterotrophic fimbriimonadaceae and phyllobacteriaceae can produce these metabolites zhao et al 2018 ahls stimulate anammox activity and biofilm formation the addition of c6 hsl and c8 hsl at 30 mg l 1 into anammox reactors increased the anammox activity by 20 35 and growth rate of anaob by 28 tang et al 2015 specific ahls can upregulate a broad range of pathways in anaob involving electron transfer energy and or biomass synthesis e g nad tang et al 2018 the addition of c6 hsl c8 hsl andc12 hsl at 2 μmol l 1 also increased the eps content especially protein eps in anammox biofilm by 20 32 tang et al 2018 ahl inactivation by vanillin and porcine kidney acylase i led to a significant decrease in eps content and polysaccharide to protein ratio destabilizing biofilm structure and reducing anammox activity zhao et al 2016 as an alternative to the costly ahl addition introducing ahl producing bacteria to wastewater anammox systems will potentially improve nitrogen removal efficiency and biofilm stability ding et al 2015 4 meta analysis of anammox communities influenced by organics the microbial interactions within complex wastewater anammox communitities can be deciphered via inter taxa and taxa environment correlations and co occurrence network analyses 16s rrna gene sequencing data have been generated in large amounts with the widespread use of next generation sequencing techqniues and have been applied in studying microbial correlations in extremely heterogeneous microbial communities o brien et al 2016 rosa et al 2018 wu et al 2019 we analyzed 149 sets of 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing data collected from different types of wastewater anammox reactors e g anammox anammox denitrification partial nitritation anammox with varied nlr 0 06 1 52 kg n m 3d 1 and organic types e

identified and their relative abundances in anammox samples at different nlrs and influent c n ratios were compared fig 3 the pair wise correlations among core taxa and their correlations with key operating parameters were calculated fig 4 a co occurrence network was constructed using sparse correlations for compositional data sparcc correlation analysis where 7 keystone taxa were identified and the modular structure of abundant otus and their inter taxa correlations were displayed figs 5 and 6 4 1 core taxa and their correlations with organics overall the alpha diversity metrics of anammox communities chao1 shannon and simpson increased with c n ratio indicating potentially higher functional redundancy with elevated organics inputs fig s4 nineteen otus belonging to planctomycetes 3 anaerolineaceae 4 ignavibacteria 2 burkholderiaceae 2 rhodocyclaceae 2 gammaproteobacteria 2 gemmatimonadaceae 1 steroidobacteraceae 1 rhodanobacteraceae 1 and nitrosomonadaceae 1 were identified as the core taxa fig 2 core taxa were defined as the frequently abundant microbes detected in more than 80 of the samples constituting the top 80 of the total reads in more 50 of the total analyzed samples wu et al 2019 they participate in diverse microbial processes modulate the assembly of community and potentially make significant contributions to nitrogen turnover in anammox systems saunders et al 2016 the relative abundances of the 19 core taxa vary significantly from 2 3 to 68 5 in wastewater anammox communities and are heavily influenced by c n ratio and nlr fig 3 in the absence of influent organics c n 0 n 27 fermentative dnra bacteria anaerolineaceae and ignavibacteria growing on endogenous organics are the most abundant core taxa fig 3 higher nlrs can stimulate anammox activity producing more smp for fermentative dnra bacteria which in turn replenish nitrite for anaob keren et al 2020 lawson et al 2017 consistently dnra bacteria core taxa anaerolineaceaeand anaob core taxa brocadiaceaeare positively correlated with nlr and nre table s2 in the presence of influent organics the relative abundances of denitrifying core taxa rhodocyclaceae and burkholderiaceae in the community increase 8 1 13 5 and 4 7 18 3 respectively with influent c n ratio 0 3 fig 3 whereas anaerolineaceae andignavibacteriadecreasesubstantially 21 1 6 4 and 10 2 4 1 respectively in most cases acetate is supplied as the readily biodegradable carbon source table s1 fermentative bacteria mainly grow by decomposing organic macromolecules and thus are outcompeted by heterotrophic denitrifiers which can oxidize acetate more rapidly when glucose is used instead it otherwise stimulats the growth of fermentative core taxa anaerolineaceae andignavibacteria over denitrifying core taxa wang et al 2019a similarly meta analysis also suggests significant positive correlations between c n and denitrifying core taxa rhodocyclaceae and burkholderiaceae fig 4 in contrary denitrifying core taxa gemmatimonadaceaeare negatively correlated with c n and positively correlated with nlr because they potentially grow on endogenous organics produced by anaob rather than exogenous organics in order to better reveal the effects of organics on core taxa abundances samples containing exogenous organics were further grouped into low strength wastewater lsw n 18 and high strength wastewater hsw n 36 according to their nlrs 0 06 0 31 and 0 40 1 52 kg n m 3d 1 respectively core taxa are in general more abundant in the hsw group fig 3 c n is negatively correlated with fermentative core taxa ignavibacteria and anaob core taxa unclassifiedplanctomycetes and positively correlated with the denitrifying core taxa burkholderiaceae and rhodocyclaceae table s2 in the lsw group however neither cod nor c n display significant correlations with any core taxa significant correlations among core taxa are strong indictors for their cooperative or competitive interactions within anammox community overall core taxa rhodocyclaceae and brocadiaceaeare positively correlated fig 4 where rhodocyclaceae potentially perform denitratation supplying nitrite to brocadiaceae du et al 2017 core taxaunclassifiedplanctomycetes anaerolineaceae ignavibacteria and burkholderiaceae also exhibited positive inter taxa correlations suggesting the preserved cooperations between anaob fermenters and denitrifiers across different anammox communities based on the cross feeding of endogenous organics in addition to core taxa other populations could also be functionally important irrespective of their relative abundances e g keystone taxa and even rare populations 0 1 can drive community composition and function banerjee et al 2018 manipulation of these driver species can potentially enable effective control of the whole community towards better performance for example a potential strategy could be bioaugmentation with partial denitrifier rhodocyclaceaeto enhance denitratation or quickly establish a denitratation anammox community 4 2 microbial co occurrence network and keystone taxa the microbial co occurrence network further reflects more detailed microbial interactions functional modules and keystone taxa in analyzed wastewater anammox communities fig 5 216 nodes representing taxa with significant correlations sparcc r 0 6 p 0 01 and 1916 edges representing relationships between nodes are displayed in the network nodes are classified into 11 modules and each module represents clustered microbes with similar functions parter et al 2007 taxa in the first 6 modules compose about 70 of the total community in each sample fig s5 7 keystone taxa are identified as highly connected populations or hubs with high degree 30 high closeness centrality 0 4 and low betweenness centrality 0 01 in the occurrence network berry and widder 2014 they potentially form a keystone guild affecting community functions by selectively modulating accessory taxa that connect with them among them five belong to proteobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi located in module 5 fig 6 otu311 belonging to chloroflexi likely a fermentative dnra in module 2 are both core and keystone taxa and thus may have greater influences on community assembly than other keystone taxa significant correlations between keystone taxa and environmental factors further suggest their roles in community assembly overall c n is positively correlated with 4 keystone taxa belonging to betaproteobacteria acidobacteria caldilineaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae while nlr is negatively correlated with 2 keystone taxa chloroflexi and hyphomicrobiaceae table s2 most keystone taxa are facultative heterotrophs using a variety of organics e g hyphomicrobiaceae lu et al 2014 organics can therefore reinforce the associations between keystone taxa and other taxa in the guilds where the latter arise because of resource sharing niche partitioning and spatiotemporal coherence banerjee et al 2018 tracking the abundances of keystone taxa would be helpful to evaluate microbial community stability and predict performance and community fluctuations in anammox reactors 5 conclusion and perspectives this review summarizes the comprehensive effects of organics on the microbial ecology i e community structure and function of wastewater anammox processes toxicity of inhibitory organics e g methanol phenols and antibiotics on anammox activity varies upon organic types anammox species and reactor operating conditions acetate and glycerol are favorable organics that promote denitratation anammox but excessive exogenous organics intensify the competition between anaob and heterotrophic denitrifiers for nitrite in the absence of exogenous organics biodegradable smp serve as the main carbon sources for fermentative bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers and in particular amino acids vitamin b12 and ahls also mediate metabolic interactions between anaob and heterotrophs the microbial co occurrence network established herein is a step forward to understand the preserved microbial interactions in diverse anammox communities 19 core taxa and 7 keystone taxa are identified exhibiting strong correlations with c n and nlr however their exact roles in sustaining community function are yet to be unraveled in individual communities there have been numerous studies aiming to optimize seed sludge nlr and temperature for better operation of anammox reactors but the knowledge on organics management is limited especially for mainstream anammox processes a widely accepted concept configuration of mainstream anammox is the a b process where organics are captured in a stage for anaerobic bioenergy production and nitrogen is subsequently removed in b stage by deammonification in order to achieve the desired nitrogen removal in b stage typically 70 organics have to be properly managed according to nlr and other reactor operating parameters in the future the following research needs should be given priority 1 optimize exogenous organics management stretegies for mainstream anammox reactors deciphering factors that lead to altered organics management e g organics types and c n including but not limited to wastewater composition regulatory requirements and treatment flow sheet 2 development of endogenous organics as alternative carbon sources for nitrate reduction understanding their roles in facilitating the growth and metabolic interactions between anaob heterotrophs is needed to make full use of them towards enhanced biofilm stability stress tolerance and total nitrogen removal 3 metabolic network analysis based on representative metagenomic data metagenomics can yield more information on the metabolic functions of both abundant and rare populations in the community unraveling the complex metabolic interactions among these populations especially core and keystone taxa is useful to assemble more efficient wastewater anammox

anammox bacteria utilize nitrite as the electron acceptor and ammonium as the electron donor to produce dinitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions van de graaf et al 1996 in the past two decades this process has evolved as an efficient and cost effective technique for wastewater nitrogen removal significantly reducing energy consumption chemical requirement and sludge production compared with the conventional nitrification denitrification process kartal et al 2010 thus far several hundred full scale anammox treatment systems have been implemented worldwide for treating high strength ammonium wastewater such as digestate poultry and pharmaceutical wastewater lackner et al 2014 lotti et al 2012 shi et al 2016 more recently mainstream anammox is proposed as a novel technology to achieve carbon and energy neutral treatment of domestic wastewater wett et al 2013 organics are chemically complicated and present in a broad range of concentrations in both domestic and industrial wastewater they have drawn much attention in wastewater anammox studies due to their significant impacts on the efficiency and stability of anammox processes fig s1a particularly the number of publications on wastewater anammox increased by 14 annually during the past 10 years and approximately 27 of these articles involved organics as one of the keywords fig s1a among them exogenous organics have been overwhelmingly studied fig s1b mainly focusing on how biodegradable and recalcitrant compounds affect anammox nitrogen removal from an engineering perspective the roles of biodegradable organics in driving coupled denitrification anammox cao et al 2020 partial nitritation anammox denitrification li et al 2020 and denitratation anammox processes du et al 2019b ma et al 2020 have been reviewed recently however the different responses of diverse microbial groups in anammox reactors to endogenous and exogenous organics which are fundamentally important to maintain stable microbial communities have not been reviewed this review aims to bring on the stage the hidden effects of organics on wastewater anammox communities from a microbial ecology perspective it synthesizes the metabolic interactions between anaob and a broad range of coexisting populations that have been largely overlooked discusses the roles of endogenous organics in determining anammox biofilm granule structure and function and also reveals the microbial interactions within complex wastewater anammox communitities by meta analysis on the massive 16s rrna gene sequencing data collected from literature this information would be useful to understand the organic drivers of community assembly enhance the activity of anaob and maintain the stability of anammox communities in the end the importance of organics management in enhancing the efficiency of wastewater anammox treatment is restated and perspectives on future research needs are discussed 2 effects of exogenous organics on anammox communities exogenous organics are widely present in wastewater anammox systems in domestic wastewater the concentrations of ammonia and cod are typically in the range of 20 45 mg n l 1 and 180 500 mg cod l 1 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 where biodegradable cod varies from 30 to 50 of the total cod sun et al 2016 inhigh strength wastewater such as anaerobic digestate the concentrations of ammonia and cod are typically in 500 1500 mg n l 1 and 500 1800 mg cod l 1 c n ratio 0 5 3 lackner et al 2014 one stage partial nitritation anammox pn a processes simultaneously remove biodegradable carbon and nitrogen in a single reactor in two stage pn a processes 75 of biodegradable cod can be removed in nitritation wang et al 2020 and the residual biodegradable cod flow into the downstream anammox process fig s2 stimulating mixotrophic growth of anaob and coexisting heterotrophs fig 1 the remaining recalcitrant cod is mainly composed of humic acids and fulvic acids which at low concentrations can improve quorum sensing and stimulate anammox growth liu et al 2020 excessive rcod would otherwise promote heterotrophic growth competing with anaob for nitrite kraiem et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b 2 1 metabolic versatility of anaob on organics anaob were initially considered to be obligate chemolithoautotrophic organisms which later on were found capable of mixotrophic growth via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra kartal et al 2012 when ammonia is limited anaob can use h2 fe2 monoamine dimethylamine and a variety of simple organic compounds e g formate acetate and propionate as alternative electron donors to replenish electrons for growth guven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007a kartal et al 2007b kartal et al 2008 strous et al 2006 in general candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadiaand candidatus jettenia were the dominant anaob in mainstream anammox systems nlr 0 6 kg n m 3d 1 with relative abundances of 0 1 38 0 1 13 6 1 3 37 6 respectively akaboci et al 2018 ding et al 2018 feng et al 2018 liang et al 2018 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 genomic analyses suggested that five out of the six anammox genera discovered so far are capable of oxidizing simple organic acids candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis strous et al 2006 candidatus brocadia fulgida gori et al 2011 candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus kartal et al 2007b candidatus jettenia caeni ali et al 2015 and candidatus scalindua profunda van de vossenberg et al 2013 mixotrophic growth with the addition of simple organic acids resulted in higher biomass yield of anaob than autotrophic growth feng et al 2018 during full dnra eq 1 nitrite reduction to ammonium is the rate limiting step limited organics promote partial dnra nitrate to nitrite only over full dnra by anaob eq 2 castro barros et al 2017 from a thermodynamic point of view partial dnra yields more energy than full dnra 552 vs 500 kj mol acetate partial dnra in combination with anammox further enhances energy production 1984 kj mol

significantly depending on organic types and anammox species formate is utilized 3 5 times more efficiently than acetate and propionate by the same anammox cultures 93 122 vs 20 61 and 13 72 μg cod min 1 g 1 of protein ali et al 2015 kartal et al 2007b kartal et al 2008 van de vossenberg et al 2008 there are two possible explanations for the discrepancy 1 thermodynamically formate is more favorable than acetate and propionate as electron donors the δgo values of organics oxidation are 80 8 69 0 and 69 3 kj e eq respectively rittmann and mccarty 2012 2 formate can be directly incorporated into cellular metabolites by anaob via the methyl branch of the wood ljungdahl pathway whereas acetate needs to be fully oxidized to co2 and re assimilated lawson et al 2020 candidatus brocadia fulgida consumed acetate more efficiently than other organics 61 vs 20 51 μg cod min 1 g 1 protein kartal et al 2007b kartal et al 2008 van de vossenberg et al 2008 their up regulated dnra and acetate metabolic pathways can explain their superiority in acetate utilization and the stimulated growth upon acetate addition feng et al 2019 despite of the widely reported versatility of anaob in using small molecule organics there is a lack of experimentally determined growth rates and yields for different anaob populations growing on different organics mixotrophy gives anaob growth advantages especially under nutrient limited conditions and could be one of the reasons explaining their prevalence in diverse environment 2 2 inhibition of organics on anaob alcohols aldehydes phenols antibiotics can exert inhibitory effects on enriched anaob or wastewater anammox processes table 1 generally the inhibitory effects of phenols and antibiotics are reversible but the toxicity of methanol is stronger and mostly irreversible anammox granules and biofilm exhibit higher tolerance to toxicants than flocculent cultures methanol is widely used to facilitate denitrification at wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to its low cost hellinga et al 1998 however it is one of the most potent inhibitors to anaob and thus challenges may emerge if mainstream anammox and methanol facilitated denitrification are implemented in sequence at wwtps the effects and mechanisms of methanol inhibition of anaob have been summarized in a previous review jin et al 2012 briefly candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis exhibited higher methanol resistance than candidatus brocadia fulgida isaka et al 2008 oshiki et al 2011 formaldehyde from methanol oxidation by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao in anaob could be the actual inhibitor causing protein damage by irreversible cross linking with peptides metz et al 2004 schalk et al 2000 methanol inhibition was stronger for anaob in reactors with higher nlr where hao activity was also higher table 1 phenolic compounds especially phenol and p nitrophenol are the major constituents of wastewater from coal gasification plants and anaerobic digesters collins et al 2005 anaob inhibition by phenol is rapid and reversible lyu et al 2018 yang et al 2013a specifically phenol can bind to the α and γ subunits of hydrazine synthase hzs leading to competition with haem and the inhibition can be alleviated once phenol is detached the specific anammox activity saa of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis decreased by 56 in 18 h with 4 3 mmol l 1 phenol and 26 in 7 days with 4 3 mmol l 1 phenol lyu et al 2018 surprisingly the saa of an anammox biofilm gradually increased from 5 to 62 kg nh4 n m 3d 1 as the phenol concentration increased from 0 5 to 5 9 mmol l 1 in 480 days toh and ashbolt 2002 indicating potential acclimation of anaob to phenol or degradation detoxification of the toxicant by other microbes in the community antibiotics are commonly found in high strength veterinary and pharmaceutical wastewaters exerting inhibitory effect by disrupting cell wall synthesis protein synthesis or dna replication and repair fu et al 2020 lotti et al 2012 roose amsaleg and laverman 2016 oxytetracycline has been reported to exert the greatest inhibition on anammox activity inhibition rate 91 oxytetracycline 50 mg l 1 duration 7 days yang et al 2013b nevertheless it s concluded so far that the inhibition effects on anammox activity vary upon anammox species types and concentrations of antibiotics as well as exposure duration fernández et al 2009 lotti et al 2012 sguanci et al 2017 compared with short term inhibitory tests 6 24 h greater inhibition on anaob activities by antibiotics has been observed during long term tests 12 100 days table 1 though short term inhibitory effects may be underestimated because of the rapid adsorption of antibiotics onto anammox biofilm or granules moreover the positively charged enrofloxacin can be imported into anaob anammoxosome through channel forming proteins more efficiently than the negatively charged doxycycline kartal et al 2013 leading to more rapid and profound inhibition on anaob sguanci et al 2017 a more standard procedure is required for testing the inhibitory effects of inhibitory compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations roose amsaleg and laverman 2016 the inhibition by organic compounds can be relieved by granulation bioaugmentation and or detoxification table 1 biofilm growth and granulation can increase the resistance of anammox cultures to inhibitory compounds for example the estimated half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 values of doxycycline were 121 and 378 mg l 1 for granular and flocculent anammox sludge respectively alvarino et al 2014 sguanci et al 2017 this was potentially because of the higher adsorption and bioconversion rates of organics on anammox granule surface and biofilm exterior compared with flocculent sludge jiang et al 2002 yap et al 1999 there were studies showing that lab scale wastewater anammox reactors regularly bioaugmented with fresh and enriched anammox cultures showed high robustness tang et al 2011a zhang et al 2018a similarly full scale mainstream anammox processes regularly bioaugmented with sidestream anammox granules are expected to be more resistant to stressors wett et al 2013 anaob are also potentially prevented from organic inhibition by coexisting microbes which are capable of degrading inhibitory compounds e g the denitrifier klebsiella sp sqy5 can degrade tetracycline shao et al 2018 and ammonia oxidizers can co oxidize antibiotics with ammonia men et al 2017 2 3 effects of organics on other functional populations combined processes such as pn a and partial denitrification anammox pd a rely on extensive metabolic cooperation between anaob and other microbial groups to achieve efficient nitrogen removal mainstream anammox reactors can achieve desired nitrogen removal efficiency nre 70 with the addition of acetate c n 0 5 1 4 table 2 in any anammox reactors especially those under mainstream conditions anaob accounted only for 0 1 38 of the whole community leaving the rest dominated by other populations therefore the effects of organics on the metabolism of coexisting populations and their metabolic interactions with anaob have been paid more attention currently 2 3 1 effects of organics on autotrophs in one stage pn a reactor ideally ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonium oxidizing archaea aoa convert about half of the influent ammonia to nitrite which is then utilized by anaob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob compete with anaob for nitrite causing nitrate accumulation moreover complete ammonium oxidizing comammox bacteria show an high affinity for ammonia km 0 7 μg nh4 n l 1 and produce nitrate kits et al 2017 these autotrophic nitrifying microorganisms albeit less abundant than anaob are drastically influenced by organics leading to fluctuations in community composition and total nitrogen removal in one stage pn a process nitrosomonas spp were the predominant aob with relative abundances of 1 5 in pn a reactors gilbert et al 2014 liu et al 2017 the presence of organics in pn a systems can exacerbate the washout of aob and thus deteriorate reactor performance organics would stimulate heterotrophic growth that competes with aob for limited oxygen although aob such as nitrosomonas europaea can utilize a variety of organics including pyruvate lactate and acetate for anaerobic growth their maximum growth rates are much lower than denitrifiers growing on acetate e g μmax 0 03 0 05 d 1 vs 3 7 d 1 mokhayeri et al 2006 schmidt 2009 with the addition of glucose c n 1 both the relative abundance and activity of aob in pn a reactors decreased substantially wen et al 2016 moreover recalcitrant organics e g humic acids in anaerobic digestion effluent could cause the enzyme deactivation or diffusion limitation of aob in pn a process zhang et al 2018b candidatus nitrososphaera are the predominant aoa in anammox systems which could be enriched up to 3 44 of the community in an intermittently aerated sequencing batch reactor qiu et al 2019 small organics e g malate succinate and pyruvate could accelerate the growth of aoa sauder et al 2017 tourna et al 2011 these organics likely act by detoxifying hydrogen peroxide produced during ammonia oxidation rather than direct assimilation by aoa kim et al 2016 the overgrowth of nob nitrospira has been frequently reported in mainstream pn a reactors accounting for 3 16 of the total microbial community akaboci et al 2018 liu et al 2017 compared with nitrite oxidation nob nitrospira growing on formate leads to higher biomass yield 0 57 gvss cod 1 vs 0 07 gvss no2 n 1 and maximum growth rate 3 4 d 1 vs 0 76 d 1 button 1998 koch et al 2015 winkler et al 2012 the metabolic versatility on formate brings additional difficulties in nob suppression in pn a reactors miao et al 2018 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2014 comammox bacteria can be unintentionally enriched in pn a reactors especially in those receiving low concentrations of ammonia and operated at low do and long srt camejo et al 2017 roots et al 2019 similar to nob nitrospira genomic analysis of comammox nitrospira suggested their capability of oxidizing formate poghosyan et al 2019 their high affinities to ammonia and nitrite and potential metabolic versatility in utilizing formate may explain their overgrowth in pn a reactors under mainstream conditions with organics 2 3 2 effects of organics on heterotrophs heterotrophs are generally much more abundant than anaob in anammox communities du et al 2017 gonzalez gil et al 2015 hu et al 2018 growing on a wide range of organics in wastewater influent and or externally added laureni et al 2016 le et al 2019 complete denitrifiers fermentative dnra bacteria and nitrite dependent methane oxidation n damo bacteria compete with anaob for nitrite whereas partial denitrifiers and nitrate dependednt methane oxidation n damo archaea facilitate anaob growth by providing nitrite denitrifiers in anammox reactors are represented by denitratisoma dokdonella limnobacter and thauera fig 2 and their relative abundances range from 0 3 to 23 6 of anammox communities akaboci et al 2018 cao et al 2016 pereira et al 2017 by controlling organics types e g acetate or glycerol and or c no3 n ratio 2 3 5 some denitrifiers can perform stable denitratation reduction of nitrate to nitrite that enhance anammox activity cao et al 2013 du et al 2017 du et al 2019a ji et al 2018 le et al 2019 lu and chandran 2010a lu et al 2011 there are two reasons explaining acetate glycerol facilitated denitratation 1 acetate and glycerol are mostly converted to poly 3 hydroxybutyrate as a storage compound rather than being used for biosynthesis yielding more electrons to sustain the activity of the electron costly nitrate reductase majone et al 2001 2 acetate and glycerol donate electrons to cytochrome b or ubiquinone preferentially accepted by nitrate reductase in the upstream of the electron transfer chain rather than nitrite reductase downstream van rijn et al 1996 though limited influent organics can induce denitratation they can also trigger n2o production in anammox reactors e g n2o emission factor 0 46 at c n 0 1 jia et al 2018 kampschreur et al 2009 lu and chandran 2010b heterotrophic dnra bacteria in anammox reactors are dominated by fermentative anaerolineaceae and ignavibacteria oxidizing organic macromolecules to small organic acids and h2 while reducing nitrate to nitrite and then ammonium du et al 2017 gonzalez gil et al 2015 hu et al 2018 a recent study suggested that excessive fermentative dnra bacteria led to deteriorated anammox performance by competing with anaob for nitrite and other metabolic necessities keren et al 2020 organics types can influence anaob fermentative dnra bacteria interactions in an anammox reactor supplied with glucose anaerolineaceae and ignavibacteria increased from 34 to 54 and overgrew conventional denitrifiers when c n ratio increased from 0 to 2 whereas the relative abundance of anaob decrease substantially wang et al 2019a in comparison acetate reduced the abundances of fermentative dnra bacteria in anammox reactors wang et al 2018 n damo can be been coupled with anammox process to achieve simultaneous removal of nitrogen and methane from landfill leachate where n damo bacteria and archaea accounted for up to 7 18 and 3 37 of the anammox community respectively nie et al 2019 nie et al 2020 xie et al 2018 methane as an alternative carbon source e g dissolved concentration 20 mg l 1 can be used by n damo archaea to reduce nitrate and the produced nitrite is sebsequently utilized by anaob and n damo bacteria wang et al 2019b 3 endogenous organics and their effects on anammox communities endogenous organicsare derived from microbial metabolism mainly in the forms of eps and smp with complex compositions eps are the backbones of anammox biofilm granule influencing the mass transfer efficiency adsorption ability structural stability and stress tolerance hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 sheng et al 2010 smp determine the metabolic interactions between anaob and coexisting heterotrophs lawson et al 2017 sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 understanding the dynamics and roles of endogenous organics is a part of the continuing efforts to optimize the start up and operation of wastewater anammox reactors 3 1 effects of eps on anammox biofilm structure and function compared with anaerobic and nitrifying granules eps in anammox granules exhibited higher content 111 410 mg gvss 1 vs 60 74 mg gvss 1 martinez et al 2004 ni et al 2015 tang et al 2011b wu et al 2009 zhu et al 2018 lower polysaccharide to protein ratio 0 8 2 3 vs 2 5 3 1 and lower hydrophilic to hydrophobic ratio 0 2 0 7 vs 3 13 chen et al 2019 hou et al 2015 niu et al 2016 sheng et al 2010 sun et al 2018 anammox growth rate in biofilm system is determined by mass transfer including free diffusion and the lung like breathing diffusion in pore water eps may serve as the ion transport tunnel between biofilm and bulk liquid sustaining lung like breathing behavior that enhances mass transfer efficiency xu et al 2019 excessive eps synthesized in heavily loaded anammox granular systems tang et al 2011b otherwise may adversely influence mass transfer by occupying the substrate transport tunnel eps control the retention efficiency of anaob by influencing the mechanical strength of biofilms and settleability of granules decreased eps were often associated with granule disintegration and or low settleability wang et al 2019c zhu et al 2018 adding proteinase k β amylase and cellulose also caused reductions in eps content and mechanical strength of anammox granules lin and wang 2017 moreover high nlr in an anammox granular reactor led to excessive eps production poor sludge settleability and granule floating possibly due to decreased porosity and permeability of granules to release n2 chen et al 2014 lu et al 2012 eps protect anammox communities against stresses such as low temperature heavy metals and high salinity in a columned anammox sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr eps content increased from 118 to 234 mg gvss 1 when temperature decreased from 19 7 to 13 7 c which was probably beneficial to maintain the tn removal of 87 5 2 2 zhang et al 2020a to better cope with low temperature 16 c pulsed electric field was applied in anammox reactors to enhance eps secretion and saa zhang et al 2019 anammox granules exhibited higher ic50 values for copper nanoparticles cu nps than flocs 4 64 1 24 vs 3 27 0 79 mg gvss 1 presumably due to cu nps adsorption by eps zhang et al 2017 polysaccharide eps increased from 2 to 6 mg gvss 1 when salinity increased from 0 to 30 g l 1 in an anammox reactor and this again helped to maintain the desired nitrogen removal at 86 88 fang et al 2018 polysaccharide eps can regulate cell membrane permeability by acting as a hydrogel reducing water loss and maintaining saa lotti et al 2019 3 2 effects of smp on the interactions between anaob and heterotrophs the heterotrophic communities in wastewater anammox reactors are to a certain extent similar in composition regardless of their drastically varied operating conditions probably due to the anaob heterotroph interactions based on smp gonzalez gil et al 2015 hu et al 2018 pereira et al 2017 smp consist of biodegradable organics e g polysaccharides and proteins signaling molecules e g acylated homoserine lactones ahls and secondary metabolites e g vitamin b12 soh et al 2020 smp secreted by anaob support heterotrophic growth via cross feeding which in turn benefits the growth of anaob most heterotrophs in anammox communities lack catabolic pathways for amino acids with a high biosynthetic cost and therefore are selected to degrade those that are less costly to synthesize and directly incorporate costly amino acids into protein synthesis lawson et al 2017 candidatusbrocadia are able to synthesize vitamins b1 b7 and b12 which are the auxotrophic necessities for fermentative dnra bacteria e g populations in chloroflexi and chlorobi keren et al 2020 lawson et al 2017 in return most anaob lack genes for synthesizing molybdenum cofactor moco and folate that are essential for co2 fixation but heterotrophic fimbriimonadaceae and phyllobacteriaceae can produce these metabolites zhao et al 2018 ahls stimulate anammox activity and biofilm formation the addition of c6 hsl and c8 hsl at 30 mg l 1 into anammox reactors increased the anammox activity by 20 35 and growth rate of anaob by 28 tang et al 2015 specific ahls can upregulate a broad range of pathways in anaob involving electron transfer energy and or biomass synthesis e g nad tang et al 2018 the addition of c6 hsl c8 hsl andc12 hsl at 2 μmol l 1 also increased the eps content especially protein eps in anammox biofilm by 20 32 tang et al 2018 ahl inactivation by vanillin and porcine kidney acylase i led to a significant decrease in eps content and polysaccharide to protein ratio destabilizing biofilm structure and reducing anammox activity zhao et al 2016 as an alternative to the costly ahl addition introducing ahl producing bacteria to wastewater anammox systems will potentially improve nitrogen removal efficiency and biofilm stability ding et al 2015 4 meta analysis of anammox communities influenced by organics the microbial interactions within complex wastewater anammox communitities can be deciphered via inter taxa and taxa environment correlations and co occurrence network analyses 16s rrna gene sequencing data have been generated in large amounts with the widespread use of next generation sequencing techqniues and have been applied in studying microbial correlations in extremely heterogeneous microbial communities o brien et al 2016 rosa et al 2018 wu et al 2019 we analyzed 149 sets of 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing data collected from different types of wastewater anammox reactors e g anammox anammox denitrification partial nitritation anammox with varied nlr 0 06 1 52 kg n m 3d 1 and organic types e g real wastewater and externally added glucose and acetate etc detailed sample information table s1 fig s3 and data analysis procedures can be found in supplementary information 19 core taxa were identified and their relative abundances in anammox samples at different nlrs and influent c n ratios were compared fig 3 the pair wise correlations among core taxa and their correlations with key operating parameters were calculated fig 4 a co occurrence network was constructed using sparse correlations for compositional data sparcc correlation analysis where 7 keystone taxa were identified and the modular structure of abundant otus and their inter taxa correlations were displayed figs 5 and 6 4 1 core taxa and their correlations with organics overall the alpha diversity metrics of anammox communities chao1 shannon and simpson increased with c n ratio indicating potentially higher functional redundancy with elevated organics inputs fig s4 nineteen otus belonging to planctomycetes 3 anaerolineaceae 4 ignavibacteria 2 burkholderiaceae 2 rhodocyclaceae 2 gammaproteobacteria 2 gemmatimonadaceae 1 steroidobacteraceae 1 rhodanobacteraceae 1 and nitrosomonadaceae 1 were identified as the core taxa fig 2 core taxa were defined as the frequently abundant microbes detected in more than 80 of the samples constituting the top 80 of the total reads in more 50 of the total analyzed samples wu et al 2019 they participate in diverse microbial processes modulate the assembly of community and potentially make significant contributions to nitrogen turnover in anammox systems saunders et al 2016 the relative abundances of the 19 core taxa vary significantly from 2 3 to 68 5 in wastewater anammox communities and are heavily influenced by c n ratio and nlr fig 3 in the absence of influent organics c n 0 n 27 fermentative dnra bacteria anaerolineaceae and ignavibacteria growing on endogenous organics are the most abundant core taxa fig 3 higher nlrs can stimulate anammox activity producing more smp for fermentative dnra bacteria which in turn replenish nitrite for anaob keren et al 2020 lawson et al 2017 consistently dnra bacteria core taxa anaerolineaceaeand anaob core taxa brocadiaceaeare positively correlated with nlr and nre table s2 in the presence of influent organics the relative abundances of denitrifying core taxa rhodocyclaceae and burkholderiaceae in the community increase 8 1 13 5 and 4 7 18 3 respectively with influent c n ratio 0 3 fig 3 whereas anaerolineaceae andignavibacteriadecreasesubstantially 21 1 6 4 and 10 2 4 1 respectively in most cases acetate is supplied as the readily biodegradable carbon source table s1 fermentative bacteria mainly grow by decomposing organic macromolecules and thus are outcompeted by heterotrophic denitrifiers which can oxidize acetate more rapidly when glucose is used instead it otherwise stimulats the growth of fermentative core taxa anaerolineaceae andignavibacteria over denitrifying core taxa wang et al 2019a similarly meta analysis also suggests significant positive correlations between c n and denitrifying core taxa rhodocyclaceae and burkholderiaceae fig 4 in contrary denitrifying core taxa gemmatimonadaceaeare negatively correlated with c n and positively correlated with nlr because they potentially grow on endogenous organics produced by anaob rather than exogenous organics in order to better reveal the effects of organics on core taxa abundances samples containing exogenous organics were further grouped into low strength wastewater lsw n 18 and high strength wastewater hsw n 36 according to their nlrs 0 06 0 31 and 0 40 1 52 kg n m 3d 1 respectively core taxa are in general more abundant in the hsw group fig 3 c n is negatively correlated with fermentative core taxa ignavibacteria and anaob core taxa unclassifiedplanctomycetes and positively correlated with the denitrifying core taxa burkholderiaceae and rhodocyclaceae table s2 in the lsw group however neither cod nor c n display significant correlations with any core taxa significant correlations among core taxa are strong indictors for their cooperative or competitive interactions within anammox community overall core taxa rhodocyclaceae and brocadiaceaeare positively correlated fig 4 where rhodocyclaceae potentially perform denitratation supplying nitrite to brocadiaceae du et al 2017 core taxaunclassifiedplanctomycetes anaerolineaceae ignavibacteria and burkholderiaceae also exhibited positive inter taxa correlations suggesting the preserved cooperations between anaob fermenters and denitrifiers across different anammox communities based on the cross feeding of endogenous organics in addition to core taxa other populations could also be functionally important irrespective of their relative abundances e g keystone taxa and even rare populations 0 1 can drive community composition and function banerjee et al 2018 manipulation of these driver species can potentially enable effective control of the whole community towards better performance for example a potential strategy could be bioaugmentation with partial denitrifier rhodocyclaceaeto enhance denitratation or quickly establish a denitratation anammox community 4 2 microbial co occurrence network and keystone taxa the microbial co occurrence network further reflects more detailed microbial interactions functional modules and keystone taxa in analyzed wastewater anammox communities fig 5 216 nodes representing taxa with significant correlations sparcc r 0 6 p 0 01 and 1916 edges representing relationships between nodes are displayed in the network nodes are classified into 11 modules and each module represents clustered microbes with similar functions parter et al 2007 taxa in the first 6 modules compose about 70 of the total community in each sample fig s5 7 keystone taxa are identified as highly connected populations or hubs with high degree 30 high closeness centrality 0 4 and low betweenness centrality 0 01 in the occurrence network berry and widder 2014 they potentially form a keystone guild affecting community functions by selectively modulating accessory taxa that connect with them among them five belong to proteobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi located in module 5 fig 6 otu311 belonging to chloroflexi likely a fermentative dnra in module 2 are both core and keystone taxa and thus may have greater influences on community assembly than other keystone taxa significant correlations between keystone taxa and environmental factors further suggest their roles in community assembly overall c n is positively correlated with 4 keystone taxa belonging to betaproteobacteria acidobacteria caldilineaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae while nlr is negatively correlated with 2 keystone taxa chloroflexi and hyphomicrobiaceae table s2 most keystone taxa are facultative heterotrophs using a variety of organics e g hyphomicrobiaceae lu et al 2014 organics can therefore reinforce the associations between keystone taxa and other taxa in the guilds where the latter arise because of resource sharing niche partitioning and spatiotemporal coherence banerjee et al 2018 tracking the abundances of keystone taxa would be helpful to evaluate microbial community stability and predict performance and community fluctuations in anammox reactors 5 conclusion and perspectives this review summarizes the comprehensive effects of organics on the microbial ecology i e community structure and function of wastewater anammox processes toxicity of inhibitory organics e g methanol phenols and antibiotics on anammox activity varies upon organic types anammox species and reactor operating conditions acetate and glycerol are favorable organics that promote denitratation anammox but excessive exogenous organics intensify the competition between anaob and heterotrophic denitrifiers for nitrite in the absence of exogenous organics biodegradable smp serve as the main carbon sources for fermentative bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers and in particular amino acids vitamin b12 and ahls also mediate metabolic interactions between anaob and heterotrophs the microbial co occurrence network established herein is a step forward to understand the preserved microbial interactions in diverse anammox communities 19 core taxa and 7 keystone taxa are identified exhibiting strong correlations with c n and nlr however their exact roles in sustaining community function are yet to be unraveled in individual communities there have been numerous studies aiming to optimize seed sludge nlr and temperature for better operation of anammox reactors but the knowledge on organics management is limited especially for mainstream anammox processes a widely accepted concept configuration of mainstream anammox is the a b process where organics are captured in a stage for anaerobic bioenergy production and nitrogen is subsequently removed in b stage by deammonification in order to achieve the desired nitrogen removal in b stage typically 70 organics have to be properly managed according to nlr and other reactor operating parameters in the future the following research needs should be given priority 1 optimize exogenous organics management stretegies for mainstream anammox reactors deciphering factors that lead to altered organics management e g organics types and c n including but not limited to wastewater composition regulatory requirements and treatment flow sheet 2 development of endogenous organics as alternative carbon sources for nitrate reduction understanding their roles in facilitating the growth and metabolic interactions between anaob heterotrophs is needed to make full use of them towards enhanced biofilm stability stress tolerance and total nitrogen removal 3 metabolic network analysis based on representative metagenomic data metagenomics can yield more information on the metabolic functions of both abundant and rare populations in the community unraveling the complex metabolic interactions among these populations especially core and keystone taxa is useful to assemble more efficient wastewater anammox
