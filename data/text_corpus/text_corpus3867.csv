19335,recovery of phosphate from wastewater is challenging with one of the best opportunities being recovery from sludge anaerobic digestion liquor as struvite however this is limited by the proportion of total phosphorous which is soluble due to in digester metal ion precipitation high pressure anaerobic digestion may enable enhanced phosphate solubility and hence recovery potential without the use of added acid due to an increased liquid phase co2 concentration this was tested at 2 4 and 6 bar absolute bara vs a 1 bara control reactor fed with activated sludge increased pressure significantly p 0 0008 increased the fraction of phosphate that was soluble ranging from 52 at 1 bara to 75 at 6 bara model based analysis indicated that the main reason for increased solubility was ph depression down to 6 4 at 6 bara rather than changes in ion pairing with carbonates or increases in ionic activity however biological performance was adversely impacted with a substantial loss in vs and cod destruction on the order of 5 10 absolute no organic acid accumulation was observed bacterial and archaeal communities were significantly impacted p 0 0003 0 0005 with a shift to specific organisms including bacteroidales rikenellaceae within the bacteria and a deep sea euryarchaeotal group at 2 bara and methanocellaceae within the archaea at 4 and 6 bara the work indicates that high pressure operation is a technically viable option to improve phosphate recovery and produce a high methane biogas product but that the loss of overall conversion needs to be further addressed possibly through two stage digestion keywords pressurised anaerobic digestion nutrients recovery phosphorus ph volatile solids microbial community 1 introduction the case from phosphorous p recovery from waste streams in the long term has been extensively established as being essential to the sustainability of human society cordell and white 2011 a large proportion of the phosphorous entering domestic wastewater accumulates in the sludge stream which is commonly treated through anaerobic digestion converting organics to methane and releasing ammonia and phosphate through mineralisation one of the most readily accessible routes for p recovery is struvite mgnh4po4 precipitation in the relatively high p stream being produced from the anaerobic digester by dewatering increasing ph and dosing magnesium as hydroxide or chloride to recover soluble p as crystal struvite mehta et al 2015 however the amount of p that can be recovered through this route is limited by the fact that only approximately 20 of the mineral p is soluble and the remaining 80 is lost in the solids stream during dewatering latif et al 2017 this sludge may be added to soils as a fertiliser but is often complexed with cations such as aluminium al and iron fe which restricts p uptake by the plant alternatively sludge is commonly landfilled or incinerated which results on loss of p from the current agricultural cycle or unregulated release to the environment enhancing the proportion of p which remains soluble in the anaerobic digester would increase the fraction that could be recovered as struvite in digester reject there is limited literature available on enhancing soluble po4 in anaerobic digester effluents to enable its recovery options such as edta and ion exchange resins are uneconomic latif 2017 operating the digester at a low ph of 6 0 allowed up to 80 of total p solubilized as po4 vs 20 at standard digester ph levels of 7 2 however this reduced methane production particularly compromising hydrolysis and methanogenesis latif et al 2015 2017 moreover chemical inputs as hydrochloric acid and final sludge quality are a concern anaerobic digestion produces methane and carbon dioxide as main final gaseous products in approximately equal molar proportions therefore an alternative to chemically depressing ph is the use of pressurised reactors which decreases system ph by retaining the weak acid carbon dioxide co2 in the liquid this has the added benefit of increasing methane content in the biogas due to the relative solubilities of methane and co2 chen et al 2014 ad is typically operated at ambient pressure resulting in 30 35 of co2 in biogas co2 is 20 times more soluble than methane wang et al 2003 and hence increasing pressure preferentially retains co2 resulting in a high methane biogas chen et al 2014 this has been the motivation for studies to date with pressures of between 2 and 90 bar absolute bara pressure applied to achieve a high methane gas product keymer et al 2013 lindeboom et al 2012 wahidunnabi and eskicioglu 2014 this resulted in ch4 contents up to 95 of total biogas with enhanced conversion as an additional outcome however the potential to enhance p solubility and impact on system ph in general has not been previously studied this paper assesses the effect of high pressure on po4 solubility and methane production during

temperature of 37 1 c to maintain mesophilic conditions plc recorded the ph and biogas production of the control reactor 2 3 reactor operation the control and hipad reactors were seeded with 750 ml of inoculum 14 82 g vs added having cod vs ratio of 1 62 w w basis and adjusted to a ph of 7 0 prior to feeding each reactor was purged with nitrogen n2 gas at a flow rate of 5 l min 1 for minimum five minutes to remove any excessive gas from the headspace and to provide anaerobic conditions the reactors were operated at a 12 day hrt at an organic loading rate olr of 1 55 0 2 g vs l 1 d 1 feeding was on a batch fed basis with a flow rate of 63 2 ml d 1 the hipad was initially operated identically to the control for 50d to achieve convergence and stable operation following this the experimental reactor was operated at 2 bara for 48d 4 bara for 46d and 6 bara for 46d actual pressure was between 0 02 and 0 05 bar of set point in all periods additional info in supplementary info 2 the last two

analytical techniques digesters were analysed for total solids ts volatile solids vs and chemical oxygen demand cod three times a week twice a week for scod and vfa and once a week for soluble and

molecular analysis samples were collected for pyrosequencing during steady state conditions at the last day of 2 4 and 6 bara pressure along with samples from the control further information on extraction and sequencing including primers is given in latif et al 2015 otu tables were produced as for latif et al 2015 and the archaeal otus were grouped into taxonomic classifications as presented in section 3 sequences from the most abundant otu within each of these classifications was imported into megax windows aligned and a phylogenetic tree constructed using the minimum evolution approach default parameters all data and the phylogenetic tree are provided in supplementary material si4 2 6 statistical analysis all errors and error bars are 95 confidence in mean of triplicates using a two tailed t test 5 significance threshold linear correlation was assessed in microsoft excel 2010 using the regression tool with reported p values being for the standard linear model parameter uncertainty for non linear regression is 95 confidence using a two tailed t test with parameter standard error estimated from the fisher information matrix as described in latif et al 2015 where derived values are analytically calculated from primary observed values errors were propagated analytically batstone 2013 2 7 model based analysis to assess the factors contributing to changes in soluble phosphorous a full model of the anaerobic digestion process was used including an advanced physicochemical model solon et al 2017 this includes ion activity davies equation ion pairing and phosphate sulfur and carbonate precipitation with iron calcium magnesium and a number of other metal cations the anaerobic digester model only was used extracted from the plant wide model of solon et al 2017 all simulations were done in matlab r2016b matlab simulink waste activated sludge solon et al 2017 was used as input with net solids adjusted by direct proportioning to concentrations as measured in section 2 1 degradability inert xi vs degradable all others was set to achieve the observed volatile solids destruction in the control 1 bara case and poly p content adjusted to achieve the observed output phosphate concentration in the control case 1 bara magnesium and calcium levels were set to observed measured totals in the control case input sodium concentration normally used to determine ionic balance did not need modification as ph of the control reactor was correct without modification 0 035m parameters were unmodified for simulation at the 2 bara 4 bara and 6 bara cases which were conducted simply by changing headspace pressure degradability was not modified to reflect the reduced vs destruction seen at higher pressures all simulations were run to steady state with constant input 1000d matlab code including model simulink files and post processing scripts are available in the linked data repository 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the mass balance vs destruction mass balance instantaneous for the entire experimental period is shown in fig 2 this demonstrates a highly significant p 0 001 impact of high pressure operation on vs destruction the different operating periods for both mass balance volatile solids destruction vsd and cod destruction are shown in fig 3 this demonstrates i always significant p 1 10 5 and substantial 5 absolute loss in vs and cod destruction vs control ii progressive loss of vsd with increase in pressure p 0 03 not observed in cod destruction iii generally consistent results between cod destruction and vsd and iv elevated cod destruction vs vsd generally 2 3 indicating that high energy material is preferentially destroyed van kleeck vsd was generally consistent with cod and mass balance vs destruction except during the 1 bara operational period where control was significantly higher than experimental and the mb control likely due to accumulation of grit in the control system in this early stage methane recovery and cod balancing was better in the experimental system particularly during the 2 bara period and this was likely due to better sealing in the stainless steel hipad experimental system vs the perspex control system methane content in the biogas was elevated substantially from 70 in the control to 81 4 0 01 at 6 bara with the rest as co2 fig 4 chen et al 2014 reported 71 3 and 73 3 methane at 3 and 8 9 bara respectively driven by relative solubilities as previously discussed this also resulted in reduction of ph to 6 72 6 56 and 6 38 at 2 4 and 6 bara respectively fig 4 model results largely reflected observed results though with diminishing impact at 6 bara vs 4 bara the diminishing model effect is due to co2 nearing its kla of 6 3 and the reason that the observed ph is lower than the simulated ph at this point is not known this is not due to the reduced vs destruction as tested by simulation one possibility is a reduced kla for degassing at increased pressure but references relating pressure dependency of degassing of sparingly soluble gases could not be found associated with a decrease in ph an increase in the soluble organics was predicted based on latif et al 2017 as well a decrease in overall hydrolytic efficiency hydrolysis extent did indeed decrease see vsd data and methane data the total vfa concentration at all pressure conditions and control was below 12 mg l 1 without accumulation refer supplementary material 3 the scod concentration at all pressure conditions was always lower than the control contrasting with previous work at artificially induced low ph latif et al 2015 2017 this indicates that the low ph and or high pressure conditions are reducing hydrolytic capability without inducing accumulation of vfa and other soluble organics moreover the vsd in test reactor was always lower than the control with a possible reason of low ph accumulating residual organic matter as found followed by reducing hydrolytic capability as previously reported by latif et al 2017 modelling did not predict a substantial increase in vfas or loss of hydrolytic performance 3 2 effect of pressure on po4 solubility the soluble fraction of total po4 at control 2 and 4 bara were 52 56 and 65 of total p respectively but increased substantially to 75 at 6 bara the po4 concentrations in sludge were measured as 314 0 2 367 0 3 426 0 4 and 490 0 3 at control 2 4 and 6 bara respectively fig 5 a ca was 29 1 mg l 34 4 0 5 51 6 0 1 and 53 1 0 3 mg l at control 2 4 and 6 while mg was 39 5 70 2 117 1 and 140 1 at control 2 4 and 6 bara the major difference in cations was a relatively minor increase in ca solubility from 4 to 6 bara but major increase in mg solubility from 4 to 6 bara the model could effectively predict both absolute phosphorous and metal ion proportioning fig 5 as well as changes in solubility with increased pressure the main difference was overprediction of ca solubility and underprediction of mg solubility the model predicted the major precipitates were amorphous calcium phosphate acp and struvite with no other substantial calcium or magnesium precipitates phosphate or carbonates according to modelling the main reason for enhanced soluble phosphate was decrease in ph and hence shift in precipitation equilibria changes in ionic strength and activity had a relatively minor impact with ionic strength increasing by 10 from 1 bara to 6 bara changes in ion pairing were negligible with paired ca and mg being 42 47 of total soluble ca and mg across all pressure ranges that is paired concentration fraction increased in proportion with the soluble fraction the ammonium concentration in the test reactor was generally 20 lower than in the control fig 5b at all test conditions likely due to reduced hydrolysis extent this would have a minor impact on struvite precipitation extent reducing it by approximately 10 model based analysis 3 3 effect of pressure on microbial community control samples were taken at the same time as test reactor samples immediately prior to changing pressure regime full otu tables are given in supplementary information 4 and two feed samples early 6 bara operating period were also taken the communities were dominated by bacteria 80 95 with test reactors at 2 4 and 6 bara having a higher proportion of archaea 17 of assigned sequences at 2 bara 7 at 4 bara and 8 at 6 bara vs 4 7 in control reactors the effect of pressure on bacterial dominance was not significant considering pressure as a continuous factor p 0 05 the bacterial community was significantly impacted by pressure effect of pressure as a continuous factor on bacterial community pc1 41 of variance p 0 0003 the source pca biplot is given in si s4 this shift was mainly due to emergence of a specific dominant otu affiliated with bacteroidales rikenellaceae blvii28 acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes which emerged as the dominant otu 10 4 and 6 bara not observed at 2 bara the affiliated isolate is a strict anaerobic carbohydrate fermenter with limited proteolytic function su et al 2014 rhodocyclaceae multiple otus also emerged at 2 4 and 6 bara there was a corresponding decrease in a diverse range of bacterial otus as shown in the pca plot in si s4 no references could be found in the literature on impact of high pressure on anaerobic hydrolytic communities but work in marine sediments has found loss in diversity and shift away from classic functional anaerobes such deltaproteobacteria as ph decreases and pco2 increases yanagawa et al 2013 the archaeal community was strongly impacted also by pressure pc1 45 of variance p 0 0005 and this was due to important shifts in the archaeal community the control samples and test reactor at 1 bara were dominated by otus affiliated with methanosaetaceae acetate utiliser and methanobacteriales hydrogen utilisers however a single dominant otu within the archaea affiliated with a dseg deep sea euryarchaeotic group a marine microbe within the phylum euryarchaeota emerged as dominant at 2 bara and multiple methanocella species emerged at 4 and 6 bara fig 6 dseg was originally found at high pressure in deep sea marine sediments where a high pressure on sediments is exerted by the height of the water column aoki et al 2014 it has since been found in anaerobic digesters at a 3 of total archaea level dziewit et al 2015 published papers do not comment on its function but it is relatively deep rooted within the euryarcheota see phylogenetic tree in si s4 methanocella is commonly associated with rice plant roots utilising h2 formate and contributes to methane emissions from rice production conrad et al 2006 overall increased pressure significantly impacted bacterial community with a loss in hydrolytic function and community diversity accompanied with a shift to a specific organism the methanogenic community was significantly and substantially impacted but without a loss in function i e no accumulation of vfas the difference did not appear to be due to the different reactor materials of construction polycarbonate vs stainless steel since the 1 bara test reactor samples clustered with the control samples see si s4 general community stability without the changes in headspace pressure are demonstrated by consistency of the control communities over time for both bacteria see si s4 and archaea fig 6 3 4 overall feasibility of increased pressure operation while p recovery is substantially enabled by the increase in pressure the value of recovered p is relatively modest batstone et al 2015 at us2 us4 per kg p it is assumed that the p in struvite will also have this value given emissions of approximately 0 6 kg p person year metson et al 2016 even if all the p is recovered its value over the asset lifetime 20 year is us4m for a 100 000 person plant the loss of almost 10 vsd absolute in this context is not acceptable as it would result in an additional 18m over 20 years cost of sludge disposal 50 wet tonne 20 solids however the loss in vsd could potentially be addressed through a secondary low pressure digestion at increased capital but also offering an increase in capacity over single stage atmospheric pressure operation the increased costs of high pressure operation are substantial operation at this level of elevated pressure i e above 2 bara means that under most legislation the vessel is classed as a pressure vessel e g as nz1210 is relevant in australia sai 2010 this not only substantially increases the capital cost normally 2 3x but also increases operating cost through periodic normally annual inspection and the increase in pump size and energy input needed to feed the reactor at double to triple the basic head pressure for an atmospheric pressure reactor overall the economic cost of high pressure operation is likely to be substantially higher compared with digester acid dosing for p recovery at us100 us250 d 100 000 ep plant latif et al 2017 though with some secondary benefits including increased biogas methane composition and a decrease in highly soluble gases including sulphides which would increase with acid dosing and without the increase in salts in the final biosolids product 4 conclusions high pressure anaerobic digestion at 2 4 and 6 bara was compared to a 1 bara atmospheric pressure control to determine the potential for enhanced phosphorous recovery and the impact of pressure on ph performance and microbial community increasing pressure had a substantial impact on vs destruction compared with 1 bara decreasing it by approximately 25 at 6 bara and with a significant continuous pressure response p 0 03 cod destruction was decreased less only 15 at 6 bara indicating that reduced material was preferentially destroyed at high pressure phosphorous solubility was increased substantially with po4 up to 56 65 and 75 of the total p being in soluble form at 2 4 and 6 bara compared with 50 at 1 bara this was strongly related to an increase in soluble mg which also had a linear relationship with pressure p 0 01 and a reduced effect on soluble ca model based analysis indicated the main reason for decreased solubility was the change in ph with ion pairing and activity changes having a minor impact there was a substantial shift in bacterial but also methanogenic population from methanosaetaceae and methanobacteriales in the control towards specifically dseg at 2 bara and methanocella at 4 and 6 bara but no accumulation of organic acids or soluble cod indicating that only hydrolysis was adversely impacted while increased pressure operation can substantially improve the prospects for phosphorous recovery and generate a high methane biogas the loss in volatile solids destruction would need to be mitigated to make its application economically justifiable acknowledgements the grains research and development corporation grdc under the fertiliser from waste ii project financially supports this

tailed t test 5 significance threshold linear correlation was assessed in microsoft excel 2010 using the regression tool with reported p values being for the standard linear model parameter uncertainty for non linear regression is 95 confidence using a two tailed t test with parameter standard error estimated from the fisher information matrix as described in latif et al 2015 where derived values are analytically calculated from primary observed values errors were propagated analytically batstone 2013 2 7 model based analysis to assess the factors contributing to changes in soluble phosphorous a full model of the anaerobic digestion process was used including an advanced physicochemical model solon et al 2017 this includes ion activity davies equation ion pairing and phosphate sulfur and carbonate precipitation with iron calcium magnesium and a number of other metal cations the anaerobic digester model only was used extracted from the plant wide model of solon et al 2017 all simulations were done in matlab r2016b matlab simulink waste activated sludge solon et al 2017 was used as input with net solids adjusted by direct proportioning to concentrations as measured in section 2 1 degradability inert xi vs degradable all others was set to achieve the observed volatile solids destruction in the control 1 bara case and poly p content adjusted to achieve the observed output phosphate concentration in the control case 1 bara magnesium and calcium levels were set to observed measured totals in the control case input sodium concentration normally used to determine ionic balance did not need modification as ph of the control reactor was correct without modification 0 035m parameters were unmodified for simulation at the 2 bara 4 bara and 6 bara cases which were conducted simply by changing headspace pressure degradability was not modified to reflect the reduced vs destruction seen at higher pressures all simulations were run to steady state with constant input 1000d matlab code including model simulink files and post processing scripts are available in the linked data repository 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the mass balance vs destruction mass balance instantaneous for the entire experimental period is shown in fig 2 this demonstrates a highly significant p 0 001 impact of high pressure operation on vs destruction the different operating periods for both mass balance volatile solids destruction vsd and cod destruction are shown in fig 3 this demonstrates i always significant p 1 10 5 and substantial 5 absolute loss in vs and cod destruction vs control ii progressive loss of vsd with increase in pressure p 0 03 not observed in cod destruction iii generally consistent results between cod destruction and vsd and iv elevated cod destruction vs vsd generally 2 3 indicating that high energy material is preferentially destroyed van kleeck vsd was generally consistent with cod and mass balance vs destruction except during the 1 bara operational period where control was significantly higher than experimental and the mb control likely due to accumulation of grit in the control system in this early stage methane recovery and cod balancing was better in the experimental system particularly during the 2 bara period and this was likely due to better sealing in the stainless steel hipad experimental system vs the perspex control system methane content in the biogas was elevated substantially from 70 in the control to 81 4 0 01 at 6 bara with the rest as co2 fig 4 chen et al 2014 reported 71 3 and 73 3 methane at 3 and 8 9 bara respectively driven by relative solubilities as previously discussed this also resulted in reduction of ph to 6 72 6 56 and 6 38 at 2 4 and 6 bara respectively fig 4 model results largely reflected observed results though with diminishing impact at 6 bara vs 4 bara the diminishing model effect is due to co2 nearing its kla of 6 3 and the reason that the observed ph is lower than the simulated ph at this point is not known this is not due to the reduced vs destruction as tested by simulation one possibility is a reduced kla for degassing at increased pressure but references relating pressure dependency of degassing of sparingly soluble gases could not be found associated with a decrease in ph an increase in the soluble organics was predicted based on latif et al 2017 as well a decrease in overall hydrolytic efficiency hydrolysis extent did indeed decrease see vsd data and methane data the total vfa concentration at all pressure conditions and control was below 12 mg l 1 without accumulation refer supplementary material 3 the scod concentration at all pressure conditions was always lower than the control contrasting with previous work at artificially induced low ph latif et al 2015 2017 this indicates that the low ph and or high pressure conditions are reducing hydrolytic capability without inducing accumulation of vfa and other soluble organics moreover the vsd in test reactor was always lower than the control with a possible reason of low ph accumulating residual organic matter as found followed by reducing hydrolytic capability as previously reported by latif et al 2017 modelling did not predict a substantial increase in vfas or loss of hydrolytic performance 3 2 effect of pressure on po4 solubility the soluble fraction of total po4 at control 2 and 4 bara were 52 56 and 65 of total p respectively but increased substantially to 75 at 6 bara the po4 concentrations in sludge were measured as 314 0 2 367 0 3 426 0 4 and 490 0 3 at control 2 4 and 6 bara respectively fig 5 a ca was 29 1 mg l 34 4 0 5 51 6 0 1 and 53 1 0 3 mg l at control 2 4 and 6 while mg was 39 5 70 2 117 1 and 140 1 at control 2 4 and 6 bara the major difference in cations was a relatively minor increase in ca solubility from 4 to 6 bara but major increase in mg solubility from 4 to 6 bara the model could effectively predict both absolute phosphorous and metal ion proportioning fig 5 as well as changes in solubility with increased pressure the main difference was overprediction of ca solubility and underprediction of mg solubility the model predicted the major precipitates were amorphous calcium phosphate acp and struvite with no other substantial calcium or magnesium precipitates phosphate or carbonates according to modelling the main reason for enhanced soluble phosphate was decrease in ph and hence shift in precipitation equilibria changes in ionic strength and activity had a relatively minor impact with ionic strength increasing by 10 from 1 bara to 6 bara changes in ion pairing were negligible with paired ca and mg being 42 47 of total soluble ca and mg across all pressure ranges that is paired concentration fraction increased in proportion with the soluble fraction the ammonium concentration in the test reactor was generally 20 lower than in the control fig 5b at all test conditions likely due to reduced hydrolysis extent this would have a minor impact on struvite precipitation extent reducing it by approximately 10 model based analysis 3 3 effect of pressure on microbial community control samples were taken at the same time as test reactor samples immediately prior to changing pressure regime full otu tables are given in supplementary information 4 and two feed samples early 6 bara operating period were also taken the communities were dominated by bacteria 80 95 with test reactors at 2 4 and 6 bara having a higher proportion of archaea 17 of assigned sequences at 2 bara 7 at 4 bara and 8 at 6 bara vs 4 7 in control reactors the effect of pressure on bacterial dominance was not significant considering pressure as a continuous factor p 0 05 the bacterial community was significantly impacted by pressure effect of pressure as a continuous factor on bacterial community pc1 41 of variance p 0 0003 the source pca biplot is given in si s4 this shift was mainly due to emergence of a specific dominant otu affiliated with bacteroidales rikenellaceae blvii28 acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes which emerged as the dominant otu 10 4 and 6 bara not observed at 2 bara the affiliated isolate is a strict anaerobic carbohydrate fermenter with limited proteolytic function su et al 2014 rhodocyclaceae multiple otus also emerged at 2 4 and 6 bara there was a corresponding decrease in a diverse range of bacterial otus as shown in the pca plot in si s4 no references could be found in the literature on impact of high pressure on anaerobic hydrolytic communities but work in marine sediments has found loss in diversity and shift away from classic functional anaerobes such deltaproteobacteria as ph decreases and pco2 increases yanagawa et al 2013 the archaeal community was strongly impacted also by pressure pc1 45 of variance p 0 0005 and this was due to important shifts in the archaeal community the control samples and test reactor at 1 bara were dominated by otus affiliated with methanosaetaceae acetate utiliser and methanobacteriales hydrogen utilisers however a single dominant otu within the archaea affiliated with a dseg deep sea euryarchaeotic group a marine microbe within the phylum euryarchaeota emerged as dominant at 2 bara and multiple methanocella species emerged at 4 and 6 bara fig 6 dseg was originally found at high pressure in deep sea marine sediments where a high pressure on sediments is exerted by the height of the water column aoki et al 2014 it has since been found in anaerobic digesters at a 3 of total archaea level dziewit et al 2015 published papers do not comment on its function but it is relatively deep rooted within the euryarcheota see phylogenetic tree in si s4 methanocella is commonly associated with rice plant roots utilising h2 formate and contributes to methane emissions from rice production conrad et al 2006 overall increased pressure significantly impacted bacterial community with a loss in hydrolytic function and community diversity accompanied with a shift to a specific organism the methanogenic community was significantly and substantially impacted but without a loss in function i e no accumulation of vfas the difference did not appear to be due to the different reactor materials of construction polycarbonate vs stainless steel since the 1 bara test reactor samples clustered with the control samples see si s4 general community stability without the changes in headspace pressure are demonstrated by consistency of the control communities over time for both bacteria see si s4 and archaea fig 6 3 4 overall feasibility of increased pressure operation while p recovery is substantially enabled by the increase in pressure the value of recovered p is relatively modest batstone et al 2015 at us2 us4 per kg p it is assumed that the p in struvite will also have this value given emissions of approximately 0 6 kg p person year metson et al 2016 even if all the p is recovered its value over the asset lifetime 20 year is us4m for a 100 000 person plant the loss of almost 10 vsd absolute in this context is not acceptable as it would result in an additional 18m over 20 years cost of sludge disposal 50 wet tonne 20 solids however the loss in vsd could potentially be addressed through a secondary low pressure digestion at increased capital but also offering an increase in capacity over single stage atmospheric pressure operation the increased costs of high pressure operation are substantial operation at this level of elevated pressure i e above 2 bara means that under most legislation the vessel is classed as a pressure vessel e g as nz1210 is relevant in australia sai 2010 this not only substantially increases the capital cost normally 2 3x but also increases operating cost through periodic normally annual inspection and the increase in pump size and energy input needed to feed the reactor at double to triple the basic head pressure for an atmospheric pressure reactor overall the economic cost of high pressure operation is likely to be substantially higher compared with digester acid dosing for p recovery at us100 us250 d 100 000 ep plant latif et al 2017 though with some secondary benefits including increased biogas methane composition and a decrease in highly soluble gases including sulphides which would increase with acid dosing and without the increase in salts in the final biosolids product 4 conclusions high pressure anaerobic digestion at 2 4 and 6 bara was compared to a 1 bara atmospheric pressure control to determine the potential for enhanced phosphorous recovery and the impact of pressure on ph performance and microbial community increasing pressure had a substantial impact on vs destruction compared with 1 bara decreasing it by approximately 25 at 6 bara and with a significant continuous pressure response p 0 03 cod destruction was decreased less only 15 at 6 bara indicating that reduced material was preferentially destroyed at high pressure phosphorous solubility was increased substantially with po4 up to 56 65 and 75 of the total p being in soluble form at 2 4 and 6 bara compared with 50 at 1 bara this was strongly related to an increase in soluble mg which also had a linear relationship with pressure p 0 01 and a reduced effect on soluble ca model based analysis indicated the main reason for decreased solubility was the change in ph with ion pairing and activity changes having a minor impact there was a substantial shift in bacterial but also methanogenic population from methanosaetaceae and methanobacteriales in the control towards specifically dseg at 2 bara and methanocella at 4 and 6 bara but no accumulation of organic acids or soluble cod indicating that only hydrolysis was adversely impacted while increased pressure operation can substantially improve the prospects for phosphorous recovery and generate a high methane biogas the loss in volatile solids destruction would need to be mitigated to make its application economically justifiable acknowledgements the grains research and development corporation grdc under the fertiliser from waste ii project financially supports this

19336,found in drinking water distribution systems dwdss swimming pools and recreational waters n fowleri is the causative agent of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis pam although cases of n fowleri infections are rare the fatality is comparatively high 95 and surveillance is essential to minimize n fowleri infections however conventional n fowleri detection methods are less satisfying owing to their time consuming and lab intensive characteristics as well as the lack of the ability to determine viability as a result an alternative detection approach capable of determining viability as well as species identification is required to better ensure public health based on our previous research focusing on distinguishing laboratory cultured n fowleri from n lovaniensis and n italica this study applies untargeted metabolomics methods to field samples from operational dwdss a list of diagnostic features was found to preliminarily discriminate the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples with satisfying predictive accuracy the results outlined in this manuscript further validate and improve the metabolite based n fowleri detection approach potentially aiding water utilities in the detection and management of n fowleri in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords naegleria fowleri amoeba mass spectrometry metabolomics rapid detection drinking water distribution 1 introduction the pathogenic free living amoeba naegleria fowleri is found globally in rivers lakes swimming pools and even in the drinking water distribution systems dwdss miller et al 2015 morgan et al 2016 n fowleri is known to cause deadly primary amoebic meningoencephalitis pam when the host accidentally aspirates water containing n fowleri into nasal cavity n fowleri can migrate to the central nervous system to destroy the host tissue and induce intense immune response jarolim et al 2000 marciano cabral and cabral 2007 since the first case in 1961 in australia fowler and carter 1965 over 400 cases have been identified around the world naqvi et al 2016 more than 143 of which occurred from 1962 to 2016 in united states cdc 2017 recently it has been estimated that approximately 16 people annually die of n fowleri infections in the usa matanock et al 2018 though rare pam has an extremely high mortality rate of over 95 with most patients dying within two weeks of infection visvesvara et al 2007 capewell et al 2015 as a consequence monitoring the occurrence of n fowleri in recreational water and dwdss is important to maximize public safety with respect to n fowleri infection substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of a robust n fowleri detection approach conventional detection of n fowleri is time consuming 48 h and labor intensive requiring culturing on non nutrient agar plates nna coated with escherichia coli e coli reveiller et al 2002 mahittikorn et al 2015 the developed qpcr assays can shorten detection time but still have the disadvantages of high cost and inability to determine viability qvarnstrom et al 2006 robinson et al 2006 puzon et al 2009 mull et al 2013 extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of novel detection methods for microorganisms in dwdss keinanen et al 2004 deines et al 2010 in a review by douterlo et al various techniques to investigate the microbial activity of dwdss including real time pcr proteomics and metabolomics to name a few were summarized douterelo et al 2014 particularly beale et al applied gc ms based metabolomics approach to study the bacterial activity in biofilm and its influence on pipe corrosion beale et al 2010 beale et al 2013 inspired by the pioneering work by beale et al in our previous study yu et al 2017 we applied untargeted metabolomics in an effort to develop a robust metabolite based detection approach for pathogenic n fowleri based on the analysis of the metabolome of lab cultured naegleria species pathogenic n fowleri non pathogenic n lovaniensis n italica and culture media e coli we successfully found 63 molecular significant features capable of distinguishing n fowleri from non pathogenic n lovaniensis and n italica as well as e coli in addition the metabolite identities of 4 out of 63 features were putatively confirmed by ms ms matching with standards or available information in metabolite databases in accordance with the metabolomics standards initiative msi standards this metabolite based approach in our previous study has potential as a n fowleri surveillance tool for use by water authorities to monitor the quality in recreational waters and dwdss additionally this method may serve to support future development of n fowleri sensors however to achieve broad implementation and adoption the results from the previous study based upon laboratory clusters where the growth conditions were strictly controlled must be extended to ex vivo samples though promising the interference from environmental matrices and the external stress on the n fowleri metabolite profiles were largely ignored in the previous effort in order to complement and validate the findings from the previous study here we report the classification of field samples collected from different sites within operational dwdss known to be colonized by n fowleri or n lovaniensis using untargeted metabolomics methods the sample collection time spanned from 2014 to 2015 and for each site multiple samples were collected through different time points when viable naegleria spp were detected or killed due to disinfection or removed due to seasonal changes in the dwdss in this study 60 significant features were found to differentiate the n fowleri positive n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples of which 10 have been reported in our previous study focusing on lab cultured samples to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to apply untargeted metabolomics to the problem of rapidly detecting viable n fowleri in colonized field samples the capacity of this technique to rapidly classify the different samples demonstrates the potential of such techniques to impact drinking water monitoring campaigns 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sample collection and preparation field sites were selected based on a history of detection for n fowleri and n lovaniensis as well as a low free chlorine residual less than 0 1 mg l biofilm samples were collected from kiwa biofilm monitors connected directly to the pipe line puzon et al 2009 miller et al 2015 morgan et al 2016 miller et al 2017 prior to analysis samples were stored and transported at room temperature and all efforts were made to expediently extract a range of metabolites specifically biofilm sample collection and processing were done as described previously by miller et al miller et al 2017 briefly replicate glass rings with biofilm were removed from the kiwa biofilm monitor and placed in 30 ml of filtered 0 22 μm water in a 50 ml tube glass rings from each biomonitor were vortexed sonicated and centrifuged to dislodge and concentrate the biofilm and the excess supernatant after centrifugation was discarded cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of the original supernatant and then used for viability plating flow cytometry dna analysis and metabolite extraction miller et al 2015 yu et al 2017 methods used for determining amoebae viability were done as previously described by culturing on non nutrient agar nna e coli plates robinson et al 2006 puzon et al 2009 miller et al 2017 positive plates were collected for dna extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr melt curve analysis for species identification a portion of each biofilm sample was used for total dna extraction amoeba species identification and quantification using the qpcr primers and method reported in puzon et al 2009 with standard curves generated from pure cultures of n fowleri or n lovaniensis puzon et al 2009 2 2 microbial enumeration and field site physical and chemical parameters sample sites were monitored for free and total chlorine or chloramine residuals turbidity and water temperature as previously described on the day of sampling at the sites morgan et al 2016 miller et al 2017 a pocket colorimeter ii hach u s was used to measure free and total chlorine or monochloramine and free ammonia concentrations according to the manufacturer s protocol turbidity was measured using a thermo orion turbidimeter aq4500 thermo scientific australia according to the manufacturer s protocol and temperature was measured using the mc 87 dual channel digital thermometer tps australia total cell counts were preformed using flow cytometry in the laboratory as previously described miller et al 2015 gonzalez et al 2016 morgan et al 2016 miller et al 2017 puzon et al 2017 briefly both field samples were diluted to fit into the counting range of the flow cytometry using milli q water of the diluted samples 200 μl was stained with 2 μl 10 of sybr green 1 invitrogen usa and incubated for 15 min in the dark before analysis flow cytometry controls included filtered and or unstained field samples or ringers solution and flow check fluorophores all samples were run in duplicates and averaged results for flow cytometry were presented as cells cm2 for each biofilm samples detailed sample information is summarized in table 1 2 3 metabolite extraction the metabolite extraction from field samples was performed using a hot methanol approach yu et al 2017 in brief a quenching solution 60 methanol v v with 0 85 ambic was made by combining 30 ml methanol vwr chemicals usa 5 ml of 8 5 wt vol ammonium bicarbonate ambic sigma usa and 14 5 ml of milliq ambic 8 5 was created by dissolving 0 85 g of ambic in 10 ml of milliq water the ph was adjusted to 7 4 with 12 m hcl rowe scientific australia brought up to a final volume of 50 ml with milliq water prior to gentle mixing and centrifuging at 5000 g for 2 min the samples were quenched using equal volumes of the quenching solution the supernatant from each sample was subsequently decanted and cell metabolites were extracted from the cell pellet using the hot methanol method each cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl 100 methanol pre heated to 70 c for 30 min samples were then incubated at 70 c for 15 min an equal volume 500 μl of milli q water was added to each replicate and vortexed the sample was then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 1 min and the supernatant transferred to a fresh tube this saved supernatant was then stored at 80 c and used for metabolite analysis 2 4 liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight analysis metabolite separations mass analysis and tandem mass spectrometry were conducted using a liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight system yu et al 2017 specifically an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc system acquity i class uplc waters milford ma coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof waters xevo g2 waters manchester uk was used as the platform for untargeted metabolite measurements before ionization metabolites were separated using a c18 beh uplc column 50 2 1 mm 1 7 μm waters milford ma held at 40 c for separation high purity water with 0 1 formic acid a and pure acetonitrile with 0 1 formic acid b were used as the mobile phases for sample elution the gradient method was set as follows 0 0 2 min mobile phase b was kept at 5 0 2 2 5 min linearly increased to 100 2 5 4 min held at 100 4 4 1 min decreased to its initial condition of 5 4 1 5 min mobile phase b was kept at 5 for column re equilibration the flow rate remained at 0 3 ml min through the data acquisition process each sample was analyzed 5 times using a 10 μl injection with a randomized injection sequence the quality control qc sample was created by pooling equal volumes of each analytical sample this qc sample was inserted into injection queue with a frequency of every 10th analytical sample injection to ensure the consistency and reproducibility of system performance the samples were tested under positive mode using mse function low energy off high energy ramp from 20 to 50 ev over m z range of 100 1200 the capillary voltage was kept at 2 8 kv while the cone voltage was 35 v the flow rate of cone gas and desolvation gas was 50 and 1000 l h respectively and the source temperature was 140 c online calibration was performed by infusing a lockspray solution of leucine enkephalin 2 ng μl with m z of 556 2771 into the system every 45 s during data acquisition the sample data was recorded in continuum mode with a scan time of 0 1 s 2 5 data processing and reduction statistical analysis and significant feature extraction were performing with the progenesis qi v2 0 non linear dynamics durham nc platform using the raw data acquired from the uplc qtof system alignment of the samples using the total ion chromatogram tic was based on the pooled quality control sample the raw data were then subjected to peak picking deconvolution and normalization with the default software settings a master table containing m z values retention times corresponding abundances anova p values and fold changes across different sample groups were then exported for continued statistical analysis the data table was then imported into ezinfo v2 0 umetrics umea sweden for principal component analysis pca where pareto scaling was performed prior to sample classification 2 6 significant feature extraction and identification the significant features across the different experimental classes were chosen according to their ability to distinguish different sample groups with the criteria of anova p values less than 0 05 and fold changes greater than 1 2 the significant features with reasonable intensities were subjected to targeted ms ms with the collision energy ramping from 5 to 65 ev the scan time of targeted ms ms experiment was set at 0 5 s the metabolite identification was aided by comparing fragmentation patterns with the existing metabolite databases including massbank horai et al 2010 metlin smith et al 2005 and hmdb wishart et al 2013 the confidence level of the putatively identified metabolites in this paper was equal to 2 where the exact mass and fragment information matches with those in databases following standards proposed by the chemical analysis working group cawg msi sumner et al 2007 2 7 significant feature analysis the data table generated from progenesis qi consisting of m z retention time and abundance information was directly imported into metaboanalyst xia et al 2009 for further statistical analysis without subjecting the data to any additional filtering normalization and transformation partial least square discriminant analysis pls da and support vector machine svm algorithms integrated in metaboanalyst were used to build up prediction models based on the selected identified features receiver operating characteristic roc plots were generated to evaluate the classification performance with 95 confidence band and the prediction accuracy was computed with 100 cross validation and assessed with 1 3 of the samples as validation test set xia et al 2013 the roc plots are provided in the supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 dwds field site conditions and naegleria species identification field biofilm samples were collected over the course of a year from different field sites in rural western australia to account for seasonal variation in amoebae populations and abundance in the operational dwds biofilm samples from kt sk and t sites at a certain time point contained viable n fowleri while biofilm from ml site contained viable n lovaniensis table 1 total naegleria cells in viable samples ranged from 2 to 600 total cells per sample as calculated by qpcr table 1 samples negative for viable and non viable naegleria were also recorded at sites sk and kt at some time points biofilm samples were positive for either viable n fowleri or n lovaniensis predominantly during autumn average temperature 22 c with the exception of the t site biofilm which was positive during spring temperature 18 c viable n fowleri and n lovaniensis were detected in biofilm samples with an average biofilm density of 1 72 106 cells cm2 and 8 9 105 cells cm2 respectively the average biofilm density of the n fowleri negative samples was approximately one order of magnitude lower 1 4 105 cells cm2 viable amoebae were only detected when the disinfection residual was below 0 1 mg l at all four sites 3 2 multivariate analyses principle component analysis pca was conducted to evaluate the metabolome similarity among different sample groups as shown in fig 1 a the first set of pca analysis focused on the comparison between the n fowleri positive sample 1 3 and n fowleri negative samples sample 4 12 collected from kt site as demonstrated in table 1 the three n fowleri positive samples were collected from the same time point whereas there are four subgroups in the n fowleri negative samples representing 4 collection time points after the disinfection applied to kill n fowleri remarkably distinction could be observed in the pca scores plot with the explained variance adding up to 81 by the first two principle components principal component 1 63 principal component 2 18 the pca analysis revealed the significant metabolite profile difference between the n fowleri positive and n fowleri negative samples though they were collected from the same kt site this conclusion was further confirmed by the pca analysis targeting on the samples harvested from a different field site sk which is 15 km away from kt but receives no chlorine residual n fowleri was detected in sk in two different time points including may 8th 2014 and march 20th 2015 sample 13 14 21 22 the samples 21 and 22 suggested a seasonal recolonization of n fowleri after loss of n fowleri in the winter months as noted previously morgan et al 2016 miller et al 2017 when mapping the n fowleri positive samples sample 13 14 21 22 together with the n fowleri negative samples sample 15 20 23 24 from sk on three dimensional pca scores plot the clear separation was again observed fig 1b the first three components accounted for up to 77 explained variance it is worth noting that the two sets of positive samples 13 14 and 21 22 although collected at different time points still cluster with each other and are well separated from n fowleri negative samples such observation suggests that it is the presence absence of n fowleri plays a major role in separating different sample groups instead of the other changes in the environmental matrix along with time fig 1a and b collectively suggest that the metabolite profile alteration of n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative samples could be successfully captured despite the interferences from environmental matrix as well as the effect of external stress on the n fowleri metabolite profile fig 1c showed the distinction between n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 25 26 and n lovaniensis samples sample 27 28 these samples were collected from different locations and time points of which n fowleri positive samples were from sites kt sk and t respectively while the n lovaniensis samples were harvested from site ml the n lovaniensis samples were clearly distinguished from the n fowleri positive samples in the 3d scores plot with principal component 1 of 38 principal component 2 of 27 and principle component 3 of 11 the pca result of n fowleri and n lovaniensis comparison indicates the potential of using global metabolite profiles to discriminate n fowleri from n lovaniensis in the real field samples 3 3 significant feature extraction to identify the features that enable sample differentiation e g fig 2 5 consecutive steps were applied for significant feature extraction in the first step n fowleri positive and n fowleri negative samples collected from kt were compared with each other and the significant features meeting the criteria as described in the experimental section anova p values 0 05 fold changes 1 2 were extracted a total of 153 significant features were identified with the potential to discriminate the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative samples coming from kt table s1 in a similar way the n fowleri positive and negative samples from the sk site were compared and 120 significant features were identified table s2 following step 2 we compared kt and sk significant features to find the common features mass difference 20 ppm retention time difference 0 05 min appearing in both table s1 and s2 with consistent fold change direction which lead to the identification of 98 common features table s3 these 98 common features capable of separating n fowleri positive and negative samples in kt and sk have higher probability to serve as diagnostic metabolites which can potentially be applied to other field sites for n fowleri detection notably one of putatively identified diagnostic metabolites in our previous lab cultured n fowleri study yu et al 2017 tributylamine was also found in the common feature list containing 98 entries although the aforementioned 98 common features are able to differentiate the n fowleri positive and negative samples they are still lacking the ability of distinguishing n fowleri positive samples from n lovaniensis samples and hence may cause false positive results in the future application to solve this issue in step 4 with the comparison between n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 25 26 and n lovaniensis samples sample 27 28 127 significant features were found table s4 finally the common feature search strategy was applied to table s3 and s4 and 60 features table s5 were found to show up in both significant lists these 60 significant features can potentially separate the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative as well as n lovaniensis field samples extensive efforts were placed towards identifying the chemical nature of the 60 diagnostic features the targeted metabolomics method as mentioned in the experimental section was used to probe the specific features in more details with the collected ms ms serving as input to the available metabolite databases including massbank metlin and hmdb unfortunately most of the amoebae metabolite information is still missing in the current databases which makes the identification of the potential diagnostic features extremely difficult only the feature with a m z of 136 060 and retention time of 0 61 min was putatively identified as adenine or adenosine fragment the ms ms matching result with massbank database is shown in fig 3 where the peaks beyond parent ion m z 136 060 were likely from the contaminants in the field samples that were co fragmented with the targeted ions adenine is a component of adenosine structure in fact a significant feature with 0 61 min retention time and m z 268 1001 close to the mass of adenosine was also found in the experimental data the chemical identities of m z 268 1001 could not be further confirmed because the abundance of m z 268 1001 was too low to generate reasonable ms ms pattern however it cannot exclude the possibility that m z 136 060 is an in source fragment of m z 268 1001 and thus m z 136 060 is labeled as adenine or adenosine fragment fig 4 displayed the corresponding box plots to m z 136 060 which was divided into three different comparison groups kt n fowleri positive vs n fowleri negative sk n fowleri positive vs n fowleri negative n fowleri positive vs n lovaniensis positive in our previous study a total of 63 features were identified as the diagnostic features separating the lab cultured pathogenic n fowleri from non pathogenic n lovaniensis n italica as well as the e coli culture media here we attempted to correlate the significant feature list table s4 in this study with the findings in our previous efforts close inspection revealed that 10 common diagnostic features mass difference 20 ppm retention time difference 0 05 min were identified in both field sample based and the previous lab cultured sample based studies fig 5 table 2 summarizes the information for 10 diagnostic features including m z retention time anova p value q value and max fold changes unfortunately the putatively identified metabolites in the previous guanine phosphocholine tributylamine pc 16 1 9e 0 0 pc 16 1 9z 0 0 and current study adenine adenosine fragment were excluded in the 10 diagnostic feature list leaving the chemical identities of the 10 diagnostic features unclear again the challenge of metabolite characterization facing in this study exhibited the need to supplement more amoebae related information to the current metabolite databases 3 4 significant feature analysis as shown in figure s1 roc curve analysis based on the 10 common diagnostic features was conducted to examine their performance of distinguishing n fowleri positive n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples the prediction models were computed using pls da and supporting vector machine svm algorithms respectively in figure s1a the roc curve of n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 versus n fowleri negative samples sample 4 12 15 20 23 24 was shown with the area under curve auc of 0 995 and 95 ci of 0 977 1 figure s1b showed the model built for discriminating n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 and n lovaniensis positive samples sample 27 28 where both the auc and ci values were 1 the confusion matrix generated from figure s1a and s1b respectively was shown in table s6 for n fowleri positive vs n fowleri negative 6 out of 80 n fowleri negative samples are misclassified into the n fowleri positive group giving a false positive rate of 7 5 for n fowleri positive vs n lovaniensis positive all the samples are correctly labeled with prediction accuracy up to 100 however considering the limited sample size in this study overfitting may occur and thus leads to the overestimated successful rate to further evaluate the prediction performance of the 10 diagnostic features we took advantage of the tester module integrated into metaboanalyst to predict the appearance of n fowleri in the samples collected from t site located 110 and 95 km away from the kt and sk respectively after the n fowleri was detected in the water distribution pipeline in t replicate samples were collected on march 25th 2015 in this study each sample has five technical replicates which gives a total of 10 replicates of site t n fowleri positive samples in the first evaluation the unlabeled t site samples were combined with n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 versus n fowleri negative samples sample 4 12 15 20 23 24 the combined sample set was then processed by the pls da algorithm in the test module which could output the class prediction of unlabeled site t samples based on the 10 diagnostic features as shown in table 3 10 technical replicate samples were correctly labeled as n fowleri positive with the probability more than 50 similar method was applied to the n fowleri positive vs n lovaniensis positive prediction with svm where the unlabeled site t samples were combined with n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 and n lovaniensis positive samples sample 27 28 the prediction results in table 4 exhibit high accuracy where all the samples were correctly identified as n fowleri positive with reasonably high probability overall based on the samples collected from an independent field site the 10 diagnostic features have strong potential to separate n fowleri positive samples from n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive 4 discussion in this study we utilized the uplc ms platform to analyze field samples collected from different sites with viable n fowleri n fowleri positive viable n lovaniensis n lovaniensis positive and no viable naegleria spp n fowleri negative careful analysis of the metabolite pools of the collected samples revealed that a total of 60 features are potentially able to discriminate the samples collected from n fowleri positive sites from those coming from n fowleri negative or n lovaniensis positive field sites the detection results of the uplc ms platform were performed and analyzed independently of the qpcr analysis results and produced identical detection results for n fowleri positive where the n fowleri positive samples are well clustered and clearly separated from the n fowleri negative samples in the pca scores plot of the 60 significant features the one with m z of 136 060 and retention time of 0 61 min was putatively labeled as adenine or adenosine fragment while chemical identities of the other features remain unknown in this study owing to the incompleteness of the available metabolite databases adenine as a member of purine not only takes part in the dna and rna synthesis but also gets involved in cellular respiration in the form of flavin adenine dinucleotide fad and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad chandel 2015 on the other hand adenosine is important structural component of the energy currency adenosine triphosphate atp the increased level of adenine adenosine fragment in the n fowleri positive samples may imply an enhanced proliferation activity of the n fowleri which agrees with our observation in the prior study yu et al 2017 a total of 10 common features were found when comparing the 60 significant features found in the current field study with the diagnostic metabolites reported in prior lab cultured study however the identified metabolites in the prior study consisting of adenine phosphocholine guanine tributylamine were excluded from the common feature list leaving the identities of the 10 common features unknown it is also worth noting that the previously identified metabolite tributylamine remained in the significant feature list obtained in step 3 fig 2 capable of discriminating n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative samples in both kt and sk sites nevertheless it was not included in the significant feature list based on the n fowleri positive vs n lovaniensis positive samples comparison in step 4 fig 2 and thus excluded in the final common feature list generated in step 5 two possible reasons may contribute the exclusion of the identified metabolites from our prior lab cultured study in the current field sample study the first possible reason is related to the abundance of metabolites unlike the cultured samples in the lab which are strictly controlled the amount of viable n fowleri in the field samples may vary greatly which may lead to the intensities of metabolites like phosphocholine guanine tributylamine below the detection limit of our uplc ms platform the second possible reason is that external environmental stress may change the metabolite profile of n fowleri or inclusion of interfered metabolites from microbes found to have a significant positive association i e possible food sources with the presence of n fowleri morgan et al 2016 puzon et al 2017 as a result the metabolites found in the cultured sample are not detected in this study it should be noted that the uplc ms platform was sensitive enough to detect n fowleri in the range of 2 600 cells per sample in an operational dwdss the performance of the 10 common diagnostic features was further tested by predicting the samples collected form site t where n fowleri was detected tables 3 and 4 show good prediction accuracy when distinguishing the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis samples interestingly a recent study noted that viable n fowleri and other naegleria species including n lovaniensis do not colonise dwds biofilm and bulk water at the same time and hence our detection prediction accuracy further supports the potential application of the metabolomics for rapid monitoring and surveillance miller et al 2018 notably all the prediction results in table 4 comes with relatively high probability close to 1 however the probability in table 3 is lower around 0 5 meaning a moderate confidence level on the prediction results future studies are still needed to further expand the diagnostic metabolite pool to increase the prediction confidence and to lower the false positive negative percentage of the prediction results metabolite profiling studies of microorganisms are still rare and often only look at the impact of a single variable affecting microorganisms in controlled conditions such as controlled laboratory culturing conditions a few recent studies have begun to analyze extracellular metabolites in laboratory simulated bulk water excreted from pipe wall biofilm in order to improve water quality monitoring and use the metabolite profiling of the water to predict future microbial induced corrosion events before they happened beale et al 2010 2012 metabolite analysis has also been used to distinguish between viable and irradiated cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples beale et al 2013a to our knowledge this is the first study to directly sample extract and analyze the metabolite pool from operational dwds biofilms which contain viable n fowleri or n lovaniensis further studies are needed to understand the full impact of environmental and ecological factors on the metabolite profile of n fowleri in dwds biofilms the coupling of metabolite studies with complex field samples has massive potential to improve our understanding of the microbial ecology and how is impacted by fluctuating environmental factors 5 conclusion the appearance of n fowleri in engineered dwdss water parks and swimming pools as well as natural rivers lakes ponds and geothermal waters systems poses a risk to public health the high fatality rate of n fowleri caused disease stresses the need for water authorities to monitor n fowleri however the current culture based detection of n fowleri is time consuming and direct molecular methods are unable to assess the viability of n fowleri thus hindering the water authorities effective surveillance and response i e increased disinfection to n fowleri outbreaks building upon the work in our prior study we applied the untargeted metabolomics approach to the n fowleri positive negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples covering different locations along the dwdss and different time points a total of 60 significant features were found to discriminate the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples and among them 10 features matched those identified in the previous lab cultured samples based study with the continued development of uplc ms platforms and robot assisted sampling the information derived from the present untargeted approach may find use in a targeted ms assay aimed at the sensitive detection of n fowleri with the added benefit of assessing viability with advances in instrumentation and economies of scale such instrumentation may significantly reduce the workload and response time of water authorities to further develop this method the workflow ranging from sample collection preparation and data analysis can be further standardized and optimized in addition more samples covering different locations water sources time points and the extension of n fowleri colonization within drinking water pipeline are still needed to further validate the findings in this manuscript and to extend the diagnostic metabolite pool before untargeted metabolomics approach is robust enough to be adopted by the water monitoring stakeholders recognizing the need for continued investigation this study illustrated the potential of an untargeted metabolomics based approach to serve as a supplementary method for n fowleri monitoring in the field sites additionally the results and workflow demonstrated in the current study established a solid base for further development of a sensitive and rapid approach for n fowleri detection in operational dwdss as well as natural and engineered recreational waters acknowledgements the continued access and installation of the biofilm monitors were achieved with the

19336,found in drinking water distribution systems dwdss swimming pools and recreational waters n fowleri is the causative agent of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis pam although cases of n fowleri infections are rare the fatality is comparatively high 95 and surveillance is essential to minimize n fowleri infections however conventional n fowleri detection methods are less satisfying owing to their time consuming and lab intensive characteristics as well as the lack of the ability to determine viability as a result an alternative detection approach capable of determining viability as well as species identification is required to better ensure public health based on our previous research focusing on distinguishing laboratory cultured n fowleri from n lovaniensis and n italica this study applies untargeted metabolomics methods to field samples from operational dwdss a list of diagnostic features was found to preliminarily discriminate the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples with satisfying predictive accuracy the results outlined in this manuscript further validate and improve the metabolite based n fowleri detection approach potentially aiding water utilities in the detection and management of n fowleri in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords naegleria fowleri amoeba mass spectrometry metabolomics rapid detection drinking water distribution 1 introduction the pathogenic free living amoeba naegleria fowleri is found globally in rivers lakes swimming pools and even in the drinking water distribution systems dwdss miller et al 2015 morgan et al 2016 n fowleri is known to cause deadly primary amoebic meningoencephalitis pam when the host accidentally aspirates water containing n fowleri into nasal cavity n fowleri can migrate to the central nervous system to destroy the host tissue and induce intense immune response jarolim et al 2000 marciano cabral and cabral 2007 since the first case in 1961 in australia fowler and carter 1965 over 400 cases have been identified around the world naqvi et al 2016 more than 143 of which occurred from 1962 to 2016 in united states cdc 2017 recently it has been estimated that approximately 16 people annually die of n fowleri infections in the usa matanock et al 2018 though rare pam has an extremely high mortality rate of over 95 with most patients dying within two weeks of infection visvesvara et al 2007 capewell et al 2015 as a consequence monitoring the occurrence of n fowleri in recreational water and dwdss is important to maximize public safety with respect to n fowleri infection substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of a robust n fowleri detection approach conventional detection of n fowleri is time consuming 48 h and labor intensive requiring culturing on non nutrient agar plates nna coated with escherichia coli e coli reveiller et al 2002 mahittikorn et al 2015 the developed qpcr assays can shorten detection time but still have the disadvantages of high cost and inability to determine viability qvarnstrom et al 2006 robinson et al 2006 puzon et al 2009 mull et al 2013 extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of novel detection methods for microorganisms in dwdss keinanen et al 2004 deines et al 2010 in a review by douterlo et al various techniques to investigate the microbial activity of dwdss including real time pcr proteomics and metabolomics to name a few were summarized douterelo et al 2014 particularly beale et al applied gc ms based metabolomics approach to study the bacterial activity in biofilm and its influence on pipe corrosion beale et al 2010 beale et al 2013 inspired by the pioneering work by beale et al in our previous study yu et al 2017 we applied untargeted metabolomics in an effort to develop a robust metabolite based detection approach for pathogenic n fowleri based on the analysis of the metabolome of lab cultured naegleria species pathogenic n fowleri non pathogenic n lovaniensis n italica and culture media e coli we successfully found 63 molecular significant features capable of distinguishing n fowleri from non pathogenic n lovaniensis and n italica as well as e coli in addition the metabolite identities of 4 out of 63 features were putatively confirmed by ms ms matching with standards or available information in metabolite databases in accordance with the metabolomics standards initiative msi standards this metabolite based approach in our previous study has potential as a n fowleri surveillance tool for use by water authorities to monitor the quality in recreational waters and dwdss additionally this method may serve to support future development of n fowleri sensors however to achieve broad implementation and adoption the results from the previous study based upon laboratory clusters where the growth conditions were strictly controlled must be extended to ex vivo samples though promising the interference from environmental matrices and the external stress on the n fowleri metabolite profiles were largely ignored in the previous effort in order to complement and validate the findings from the previous study here we report the classification of field samples collected from different sites within operational dwdss known to be colonized by n fowleri or n lovaniensis using untargeted metabolomics methods the sample collection time spanned from 2014 to 2015 and for each site multiple samples were collected through different time points when viable naegleria spp were detected or killed due to disinfection or removed due to seasonal changes in the dwdss in this study 60 significant features were found to differentiate the n fowleri positive n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples of which 10 have been reported in our previous study focusing on lab cultured samples to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to apply untargeted metabolomics to the problem of rapidly detecting viable n fowleri in colonized field samples the capacity of this technique to rapidly classify the different samples demonstrates the potential of such techniques to impact drinking water monitoring campaigns 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sample collection and preparation field sites were selected based on a history of detection for n fowleri and n lovaniensis as well as a low free chlorine residual less than 0 1 mg l biofilm samples were collected from kiwa biofilm monitors connected directly to the pipe line puzon et al 2009 miller et al 2015 morgan et al 2016 miller et al 2017 prior to analysis samples were stored and transported at room temperature and all efforts were made to expediently extract a range of metabolites specifically biofilm sample collection and processing were done as described previously by miller et al miller et al 2017 briefly replicate glass rings with biofilm were removed from the kiwa biofilm monitor and placed in 30 ml of filtered 0 22 μm water in a 50 ml tube glass rings from each biomonitor were vortexed sonicated and centrifuged to dislodge and concentrate the biofilm and the excess supernatant after centrifugation was discarded cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of the original supernatant and then used for viability plating flow cytometry dna analysis and metabolite extraction miller et al 2015 yu et al 2017 methods used for determining amoebae viability were done as previously described by culturing on non nutrient agar nna e coli plates robinson et al 2006 puzon et al 2009 miller et al 2017 positive plates were collected for dna extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr melt curve analysis for species identification a portion of each biofilm sample was used for total dna extraction amoeba species identification and quantification using the qpcr primers and method reported in puzon et al 2009 with standard curves generated from pure cultures of n fowleri or n lovaniensis puzon et al 2009 2 2 microbial enumeration and field site physical and chemical parameters sample sites were monitored for free and total chlorine or chloramine residuals turbidity and water temperature as previously described on the day of sampling at the sites morgan et al 2016 miller et al 2017 a pocket colorimeter ii hach u s was used to measure free and total chlorine or monochloramine and free ammonia concentrations according to the manufacturer s protocol turbidity was measured using a thermo orion turbidimeter aq4500 thermo scientific australia according to the manufacturer s protocol and temperature was measured using the mc 87 dual channel digital thermometer tps australia total cell counts were preformed using flow cytometry in the laboratory as previously described miller et al 2015 gonzalez et al 2016 morgan et al 2016 miller et al 2017 puzon et al 2017 briefly both field samples were diluted to fit into the counting range of the flow cytometry using milli q water of the diluted samples 200 μl was stained with 2 μl 10 of sybr green 1 invitrogen usa and incubated for 15 min in the dark before analysis flow cytometry controls included filtered and or unstained field samples or ringers solution and flow check fluorophores all samples were run in duplicates and averaged results for flow cytometry were presented as cells cm2 for each biofilm samples detailed sample information is summarized in table 1 2 3 metabolite extraction the metabolite extraction from field samples was performed using a hot methanol approach yu et al 2017 in brief a quenching solution 60 methanol v v with 0 85 ambic was made by combining 30 ml methanol vwr chemicals usa 5 ml of 8 5 wt vol ammonium bicarbonate ambic sigma usa and 14 5 ml of milliq ambic 8 5 was created by dissolving 0 85 g of ambic in 10 ml of milliq water the ph was adjusted to 7 4 with 12 m hcl rowe scientific australia brought up to a final volume of 50 ml with milliq water prior to gentle mixing and centrifuging at 5000 g for 2 min the samples were quenched using equal volumes of the quenching solution the supernatant from each sample was subsequently decanted and cell metabolites were extracted from the cell pellet using the hot methanol method each cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl 100 methanol pre heated to 70 c for 30 min samples were then incubated at 70 c for 15 min an equal volume 500 μl of milli q water was added to each replicate and vortexed the sample was then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 1 min and the supernatant transferred to a fresh tube this saved supernatant was then stored at 80 c and used for metabolite analysis 2 4 liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight analysis metabolite separations mass analysis and tandem mass spectrometry were conducted using a liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight system yu et al 2017 specifically an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc system acquity i class uplc waters milford ma coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof waters xevo g2 waters manchester uk was used as the platform for untargeted metabolite measurements before ionization metabolites were separated using a c18 beh uplc column 50 2 1 mm 1 7 μm waters milford ma held at 40 c for separation high purity water with 0 1 formic acid a and pure acetonitrile with 0 1 formic acid b were used as the mobile phases for sample elution the gradient method was set as follows 0 0 2 min mobile phase b was kept at 5 0 2 2 5 min linearly increased to 100 2 5 4 min held at 100 4 4 1 min decreased to its initial condition of 5 4 1 5 min mobile phase b was kept at 5 for column re equilibration the flow rate remained at 0 3 ml min through the data acquisition process each sample was analyzed 5 times using a 10 μl injection with a randomized injection sequence the quality control qc sample was created by pooling equal volumes of each analytical sample this qc sample was inserted into injection queue with a frequency of every 10th analytical sample injection to ensure the consistency and reproducibility of system performance the samples were tested under positive mode using mse function low energy off high energy ramp from 20 to 50 ev over m z range of 100 1200 the capillary voltage was kept at 2 8 kv while the cone voltage was 35 v the flow rate of cone gas and desolvation gas was 50 and 1000 l h respectively and the source temperature was 140 c online calibration was performed by infusing a lockspray solution of leucine enkephalin 2 ng μl with m z of 556 2771 into the system every 45 s during data acquisition the sample data was recorded in continuum mode with a scan time of 0 1 s 2 5 data processing and reduction statistical analysis and significant feature extraction were performing with the progenesis qi v2 0 non linear dynamics durham nc platform using the raw data acquired from the uplc qtof system alignment of the samples using the total ion chromatogram tic was based on the pooled quality control sample the raw data were then subjected to peak picking deconvolution and normalization with the default software settings a master table containing m z values retention times corresponding abundances anova p values and fold changes across different sample groups were then exported for continued statistical analysis the data table was then imported into ezinfo v2 0 umetrics umea sweden for principal component analysis pca where pareto scaling was performed prior to sample classification 2 6 significant feature extraction and identification the significant features across the different experimental classes were chosen according to their ability to distinguish different sample groups with the criteria of anova p values less than 0 05 and fold changes greater than 1 2 the significant features with reasonable intensities were subjected to targeted ms ms with the collision energy ramping from 5 to 65 ev the scan time of targeted ms ms experiment was set at 0 5 s the metabolite identification was aided by comparing fragmentation patterns with the existing metabolite databases including massbank horai et al 2010 metlin smith et al 2005 and hmdb wishart et al 2013 the confidence level of the putatively identified metabolites in this paper was equal to 2 where the exact mass and fragment information matches with those in databases following standards proposed by the chemical analysis working group cawg msi sumner et al 2007 2 7 significant feature analysis the data table generated from progenesis qi consisting of m z retention time and abundance information was directly imported into metaboanalyst xia et al 2009 for further statistical analysis without subjecting the data to any additional filtering normalization and transformation partial least square discriminant analysis pls da and support vector machine svm algorithms integrated in metaboanalyst were used to build up prediction models based on the selected identified features receiver operating characteristic roc plots were generated to evaluate the classification performance with 95 confidence band and the prediction accuracy was computed with 100 cross validation and assessed with 1 3 of the samples as validation test set xia et al 2013 the roc plots are provided in the supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 dwds field site conditions and naegleria species identification field biofilm samples were collected over the course of a year from different field sites in rural western australia to account for seasonal variation in amoebae populations and abundance in the operational dwds biofilm samples from kt sk and t sites at a certain time point contained viable n fowleri while biofilm from ml site contained viable n lovaniensis table 1 total naegleria cells in viable samples ranged from 2 to 600 total cells per sample as calculated by qpcr table 1 samples negative for viable and non viable naegleria were also recorded at sites sk and kt at some time points biofilm samples were positive for either viable n fowleri or n lovaniensis predominantly during autumn average temperature 22 c with the exception of the t site biofilm which was positive during spring temperature 18 c viable n fowleri and n lovaniensis were detected in biofilm samples with an average biofilm density of 1 72 106 cells cm2 and 8 9 105 cells cm2 respectively the average biofilm density of the n fowleri negative samples was approximately one order of magnitude lower 1 4 105 cells cm2 viable amoebae were only detected when the disinfection residual was below 0 1 mg l at all four sites 3 2 multivariate analyses principle component analysis pca was conducted to evaluate the metabolome similarity among different sample groups as shown in fig 1 a the first set of pca analysis focused on the comparison between the n fowleri positive sample 1 3 and n fowleri negative samples sample 4 12 collected from kt site as demonstrated in table 1 the three n fowleri positive samples were collected from the same time point whereas there are four subgroups in the n fowleri negative samples representing 4 collection time points after the disinfection applied to kill n fowleri remarkably distinction could be observed in the pca scores plot with the explained variance adding up to 81 by the first two principle components principal component 1 63 principal component 2 18 the pca analysis revealed the significant metabolite profile difference between the n fowleri positive and n fowleri negative samples though they were collected from the same kt site this conclusion was further confirmed by the pca analysis targeting on the samples harvested from a different field site sk which is 15 km away from kt but receives no chlorine residual n fowleri was detected in sk in two different time points including may 8th 2014 and march 20th 2015 sample 13 14 21 22 the samples 21 and 22 suggested a seasonal recolonization of n fowleri after loss of n fowleri in the winter months as noted previously morgan et al 2016 miller et al 2017 when mapping the n fowleri positive samples sample 13 14 21 22 together with the n fowleri negative samples sample 15 20 23 24 from sk on three dimensional pca scores plot the clear separation was again observed fig 1b the first three components accounted for up to 77 explained variance it is worth noting that the two sets of positive samples 13 14 and 21 22 although collected at different time points still cluster with each other and are well separated from n fowleri negative samples such observation suggests that it is the presence absence of n fowleri plays a major role in separating different sample groups instead of the other changes in the environmental matrix along with time fig 1a and b collectively suggest that the metabolite profile alteration of n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative samples could be successfully captured despite the interferences from environmental matrix as well as the effect of external stress on the n fowleri metabolite profile fig 1c showed the distinction between n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 25 26 and n lovaniensis samples sample 27 28 these samples were collected from different locations and time points of which n fowleri positive samples were from sites kt sk and t respectively while the n lovaniensis samples were harvested from site ml the n lovaniensis samples were clearly distinguished from the n fowleri positive samples in the 3d scores plot with principal component 1 of 38 principal component 2 of 27 and principle component 3 of 11 the pca result of n fowleri and n lovaniensis comparison indicates the potential of using global metabolite profiles to discriminate n fowleri from n lovaniensis in the real field samples 3 3 significant feature extraction to identify the features that enable sample differentiation e g fig 2 5 consecutive steps were applied for significant feature extraction in the first step n fowleri positive and n fowleri negative samples collected from kt were compared with each other and the significant features meeting the criteria as described in the experimental section anova p values 0 05 fold changes 1 2 were extracted a total of 153 significant features were identified with the potential to discriminate the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative samples coming from kt table s1 in a similar way the n fowleri positive and negative samples from the sk site were compared and 120 significant features were identified table s2 following step 2 we compared kt and sk significant features to find the common features mass difference 20 ppm retention time difference 0 05 min appearing in both table s1 and s2 with consistent fold change direction which lead to the identification of 98 common features table s3 these 98 common features capable of separating n fowleri positive and negative samples in kt and sk have higher probability to serve as diagnostic metabolites which can potentially be applied to other field sites for n fowleri detection notably one of putatively identified diagnostic metabolites in our previous lab cultured n fowleri study yu et al 2017 tributylamine was also found in the common feature list containing 98 entries although the aforementioned 98 common features are able to differentiate the n fowleri positive and negative samples they are still lacking the ability of distinguishing n fowleri positive samples from n lovaniensis samples and hence may cause false positive results in the future application to solve this issue in step 4 with the comparison between n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 25 26 and n lovaniensis samples sample 27 28 127 significant features were found table s4 finally the common feature search strategy was applied to table s3 and s4 and 60 features table s5 were found to show up in both significant lists these 60 significant features can potentially separate the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative as well as n lovaniensis field samples extensive efforts were placed towards identifying the chemical nature of the 60 diagnostic features the targeted metabolomics method as mentioned in the experimental section was used to probe the specific features in more details with the collected ms ms serving as input to the available metabolite databases including massbank metlin and hmdb unfortunately most of the amoebae metabolite information is still missing in the current databases which makes the identification of the potential diagnostic features extremely difficult only the feature with a m z of 136 060 and retention time of 0 61 min was putatively identified as adenine or adenosine fragment the ms ms matching result with massbank database is shown in fig 3 where the peaks beyond parent ion m z 136 060 were likely from the contaminants in the field samples that were co fragmented with the targeted ions adenine is a component of adenosine structure in fact a significant feature with 0 61 min retention time and m z 268 1001 close to the mass of adenosine was also found in the experimental data the chemical identities of m z 268 1001 could not be further confirmed because the abundance of m z 268 1001 was too low to generate reasonable ms ms pattern however it cannot exclude the possibility that m z 136 060 is an in source fragment of m z 268 1001 and thus m z 136 060 is labeled as adenine or adenosine fragment fig 4 displayed the corresponding box plots to m z 136 060 which was divided into three different comparison groups kt n fowleri positive vs n fowleri negative sk n fowleri positive vs n fowleri negative n fowleri positive vs n lovaniensis positive in our previous study a total of 63 features were identified as the diagnostic features separating the lab cultured pathogenic n fowleri from non pathogenic n lovaniensis n italica as well as the e coli culture media here we attempted to correlate the significant feature list table s4 in this study with the findings in our previous efforts close inspection revealed that 10 common diagnostic features mass difference 20 ppm retention time difference 0 05 min were identified in both field sample based and the previous lab cultured sample based studies fig 5 table 2 summarizes the information for 10 diagnostic features including m z retention time anova p value q value and max fold changes unfortunately the putatively identified metabolites in the previous guanine phosphocholine tributylamine pc 16 1 9e 0 0 pc 16 1 9z 0 0 and current study adenine adenosine fragment were excluded in the 10 diagnostic feature list leaving the chemical identities of the 10 diagnostic features unclear again the challenge of metabolite characterization facing in this study exhibited the need to supplement more amoebae related information to the current metabolite databases 3 4 significant feature analysis as shown in figure s1 roc curve analysis based on the 10 common diagnostic features was conducted to examine their performance of distinguishing n fowleri positive n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples the prediction models were computed using pls da and supporting vector machine svm algorithms respectively in figure s1a the roc curve of n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 versus n fowleri negative samples sample 4 12 15 20 23 24 was shown with the area under curve auc of 0 995 and 95 ci of 0 977 1 figure s1b showed the model built for discriminating n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 and n lovaniensis positive samples sample 27 28 where both the auc and ci values were 1 the confusion matrix generated from figure s1a and s1b respectively was shown in table s6 for n fowleri positive vs n fowleri negative 6 out of 80 n fowleri negative samples are misclassified into the n fowleri positive group giving a false positive rate of 7 5 for n fowleri positive vs n lovaniensis positive all the samples are correctly labeled with prediction accuracy up to 100 however considering the limited sample size in this study overfitting may occur and thus leads to the overestimated successful rate to further evaluate the prediction performance of the 10 diagnostic features we took advantage of the tester module integrated into metaboanalyst to predict the appearance of n fowleri in the samples collected from t site located 110 and 95 km away from the kt and sk respectively after the n fowleri was detected in the water distribution pipeline in t replicate samples were collected on march 25th 2015 in this study each sample has five technical replicates which gives a total of 10 replicates of site t n fowleri positive samples in the first evaluation the unlabeled t site samples were combined with n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 versus n fowleri negative samples sample 4 12 15 20 23 24 the combined sample set was then processed by the pls da algorithm in the test module which could output the class prediction of unlabeled site t samples based on the 10 diagnostic features as shown in table 3 10 technical replicate samples were correctly labeled as n fowleri positive with the probability more than 50 similar method was applied to the n fowleri positive vs n lovaniensis positive prediction with svm where the unlabeled site t samples were combined with n fowleri positive sample 1 3 13 14 21 22 and n lovaniensis positive samples sample 27 28 the prediction results in table 4 exhibit high accuracy where all the samples were correctly identified as n fowleri positive with reasonably high probability overall based on the samples collected from an independent field site the 10 diagnostic features have strong potential to separate n fowleri positive samples from n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive 4 discussion in this study we utilized the uplc ms platform to analyze field samples collected from different sites with viable n fowleri n fowleri positive viable n lovaniensis n lovaniensis positive and no viable naegleria spp n fowleri negative careful analysis of the metabolite pools of the collected samples revealed that a total of 60 features are potentially able to discriminate the samples collected from n fowleri positive sites from those coming from n fowleri negative or n lovaniensis positive field sites the detection results of the uplc ms platform were performed and analyzed independently of the qpcr analysis results and produced identical detection results for n fowleri positive where the n fowleri positive samples are well clustered and clearly separated from the n fowleri negative samples in the pca scores plot of the 60 significant features the one with m z of 136 060 and retention time of 0 61 min was putatively labeled as adenine or adenosine fragment while chemical identities of the other features remain unknown in this study owing to the incompleteness of the available metabolite databases adenine as a member of purine not only takes part in the dna and rna synthesis but also gets involved in cellular respiration in the form of flavin adenine dinucleotide fad and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad chandel 2015 on the other hand adenosine is important structural component of the energy currency adenosine triphosphate atp the increased level of adenine adenosine fragment in the n fowleri positive samples may imply an enhanced proliferation activity of the n fowleri which agrees with our observation in the prior study yu et al 2017 a total of 10 common features were found when comparing the 60 significant features found in the current field study with the diagnostic metabolites reported in prior lab cultured study however the identified metabolites in the prior study consisting of adenine phosphocholine guanine tributylamine were excluded from the common feature list leaving the identities of the 10 common features unknown it is also worth noting that the previously identified metabolite tributylamine remained in the significant feature list obtained in step 3 fig 2 capable of discriminating n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative samples in both kt and sk sites nevertheless it was not included in the significant feature list based on the n fowleri positive vs n lovaniensis positive samples comparison in step 4 fig 2 and thus excluded in the final common feature list generated in step 5 two possible reasons may contribute the exclusion of the identified metabolites from our prior lab cultured study in the current field sample study the first possible reason is related to the abundance of metabolites unlike the cultured samples in the lab which are strictly controlled the amount of viable n fowleri in the field samples may vary greatly which may lead to the intensities of metabolites like phosphocholine guanine tributylamine below the detection limit of our uplc ms platform the second possible reason is that external environmental stress may change the metabolite profile of n fowleri or inclusion of interfered metabolites from microbes found to have a significant positive association i e possible food sources with the presence of n fowleri morgan et al 2016 puzon et al 2017 as a result the metabolites found in the cultured sample are not detected in this study it should be noted that the uplc ms platform was sensitive enough to detect n fowleri in the range of 2 600 cells per sample in an operational dwdss the performance of the 10 common diagnostic features was further tested by predicting the samples collected form site t where n fowleri was detected tables 3 and 4 show good prediction accuracy when distinguishing the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis samples interestingly a recent study noted that viable n fowleri and other naegleria species including n lovaniensis do not colonise dwds biofilm and bulk water at the same time and hence our detection prediction accuracy further supports the potential application of the metabolomics for rapid monitoring and surveillance miller et al 2018 notably all the prediction results in table 4 comes with relatively high probability close to 1 however the probability in table 3 is lower around 0 5 meaning a moderate confidence level on the prediction results future studies are still needed to further expand the diagnostic metabolite pool to increase the prediction confidence and to lower the false positive negative percentage of the prediction results metabolite profiling studies of microorganisms are still rare and often only look at the impact of a single variable affecting microorganisms in controlled conditions such as controlled laboratory culturing conditions a few recent studies have begun to analyze extracellular metabolites in laboratory simulated bulk water excreted from pipe wall biofilm in order to improve water quality monitoring and use the metabolite profiling of the water to predict future microbial induced corrosion events before they happened beale et al 2010 2012 metabolite analysis has also been used to distinguish between viable and irradiated cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples beale et al 2013a to our knowledge this is the first study to directly sample extract and analyze the metabolite pool from operational dwds biofilms which contain viable n fowleri or n lovaniensis further studies are needed to understand the full impact of environmental and ecological factors on the metabolite profile of n fowleri in dwds biofilms the coupling of metabolite studies with complex field samples has massive potential to improve our understanding of the microbial ecology and how is impacted by fluctuating environmental factors 5 conclusion the appearance of n fowleri in engineered dwdss water parks and swimming pools as well as natural rivers lakes ponds and geothermal waters systems poses a risk to public health the high fatality rate of n fowleri caused disease stresses the need for water authorities to monitor n fowleri however the current culture based detection of n fowleri is time consuming and direct molecular methods are unable to assess the viability of n fowleri thus hindering the water authorities effective surveillance and response i e increased disinfection to n fowleri outbreaks building upon the work in our prior study we applied the untargeted metabolomics approach to the n fowleri positive negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples covering different locations along the dwdss and different time points a total of 60 significant features were found to discriminate the n fowleri positive from n fowleri negative and n lovaniensis positive field samples and among them 10 features matched those identified in the previous lab cultured samples based study with the continued development of uplc ms platforms and robot assisted sampling the information derived from the present untargeted approach may find use in a targeted ms assay aimed at the sensitive detection of n fowleri with the added benefit of assessing viability with advances in instrumentation and economies of scale such instrumentation may significantly reduce the workload and response time of water authorities to further develop this method the workflow ranging from sample collection preparation and data analysis can be further standardized and optimized in addition more samples covering different locations water sources time points and the extension of n fowleri colonization within drinking water pipeline are still needed to further validate the findings in this manuscript and to extend the diagnostic metabolite pool before untargeted metabolomics approach is robust enough to be adopted by the water monitoring stakeholders recognizing the need for continued investigation this study illustrated the potential of an untargeted metabolomics based approach to serve as a supplementary method for n fowleri monitoring in the field sites additionally the results and workflow demonstrated in the current study established a solid base for further development of a sensitive and rapid approach for n fowleri detection in operational dwdss as well as natural and engineered recreational waters acknowledgements the continued access and installation of the biofilm monitors were achieved with the

19337,ensuring the biological stability of drinking water is essential for modern drinking water supply to understand and manage the biological stability it is critical that the bacterial growth in drinking water can be measured nowadays advance treatment technologies such as reverse osmosis ro are increasingly applied in drinking water purification where the produced water is characterized by low levels of nutrients and cell counts the challenge is therefore how to measure the low bacterial growth potential bgp of such ultra pure water using the available methods which were originally developed for conventionally treated drinking water in this study we proposed a protocol to assess bgp of ultra pure drinking water produced by ro and post treatment including remineralization natural bacterial consortium from conventional drinking water was added to all water samples during this study to ensure the presence of a wide range of bacterial strains the method development included developing an ultra pure blank with high reproducibility to lower the detection limit of the bgp method 50 20 103 intact cells ml compared with conventional blanks such as bottled spring water deep groundwater treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate of surface water supply the ultra low blank consists of ro permeate after adjusting its ph and essential mineral content under controlled laboratory conditions to ensure carbon limitation regarding the test protocol inoculum concentrations of 10 103 intact cells ml may have a significant contribution to the measured low levels of bgp pasteurization of water samples before measuring bgp is necessary to ensure reliable bacterial growth curves the optimized method was used to assess bgp of ultra pure drinking water produced by ro membranes and post treatment including remineralization where the bgp has decreased more than 6 fold to a level of 90 20 103 intact cells ml compared with conventionally treated water 630 70 103

compounds in drinking water and form hazardous disinfection by products dbps havelaar et al 2000 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 gopal et al 2007 or through producing biologically stable drinking water that

turbidity withers and drikas 1998 page et al 2002 colony count van der kooij et al 1982 joret et al 1991 van der kooij 1992 sack et al 2010 2011 biomass volume servais et al 1987 cell number hammes and egli 2005 dixon et al 2012 park et al 2016 prest et al 2016 and cell activity based on adenosine tri phosphate atp van der kooij and veenendaal 2001 2014 van der kooij et al 2017 employing flow cytometry fcm for cell count was evaluated and applied in bgp tests dixon et al 2012 prest et al 2016 because of its advantages of being simple rapid reproducible and informative prest et al 2013 van nevel et al 2017 regardless of the test type and the parameter to be measured each conducted test to assess the potential of drinking water to support bacterial growth requires using a blank ideally nutrient free water which defines the detection limit of the method to obtain reliable and reproducible results bottled spring water evian france has been widely investigated and used as a blank for bgp measurements due to its low nutrient content hammes and egli 2005 vital et al 2007 bucheli witschel et al 2012 elhadidy et al 2016 prest et al 2016 farhat et al 2018 in addition two water types collected at water treatment plants in the netherlands namely deep groundwater treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate of surface water supply have been used as blanks because of their low nutrient content bereschenko and hornstra 2014 guo et al 2014 mikkers and magic knezev 2014 van der kooij et al 2014 table 1 presents the characteristics of each blank although the lowest reported bgp of those blanks is 100 103 cells ml they are still adequate and reliable blanks for drinking water produced by conventional treatment processes with bgp reaching levels of 300 700 103 cells ml prest et al 2016 nescerecka et al 2018 however this becomes problematic if the bgp of treated drinking water decreases below 100 103 cells ml as the measurements will no longer be reliable drinking water produced by reverse osmosis ro is an example of such water with considerably low bgp park and hu 2010 dixon et al 2012 due to the high efficiency of ro to retain bacterial cells madaeni 1999 van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2003 park and hu 2010 and the aoc content escobar et al 2000 hong et al 2005 thayanukul et al 2013 being unable to measure the low levels of bgp with high reliability might limit our understanding of the bacteriological water quality of such ultra pure water and factors affecting it for instance post treatment of ro permeate including remineralization and aeration may have a significant impact on its original quality which cannot be affirmed with conventional blanks therefore it is highly necessary to lower the detection limit of the bgp method by introducing an ultra pure blank with a much lower bgp this is especially true when looking at the increasing number of advanced treatment processes in water utilities including ro treatment plants villacorte et al 2015 in response to more stringent water quality regulations advances in water treatment technologies and increasing awareness of water quality deterioration during distribution liu et al 2017 moreover there are other variations in the test conditions of current bgp methods all of which may influence the measurement and detection limit of the method such as i inactivation procedures of indigenous bacteria e g pasteurization filtration or no pre treatment and ii introduction of various inoculum types if applicable for instance pasteurization is needed to inactivate natural bacteria before inoculating with pure bacterial strains for aoc measurements van der kooij et al 1982 van der kooij 1992 sack et al 2010 2011 whereas filtration is mainly practiced when total inactivation of natural bacteria is unnecessary which is especially true when using a natural bacterial consortium for inoculation hammes and egli 2005 farhat et al 2018 the main objective of the present study is to develop a protocol to assess the bgp of ultra pure drinking water the research focused on i lowering the detection limit of the method by using ro permeate after adjusting its chemical water quality at the laboratory as a blank ii assessing the need for pre treatment i e pasteurization of water samples prior to measuring bgp and iii evaluating the contribution of inoculation to the bgp measurements finally the developed protocol was applied to evaluate the change in bgp of remineralized ro permeate from a pilot treatment system operated at a drinking water pumping station in the netherlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 conventional and ro based water treatment this study was conducted at one of the water treatment plants of oasen drinkwater the netherlands currently the anaerobic groundwater is treated by conventional water treatment processes at a capacity of 340 m3 h the treatment comprises aeration rapid sand filtration softening granular activated carbon gac filtration and uv disinfection at the same location a pilot scale ro based water treatment unit 7 m3 h is operated in parallel which consists of anaerobic ro filtration hydranautics espa2 ld 4040 with 75 total recovery followed by ion exchange 1 4 m3 of lewatit s 2568 synthetic resin for further removal of ammonium remineralization using traditional calcite contactors for the addition of calcium 40 mg l ca2 and hydrogen carbonate

approach the experimental approach is shown in fig 1 firstly the ultra pure blank lab remin was compared with conventional blanks bew dgw and ssf specifically in terms of bgp secondly the factors affecting bgp of the lab remin blank were studied including the undesired addition of nutrients during chemical adjustments of the lab remin blank which was assessed by varying the concentrations of nahco3 namely 61 122 selected for this study 183 and 244 mg l hco3 the ph remained constant at 7 8 0 2 to guarantee that any differences can be attributed to chemical impurities a similar approach was followed to study the undesired addition of nutrients during inoculating the lab remin blank with a natural bacterial community from fresh ctw this effect was assessed for several inoculum concentrations namely 0 5 lowest 1 2 5 10 selected for this study 20 and 50 highest to ensure obtaining a significant impact 103 intact cells ml as compared to the non inoculated lab remin blank the

added volume of the lab remin blank and the average measured bgp of ctw respectively thirdly the effect of initial cell count on bacterial growth was studied by analyzing all water samples with and without pasteurization and observing the resulting bacterial growth curves lastly the developed method was applied to assess the bgp of ultra pure drinking water produced by ro membranes and post treatment site remin collected at different times i e 0 1 2 3 24 48 72 96 264 and 336 h after refilling the calcite contactors with fresh calcite grains the purpose of the latter test was to confirm the applicability of the developed method and ultra pure blank to reliably assess the bgp of such drinking water 2 4 bacterial growth potential bgp method 2 4 1 aoc free materials glassware used for sampling duran graduated clear glass bottles with screw plastic cap and incubation clear glass vials with screw plastic cap of water samples was made aoc free as described in previous studies weinrich

air dried overnight and heat treated in a muffle oven at 550 c for 6 h the plastic lids were cleaned by soaking in heated 60 c sodium persulfate solution na2s2o8 100 g l for 1 h then rinsing three times with ultrapure water and air drying moreover all preparations and procedures for the bgp test were conducted in a clean laboratory environment to avoid air borne contamination 2 4 2 preparation

egli 2005 p and n were added by dosing 0 1 μl ml of both kh2po4 and kno3 stock solutions the blanks are made carbon limited to ensure detecting any potential carbon contaminations during the handling of samples which comes in different forms such as i carbon attached to the glassware and caps ii volatile carbon present in the laboratory environment and iii carbon contamination present in reagent grade chemicals used in the laboratory in addition to the original carbon content of the blanks 2 4 4 samples pre treatment and inoculation to evaluate the influence of initial cell count on the bgp measurements all water types ctw site remin bew dgw ssf and lab remin were analyzed both with and without pasteurization at 70 c for 30 min followed by cooling the samples down to room temperature in an ice bath before any further handling a natural bacterial inoculum from ctw collected during each sampling campaign was added to all water samples whether pasteurized or not to ensure the presence of a broad bacterial community the final concentration of inoculum in samples was 10 103 intact cells ml as suggested elsewhere hammes and egli 2005 farhat et al 2018 the added volume of ctw for inoculation was determined by its initial cell count measured by fcm and it was around 18 2 μl ml 1 75 v v throughout the study period no further amendments have been performed on the practical samples ctw and site remin to measure the actual bgp of these waters whereas p and n have been added to the blanks see section 2 4 3 routinely addition of the different chemicals and inoculum was done using pipettes with sterilized plastic tips which were rinsed 10 times with ultrapure water before using to avoid aoc leaching into the water samples 2 4 5 test handling procedures after performing the aforementioned adjustments each water sample was transferred into three aoc free glass vials by direct pouring of 20 2 ml per vial volume was measured using a reference vial the glass vials containing the samples were incubated at 30 c in the dark under static conditions aliquots were poured from the incubated vials into 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes to perform fcm analysis on day 0 initial count 1 3 6 8 10 13 16 and 20 bgp was expressed as the maximum count obtained during the 20 day incubation period 2 4 6 flow cytometry fcm measurements flow cytometry fcm coupled with fluorescence staining has been selected for this study to quantify cell counts in water samples the fcm bd accuri c6 fcm belgium is fitted with a 50 mw laser with emission wavelength of 488 nm green fluorescence intensity detector fl1 channel 533 30 nm red fluorescence intensity detector fl3 channel 670 nm and sideward and forward scattered light intensity collectors the staining protocol described by prest et al 2013 was applied during this study where two staining solutions were prepared i sybr green i sg 1 100 diluted in filtered ic millex lg 0 2 μm millipore dmso for total cell count and ii a mix of sybr green i and propidium iodide sgpi with a pi working concentration of 0 3 mm and 1 100 diluted sg in filtered dmso for intact cell count the staining protocol includes preheating of 500 μl of sample to 35 2 c for 5 min staining either with sg or sgpi 10 μl ml depending on the desired measurement incubating in the dark at 35 2 c for 10 min and lastly measuring with fcm at 35 μl min flow rate and 50 μl of analyzed sample volume identical settings to volumetric calibration of fcm with setting a threshold on fl1 channel of green fluorescence to 700 data acquisition was performed using bd accuri cflow software where a digital gate was set on fl1 fl3 density plot to distinguish the stained bacterial cells from inorganic particles of water samples and instrument noise the fcm detection limit is 2 103 cells ml samples were diluted when bacterial counts exceeded 200 103 cells ml 2 5 statistical analysis different statistical tools were applied using microsoft excel including i q q plot chi square test and kolmogorov smirnov test to check the normality of data and ii student s t test and anova test to determine the significance of differences when comparing 2 or more than 2 samples respectively simple linear regression analysis was conducted for quantitative correlation between two variables a significance level alpha of 0 05 was considered 3 results 3 1 laboratory remineralized ro permeate lab remin as an ultra pure blank for the bacterial growth potential bgp measurements as shown in fig 2 the bgp of conventional blanks expressed as absolute maximum growth obtained during a 20 day period of incubation was in the range of 80 220 100 210 and 375 500 103 intact cells ml for bottled evian water bew deep groundwater dgw treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate ssf of surface water supply respectively regarding site water samples conventionally treated groundwater ctw has an average bgp of 630 70 103 intact cells ml whereas the bgp of ro treated groundwater after post treatment site remin was reduced considerably more than 6 fold to 90 20 103 intact cells ml which can no longer be affirmed by the bgp detection limit using conventional blanks noteworthy laboratory remineralized ro permeate lab remin has a bgp of 50 20 103 intact cells ml which is significantly lower than that of conventional blanks p 0 05 anova and tukey kramer post hoc tests and site remin p 0 05 student s t test furthermore the lab remin blank showed better reproducibility and the standard deviation 20 103 intact cells ml was at least 2 fold lower compared with conventional blanks 50 103 intact cells ml this observation can also be confirmed by the constant initial cell count of the lab remin blank 2 103 intact cells ml the detection limit of fcm measured on different sampling dates whereas up to 40 variation was observed in the initial total and intact cell count of conventional blanks comparable averages of 60 80 103 intact cells ml for bew dgw and ssf fig s1 3 2 influence of chemicals addition and inoculation on the bgp of lab remin blank the chemical stocks used to adjust ph and mineral content of ro permeate contain impurities which can be biodegradable and lead to increase the bgp of lab remin blank however the results showed that the added volumes of nahco3 stock solution to obtain final concentrations of 61 122 183 and 244 mg l hco3 final ph of 7 8 0 2 in all cases led to insignificantly different p 0 05 anova test bgp of lab remin blank fig s2 introduction of biodegradable compounds can also occur when inoculating the lab remin blank with natural bacteria of fresh ctw which may lead to additional bgp theoretically this additional bgp depends on inoculum volume and can be calculated equation 1 as shown in table 2 δbgpconsortium for several inoculum concentrations namely 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 and 50 103 intact cells ml corresponding to inoculum volume the final inoculum concentration selected for this study is 10 103 intact cells ml as suggested elsewhere hammes and egli 2005 farhat et al 2018 to ensure the presence of sufficient cells to initiate growth the theoretical increase in bgp due to the selected inoculum concentration comparing with non inoculated lab remin blank was in the range of 11 14 103 intact cells ml table 2 which was also observed experimentally with a high significance level p 0 05 student s t test by conducting a large number of tests n 18 tests in triplicate fig 3 b however this increase was experimentally insignificant p 0 05 student s t test with a small number of tests n 1 test in triplicate fig 3a the large number of bgp tests needed is attributed to the higher standard deviation of bgp measurements 20 103 intact cells ml comparing with the target theoretical increase in bgp for instance the measured increase in bgp due to inoculating with 50 103 intact cells ml 80 103 intact cells ml was according to the theoretical calculations 58 70 103 intact cells ml standard deviation of bgp measurements as shown in table 2 even with a small number of tests n 1 test in triplicate fig 3a although the increase in bgp due to inoculation can be theoretically less by decreasing the inoculum concentration to 5 103 intact cells ml or even lower table 2 still a larger number of bgp tests n 150 tests in triplicate based on student s t test calculations will be needed to detect this increase experimentally which is beyond the scope of this study as a result the bgp of lab remin blank without and with inoculation with the selected concentration 10 103 intact cells ml was 35 10 and 50 20 103 intact cells ml respectively therefore contribution of inoculum to the measured bgp of lab remin blank is about 20 30 3 3 effect of initial cell count on the bgp is there a need for pasteurization the typical shape of bacterial growth curves was not observed when the initial cell count is higher than the maximum bacterial growth that can be maintained by nutrients in water this effect was occasionally observed for non pasteurized site remin samples fig 4 a where the initial cell count of non pasteurized samples c0 non pasteurized 170 103 intact cells ml was substantially higher than the maximum bacterial growth that could be maintained by the nutrients available for bacteria cmax 110 103 intact cells ml and thus bacterial counts decreased immediately after incubation this was observed when fresh calcite grains were used in the remineralization step and the attached bacteria may have washed out unlike the non pasteurized samples pasteurized site remin samples resulted in the typical bacterial growth curves where growth parameters could be calculated table 3 an additional example of this case is given in fig s3 in contrast to the previous case non pasteurized as well as pasteurized site remin samples resulted in the typical bacterial growth curves when the calcite filter was in operation for several weeks fig 4b and the bacterial growth parameters could be calculated for both water samples table 3 in this case the maximum growth level for both non pasteurized and pasteurized samples was identical cmax 98 103 intact cells ml regardless of the difference in the initial cell count 3 4 case study monitoring bgp of drinking water produced by ro and post treatment site remin fig 5 shows the bgp results of pasteurized and inoculated with 10 103 intact cells ml of the original water and ctw site remin samples at different time intervals after refilling the calcite contactors with fresh calcite grains bgp decreased dramatically from 470 103 intact cells ml for the sample collected immediately after starting the operation with the fresh calcite grains to a stable level of 80 110 103 intact cells ml after 3 h of operation a similar trend was observed for non pasteurized and inoculated with 10 103 intact cells ml of ctw site remin samples fig s4 similar trends were observed for the dissolved organic carbon doc and initial cell count of non pasteurized samples the doc concentrations and initial cell counts decreased from 3 1 to 0 3 mg l and from 280 to 20 103 intact cells ml over time respectively fig s5 for this monitoring test lab remin blanks were measured on each sampling day and the average resulting bgp was 50 103 intact cells ml which was significantly p 0 05 student s t test lower than the bgp of site remin samples after reaching stability 80 110 103 intact cells ml 4 discussion 4 1 composition of the ultra pure lab remin blank and factors influencing the bgp measurements at low levels of nutrients it is proposed to use a lab remin blank which is ro permeate after remineralization in the laboratory to adjust ph to 7 8 0 2 and mineral content as an ultra pure blank for bgp measurements of very low nutrient drinking water produced by desalination technologies the adjustments of the lab remin blank and the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen ensure that bacterial growth is limited by carbon the ph adjustment of the lab remin blank is necessary since low ph may hinder the ability of bacteria to effectively hydrolyse nutrients russell and wilson 1996 and it requires complex adaptive strategies to maintain a neutral intracellular ph dilworth and glenn 1999 this was confirmed by the observation of no significant growth with the original ph 5 5 of ro permeate in the present study data not shown these results might explain the very low bacterial yield observed in the study of elhadidy et al 2016 for synthetic water comprising milli q water nitrogen phosphorus and carbon acetate without ph adjustments besides mineral addition is essential because the low ionic strength of ro permeate may cause osmotic shock in aquatic microorganisms kaplan et al 1993 the bgp of lab remin might also be limited by the absence of trace elements required for bacterial growth such as fe and mn durand and kawashima 1980 takashima et al 1990 in this regard it is assumed that the minimum required concentrations of such elements are added to lab remin when inoculating with ctw which contains sufficient amounts of those elements table s1 this was confirmed by the observation of no additional growth in the inoculated lab remin blank when a trace elements broth fe zn b and co up to 200 μg l was added fig s6 additionally church et al 2000 also found that similar fe concentration to that available here in the lab remin blank after inoculation 0 15 μg l fe is not growth limiting all the aforementioned adjustments together with the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen guarantee that the bgp of lab remin 50 20 103 intact cells ml is limited by the organic carbon content rather than the inorganic constituents therefore any potential carbon contamination that may significantly influence the low levels of bgp can be detected the addition of chemicals to adjust water quality of ro permeate is a source of contamination where even using reagent grade chemical stock solutions 99 purity may cause unwanted addition of nutrients that could increase the bgp of lab remin blank it is ideal to use aoc free chemical stock solutions for necessary water quality adjustments however they are commercially not available kaplan et al 1993 because chemical manufacturing for laboratory and commercial purposes involves the usage of additives and impurities patnaik 2003 nonetheless the results revealed that there was no significant effect of nahco3 chemical impurities 99 5 purity on the bgp of lab remin blank therefore other chemical stocks i e reagent grade cacl2 and mgcl2 99 purity are assumed to have insignificant effects as well as their final concentration 145 mg l cacl2 2h2o and 35 mg l mgcl2 6h2o in the lab remin blank was lower than that of nahco3 170 mg l nahco3 although ro permeate should be totally bacteria free due to the smaller pore size of ro membranes 1 nm comparing with bacterial cells typically 200 nm it still contains bacteria that are able to grow and reproduce this is a common observation in several ro studies park and hu 2010 dixon et al 2012 fujioka et al 2018 the practical aspects such as leakage in membrane systems e g o rings of interconnectors liu et al 2013a pype et al 2016 or bacterial growth in the permeate side are possible reasons for this observation despite the bacterial content of ro permeate fresh bacterial inoculum of ctw was always added to the lab remin blank to ensure the presence of a broad bacterial community in addition to its original cell load as a result of using fresh ctw for inoculation unwanted increase in nutrient content of the lab remin blank could occur the consistent and simple approach in this study of inoculating with fresh ctw ensures the viability and activity of cells even though protocols to prepare aoc free natural bacterial inoculum are suggested hammes and egli 2005 the additional bgp of lab remin blank caused by increase in nutrients due to inoculation could be quantified δbgpconsortium table 2 as the characteristics of the inoculum are known therefore the measured bgp of lab remin blank can be corrected where the actual bgp can be expressed as bgpactual bgpmeasured δbgpconsortium this correction can be applied for all inoculated blanks and samples but it will be more critical in the case of ultra low nutrient water such as the lab remin blank where δbgpconsortium can reach 30 of the measured bgp when inoculating with 10 103 intact cells ml of ctw and the site remin samples where this percentage decreases to 10 15 however this additional bgp is insignificant for ctw samples less than 2 in this study no correction was made because all the blanks and samples were inoculated with the same concentration of ctw bacteria 10 103 intact cells ml and hence the absolute differences will remain unchanged with and without correction interestingly the results table 2 showed that the increase in bgp of the lab remin blank after inoculation is solely attributed to nutrient content of ctw inoculum this suggests that the indigenous bacteria in ro permeate are capable of utilizing all the nutrients available in the lab remin blank and thus the bgp of the non inoculated lab remin blank reflects the total nutrient content of the ro permeate however we argue here to inoculate the lab remin blank in all cases for any future study before measuring bgp to ensure no growth limitation occurs because of the limited diversity of the bacterial strains in ro permeate 4 2 comparing the ultra pure lab remin blank with conventional blanks in the present study the detection limit of the bgp method was further decreased to 50 20 103 intact cells ml after using the ultra pure lab remin blank comparing with conventional blanks namely bottled evian water bew deep groundwater dgw treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate ssf of surface water supply which have bgp ranging from 100 600 103 intact cells ml as reported elsewhere vital et al 2007 bucheli witschel et al 2012 bereschenko and hornstra 2014 guo et al 2014 mikkers and magic knezev 2014 van der kooij et al 2014 prest et al 2016 and confirmed here the lower bgp of the lab remin blank comparing with conventional blanks was found whether pasteurization was applied before measuring bgp or not fig 2 this observation can be explained by the lower organic nutrient content doc of the lab remin blank 0 3 mg l detection limit comparing with the conventional blanks 0 5 mg l furthermore the measured bgp of the lab remin blank with flow cytometry can be expressed as aoc concentration using the reported yield factor of 1 107 cells μg ac c eq hammes and egli 2005 prest et al 2016 the estimated aoc concentration of the lab remin blank is 5 2 μg ac c eq l and is lower than the reported aoc content of bew 10 52 μg ac c eq l vital et al 2007 bucheli witschel et al 2012 as measured using a natural bacterial consortium according to hammes and egli 2005 however the estimated aoc concentration of the lab remin blank is slightly higher than that of dgw and ssf 1 4 μg ac c eq l bereschenko and hornstra 2014 van der kooij et al 2014 as measured using pure bacterial strains p17 and nox according to van der kooij et al 1982 the latter appears to contradict the bgp results obtained in this study where the lab remin blank was found to support much lower bacterial growth than dgw and ssf the reason is that the aoc measuring protocol has a pronounced effect on the obtained concentrations as previously highlighted ross et al 2013 the critical methodological aspects are the pre treatment of water samples and the inoculum type where the pure bacterial stains p17 and nox are known to lead to lower aoc content compared to the natural bacterial communities hammes and egli 2005 however the estimated aoc content of bew dgw and ssf using the measured bgp in the present study and the yield factor of 1 107 cells μg ac c eq hammes and egli 2005 prest et al 2016 is in the range of 10 60 μg ac c eq l and is significantly higher than that of the lab remin blank another advantage of the lab remin blank compared to conventional blanks is the high reproducibility the results show that the lab remin blank is more reproducible standard deviation of 20 103 intact cells ml compared to bew dgw and ssf standard deviation of 50 103 intact cells ml the reproducibility of the lab remin blank can be attributed to high nutrient removal efficiency and constant performance of ro treatment regardless of feed water quality and environmental factors escobar et al 2000 hong et al 2005 park and hu 2010 thayanukul et al 2013 for conventional blanks they are prone to water quality changes influenced by operating conditions for instance switching extraction wells in the case of groundwater and fluctuating treatment efficiency this explanation can be confirmed by the lower variation in the measured initial cell count of ro permeate comparing with that of conventional blanks up to 40 the higher reproducibility of the lab remin blank implies that any contamination during bgp measurements could be detected more easily comparing with conventional blanks although the bgp of lab remin blank might be overestimated due to the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen it is still lower than the actual bgp of ultra pure drinking water produced by ro and post treatment including remineralization site remin measured without any amendments using a lab remin blank the bgp of the site remin samples could be reliably measured and was considerably lower more than 6 fold than that of conventionally treated water from the same groundwater source the difference in bgp observed between the remineralized ro permeate under controlled conditions lab remin blank and at the site site remin samples in this study indicate that leaching of nutrients could occur during post treatment of ro permeate at the site e g leaching of aoc and microbially available phosphorus lehtola et al 2002 from the calcite grains this leaching was mainly observed when the calcite contactors were refilled with fresh calcite grains to remineralize ro permeate as a higher doc content was measured in the instant effluent preventing water quality deterioration of ro permeate during post treatment processes is a challenging from a practical standpoint where ro permeate comes in contact with different materials e g chemicals fittings pipes which might leach nutrients despite the increase in the bgp of ro permeate after the post treatment processes the bgp of site remin samples is still significantly lower more than 6 fold than that of ctw the considerable reduction in bgp reflects the effectiveness of ro treatment in retaining bacterial cells and aoc content madaeni 1999 escobar et al 2000 van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2003 hong et al 2005 park and hu 2010 thayanukul et al 2013 belila et al 2016 from the water to be treated and thus limiting bacterial growth aoc concentration in the site remin samples is estimated at 9 2 μg ac c eq l using yield factors reported by hammes and egli 2005 and prest et al 2016 and is in line with the findings of park and hu 2010 although higher aoc concentrations have been reported for ro permeate 32 60 μg ac c eq l hong et al 2005 meckes et al 2007 thayanukul et al 2013 it comprised the lowest aoc concentrations among all the tested waters in those studies the variation in aoc content of ro permeate can be largely attributed to the different methods applied to measure it ross et al 2013 as discussed above moreover different design of ro systems in the aforementioned studies including post treatment may also affect the final aoc concentration 4 3 is there a need for pasteurization of water samples as part of the bgp method pasteurization is applied in several biological stability assessment methods to guarantee complete inactivation of indigenous bacteria before inoculating with pure bacterial strains van der kooij et al 1982 joret et al 1991 van der kooij 1992 sack et al 2010 2011 some researchers argued that there is no need for pasteurization to measure the extent of indigenous bacterial growth prest et al 2016 because of its potential effects on modifying the nutrients composition e g proteins denaturing which may increase the uncertainty of the measured values ross et al 2013 however in the present study pasteurization of water samples prior to bgp measurement was found to be necessary even when considering indigenous bacteria for inoculation to avoid the possible influence of abnormally elevated initial cell count on the typical shape of bacterial growth curves and hence bgp outcome table 3 this was occasionally observed for non pasteurized site remin samples when using fresh calcite grains for remineralization where bacteria attached to the grains were washed out fig 4a similar fluctuations in cell concentrations in the effluent of biological filters have been previously observed and linked to the operating conditions servais et al 1994 velten et al 2011 however under normal operating conditions fig 4b pasteurized and non pasteurized samples after the calcite contactors reached comparable maximum levels regardless of their initial cell counts as shown in table 3 this indicates that expressing the bgp results as the absolute maximum growth rather than the net bacterial growth is a better reflection of the actual total nutrient content of these water samples for instance considering net growth implies that part of the nutrients that are utilized by the cells initially present in the sample is totally neglected this becomes even more critical and misleading when comparing waters with different initial levels of bacterial cells which is the case of this study i e ctw and site remin samples based on the aforementioned discussion the comparable maximum growth levels in water samples without and with pasteurization under normal operating conditions suggests that any modification to the nutrient content due to pasteurization is limited however further research is recommended to investigate in depth the potential effect of pasteurization on bgp measurement another advantage of pasteurization besides the fact that it controls the initial cell count in all samples quantitatively is that it ensures that the bacterial species used for the test are the species that naturally grow in water the case of an abnormal initial cell count fig 4a implies that the bacterial species in the non pasteurized sample are mostly attached bacteria onto calcite grains which may differ from the bulk water bacteria martiny et al 2005 bonadonna et al 2009 and consequently have different yields as a result the attached bacteria may dominate the growth characteristics of the water samples rather than the bulk water bacteria which are the target of the test this is especially critical when bulk water bacteria vary significantly from bacteria that may be released from a filter bed alternatively pre treatment of water samples with 0 22 μm pore size filtration is another option to obtain a clear distinction between the initial and final cell count during the growth of natural bacterial consortia i e net growth and specific growth rate percherancier et al 1996 hammes and egli 2005 however pre treatment by pasteurization is preferred over 0 22 μm filtration in this study because of the ultra low nutrient concentration and high sensitivity of ro permeate samples i e lab remin and site remin as even minor leaching of nutrients from the flushed filters can have significant influences on bgp measurement as similarly observed for the influence of inoculation i e δbgpconsortium table 2 4 4 practical implications of measuring low levels of bgp a new ultra pure blank for the bgp method based on a laboratory remineralized ro permeate is proposed and applied in this study to assess the bgp of water produced by a pilot scale ro system there is no doubt that measuring the changes in microbiological water quality is essential for understanding and managing biological stability of drinking water thus using an ultra pure blank including the lower detection limit and better reproducibility makes it possible to push forward the monitoring and understanding of bacterial growth and microbiological quality of drinking water this is especially true for drinking water with ultra low levels of nutrients and cell counts produced by ro systems moreover the lower detection limit of the bgp method can capture the potential of bacterial water quality deterioration after ro treatment however it should also be clarified that the measurable increase in cell number does not necessarily mean that drinking water is biological unstable or that there are problems associated with drinking water bio safety for instance despite the release of cells and nutrients from the calcite contactors leading to measureable levels of bacterial growth the finished water has 6 fold lower growth potential compared with conventionally treated water the lower detection limit of the bgp methods has improved the sensitivity so that small water quality changes can be measured and acted upon other researchers have suggested that a combination of cell number and bacterial community assessment can offer more insight into both the process of bacterial re growth and whether there is improvement or deterioration regarding health related bio safety issues prest et al 2014 liu et al 2018 besides the biological stability including both bacterial count and community it is also interesting to look into how applying advanced water purification technologies can help to control the growth of target opportunistic pathogens for instance the relationship between bgp of total cells and bgp of legionella spp aeromonas spp or other pathogens vital et al 2010 and to what extent drinking water with ultra low levels of nutrients will be able to limit their growth in case of pipe cracks and bacterial intrusion into drinking water especially when considering that organic carbon is not the growth limiting factor for a group of the opportunistic pathogens e g legionella pneumophila williams et al 2015 5 conclusions the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are the ultra pure blank proposed in this study laboratory remineralized ro permeate has much lower bgp 50 20 103 intact cells ml and higher reproducibility than conventional blanks 100 600 103 intact cells ml which led to lowering the detection limit of the bgp method depending on the concentration of the natural bacterial consortium used as inoculum 10 103 intact cells ml it may have a significant influence on the measured bgp pasteurization of water samples prior to measuring bgp is necessary to lower the initial number and ensure similar communities of cells in all samples further research is needed to assess the potential effect of pasteurization on denaturing the organic nutrient content of water expressing bgp results as the absolute maximum growth rather than the net growth is a better reflection of the actual nutrient content of the water this becomes even more critical when comparing the bgp of water with different backgrounds e g initial number of cells the bgp of finished drinking water has been reduced more than 6 fold after applying ro and post treatment comparing with conventional treatment of groundwater from 630 70 103 to 90 20 103 intact cells ml acknowledgments this study was funded by the dutch drinking water company oasen drinkwater the authors

19337,ensuring the biological stability of drinking water is essential for modern drinking water supply to understand and manage the biological stability it is critical that the bacterial growth in drinking water can be measured nowadays advance treatment technologies such as reverse osmosis ro are increasingly applied in drinking water purification where the produced water is characterized by low levels of nutrients and cell counts the challenge is therefore how to measure the low bacterial growth potential bgp of such ultra pure water using the available methods which were originally developed for conventionally treated drinking water in this study we proposed a protocol to assess bgp of ultra pure drinking water produced by ro and post treatment including remineralization natural bacterial consortium from conventional drinking water was added to all water samples during this study to ensure the presence of a wide range of bacterial strains the method development included developing an ultra pure blank with high reproducibility to lower the detection limit of the bgp method 50 20 103 intact cells ml compared with conventional blanks such as bottled spring water deep groundwater treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate of surface water supply the ultra low blank consists of ro permeate after adjusting its ph and essential mineral content under controlled laboratory conditions to ensure carbon limitation regarding the test protocol inoculum concentrations of 10 103 intact cells ml may have a significant contribution to the measured low levels of bgp pasteurization of water samples before measuring bgp is necessary to ensure reliable bacterial growth curves the optimized method was used to assess bgp of ultra pure drinking water produced by ro membranes and post treatment including remineralization where the bgp has decreased more than 6 fold to a level of 90 20 103 intact cells ml compared with conventionally treated water 630 70 103

nevel et al 2017 regardless of the test type and the parameter to be measured each conducted test to assess the potential of drinking water to support bacterial growth requires using a blank ideally nutrient free water which defines the detection limit of the method to obtain reliable and reproducible results bottled spring water evian france has been widely investigated and used as a blank for bgp measurements due to its low nutrient content hammes and egli 2005 vital et al 2007 bucheli witschel et al 2012 elhadidy et al 2016 prest et al 2016 farhat et al 2018 in addition two water types collected at water treatment plants in the netherlands namely deep groundwater treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate of surface water supply have been used as blanks because of their low nutrient content bereschenko and hornstra 2014 guo et al 2014 mikkers and magic knezev 2014 van der kooij et al 2014 table 1 presents the characteristics of each blank although the lowest reported bgp of those blanks is 100 103 cells ml they are still adequate and reliable blanks for drinking water produced by conventional treatment processes with bgp reaching levels of 300 700 103 cells ml prest et al 2016 nescerecka et al 2018 however this becomes problematic if the bgp of treated drinking water decreases below 100 103 cells ml as the measurements will no longer be reliable drinking water produced by reverse osmosis ro is an example of such water with considerably low bgp park and hu 2010 dixon et al 2012 due to the high efficiency of ro to retain bacterial cells madaeni 1999 van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2003 park and hu 2010 and the aoc content escobar et al 2000 hong et al 2005 thayanukul et al 2013 being unable to measure the low levels of bgp with high reliability might limit our understanding of the bacteriological water quality of such ultra pure water and factors affecting it for instance post treatment of ro permeate including remineralization and aeration may have a significant impact on its original quality which cannot be affirmed with conventional blanks therefore it is highly necessary to lower the detection limit of the bgp method by introducing an ultra pure blank with a much lower bgp this is especially true when looking at the increasing number of advanced treatment processes in water utilities including ro treatment plants villacorte et al 2015 in response to more stringent water quality regulations advances in water treatment technologies and increasing awareness of water quality deterioration during distribution liu et al 2017 moreover there are other variations in the test conditions of current bgp methods all of which may influence the measurement and detection limit of the method such as i inactivation procedures of indigenous bacteria e g pasteurization filtration or no pre treatment and ii introduction of various inoculum types if applicable for instance pasteurization is needed to inactivate natural bacteria before inoculating with pure bacterial strains for aoc measurements van der kooij et al 1982 van der kooij 1992 sack et al 2010 2011 whereas filtration is mainly practiced when total inactivation of natural bacteria is unnecessary which is especially true when using a natural bacterial consortium for inoculation hammes and egli 2005 farhat et al 2018 the main objective of the present study is to develop a protocol to assess the bgp of ultra pure drinking water the research focused on i lowering the detection limit of the method by using ro permeate after adjusting its chemical water quality at the laboratory as a blank ii assessing the need for pre treatment i e pasteurization of water samples prior to measuring bgp and iii evaluating the contribution of inoculation to the bgp measurements finally the developed protocol was applied to evaluate the change in bgp of remineralized ro permeate from a pilot treatment system operated at a drinking water pumping station in the netherlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 conventional and ro based water treatment this study was conducted at one of the water treatment plants of oasen drinkwater the netherlands currently the anaerobic groundwater is treated by conventional water treatment processes at a capacity of 340 m3 h the treatment comprises aeration rapid sand filtration softening granular activated carbon gac filtration and uv disinfection at the same location a pilot scale ro based water treatment unit 7 m3 h is operated in parallel which consists of anaerobic ro filtration hydranautics espa2 ld 4040 with 75 total recovery followed by ion

approach the experimental approach is shown in fig 1 firstly the ultra pure blank lab remin was compared with conventional blanks bew dgw and ssf specifically in terms of bgp secondly the factors

nahco3 namely 61 122 selected for this study 183 and 244 mg l hco3 the ph remained constant at 7 8 0 2 to guarantee that any differences can be attributed to chemical impurities a similar approach was followed to study the undesired addition of nutrients during inoculating the lab remin blank with a natural bacterial community from fresh ctw this effect was assessed for several inoculum

treatment site remin collected at different times i e 0 1 2 3 24 48 72 96 264 and 336 h after refilling the calcite contactors with fresh calcite grains the purpose of the latter test was to confirm

egli 2005 p and n were added by dosing 0 1 μl ml of both kh2po4 and kno3 stock solutions the blanks are made carbon limited to ensure detecting any potential carbon contaminations during the handling of samples which comes in different forms such as i carbon attached to the glassware and caps ii volatile carbon present in the laboratory environment and iii carbon contamination present in reagent grade chemicals used in the laboratory in addition to the original carbon content of the blanks 2 4 4 samples pre treatment and inoculation to evaluate the influence of initial cell count on the bgp measurements all water types ctw site remin bew dgw ssf and lab remin were analyzed both with and without pasteurization at 70 c for 30 min followed by cooling the samples down to room temperature in an ice bath before any further handling a natural bacterial inoculum from ctw collected during each sampling campaign was added to all water samples whether pasteurized or not to ensure the presence of a broad bacterial community the final concentration of inoculum in samples was 10 103 intact cells ml as suggested elsewhere hammes and egli 2005 farhat et al 2018 the added volume of ctw for inoculation was determined by its initial cell count measured by fcm and it was around 18 2 μl ml 1 75 v v throughout the study period no further amendments have been performed on the practical samples ctw and site remin to measure the actual bgp of these waters whereas p and n have been added to the blanks see section 2 4 3 routinely addition of the different chemicals and inoculum was done using pipettes with sterilized plastic tips which were rinsed 10 times with ultrapure water before using to avoid aoc leaching into the water samples 2 4 5 test handling procedures after performing the aforementioned adjustments each water sample was transferred into three aoc free glass vials by direct pouring of 20 2 ml per vial volume was measured using a reference vial the glass vials containing the samples were incubated at 30 c in the dark under static conditions aliquots were poured from the incubated vials into 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes to perform fcm analysis on day 0 initial count 1 3 6 8 10 13 16 and 20 bgp was expressed as the maximum count obtained during the 20 day incubation period 2 4 6 flow cytometry fcm measurements flow cytometry fcm coupled with fluorescence staining has been selected for this study to quantify cell counts in water samples the fcm bd accuri c6 fcm belgium is fitted with a 50 mw laser with emission wavelength of 488 nm green fluorescence intensity detector fl1 channel 533 30 nm red fluorescence intensity detector fl3 channel 670 nm and sideward and forward scattered light intensity collectors the staining protocol described by prest et al 2013 was applied during this study where two staining solutions were prepared i sybr green i sg 1 100 diluted in filtered ic millex lg 0 2 μm millipore dmso for total cell count and ii a mix of sybr green i and propidium iodide sgpi with a pi working concentration of 0 3 mm and 1 100 diluted sg in filtered dmso for intact cell count the staining protocol includes preheating of 500 μl of sample to 35 2 c for 5 min staining either with sg or sgpi 10 μl ml depending on the desired measurement incubating in the dark at 35 2 c for 10 min and lastly measuring with fcm at 35 μl min flow rate and 50 μl of analyzed sample volume identical settings to volumetric calibration of fcm with setting a threshold on fl1 channel of green fluorescence to 700 data acquisition was performed using bd accuri cflow software where a digital gate was set on fl1 fl3 density plot to distinguish the stained bacterial cells from inorganic particles of water samples and instrument noise the fcm detection limit is 2 103 cells ml samples were diluted when bacterial counts exceeded 200 103 cells ml 2 5 statistical analysis different statistical tools were applied using microsoft excel including i q q plot chi square test and kolmogorov smirnov test to check the normality of data and ii student s t test and anova test to determine the significance of differences when comparing 2 or more than 2 samples respectively simple linear regression analysis was conducted for quantitative correlation between two variables a significance level alpha of 0 05 was considered 3 results 3 1 laboratory remineralized ro permeate lab remin as an ultra pure blank for the bacterial growth potential bgp measurements as shown in fig 2 the bgp of conventional blanks expressed as absolute maximum growth obtained during a 20 day period of incubation was in the range of 80 220 100 210 and 375 500 103 intact cells ml for bottled evian water bew deep groundwater dgw treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate ssf of surface water supply respectively regarding site water samples conventionally treated groundwater ctw has an average bgp of 630 70 103 intact cells ml whereas the bgp of ro treated groundwater after post treatment site remin was reduced considerably more than 6 fold to 90 20 103 intact cells ml which can no longer be affirmed by the bgp detection limit using conventional blanks noteworthy laboratory remineralized ro permeate lab remin has a bgp of 50 20 103 intact cells ml which is significantly lower than that of conventional blanks p 0 05 anova and tukey kramer post hoc tests and site remin p 0 05 student s t test furthermore the lab remin blank showed better reproducibility and the standard deviation 20 103 intact cells ml was at least 2 fold lower compared with conventional blanks 50 103 intact cells ml this observation can also be confirmed by the constant initial cell count of the lab remin blank 2 103 intact cells ml the detection limit of fcm measured on different sampling dates whereas up to 40 variation was observed in the initial total and intact cell count of conventional blanks comparable averages of 60 80 103 intact cells ml for bew dgw and ssf fig s1 3 2 influence of chemicals addition and inoculation on the bgp of lab remin blank the chemical stocks used to adjust ph and mineral content of ro permeate contain impurities which can be biodegradable and lead to increase the bgp of lab remin blank however the results showed that the added volumes of nahco3 stock solution to obtain final concentrations of 61 122 183 and 244 mg l hco3 final ph of 7 8 0 2 in all cases led to insignificantly different p 0 05 anova test bgp of lab remin blank fig s2 introduction of biodegradable compounds can also occur when inoculating the lab remin blank with natural bacteria of fresh ctw which may lead to additional bgp theoretically this additional bgp depends on inoculum volume and can be calculated equation 1 as shown in table 2 δbgpconsortium for several inoculum concentrations namely 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 and 50 103 intact cells ml corresponding to inoculum volume the final inoculum concentration selected for this study is 10 103 intact cells ml as suggested elsewhere hammes and egli 2005 farhat et al 2018 to ensure the presence of sufficient cells to initiate growth the theoretical increase in bgp due to the selected inoculum concentration comparing with non inoculated lab remin blank was in the range of 11 14 103 intact cells ml table 2 which was also observed experimentally with a high significance level p 0 05 student s t test by conducting a large number of tests n 18 tests in triplicate fig 3 b however this increase was experimentally insignificant p 0 05 student s t test with a small number of tests n 1 test in triplicate fig 3a the large number of bgp tests needed is attributed to the higher standard deviation of bgp measurements 20 103 intact cells ml comparing with the target theoretical increase in bgp for instance the measured increase in bgp due to inoculating with 50 103 intact cells ml 80 103 intact cells ml was according to the theoretical calculations 58 70 103 intact cells ml standard deviation of bgp measurements as shown in table 2 even with a small number of tests n 1 test in triplicate fig 3a although the increase in bgp due to inoculation can be theoretically less by decreasing the inoculum concentration to 5 103 intact cells ml or even lower table 2 still a larger number of bgp tests n 150 tests in triplicate based on student s t test calculations will be needed to detect this increase experimentally which is beyond the scope of this study as a result the bgp of lab remin blank without and with inoculation with the selected concentration 10 103 intact cells ml was 35 10 and 50 20 103 intact cells ml respectively therefore contribution of inoculum to the measured bgp of lab remin blank is about 20 30 3 3 effect of initial cell count on the bgp is there a need for pasteurization the typical shape of bacterial growth curves was not observed when the initial cell count is higher than the maximum bacterial growth that can be maintained by nutrients in water this effect was occasionally observed for non pasteurized site remin samples fig 4 a where the initial cell count of non pasteurized samples c0 non pasteurized 170 103 intact cells ml was substantially higher than the maximum bacterial growth that could be maintained by the nutrients available for bacteria cmax 110 103 intact cells ml and thus bacterial counts decreased immediately after incubation this was observed when fresh calcite grains were used in the remineralization step and the attached bacteria may have washed out unlike the non pasteurized samples pasteurized site remin samples resulted in the typical bacterial growth curves where growth parameters could be calculated table 3 an additional example of this case is given in fig s3 in contrast to the previous case non pasteurized as well as pasteurized site remin samples resulted in the typical bacterial growth curves when the calcite filter was in operation for several weeks fig 4b and the bacterial growth parameters could be calculated for both water samples table 3 in this case the maximum growth level for both non pasteurized and pasteurized samples was identical cmax 98 103 intact cells ml regardless of the difference in the initial cell count 3 4 case study monitoring bgp of drinking water produced by ro and post treatment site remin fig 5 shows the bgp results of pasteurized and inoculated with 10 103 intact cells ml of the original water and ctw site remin samples at different time intervals after refilling the calcite contactors with fresh calcite grains bgp decreased dramatically from 470 103 intact cells ml for the sample collected immediately after starting the operation with the fresh calcite grains to a stable level of 80 110 103 intact cells ml after 3 h of operation a similar trend was observed for non pasteurized and inoculated with 10 103 intact cells ml of ctw site remin samples fig s4 similar trends were observed for the dissolved organic carbon doc and initial cell count of non pasteurized samples the doc concentrations and initial cell counts decreased from 3 1 to 0 3 mg l and from 280 to 20 103 intact cells ml over time respectively fig s5 for this monitoring test lab remin blanks were measured on each sampling day and the average resulting bgp was 50 103 intact cells ml which was significantly p 0 05 student s t test lower than the bgp of site remin samples after reaching stability 80 110 103 intact cells ml 4 discussion 4 1 composition of the ultra pure lab remin blank and factors influencing the bgp measurements at low levels of nutrients it is proposed to use a lab remin blank which is ro permeate after remineralization in the laboratory to adjust ph to 7 8 0 2 and mineral content as an ultra pure blank for bgp measurements of very low nutrient drinking water produced by desalination technologies the adjustments of the lab remin blank and the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen ensure that bacterial growth is limited by carbon the ph adjustment of the lab remin blank is necessary since low ph may hinder the ability of bacteria to effectively hydrolyse nutrients russell and wilson 1996 and it requires complex adaptive strategies to maintain a neutral intracellular ph dilworth and glenn 1999 this was confirmed by the observation of no significant growth with the original ph 5 5 of ro permeate in the present study data not shown these results might explain the very low bacterial yield observed in the study of elhadidy et al 2016 for synthetic water comprising milli q water nitrogen phosphorus and carbon acetate without ph adjustments besides mineral addition is essential because the low ionic strength of ro permeate may cause osmotic shock in aquatic microorganisms kaplan et al 1993 the bgp of lab remin might also be limited by the absence of trace elements required for bacterial growth such as fe and mn durand and kawashima 1980 takashima et al 1990 in this regard it is assumed that the minimum required concentrations of such elements are added to lab remin when inoculating with ctw which contains sufficient amounts of those elements table s1 this was confirmed by the observation of no additional growth in the inoculated lab remin blank when a trace elements broth fe zn b and co up to 200 μg l was added fig s6 additionally church et al 2000 also found that similar fe concentration to that available here in the lab remin blank after inoculation 0 15 μg l fe is not growth limiting all the aforementioned adjustments together with the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen guarantee that the bgp of lab remin 50 20 103 intact cells ml is limited by the organic carbon content rather than the inorganic constituents therefore any potential carbon contamination that may significantly influence the low levels of bgp can be detected the addition of chemicals to adjust water quality of ro permeate is a source of contamination where even using reagent grade chemical stock solutions 99 purity may cause unwanted addition of nutrients that could increase the bgp of lab remin blank it is ideal to use aoc free chemical stock solutions for necessary water quality adjustments however they are commercially not available kaplan et al 1993 because chemical manufacturing for laboratory and commercial purposes involves the usage of additives and impurities patnaik 2003 nonetheless the results revealed that there was no significant effect of nahco3 chemical impurities 99 5 purity on the bgp of lab remin blank therefore other chemical stocks i e reagent grade cacl2 and mgcl2 99 purity are assumed to have insignificant effects as well as their final concentration 145 mg l cacl2 2h2o and 35 mg l mgcl2 6h2o in the lab remin blank was lower than that of nahco3 170 mg l nahco3 although ro permeate should be totally bacteria free due to the smaller pore size of ro membranes 1 nm comparing with bacterial cells typically 200 nm it still contains bacteria that are able to grow and reproduce this is a common observation in several ro studies park and hu 2010 dixon et al 2012 fujioka et al 2018 the practical aspects such as leakage in membrane systems e g o rings of interconnectors liu et al 2013a pype et al 2016 or bacterial growth in the permeate side are possible reasons for this observation despite the bacterial content of ro permeate fresh bacterial inoculum of ctw was always added to the lab remin blank to ensure the presence of a broad bacterial community in addition to its original cell load as a result of using fresh ctw for inoculation unwanted increase in nutrient content of the lab remin blank could occur the consistent and simple approach in this study of inoculating with fresh ctw ensures the viability and activity of cells even though protocols to prepare aoc free natural bacterial inoculum are suggested hammes and egli 2005 the additional bgp of lab remin blank caused by increase in nutrients due to inoculation could be quantified δbgpconsortium table 2 as the characteristics of the inoculum are known therefore the measured bgp of lab remin blank can be corrected where the actual bgp can be expressed as bgpactual bgpmeasured δbgpconsortium this correction can be applied for all inoculated blanks and samples but it will be more critical in the case of ultra low nutrient water such as the lab remin blank where δbgpconsortium can reach 30 of the measured bgp when inoculating with 10 103 intact cells ml of ctw and the site remin samples where this percentage decreases to 10 15 however this additional bgp is insignificant for ctw samples less than 2 in this study no correction was made because all the blanks and samples were inoculated with the same concentration of ctw bacteria 10 103 intact cells ml and hence the absolute differences will remain unchanged with and without correction interestingly the results table 2 showed that the increase in bgp of the lab remin blank after inoculation is solely attributed to nutrient content of ctw inoculum this suggests that the indigenous bacteria in ro permeate are capable of utilizing all the nutrients available in the lab remin blank and thus the bgp of the non inoculated lab remin blank reflects the total nutrient content of the ro permeate however we argue here to inoculate the lab remin blank in all cases for any future study before measuring bgp to ensure no growth limitation occurs because of the limited diversity of the bacterial strains in ro permeate 4 2 comparing the ultra pure lab remin blank with conventional blanks in the present study the detection limit of the bgp method was further decreased to 50 20 103 intact cells ml after using the ultra pure lab remin blank comparing with conventional blanks namely bottled evian water bew deep groundwater dgw treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate ssf of surface water supply which have bgp ranging from 100 600 103 intact cells ml as reported elsewhere vital et al 2007 bucheli witschel et al 2012 bereschenko and hornstra 2014 guo et al 2014 mikkers and magic knezev 2014 van der kooij et al 2014 prest et al 2016 and confirmed here the lower bgp of the lab remin blank comparing with conventional blanks was found whether pasteurization was applied before measuring bgp or not fig 2 this observation can be explained by the lower organic nutrient content doc of the lab remin blank 0 3 mg l detection limit comparing with the conventional blanks 0 5 mg l furthermore the measured bgp of the lab remin blank with flow cytometry can be expressed as aoc concentration using the reported yield factor of 1 107 cells μg ac c eq hammes and egli 2005 prest et al 2016 the estimated aoc concentration of the lab remin blank is 5 2 μg ac c eq l and is lower than the reported aoc content of bew 10 52 μg ac c eq l vital et al 2007 bucheli witschel et al 2012 as measured using a natural bacterial consortium according to hammes and egli 2005 however the estimated aoc concentration of the lab remin blank is slightly higher than that of dgw and ssf 1 4 μg ac c eq l bereschenko and hornstra 2014 van der kooij et al 2014 as measured using pure bacterial strains p17 and nox according to van der kooij et al 1982 the latter appears to contradict the bgp results obtained in this study where the lab remin blank was found to support much lower bacterial growth than dgw and ssf the reason is that the aoc measuring protocol has a pronounced effect on the obtained concentrations as previously highlighted ross et al 2013 the critical methodological aspects are the pre treatment of water samples and the inoculum type where the pure bacterial stains p17 and nox are known to lead to lower aoc content compared to the natural bacterial communities hammes and egli 2005 however the estimated aoc content of bew dgw and ssf using the measured bgp in the present study and the yield factor of 1 107 cells μg ac c eq hammes and egli 2005 prest et al 2016 is in the range of 10 60 μg ac c eq l and is significantly higher than that of the lab remin blank another advantage of the lab remin blank compared to conventional blanks is the high reproducibility the results show that the lab remin blank is more reproducible standard deviation of 20 103 intact cells ml compared to bew dgw and ssf standard deviation of 50 103 intact cells ml the reproducibility of the lab remin blank can be attributed to high nutrient removal efficiency and constant performance of ro treatment regardless of feed water quality and environmental factors escobar et al 2000 hong et al 2005 park and hu 2010 thayanukul et al 2013 for conventional blanks they are prone to water quality changes influenced by operating conditions for instance switching extraction wells in the case of groundwater and fluctuating treatment efficiency this explanation can be confirmed by the lower variation in the measured initial cell count of ro permeate comparing with that of conventional blanks up to 40 the higher reproducibility of the lab remin blank implies that any contamination during bgp measurements could be detected more easily comparing with conventional blanks although the bgp of lab remin blank might be overestimated due to the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen it is still lower than the actual bgp of ultra pure drinking water produced by ro and post treatment including remineralization site remin measured without any amendments using a lab remin blank the bgp of the site remin samples could be reliably measured and was considerably lower more than 6 fold than that of conventionally treated water from the same groundwater source the difference in bgp observed between the remineralized ro permeate under controlled conditions lab remin blank and at the site site remin samples in this study indicate that leaching of nutrients could occur during post treatment of ro permeate at the site e g leaching of aoc and microbially available phosphorus lehtola et al 2002 from the calcite grains this leaching was mainly observed when the calcite contactors were refilled with fresh calcite grains to remineralize ro permeate as a higher doc content was measured in the instant effluent preventing water quality deterioration of ro permeate during post treatment processes is a challenging from a practical standpoint where ro permeate comes in contact with different materials e g chemicals fittings pipes which might leach nutrients despite the increase in the bgp of ro permeate after the post treatment processes the bgp of site remin samples is still significantly lower more than 6 fold than that of ctw the considerable reduction in bgp reflects the effectiveness of ro treatment in retaining bacterial cells and aoc content madaeni 1999 escobar et al 2000 van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2003 hong et al 2005 park and hu 2010 thayanukul et al 2013 belila et al 2016 from the water to be treated and thus limiting bacterial growth aoc concentration in the site remin samples is estimated at 9 2 μg ac c eq l using yield factors reported by hammes and egli 2005 and prest et al 2016 and is in line with the findings of park and hu 2010 although higher aoc concentrations have been reported for ro permeate 32 60 μg ac c eq l hong et al 2005 meckes et al 2007 thayanukul et al 2013 it comprised the lowest aoc concentrations among all the tested waters in those studies the variation in aoc content of ro permeate can be largely attributed to the different methods applied to measure it ross et al 2013 as discussed above moreover different design of ro systems in the aforementioned studies including post treatment may also affect the final aoc concentration 4 3 is there a need for pasteurization of water samples as part of the bgp method pasteurization is applied in several biological stability assessment methods to guarantee complete inactivation of indigenous bacteria before inoculating with pure bacterial strains van der kooij et al 1982 joret et al 1991 van der kooij 1992 sack et al 2010 2011 some researchers argued that there is no need for pasteurization to measure the extent of indigenous bacterial growth prest et al 2016 because of its potential effects on modifying the nutrients composition e g proteins denaturing which may increase the uncertainty of the measured values ross et al 2013 however in the present study pasteurization of water samples prior to bgp measurement was found to be necessary even when considering indigenous bacteria for inoculation to avoid the possible influence of abnormally elevated initial cell count on the typical shape of bacterial growth curves and hence bgp outcome table 3 this was occasionally observed for non pasteurized site remin samples when using fresh calcite grains for remineralization where bacteria attached to the grains were washed out fig 4a similar fluctuations in cell concentrations in the effluent of biological filters have been previously observed and linked to the operating conditions servais et al 1994 velten et al 2011 however under normal operating conditions fig 4b pasteurized and non pasteurized samples after the calcite contactors reached comparable maximum levels regardless of their initial cell counts as shown in table 3 this indicates that expressing the bgp results as the absolute maximum growth rather than the net bacterial growth is a better reflection of the actual total nutrient content of these water samples for instance considering net growth implies that part of the nutrients that are utilized by the cells initially present in the sample is totally neglected this becomes even more critical and misleading when comparing waters with different initial levels of bacterial cells which is the case of this study i e ctw and site remin samples based on the aforementioned discussion the comparable maximum growth levels in water samples without and with pasteurization under normal operating conditions suggests that any modification to the nutrient content due to pasteurization is limited however further research is recommended to investigate in depth the potential effect of pasteurization on bgp measurement another advantage of pasteurization besides the fact that it controls the initial cell count in all samples quantitatively is that it ensures that the bacterial species used for the test are the species that naturally grow in water the case of an abnormal initial cell count fig 4a implies that the bacterial species in the non pasteurized sample are mostly attached bacteria onto calcite grains which may differ from the bulk water bacteria martiny et al 2005 bonadonna et al 2009 and consequently have different yields as a result the attached bacteria may dominate the growth characteristics of the water samples rather than the bulk water bacteria which are the target of the test this is especially critical when bulk water bacteria vary significantly from bacteria that may be released from a filter bed alternatively pre treatment of water samples with 0 22 μm pore size filtration is another option to obtain a clear distinction between the initial and final cell count during the growth of natural bacterial consortia i e net growth and specific growth rate percherancier et al 1996 hammes and egli 2005 however pre treatment by pasteurization is preferred over 0 22 μm filtration in this study because of the ultra low nutrient concentration and high sensitivity of ro permeate samples i e lab remin and site remin as even minor leaching of nutrients from the flushed filters can have significant influences on bgp measurement as similarly observed for the influence of inoculation i e δbgpconsortium table 2 4 4 practical implications of measuring low levels of bgp a new ultra pure blank for the bgp method based on a laboratory remineralized ro permeate is proposed and applied in this study to assess the bgp of water produced by a pilot scale ro system there is no doubt that measuring the changes in microbiological water quality is essential for understanding and managing biological stability of drinking water thus using an ultra pure blank including the lower detection limit and better reproducibility makes it possible to push forward the monitoring and understanding of bacterial growth and microbiological quality of drinking water this is especially true for drinking water with ultra low levels of nutrients and cell counts produced by ro systems moreover the lower detection limit of the bgp method can capture the potential of bacterial water quality deterioration after ro treatment however it should also be clarified that the measurable increase in cell number does not necessarily mean that drinking water is biological unstable or that there are problems associated with drinking water bio safety for instance despite the release of cells and nutrients from the calcite contactors leading to measureable levels of bacterial growth the finished water has 6 fold lower growth potential compared with conventionally treated water the lower detection limit of the bgp methods has improved the sensitivity so that small water quality changes can be measured and acted upon other researchers have suggested that a combination of cell number and bacterial community assessment can offer more insight into both the process of bacterial re growth and whether there is improvement or deterioration regarding health related bio safety issues prest et al 2014 liu et al 2018 besides the biological stability including both bacterial count and community it is also interesting to look into how applying advanced water purification technologies can help to control the growth of target opportunistic pathogens for instance the relationship between bgp of total cells and bgp of legionella spp aeromonas spp or other pathogens vital et al 2010 and to what extent drinking water with ultra low levels of nutrients will be able to limit their growth in case of pipe cracks and bacterial intrusion into drinking water especially when considering that organic carbon is not the growth limiting factor for a group of the opportunistic pathogens e g legionella pneumophila williams et al 2015 5 conclusions the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are the ultra pure blank proposed in this study laboratory remineralized ro permeate has much lower bgp 50 20 103 intact cells ml and higher reproducibility than conventional blanks 100 600 103 intact cells ml which led to lowering the detection limit of the bgp method depending on the concentration of the natural bacterial consortium used as inoculum 10 103 intact cells ml it may have a significant influence on the measured bgp pasteurization of water samples prior to measuring bgp is necessary to lower the initial number and ensure similar communities of cells in all samples further research is needed to assess the potential effect of pasteurization on denaturing the organic nutrient content of water expressing bgp results as the absolute maximum growth rather than the net growth is a better reflection of the actual nutrient content of the water this becomes even more critical when comparing the bgp of water with different backgrounds e g initial number of cells the bgp of finished drinking water has been reduced more than 6 fold after applying ro and post treatment comparing with conventional treatment of groundwater from 630 70 103 to 90 20 103 intact cells ml acknowledgments this study was funded by the dutch drinking water company oasen drinkwater the authors

19338,as more sensor data become available across urban water systems it is often unclear which of these new measurements are actually useful and how they can be efficiently ingested to improve predictions we present a data driven approach for modeling and predicting flows across combined sewer and drainage systems which fuses sensor measurements with output of a large numerical simulation model rather than adjusting the structure and parameters of the numerical model as is commonly done when new data become available our approach instead learns causal relationships between the numerically modeled outputs distributed rainfall measurements and measured flows by treating an existing numerical model even one that may be outdated as just another data stream we illustrate how to automatically select and combine features that best explain flows for any given location this allows for new sensor measurements to be rapidly fused with existing knowledge of the system without requiring recalibration of the underlying physics our approach based on directed information di and boosted regression trees brt is evaluated by fusing measurements across nearly 30 rain gages 15 flow locations and the outputs of a numerical sewer model in the city of detroit michigan one of the largest combined sewer systems in the world the results illustrate that the boosted regression trees provide skillful predictions of flow especially when compared to an existing numerical model the innovation of this paper is the use of the directed information step which selects only those inputs that are causal with measurements at locations of interest better predictions are achieved when the directed information step is used because it reduces overfitting during the training phase of the predictive algorithm in the age of big water data this finding highlights the importance of screening all available data sources before using them as inputs to data driven models since more may not always be better we discuss the generalizability of the case study and the requirements of transferring the approach to other systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords flow prediction causality

soil types orifices and subcatchment dynamics for large cities this can often lead to highly structured models that are difficult to parameterize and calibrate simultaneously many cities are scaling efforts to monitor assets in real time which means that more distributed sensor data are becoming available for example flow meters water level sensors and water quality sensors are now readily being deployed across urban water systems kerkez et al 2016 the proliferation of sensors seems promising but more data may not always be helpful especially if they do not exhibit a causal relationship with states being modeled in those instances two questions arise 1 which emerging sources of data are actually useful in explaining flow across large urban water systems 2 for those inputs that are deemed important what quantity of data is required and how can these data be rapidly ingested to improve predictions instead of relying on the recalibration of a numerical model this paper presents a data driven approach that combines all available data sources including the outputs of an existing numerical model into a holistic and automated prediction of water flows in this way the predictive skill embedded in a numerical model is retained when useful while any additional sources of sensor data are ingested to further improve predictions the fundamental contribution of the paper is a new method to predict flows in urban drainage systems which 1 selects useful causal inputs through a directed information algorithm and 2 yields flow predictions with the selected inputs using boosted regression trees as more diverse data sources become available to decision makers this approach will allow for the rapid and automated incorporation of emerging data into holistic predictions of flows the approach is evaluated by fusing measurements from nearly 30 rain gages and 15 flow sensors with the outputs of a numerical sewer model in the city of detroit michigan 2 background 2 1 predicting through numerical models a number of popular urban drainage models are presently in use including the stormwater management model swmm mike urban and hec hms to name a few these models couple hydrology and hydraulics numerically computing processes such as infiltration and shallow water flow once calibrated these models can be very effective at forecasting and decision making across fine spatiotemporal resolutions the most common approach to model calibration seeks to adjust the model structure and its parameters so that the model output agrees with the measurements sun and sun 2015 this often includes a combination of manual parameter tuning that relies on the expertise of modelers or in some cases auto calibration doherty 2015 if knowledge is updated due to changes in infrastructure new measurements or updated information on the watershed model recalibration is often needed it is well known that standard parameter calibration methods are subject to the curse of dimensionality where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of calibrating parameters sun and sun 2015 given this complexity and resulting financial cost of recalibration most water models hardly keep pace with urban change or the emergence of new data sources in fact it is not uncommon for many numerical water models in the united states to be over a decade as such more streamlined approaches are needed to keep pace with the emergence of new data sources and to ensure forecasts are made using the most relevant and up to date information 2 2 data driven forecasting in lieu of statistical models a number of data driven approaches are showing promise to model water systems instead of explicitly modeling physics these approaches rely only on data such as sensor measurements or features of a system to make forecasts while data driven models cannot always provide insight into system behavior they can enable streamlined and adaptive toolchains to rapidly ingest many data sources broadly many of these approaches fall under the umbrella of supervised machine learning ml approaches which use historical data to learn complex mappings between inputs and a target variable when modeling flows across urban water systems traditional ml approaches such as generalized linear regression may not work well due to the nonlinearities and collinearities inherent in complex systems dormann et al 2013 nonlinear mappings can be learned through methods such as artificial neural networks ann but these often require a large amount of data and are computationally expensive schalkoff 1997 for many applications a supervised ml approach known as boosted regression trees has recently shown promise in balancing computational intensity with performance according to caruana and niculescu mizil 2006 boosted regression trees have shown the best overall predictive performance among supervised learning algorithms while remaining immune to collinearity regardless of the choice of algorithm it is well known that many data driven approaches may be sensitive to overfitting due to inadequate input data selection especially if irrelevant inputs are used during training ng 1998 as such the prospects associated with access to many new sensor measurements may be hampered by the realization that more is not always better that is not all data may be useful and brute force use of all available data may actually lead to worse forecasts 3 methods instead of forcing the choice between a numerical or data driven approach as is commonly done our method seeks to strike a balance by combining the benefits of both the toolchain uses boosted regression trees to make forecasts by ingesting a large number of input features fig 1 however instead of using sensor data as the only input we also treat an existing numerical model as another input data source the idea being that even an out of date or poorly calibrated numerical model may still embed a significant amount of information which may not be captured by sensor data alone depending on the location of interest various combinations of input features may provide the best forecast as such an innovation in our approach is a preliminary step which uses the criterion of directed information to determine which inputs may lead to the best prediction this forms a holistic and automated toolchain which ingests all available data but reduces the risk of overfitting by selecting the most useful data for forecasting 3 1 feature selection using directed information given a set of random processes x x 1 x 2 x m and a target random process y we seek to predict the process y using the processes in x in our case y represents a time series of flow measurements at the location for which we would like to generate future predictions namely the target variable the processes x include time series that could be used to derive a predictive model for y such as rainfall measurements as well as the outputs of a numerical model in many cases it may not be advantageous to use all processes from x as inputs to a predictive model because this may lead to a model that performs well in the training phase but one that performs poorly in prediction i e overfitting instead the goal is to select a subset of processes that are useful in describing y statistically this can be captured using granger causality granger 1969 if predictions of y are improved by using a process x i x we say x i statistically causes y more formally x i causes y as measured by granger causality if the past of x i can help predict the future of y the metric of causality known as directed information di is an information theoretic quantity that measures the statistical causation given a set of random processes x x 1 x 2 x m and y the directed information i from x 1 to y is defined as the time averaged expected log likelihood ratio between two conditional probability distributions of y at time step t y t equation 1 this ratio is also known as kullback leibler divergence kullback and leibler 1951 for the conditional probability in the numerator y t is conditioned on the past of x 1 x 1 1 t 1 marko 1973 kramer 1998 1 i x 1 y x 2 x m 1 n t 1 n e p y x 1 x 2 x m log p y t x 1 1 t 1 x 2 1 t 1 x m 1 t 1 p y t x 2 1 t 1 x m 1 t 1 where x i t 1 t 2 denotes the process x i from time step t1 to t2 if the past of x 1 can help predict the future of y then the conditional probability with x 1 1 t 1 p y t x 1 1 t 1 x 2 1 t 1 x m 1 t 1 is larger than the conditional probability without x 1 1 t 1 and the expected log likelihood of their ratio will be positive otherwise if the past of x 1 cannot help predict the future of y then the two conditional probabilities are equal in which case the expected log likelihood of their ratio is zero in other words the future value of y is conditionally independent from the past value of x 1 x 1 1 t 1 given the past value of the rest processes in x x 2 1 t 1 x m 1 t 1 for random processes y and x 1 the larger the directed information value the more causal influence x 1 has on y and hence the more useful x 1 is on predicting y to reduce potential overfitting we use a model complexity penalty known as minimum description length mdl grünwald 2007 2 m d l h l o g 2 n 2 n where h denotes the markov order and n denotes the sample size of x i used for model fitting the use of this penalty term ensures that only the random processes with directed information values larger than the mdl are considered as causal this is summarized in algorithm 1 which seeks to store all these causal processes in a new subset g which will be subsequently used as input to a prediction algorithm modified from quinn et al 2015 when selecting candidate features for the directed information test non deterministic relationships among all features need to be guaranteed that is no feature can be derived directly from the others image 2 3 2 prediction using boosted regression trees once the causal features are selected using the directed information di approach they can be used to train a predictive model which in our case takes the form of boosted regression trees brt instead of learning one regression tree boosted regression trees learn multiple trees and weigh them to describe the relationship between the target variable and the features boosted regression trees rely on boosting methods that create an ensemble of regression models to improve the accuracy of model fitting elith et al 2008 given a regression problem boosted regression trees assign individual weights to every sample point of the training data set a single regression tree is then constructed and evaluated using the data a loss function wald 1950 which describes the deviance between the measurements and predicted values is used to update the individual weights on the tree the data points with larger deviance are assigned larger weights in the next step after the updated weights are assigned to individual data points a new regression tree is constructed the procedure repeats until the number of the iterations m is reached algorithm 2 through a forward and additive fashion boosted regression trees gradually optimize predictive performance by using linear combination of all individual trees like many supervised ml approaches boosted regression trees can still be subject to overfitting if too many features are used to this end the directed information is used to select only causal features thereby reducing the potential for overfitting in the final boosted regression trees image 3 4 case study and implementation 4 1 study area our case study concerns the prediction of flows in large combined sewer systems specifically we focus on the city of detroit michigan one of the largest combined sewer collection systems in the united states fig 2 we seek to predict daily flows at locations of interest using a large number of available data sources detroit and its surrounding suburbs are the largest urban source of total phosphorus to the river system connecting lakes huron and erie maccoux et al 2016 and because phosphorus load from this system is driven primarily by flow predicting and controlling the occurrence of combined sewer overflows is important while dozens of new measurements e g rain gages have become available across the city they have not yet been used in a predictive model a physically based numerical model is available but was updated over 6 years ago as such this case study presents a great opportunity to apply our approach to fusing new sensor data with the expertise embedded in the existing numerical model 4 2 data source numerical model in 1998 a physically based hydrological and hydraulic model was developed using the epa storm water management model swmm for the detroit sewer collection system s 1963 2 km2 service area tenbroek et al 1999 fig 2 the first version of the model was initially calibrated with available flow data santini et al 2001 since then it has been updated several times to reflect new facilities including 14 major combined sewer overflow outfalls sites b through o in fig 2 the latest version of the model was released in 2012 which is the model that has been shared with the authors initial inspection revealed that while the model did represent some of the larger downstream flows adequately e g flows at the final outlet of the system it generally overestimated daily flows across smaller upstream locations 4 3 data source sensor measurements hourly flow measurements were made by sensors at the terminal node of the system fig 2 site a from april 2014 to july 2014 representing the inflows into the wastewater treatment plant event based combined sewer overflow volume measurements from may 2013 to october 2015 were also obtained from the michigan department of environmental quality 1 1 michigan department of environmental quality mdeq http www michigan gov deq for 38 storm events during this period most combined sewer overflow events occurred within one day however when an event spanned multiple days a daily average was obtained by dividing the total discharge by the number of days of the event hourly precipitation data from 2013 to 2015 which served as input into the numerical model were also obtained from 30 distributed rain gages in the service area fig 2 4 4 implementation the objective of the evaluation was to predict daily inflows to the wastewater treatment plant and sewer overflows at 15 sites for the purpose of this study predicting inflows to the treatment plant tests the ability of the approach to describe large scale continuous flows while predicting combined sewer overflows captures the ability to predict smaller scale more dynamic events data from all rain gages were used as inputs to the swmm model after which swmm outputs were used as input into the directed information test the rainfall data were manually quality controlled by gap filling measurements or saturation points through interpolation with neighboring gages this was intended to ensure that the highest possible quality inputs were used as inputs to the swmm for each site the directed information test was first used to select causal input features from available rain gages and co located swmm outputs while feasible upstream flow measurements were not used as inputs to downstream predictions since it was assumed that upstream dynamics are implicitly captured by swmm to meet the non determinism criterion of the directed information test one of the gages site 2 was randomly removed from the data set before the directed information algorithm was executed once causal features were selected they were forwarded to the boosted regression trees algorithm 60 40 split for training and validation through iteration the number of trees was set to 500 while the tree depth was set equal to 4 and the learning rate equal to 0 1 to promote transparency experimental repeatability and broader adoption all of the source code for this paper is shared in an open source web repository http github com klabum dibrt the entire approach has been implemented in matlab due to security considerations and data agreement with the great lakes water authority owner of the data the authors are unable to share the swmm model and sensor data however an anonymized dataset has been provided in the same web repository to allow others to evaluate the general functionality of our approach 4 5 evaluation to evaluate performance two fit metrics were used r squared r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 3 r 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y i n y ˆ y 2 i 1 n y ˆ i 2 n y ˆ 2 i 1 n y i 2 n y 2 w h e r e r 2 0 1 nse 1 i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 100 w h e r e nse 1 where n is the sample size y i and y ˆ i are the measurements and predicted values respectively y and y ˆ are the mean value of y i and y ˆ i for interpretation an r2 value closer to 1 indicates a good model fit while a nse of 1 indicates perfect fit to determine if the directed information step of our approach actually improves final forecasts made by the boosted regression trees two scenarios were evaluated the first used the directed information step as described previously and the other did not instead directly feeding all available inputs to the regression tree algorithm the improvement in r2 and nse scores was calculated to determine the benefits of using directed information 5 results given the amount of data in the study four sites have been selected to illustrate and visualize the performance of the approach the predictive performance across all sites is summarized below while detailed information and additional figures are provided in the supplementary information of this paper 5 1 performance the performance of the algorithm at site a is shown in fig 3 from april 2014 to july 2014 measured flows are compared to those predicted by the numerical model swmm as well as those predicted by our algorithm while the swmm model performed relatively well at this location compared to other sites nse 0 17 and r2 0 59 it nonetheless had a positive bias tending to over predict peak flows for this location which corresponds to the largest conduit in the system inflow to the treatment plant the directed information algorithm selected 7 of the 30 features as inputs to the boosted regression trees out of these features swmm model output was selected as the major source of information followed by six rain gages table 1 there was no clear correspondence between the causal influence of gages and their proximity to the modeled site once trained on two months of data the directed information boosted regression trees algorithm predicted flows well nse 0 52 r2 0 58 the predictive ability was quite pronounced especially during rainfall events during which the boosted regression trees were able to accurately reconstruct both the magnitude and dynamics of the flows site o is one of the most downstream combined sewer overflows the frequency of the difference between modeled and predicted overflow volumes for 2013 2015 is compared for swmm and boosted regression trees fig 4 a since many storms did not result in overflow events we compare the frequency of prediction residuals difference between measurements and prediction rather than a time series comparison this site had more overflows compared to other locations even during small storm events for this location the swmm model vastly over predicted the overflow volumes by nearly an order of magnitude nse 24 1 and r2 0 39 however the boosted regression trees predictions showed much better agreement with the measurements nse 0 62 and r2 0 61 for this location the directed information algorithm selected 10 total features as inputs to the boosted regression trees algorithm interestingly even though swmm alone performed poorly its outputs were still selected as the most informative feature for the predictive model table 1 compared to swmm the algorithm reduced the overestimation bias by nearly a factor of 8 the performance of the algorithm at site i is illustrated by fig 4b which corresponds to a sewer overflow location in the system for site i the swmm model generally over predicted flows nse 2 71 and r2 0 65 and the directed information step did not select it as an influential input feature as such the boosted regression trees were trained only on six selected gages yielding an improved predictive performance nse 0 69 and r2 0 8 compared to swmm the measurements at site l fig 4c showed very few overflows across the 2013 2015 study period here neither the swmm model nse 0 07 and r2 0 0 nor the boosted regression trees nse 0 14 and r2 0 16 performed well while the directed information algorithm selected the swmm outputs as one informative feature a number of rain rages were deemed much more informative table 1 5 2 selection of informative inputs overall the boosted regression trees approach when combined with directed information feature selection was able to predict flows at 10 of the 15 sites well as measured by nse or r2 scores 0 4 the swmm model was selected as an informative input for 11 of the 15 sites fig 5 the number of inputs selected varied from site to site with no clear relationships to physical features such as distance to the input rain gages performance was mainly related to the magnitude and variability of flows at the target location the algorithm generally performed better at locations with more non zero measurements e g active flows or overflows during every storm many of the lower performing sites generally had mostly no flows or overflows during storms the variability of flows also played a role in predicative performance flow at sites with highly variable flows or overflows measured by deviation from mean was more difficult to predict the performance of the approach across all sites is summarized in table 2 as a comparison of the quality of the predictions with and without directed information overall the use of the directed information step reduced the fit during the training phase of the boosted regression trees but improved its performance during validation as quantified by an improvement in nse and r2 scores the use of the directed information step improved the predictive performance at almost all locations and improved the performance significantly increased nse or r2 by at least 0 05 for more than half of the sites 6 discussion the use of data driven prediction techniques such as boosted regression trees shows a good potential for predicting complex and nonlinear flows across large water systems as more data become available these methods will offer an automated and efficient way to rapidly ingest and adapt to new sources of information as shown here new data sources are not limited to new sensors such as rain gages rather existing numerical models can serve as valuable inputs for a given location if the underlying numerical model already captures flows accurately the boosted regression trees will still improve predictions but may not outperform the numerical model this was the case for site a fig 3 where the swmm model already had fairly strong performance in such instances boosted regression trees offer a rapid way to ingest new data sources to nudge the outputs of the numerical model to match observations more closely even when the outputs of the numerical model show strong bias or inaccuracy they may still prove useful when used as inputs to boosted regression trees approach numerical models even those that could be considered out of date still embed a lot of information and domain expertise for example a numerical model that may not be correct in regard to absolute flow values may still be correct in regard to timing of flows and their relative magnitudes this was the case for site o fig 4a where the outputs of the swmm model were heavily biased but were nonetheless selected as the most causal feature in such cases the role of boosted regression trees is analogous to correcting these biases by using additional sources of sensor data by extension if the underlying numerical model improves as the result of better model inputs or improvement of model structures or another model becomes available in the future the data driven approach should immediately benefit since it does not need to be altered to account for these changes as illustrated the use of more data does not necessarily lead to better predictions this important point appears to run counter to conventional wisdom on water data which often assumes that data driven techniques can arrive at the best answer by ingesting and optimizing around as much data as possible rather ensuring statistical causality between inputs and outputs is important the use of directed information provides a reliable and automated way to accomplish this in our case study when input features were selected using the directed information criterion the performance of the boosted regression trees improved in many cases only half or fewer of the available data sources were actually selected for use in the predictions the role of the directed information step in improving predictive performance may be best explained when interpreting the results of the training phase of the boosted regression trees table 2 the use of more input features may lead to an improved fit during the training phase since more data are available to explain the variability in the target variable ng 1998 however some of this variability may only be temporary or the inputs may not exhibit causality with the target variable as such strong fit during training may lead to worse predictive performance during the validation phase since the predictive algorithm becomes sensitive to non informative inputs as opposed to selecting all possible input features the chance of overfitting during training will thus be reduced when using only informative inputs while this will lead to a reduction of fit during the training phase it will often translate to an improvement in fit during the validation phase as seen in our study this result suggests that the concept of model complexity should be considered more broadly complexity of a model is often tied to notions of model structure as suggested by our case study when modeling water systems the amount of input data used should also be considered where more input data may lead to overfitting if not screened ahead of time as such the temptation to use all available data when training data driven water models should be accompanied with a keen appreciation of unintended overfitting the swmm model output was selected as an influential feature by the directed information algorithm in the majority of the study locations this is intuitive since the numerical model does embedded a significant amount of information regarding the connectivity and nonlinearities of the system however aside from directed information based causality no clear physiographic features explain why some rain gages were selected over others for use in the prediction fig 5 neither gage proximity to the modeled site nor connectivity via the drainage system were identified as factors that could explain why one gage may have been selected over the others the challenge in identifying informative gages without the use of a tool such as directed information may be rooted in the operational complexity of the detroit sewer collection system as one of the largest combined sewers in the world this system contains a large number of control points in the form of pumps gates and valves which are represented in the numerical model but often operated based on operators discretion as such stochastic uncertainty is embedded in measurements of flow which limits the ability to deterministically trace the inputs of any given rain input as such many observations of flow may thus often be explained by statistical relationships between the input and output data this however plays to be the strength of our approach which blends statistically physically or numerically based mappings through this case study a number of requirements become apparent when assessing the ability of our approach to work across other systems first and foremost the approach will benefit from as many input data as possible not all of course of which will be used this will improve the likelihood of finding locations that will be causal with the output since the directed information pre processing step is computationally efficient ingesting many data inputs can be conducted seamlessly once the most informative features are selected the length of the time record and variability in the output measurements will become important in general the time record is a proxy for number of available training storms while having more storm observations is always better to capture any statistical variability the size of the storms plays an important role as well a short time record a few months or less will suffice in training the algorithm if the output signal shows a proportional response to a broad range of inputs for example site a fig 3 shows a proportional response to a large number of storms which allowed the boosted regression trees to explore a broad output space the length of the time record will become important especially when predicting sewer overflows unlike continually measured sites e g site a which generally exhibit many non zero flows measurements of overflow will primarily be populated with many zero flow observations this highly nonlinear behavior challenges a data driven prediction algorithm because many rain inputs may not be large enough to cause any response for some sites large storm events may be less frequent and may thus results in few but highly variable outputs e g site l in these instances the boosted regression trees does not have enough relevant training data unless a longer time record is available for very few sites this may require years of observations which were not available in our study this data requirement does not however change the implementation of our toolchain as more data can simply be ingested as they are measured another important consideration when applying this approach relates to the temporal granularity of predictions in our study daily flow and volume measurements were available this placed a bound on the temporal resolution of the predictions this daily resolution still has utility in our case study since detroit s sewer system is one of the largest in the world the system dynamics play out over relatively long time scales as can be seen in fig 3 storms often lead to flow responses or overflows that can last multiple days which means that daily forecasts have utility in treatment planning collection system dewatering and overflow operations higher order dynamics are obscured or averaged at such resolutions which may be important for some smaller sewer system or other applications if higher resolution forecasts are desired our approach would require higher resolution flow data while an additional analysis would be required to assess performance across these time scales the toolchain could be applied to these data without requiring modifications this is particularly true about the directed information step of the approach which can still be used to determine which input output relationships are casual depending on the dynamics in higher resolution measurements the boosted regression trees could be replaced with more dynamically based predictive approaches this presents good opportunities for future studies which will be carried out across smaller and more rapidly changing systems overall the approach presented in this study stands to provide a number of benefits to decision makers and modelers from an operational perspective the toolchain provides an automated method by which cities and municipalities can leverage all their existing and emerging data sources to improve forecasts of flows this will be particularly useful in operational situations where an existing numerical model may not provide sufficiently fine grained warnings of floods or impending overflows however the resulting predictive model should not be used for infrastructure planning purposes changing pipe diameters evaluating new designs etc since all relationships are statistical and inherent to the data of the existing system for these purposes the numerical model will rather need to be updated and recalibrated to this end our approach can also serve as a tool to guide model calibration the use of directed information can serve as an alternative to traditional metrics such as nse or r2 providing insight not only on fit but rather the causality between the model structure and observation the directed information criterion could then be used to help determine which inputs may be most important to the numerical model which may reduce amount of inputs and time spent on calibration finally the usefulness of any particular data source must be viewed holistically a non causal relationship may suggest that an input data source is not relevant or of sufficient quality to explain a particular output however utility and causality are two way properties namely a flow measurement the output may not be informative to begin with if this is the case the inputs may still be useful for forecasting at other locations a level of user discretion should thus be exercised when evaluating input and output pairings the directed information step will help in this regard as it will provide a first check to determine if certain input output pairings should even be considered before a predictive model is constructed ultimately the quality of the final prediction which can be evaluated using more classic fit metrics or specific requirements of an application will remain a good proxy for utility of any particular forecast and thus implicitly the utility of the underlying data while not conducted in this case study due to the temporal granularity of data and the assumption that swmm model captures upstream dynamics future studies could also consider the value of flow measurements as predictors for other flow measurements 7 conclusions this paper introduced a holistic data driven toolchain based on directed information and boosted regression trees to provide flow forecasts across urban drainage systems more broadly this methodology should also work well for other types of water systems where many data or numerical models are available it was demonstrated that the use of more data is not always advantageous and may often lead to worse predictions rather a computationally efficient pre processing step directed information will be important in selecting only those input data that are informative to the overall prediction the approach based on boosted regression trees was also shown to be effective at learning complex and non linear mappings between rainfall inputs and flow more importantly it was demonstrated that the outputs of a numerical model could also be used as an important input to the data driven approach even if a numerical model is no longer fully calibrated due to aging or changes in the system it still embeds valuable information that can improve the predictive performance of the regression trees this will provide a rapid and automated way for city managers to use a diverse set of information which may be at their disposal without requiring the often expensive recalibration of numerical models naturally if a numerical model does improve so will the predictions of our approach this discovery will be important as the push for smart water systems and big water data continues future work should be carried out to determine how consistent our findings are across other study areas and other types of

19338,as more sensor data become available across urban water systems it is often unclear which of these new measurements are actually useful and how they can be efficiently ingested to improve predictions we present a data driven approach for modeling and predicting flows across combined sewer and drainage systems which fuses sensor measurements with output of a large numerical simulation model rather than adjusting the structure and parameters of the numerical model as is commonly done when new data become available our approach instead learns causal relationships between the numerically modeled outputs distributed rainfall measurements and measured flows by treating an existing numerical model even one that may be outdated as just another data stream we illustrate how to automatically select and combine features that best explain flows for any given location this allows for new sensor measurements to be rapidly fused with existing knowledge of the system without requiring recalibration of the underlying physics our approach based on directed information di and boosted regression trees brt is evaluated by fusing measurements across nearly 30 rain gages 15 flow locations and the outputs of a numerical sewer model in the city of detroit michigan one of the largest combined sewer systems in the world the results illustrate that the boosted regression trees provide skillful predictions of flow especially when compared to an existing numerical model the innovation of this paper is the use of the directed information step which selects only those inputs that are causal with measurements at locations of interest better predictions are achieved when the directed information step is used because it reduces overfitting during the training phase of the predictive algorithm in the age of big water data this finding highlights the importance of screening all available data sources before using them as inputs to data driven models since more may not always be better we discuss the generalizability of the case study and the requirements of transferring the approach to other systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords flow prediction causality

dimensionality where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of calibrating parameters sun and sun 2015 given this complexity and resulting financial cost of recalibration most water models hardly keep pace with urban change or the emergence of new data sources in fact it is not uncommon for many numerical water models in the united states to be over a decade as such more streamlined approaches are needed to keep pace with the emergence of new data sources and to ensure forecasts are made using the most relevant and up to date information 2 2 data driven forecasting in lieu of statistical models a number of data driven approaches are showing promise to model water systems instead of explicitly modeling physics these approaches rely only on data such as sensor measurements or features of a system to make forecasts while data driven models cannot always provide insight into system behavior they can enable streamlined and adaptive toolchains to rapidly ingest many data sources broadly many of these approaches fall under the umbrella of supervised machine learning ml approaches which use historical data to learn complex mappings between inputs and a target variable when modeling flows across urban water systems traditional ml approaches such as generalized linear regression may not work well due to the nonlinearities and collinearities inherent in complex systems dormann et al 2013 nonlinear mappings can be learned through methods such as artificial neural networks ann but these often require a large amount of data and are computationally expensive schalkoff 1997 for many applications a supervised ml approach known as boosted regression trees has recently shown promise in balancing computational intensity with performance according to caruana and niculescu mizil 2006 boosted regression trees have shown the best overall predictive performance among supervised learning algorithms while remaining immune to collinearity regardless of the choice of algorithm it is well known that many data driven approaches may be sensitive to overfitting due to inadequate input data selection especially if irrelevant inputs are used during training ng 1998 as such the prospects associated with access to many new sensor measurements may be hampered by the realization that more is not always better that is not all data may be useful and brute force use of all available data may actually lead to worse forecasts 3 methods instead of forcing the choice between a numerical or data driven approach as is commonly done our method seeks to strike a balance by combining the benefits of both the toolchain uses boosted regression trees to make forecasts by ingesting a large number of input features fig 1 however instead of using sensor data as the only input we also treat an existing numerical model as another input data source the idea being that even an out of date or poorly calibrated numerical model may still embed a significant amount of information which may not be captured by sensor data alone depending on the location of interest various combinations of input features may provide the best forecast as such an innovation in our approach is a preliminary step which uses the criterion of directed information to determine which inputs may lead to the best prediction this forms a holistic and automated toolchain which ingests all available data but reduces the risk of overfitting by selecting the most useful data for forecasting 3 1 feature selection using directed information given a set of random processes x x 1 x 2 x m and a target random process y we seek to predict the process y using the processes in x in our case y represents a time series of flow measurements at the location for which we would like to generate future predictions namely the target variable the processes x include time series that could be used to derive a predictive model for y such as rainfall measurements as well as the outputs of a numerical model in many cases it may not be advantageous to use all processes from x as inputs to a predictive model because this may lead to a model that performs well in the training phase but one that performs poorly in prediction i e overfitting instead the goal is to select a subset of processes that are useful in describing y statistically this can be captured using granger causality granger 1969 if predictions of y are improved by using a process x i x we say x i statistically causes y more formally x i causes y as measured by granger causality if the past of x i can help predict the future of y the metric of causality known as directed information di is an information theoretic quantity that measures the statistical causation given a set of random processes x x 1 x 2 x m and y the directed information i from x 1 to y is defined as the time averaged expected log likelihood ratio between two conditional probability distributions of y at time step t y t equation 1 this ratio is also known as kullback leibler divergence kullback and leibler 1951 for the conditional probability in the numerator y t is conditioned on the past of x 1 x 1 1 t 1 marko 1973 kramer 1998 1 i x 1 y x 2 x m 1 n t 1 n e p y x 1 x 2 x m log p y t x 1 1 t 1 x 2 1 t 1 x m 1 t 1 p y t x 2 1 t 1 x m 1 t 1 where x i t 1 t 2 denotes the process x i from time step t1 to t2 if the past of x 1 can help predict the future of y then the conditional probability with x 1 1 t 1 p y t x 1 1 t 1 x 2 1 t 1 x m 1 t 1 is larger than the conditional probability without x 1 1 t 1 and the expected log likelihood of their ratio will be positive otherwise if the past of x 1 cannot help predict the future of y then the two conditional probabilities are equal in which case the expected log likelihood of their ratio is zero in other words the future value of y is conditionally independent from the past value of x 1 x 1 1 t 1 given the past value of the rest processes in x x 2 1 t 1 x m 1 t 1 for random processes y and x 1 the larger the directed information value the more causal influence x 1 has on y and hence the more useful x 1 is on predicting y to reduce potential overfitting we use a model complexity penalty known as minimum description length mdl grünwald 2007 2 m d l h l o g 2 n 2 n where h denotes the markov order and n denotes the sample size of x i used for model fitting the use of this penalty term ensures that only the random processes with directed information values larger than the mdl are considered as causal this is summarized in algorithm 1 which seeks to store all these causal processes in a new subset g which will be subsequently used as input to a prediction algorithm modified from quinn et al 2015 when selecting candidate features for the directed information test non deterministic relationships among all features need to be guaranteed that is no feature can be derived directly from the others image 2 3 2 prediction using boosted regression trees once the causal features are selected using the directed information di approach they can be used to train a predictive model which in our case takes the form of boosted regression trees brt instead of learning one regression tree boosted regression trees learn multiple trees and weigh them to describe the relationship between the target variable and the features boosted regression trees rely on boosting methods that create an ensemble of regression models to improve the accuracy of model fitting elith et al 2008 given a regression problem boosted regression trees assign individual weights to every sample point of the training data set a single regression tree is then constructed and evaluated using the data a loss function wald 1950 which describes the deviance between the measurements and predicted values is used to update the individual weights on the tree the data points with larger deviance are assigned larger weights in the next step after the updated weights are assigned to individual data points a new regression tree is constructed the procedure repeats until the number of the iterations m is reached algorithm 2 through a forward and additive fashion boosted regression trees gradually optimize predictive performance by using linear combination of all individual trees like many supervised ml approaches boosted regression trees can still be subject to overfitting if too many features are used to this end the directed information is used to select only causal features thereby reducing the potential for overfitting in the final boosted regression trees image 3 4 case study and implementation 4 1 study area our case study concerns the prediction of flows in large combined sewer systems specifically we focus on the city of detroit michigan one of the largest combined sewer collection systems in the united states fig 2 we seek to predict daily flows at locations of interest using a large number of available data sources detroit and its surrounding suburbs are the largest urban source of total phosphorus to the river system connecting lakes huron and erie maccoux et al 2016 and because phosphorus load from this system is driven primarily by flow predicting and controlling the occurrence of combined sewer overflows is important while dozens of new measurements e g rain gages have become available across the city they have not yet been used in a predictive model a physically based numerical model is available but was updated over 6 years ago as such this case study presents a great opportunity to apply our approach to fusing new sensor data with the expertise embedded in the existing numerical model 4 2 data source numerical model in 1998 a physically based hydrological and hydraulic model was developed using the epa storm water management model swmm for the detroit sewer collection system s 1963 2 km2 service area tenbroek et al 1999 fig 2 the first version of the model was initially calibrated with available flow data santini et al 2001 since then it has been updated several times to reflect new facilities including 14 major combined sewer overflow outfalls sites b through o in fig 2 the latest version of the model was released in 2012 which is the model that has been shared with the authors initial inspection revealed that while the model did represent some of the larger downstream flows adequately e g flows at the final outlet of the system it generally overestimated daily flows across smaller upstream locations 4 3 data source sensor measurements hourly flow measurements were made by sensors at the terminal node of the system fig 2 site a from april 2014 to july 2014 representing the inflows into the wastewater treatment plant event based combined sewer overflow volume measurements from may 2013 to october 2015 were also obtained from the michigan department of environmental quality 1 1 michigan department of environmental quality mdeq http www michigan gov deq for 38 storm events during this period most combined sewer overflow events occurred within one day however when an event spanned multiple days a daily average was obtained by dividing the total discharge by the number of days of the event hourly precipitation data from 2013 to 2015 which served as input into the numerical model were also obtained from 30 distributed rain gages in the service area fig 2 4 4 implementation the objective of the evaluation was to predict daily inflows to the wastewater treatment plant and sewer overflows at 15 sites for the purpose of this study predicting inflows to the treatment plant tests the ability of the approach to describe large scale continuous flows while predicting combined sewer overflows captures the ability to predict smaller scale more dynamic events data from all rain gages were used as inputs to the swmm model after which swmm outputs were used as input into the directed information test the rainfall data were manually quality controlled by gap filling measurements or saturation points through interpolation with neighboring gages this was intended to ensure that the highest possible quality inputs were used as inputs to the swmm for each site the directed information test was first used to select causal input features from available rain gages and co located swmm outputs while feasible upstream flow measurements were not used as inputs to downstream predictions since it was assumed that upstream dynamics are implicitly captured by swmm to meet the non determinism criterion of the directed information test one of the gages site 2 was randomly removed from the data set before the directed information algorithm was executed once causal features were selected they were forwarded to the boosted regression trees algorithm 60 40 split for training and validation through iteration the number of trees was set to 500 while the tree depth was set equal to 4 and the learning rate equal to 0 1 to promote transparency experimental repeatability and broader adoption all of the source code for this paper is shared in an open source web repository http github com klabum dibrt the entire approach has been implemented in matlab due to security considerations and data agreement with the great lakes water authority owner of the data the authors are unable to share the swmm model and sensor data however an anonymized dataset has been provided in the same web repository to allow others to evaluate the general functionality of our approach 4 5 evaluation to evaluate performance two fit metrics were used r squared r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 3 r 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y i n y ˆ y 2 i 1 n y ˆ i 2 n y ˆ 2 i 1 n y i 2 n y 2 w h e r e r 2 0 1 nse 1 i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 100 w h e r e nse 1 where n is the sample size y i and y ˆ i are the measurements and predicted values respectively y and y ˆ are the mean value of y i and y ˆ i for interpretation an r2 value closer to 1 indicates a good model fit while a nse of 1 indicates perfect fit to determine if the directed information step of our approach actually improves final forecasts made by the boosted regression trees two scenarios were evaluated the first used the directed information step as described previously and the other did not instead directly feeding all available inputs to the regression tree algorithm the improvement in r2 and nse scores was calculated to determine the benefits of using directed information 5 results given the amount of data in the study four sites have been selected to illustrate and visualize the performance of the approach the predictive performance across all sites is summarized below while detailed information and additional figures are provided in the supplementary information of this paper 5 1 performance the performance of the algorithm at site a is shown in fig 3 from april 2014 to july 2014 measured flows are compared to those predicted by the numerical model swmm as well as those predicted by our algorithm while the swmm model performed relatively well at this location compared to other sites nse 0 17 and r2 0 59 it nonetheless had a positive bias tending to over predict peak flows for this location which corresponds to the largest conduit in the system inflow to the treatment plant the directed information algorithm selected 7 of the 30 features as inputs to the boosted regression trees out of these features swmm model output was selected as the major source of information followed by six rain gages table 1 there was no clear correspondence between the causal influence of gages and their proximity to the modeled site once trained on two months of data the directed information boosted regression trees algorithm predicted flows well nse 0 52 r2 0 58 the predictive ability was quite pronounced especially during rainfall events during which the boosted regression trees were able to accurately reconstruct both the magnitude and dynamics of the flows site o is one of the most downstream combined sewer overflows the frequency of the difference between modeled and predicted overflow volumes for 2013 2015 is compared for swmm and boosted regression trees fig 4 a since many storms did not result in overflow events we compare the frequency of prediction residuals difference between measurements and prediction rather than a time series comparison this site had more overflows compared to other locations even during small storm events for this location the swmm model vastly over predicted the overflow volumes by nearly an order of magnitude nse 24 1 and r2 0 39 however the boosted regression trees predictions showed much better agreement with the measurements nse 0 62 and r2 0 61 for this location the directed information algorithm selected 10 total features as inputs to the boosted regression trees algorithm interestingly even though swmm alone performed poorly its outputs were still selected as the most informative feature for the predictive model table 1 compared to swmm the algorithm reduced the overestimation bias by nearly a factor of 8 the performance of the algorithm at site i is illustrated by fig 4b which corresponds to a sewer overflow location in the system for site i the swmm model generally over predicted flows nse 2 71 and r2 0 65 and the directed information step did not select it as an influential input feature as such the boosted regression trees were trained only on six selected gages yielding an improved predictive performance nse 0 69 and r2 0 8 compared to swmm the measurements at site l fig 4c showed very few overflows across the 2013 2015 study period here neither the swmm model nse 0 07 and r2 0 0 nor the boosted regression trees nse 0 14 and r2 0 16 performed well while the directed information algorithm selected the swmm outputs as one informative feature a number of rain rages were deemed much more informative table 1 5 2 selection of informative inputs overall the boosted regression trees approach when combined with directed information feature selection was able to predict flows at 10 of the 15 sites well as measured by nse or r2 scores 0 4 the swmm model was selected as an informative input for 11 of the 15 sites fig 5 the number of inputs selected varied from site to site with no clear relationships to physical features such as distance to the input rain gages performance was mainly related to the magnitude and variability of flows at the target location the algorithm generally performed better at locations with more non zero measurements e g active flows or overflows during every storm many of the lower performing sites generally had mostly no flows or overflows during storms the variability of flows also played a role in predicative performance flow at sites with highly variable flows or overflows measured by deviation from mean was more difficult to predict the performance of the approach across all sites is summarized in table 2 as a comparison of the quality of the predictions with and without directed information overall the use of the directed information step reduced the fit during the training phase of the boosted regression trees but improved its performance during validation as quantified by an improvement in nse and r2 scores the use of the directed information step improved the predictive performance at almost all locations and improved the performance significantly increased nse or r2 by at least 0 05 for more than half of the sites 6 discussion the use of data driven prediction techniques such as boosted regression trees shows a good potential for predicting complex and nonlinear flows across large water systems as more data become available these methods will offer an automated and efficient way to rapidly ingest and adapt to new sources of information as shown here new data sources are not limited to new sensors such as rain gages rather existing numerical models can serve as valuable inputs for a given location if the underlying numerical model already captures flows accurately the boosted regression trees will still improve predictions but may not outperform the numerical model this was the case for site a fig 3 where the swmm model already had fairly strong performance in such instances boosted regression trees offer a rapid way to ingest new data sources to nudge the outputs of the numerical model to match observations more closely even when the outputs of the numerical model show strong bias or inaccuracy they may still prove useful when used as inputs to boosted regression trees approach numerical models even those that could be considered out of date still embed a lot of information and domain expertise for example a numerical model that may not be correct in regard to absolute flow values may still be correct in regard to timing of flows and their relative magnitudes this was the case for site o fig 4a where the outputs of the swmm model were heavily biased but were nonetheless selected as the most causal feature in such cases the role of boosted regression trees is analogous to correcting these biases by using additional sources of sensor data by extension if the underlying numerical model improves as the result of better model inputs or improvement of model structures or another model becomes available in the future the data driven approach should immediately benefit since it does not need to be altered to account for these changes as illustrated the use of more data does not necessarily lead to better predictions this important point appears to run counter to conventional wisdom on water data which often assumes that data driven techniques can arrive at the best answer by ingesting and optimizing around as much data as possible rather ensuring statistical causality between inputs and outputs is important the use of directed information provides a reliable and automated way to accomplish this in our case study when input features were selected using the directed information criterion the performance of the boosted regression trees improved in many cases only half or fewer of the available data sources were actually selected for use in the predictions the role of the directed information step in improving predictive performance may be best explained when interpreting the results of the training phase of the boosted regression trees table 2 the use of more input features may lead to an improved fit during the training phase since more data are available to explain the variability in the target variable ng 1998 however some of this variability may only be temporary or the inputs may not exhibit causality with the target variable as such strong fit during training may lead to worse predictive performance during the validation phase since the predictive algorithm becomes sensitive to non informative inputs as opposed to selecting all possible input features the chance of overfitting during training will thus be reduced when using only informative inputs while this will lead to a reduction of fit during the training phase it will often translate to an improvement in fit during the validation phase as seen in our study this result suggests that the concept of model complexity should be considered more broadly complexity of a model is often tied to notions of model structure as suggested by our case study when modeling water systems the amount of input data used should also be considered where more input data may lead to overfitting if not screened ahead of time as such the temptation to use all available data when training data driven water models should be accompanied with a keen appreciation of unintended overfitting the swmm model output was selected as an influential feature by the directed information algorithm in the majority of the study locations this is intuitive since the numerical model does embedded a significant amount of information regarding the connectivity and nonlinearities of the system however aside from directed information based causality no clear physiographic features explain why some rain gages were selected over others for use in the prediction fig 5 neither gage proximity to the modeled site nor connectivity via the drainage system were identified as factors that could explain why one gage may have been selected over the others the challenge in identifying informative gages without the use of a tool such as directed information may be rooted in the operational complexity of the detroit sewer collection system as one of the largest combined sewers in the world this system contains a large number of control points in the form of pumps gates and valves which are represented in the numerical model but often operated based on operators discretion as such stochastic uncertainty is embedded in measurements of flow which limits the ability to deterministically trace the inputs of any given rain input as such many observations of flow may thus often be explained by statistical relationships between the input and output data this however plays to be the strength of our approach which blends statistically physically or numerically based mappings through this case study a number of requirements become apparent when assessing the ability of our approach to work across other systems first and foremost the approach will benefit from as many input data as possible not all of course of which will be used this will improve the likelihood of finding locations that will be causal with the output since the directed information pre processing step is computationally efficient ingesting many data inputs can be conducted seamlessly once the most informative features are selected the length of the time record and variability in the output measurements will become important in general the time record is a proxy for number of available training storms while having more storm observations is always better to capture any statistical variability the size of the storms plays an important role as well a short time record a few months or less will suffice in training the algorithm if the output signal shows a proportional response to a broad range of inputs for example site a fig 3 shows a proportional response to a large number of storms which allowed the boosted regression trees to explore a broad output space the length of the time record will become important especially when predicting sewer overflows unlike continually measured sites e g site a which generally exhibit many non zero flows measurements of overflow will primarily be populated with many zero flow observations this highly nonlinear behavior challenges a data driven prediction algorithm because many rain inputs may not be large enough to cause any response for some sites large storm events may be less frequent and may thus results in few but highly variable outputs e g site l in these instances the boosted regression trees does not have enough relevant training data unless a longer time record is available for very few sites this may require years of observations which were not available in our study this data requirement does not however change the implementation of our toolchain as more data can simply be ingested as they are measured another important consideration when applying this approach relates to the temporal granularity of predictions in our study daily flow and volume measurements were available this placed a bound on the temporal resolution of the predictions this daily resolution still has utility in our case study since detroit s sewer system is one of the largest in the world the system dynamics play out over relatively long time scales as can be seen in fig 3 storms often lead to flow responses or overflows that can last multiple days which means that daily forecasts have utility in treatment planning collection system dewatering and overflow operations higher order dynamics are obscured or averaged at such resolutions which may be important for some smaller sewer system or other applications if higher resolution forecasts are desired our approach would require higher resolution flow data while an additional analysis would be required to assess performance across these time scales the toolchain could be applied to these data without requiring modifications this is particularly true about the directed information step of the approach which can still be used to determine which input output relationships are casual depending on the dynamics in higher resolution measurements the boosted regression trees could be replaced with more dynamically based predictive approaches this presents good opportunities for future studies which will be carried out across smaller and more rapidly changing systems overall the approach presented in this study stands to provide a number of benefits to decision makers and modelers from an operational perspective the toolchain provides an automated method by which cities and municipalities can leverage all their existing and emerging data sources to improve forecasts of flows this will be particularly useful in operational situations where an existing numerical model may not provide sufficiently fine grained warnings of floods or impending overflows however the resulting predictive model should not be used for infrastructure planning purposes changing pipe diameters evaluating new designs etc since all relationships are statistical and inherent to the data of the existing system for these purposes the numerical model will rather need to be updated and recalibrated to this end our approach can also serve as a tool to guide model calibration the use of directed information can serve as an alternative to traditional metrics such as nse or r2 providing insight not only on fit but rather the causality between the model structure and observation the directed information criterion could then be used to help determine which inputs may be most important to the numerical model which may reduce amount of inputs and time spent on calibration finally the usefulness of any particular data source must be viewed holistically a non causal relationship may suggest that an input data source is not relevant or of sufficient quality to explain a particular output however utility and causality are two way properties namely a flow measurement the output may not be informative to begin with if this is the case the inputs may still be useful for forecasting at other locations a level of user discretion should thus be exercised when evaluating input and output pairings the directed information step will help in this regard as it will provide a first check to determine if certain input output pairings should even be considered before a predictive model is constructed ultimately the quality of the final prediction which can be evaluated using more classic fit metrics or specific requirements of an application will remain a good proxy for utility of any particular forecast and thus implicitly the utility of the underlying data while not conducted in this case study due to the temporal granularity of data and the assumption that swmm model captures upstream dynamics future studies could also consider the value of flow measurements as predictors for other flow measurements 7 conclusions this paper introduced a holistic data driven toolchain based on directed information and boosted regression trees to provide flow forecasts across urban drainage systems more broadly this methodology should also work well for other types of water systems where many data or numerical models are available it was demonstrated that the use of more data is not always advantageous and may often lead to worse predictions rather a computationally efficient pre processing step directed information will be important in selecting only those input data that are informative to the overall prediction the approach based on boosted regression trees was also shown to be effective at learning complex and non linear mappings between rainfall inputs and flow more importantly it was demonstrated that the outputs of a numerical model could also be used as an important input to the data driven approach even if a numerical model is no longer fully calibrated due to aging or changes in the system it still embeds valuable information that can improve the predictive performance of the regression trees this will provide a rapid and automated way for city managers to use a diverse set of information which may be at their disposal without requiring the often expensive recalibration of numerical models naturally if a numerical model does improve so will the predictions of our approach this discovery will be important as the push for smart water systems and big water data continues future work should be carried out to determine how consistent our findings are across other study areas and other types of

19339,the contamination of freshwater systems arises in many river basins due to industrialization and population growth posing risks to ecosystems and human health despite these concerns the fate and potential impact of many emerging pollutants are currently unknown especially when the compounds are released into surface waters from populations distributed across large spatial scales in order to address this shortcoming a spatially explicit contaminant fate model was developed as an extension of the global vector based river routing model hydrorout hydrorout operates at very high spatial resolution 500 m simulates river and stream chemical transport with in stream removal and contains links to a set of lakes and reservoirs which act as a partial sink during the transport the chemical fate model was applied to china and includes a consumption and release module based on county level population demographics considers point source contributions from 2547 wastewater treatment plants and accumulates contributions of rural and urban populations not connected to sewage treatment plants as a case study the sources and fates of the estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 as well as the synthetic estrogenic steroid hormone 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 were modelled in chinese surface water bodies preliminary validation of the results showed predictions to be within the ranges of concentrations reported in literature with exception of ee2 the total estrogenic mass in the entire river and lake system amounted to 370 tonnes of estrogens with about 1 3 tonnes per year discharged to the ocean neighboring countries or to inland sinks under a selected baseline scenario eco toxicological risk i e contaminant concentrations in excess of the predicted no effect

environmental quality in china is deteriorating due to increasing urbanization population growth and industrial agricultural and economic intensification liu et al 2013 sepa 2013 varis et al 2014 wang et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 extensive contamination of chinese freshwaters due to releases from municipal and industrial treatment plants of untreated wastewater sewage and from runoff from agricultural production manufacturing operations and animal husbandry operations has been reported shao et al 2006 in addition the release of such emerging contaminants as pharmaceutically active compounds personal care products nanomaterials and natural hormones has gained increased attention khan et al 2017 khan and nicell 2010 2015 richardson et al 2005 zhang et al 2014b the extent to which these and other emerging contaminants contribute to overall freshwater degradation at large spatial scales i e entire countries often remains unclear because the identification of these compounds in the environment is hindered by the need to develop reliable analytical methods with sufficiently low detection limits and by the high costs associated with the field implementation of extensive monitoring campaigns as an alternative to conducting such measurements the modelling of the sources fate and risks of chemical contaminants has become a commonly used strategy to provide reasonable results at low cost for a variety of chemicals cowan ellsberry et al 2009 franco et al 2017 johnson et al 2008 spatially distributed contaminant fate models such as great er kehrein et al 2015 istreem ferrer and deleo 2017 lf2000 wqx williams et al 2012 phate anderson et al 2004 mappe pistocchi et al 2012 gwava johnson et al 2013 and hydrorout grill et al 2016 have been widely used to understand the impact of various chemical contaminants on european and north american waterways cunningham et al 2012 gimeno et al 2017 grill et al 2016 hannah et al 2009 johnson et al 2013 ort et al 2009 such models often share common assumptions and similar key modelling mechanisms keller et al 2006 pistocchi 2014 including a reasonable per capita mass emissions of a chemical contaminant of interest into individual wastewater treatment plants wwtps are calculated using the average per capita consumption use of the compound b if relevant adjustments for losses due to human metabolism and removal in wastewater treatment plants are made c dilution through advection after discharge into natural waters are modelled using stream length velocity volumetric discharge and a decay constant for the chemical d predicted environmental concentrations pecs are subsequently calculated based on the accumulated load and the river discharge at the river reach scale however these types of models have not been extensively applied in less data rich countries china poses a significant challenge to large scale contaminant fate models because of a large rural population not connected to wwtps the country s large variability of hydrological regimes and the lack of publicly available datasets regarding the geo spatial location of wwtps several studies have been conducted in an attempt to assess the risks associated with chemicals in china using non spatial screening techniques see review in wang et al 2012 others have used spatially limited models that either focussed on individual watersheds or assessed risk in primarily large rivers 1000 m3 s using a coarse scale 0 5 0 5 raster based hydrological and routing model liu et al 2015a whelan et al 2011 zhang et al 2014b the levels of risk arising from these spatially limited or coarse models may have been underestimated mostly due to two main challenges first the distribution of risk in smaller to mid sized headwater streams has not been well captured in previous models for china in these cases the dilution factors may have been too large resulting in low overall risk for smaller streams the risk contributed by communities not connected to wwtps is likely to be high in china where a significant proportion is not connected to any sewage treatment facility especially in rural areas approximately 26 of the population in large cities and 46 in small and medium cities lack wastewater treatment and the coverage in rural areas is practically non existent mohurd 2012 in addition the removal efficiency for emerging contaminants such as estrogens via secondary sewage treatment is generally high caldwell et al 2012 this may create a situation where even a relatively small population that is not connected to wastewater treatment facilities may produce significant risk which makes the assessment of the small scale contributions of local residents even more important second releases from wwtps may be unaccounted for or attributed imprecisely to the wrong river system giving rise to underestimation and inaccuracies in smaller to medium sized rivers to our knowledge there is currently no risk assessment model at the scale of entire mainland china that explicitly geolocates wwtps to their discharge points at individual river reaches to account for more localized impacts to address these challenges a realistic estimation of risk for small and medium rivers should account for sources and pathways of contaminants at high spatial resolution should take into account the locations capacity and discharge volumes of wwtps should include reasonable estimates of hydrological flow and should account for populations not connected to wastewater treatment facilities therefore the first goal of this study is to develop a high resolution spatially explicit contaminant fate model for china which considers local estimates of stream flow at the river reach scale and takes into account point sources of wwtps as well as sources of populations not connected to wwtps the second goal of this study is to apply the contaminant fate model to study the spatial distribution and magnitude of estrogen emission sources predict their fate in the environment and determine the environmental risk of these compounds in chinese surface water bodies to test whether the resulting model predictions for the case study of china are reasonable the environmental exposure and risk of the following four estrogens were calculated estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 as well as the synthetic estrogenic steroid hormone 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 in addition to being endogenously produced the first three can also result from the use of hormone replacement therapeutics in contrast ee2 is not naturally produced by humans and therefore is expected to be largely released to the environment due to its clinical use in medications such as birth control pills khan and nicell 2014 all estrogens except e1 are removed in secondary treatment plants at average rates that are in excess of 80 caldwell et al 2010 liu et al 2015a 2015b once released into the environment ee2 has been shown to be considerably more persistent than e1 e2 and e3 caldwell et al 2010 estrogens were selected for evaluation because every person releases natural estrogens in their excreta which allows for the evaluation of the relative significance of spatially distributed diffuse sources from residents not connected to wwtps versus localized point sources from populations connected to wwtps furthermore estrogens by their inherent nature are potent endocrine disruptors and are known to act in an additive way caldwell et al 2012 and thus may pose risk to aquatic life and humans even at low concentrations for example the feminization of fish leading to the collapse of a fish population caused by ee2 has been reported at concentrations as low as a few nanograms per liter kidd et al 2007 concentrations in excess of predicted no effect concentrations pnecs have been reported at several sites in rivers and lakes across china chang et al 2009 2011 jiang et al 2012 zhao et al 2009 jiang et al 2012 found alarmingly high levels of source water contamination in chinese rivers lakes and reservoirs yet the assessment of risk of estrogens in rivers and lakes based on contaminant fate models has mostly focused on north america and europe anderson et al 2012 caldwell et al 2010 writer et al 2010 while only limited such research has been conducted in china zhang et al 2014b due to substantial uncertainty regarding the sources and fate of contaminants in the environment several scenarios are used to explore the model s sensitivity with respect to key parameters overall this study presents the first comprehensive high resolution multi contaminant fate model for continental china and sets the stage for the application of the model to other areas of the world 2 methodology 2 1 general outline based on county and city level administrative units the per capita contributions of residents based on the demographics of each administrative unit were calculated by separating sources into urban and rural contaminant pathways either via wwtps or directly into the environment were then assessed fig 1 using a high resolution river hydrography and routing model the cumulative contaminant loads downstream in the river systems were calculated while accounting for contaminant decay transformation and removal in lakes the four assessed estrogens were then weighted by their relative potency and total concentrations in surface waters were calculated based on low flow discharge estimates generated from long term model simulations resulting pecs were compared to the pnec to evaluate risk the model was run for 15 scenarios each with varying settings of parameters that reflect contaminant removal in wwtps direct discharge coefficients ddc of untreated wastewater river decay and lake removal a brief description of the methodology used is presented in the sections below with further details provided in the supplementary information si 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 river network the baseline hydrographic data used in this study is provided by the hydrosheds database lehner et al 2008 a publicly available global suite of data layers representing river network topology and watershed boundaries fig 2 hydrosheds defines river flow directions at 500 m pixel resolution which are then used to create a vectorized network of river reaches for transport simulation of water and substances in a routing model called hydrorout this model has been previously applied to estimate risk for a variety of down the drain pharmaceuticals in north america grill et al 2016 lehner and grill 2013 at the 500 m resolution there are 622 150 river reaches with an average length of 4 24 km within the study area of mainland china each river reach has a contributing catchment which was used to aggregate fine scale spatial information a set of 22 952 lakes and their estimated storage volumes messager et al 2016 were integrated into hydrorout out of which 6177 are identified as reservoirs lehner et al 2011 2 2 2 discharge data hydrorout utilizes decoupled external discharge estimates as provided by the global integrated water balance model watergap döll et al 2003 version 2 2 as of 2014 for this study the time series of watergap s monthly discharge estimates for the period 1971 2000 was first aggregated to derive the long term annual average discharge as well as the annual flow regime i e the average discharge of each of the twelve calendar months these discharge values were then downscaled from the original 0 5 degree grid resolution of watergap to the 500 m pixel resolution of hydrorout by employing geospatial disaggregation and re accumulation procedures lehner and grill 2013 fig 2 for low flow assessments the lowest month of the annual flow regime was used to substitute for more traditional low flow indicators such as daily q90 flows smakhtin 2001 a preliminary validation of the resulting hydrorout discharge estimates against observations of 3003 global gauging stations grdc 2014 representing river sizes from 0 004 to 180 000 m3 s confirmed good overall correlations r2 0 99 with 0 2 positive bias for the annual average r2 0 97 with 12 positive bias for the lowest month of the flow regime the discharge estimates showed a symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape armstrong 1985 of 35 for the annual average improving to 13 for rivers 100 m3 s and 71 for the lowest month of the flow regime improving to 53 for rivers 100 m3 s these statistics indicate that errors in the discharge estimates of hydrorout are generally within reasonable boundaries and well below order of magnitude ranges even for low flows in small rivers 2 2 3 wastewater treatment plants the locations and characteristics of 2739 wwtps for china were obtained in tabular form mep 2011 corresponding to august 2010 a total of 192 wwtps with flow rates less than 1000 m3 d were excluded due to difficulties in determining the population served for these small plants resulting in 2547 wwtps considered in this study fig 3 the total designed treatment capacity of all wwtps was 125 0 million m3 d with a total average treatment capacity of 96 1 million m3 d nearly all wwtps considered used secondary treatment technologies i e biological treatment only two were considered primary treatment plants the population served by each wwtp was assigned based on data of the beijing municipal research institute of environmental protection the specific longitudes and latitudes of the wwtps were determined by using geolocation techniques which translate addresses into geographic coordinates each data point was manually verified for each individual plant and corrected using satellite imagery finally the locations were co registered to the river network of hydrorout 2 2 4 administrative units aus estimates of estrogen contributions were calculated at the county administrative level large cities such as beijing are composed of several smaller counties and these were grouped into homogenous city units to avoid inconsistencies in calculating treatment coverage due to the typical peripheral location of wwtps in these large conglomerates population demographics of a total of 2345 aus were determined based on the latest china population census conducted in 2010 china population census office 2012 see fig 4 2 3 per capita estrogen release per capita releases of the four estrogens i e e1 e2 e3 and ee2 were calculated from natural and synthetic sources for each au based on the demographic characteristics and consumption data of relevant formulations residents of each au were grouped based on gender and age group and per capita contributions of natural estrogen releases were calculated using average excretion rates khan and nicell 2014 synthetic estrogen contributions from contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy hrt were calculated using total national consumption cmsn 2012 and adjusted for elimination and metabolic conversion to other forms of estrogen khan and nicell 2014 the total consumption was distributed spatially based on relative consumption rates reported for each province cmsn 2012 see section si 1 in the supplementary information for details on these calculations 2 4 source separation and pathways two types of estrogen loading were incorporated into the model sources from 1 populations connected to a wwtp and 2 populations not connected to any wwtp the population count of treated versus untreated populations in each au was first determined based on the sum of populations treated by all wwtps in the au versus the total population loadings from treated and untreated populations were then calculated in each au separately for rural and urban populations based on data of a modis rural urban land use classification schneider et al 2010 the loading from rural and urban populations connected to wwtps were calculated using information about the capacity associated with each treatment plant see si 2 1 and the per capita estrogen excretion rates calculated previously see si 1 average removal rates in wwtps per substance of 66 8 85 97 and 84 for e1 e2 e3 and ee2 were assumed based on reported literature values caldwell et al 2010 after removal in the wwtp the load was linked to the river reach or lake into which the plant discharges its effluent the contribution of estrogens from the population not served by wwtps were calculated by taking the estimated total estrogen contributions of the entire population minus the contributions estimated for populations connected to wwtps see details in si 2 2 a population density map worldpop gaughan et al 2013 aggregated from its 100 m resolution to match hydrorout s 500 m spatial resolution was used to spatially distribute the contributions from untreated populations according to population density in the aus separated for rural and urban areas the downscaling procedure essentially resulted in a high resolution surface of estrogen input it was assumed that not all human releases of untreated wastewater enter directly into surface water bodies however the factors affecting this proportion are currently not well understood chang et al 2009 attributed almost 63 of the estrogen loads in 45 chinese rivers to discharges of untreated wastewater in rural areas this proportion could be lower for example wang et al 2011 report that 47 of untreated wastewater is discharged into trenches or ditches directly whereas only 7 is discharged into nearby rivers due to this large uncertainty a variable termed the direct discharge coefficient ddc was incorporated into the model to represent the proportion of estrogen load from untreated wastewater reaching the water body to derive a plausible estimate for ddc we made several assumptions see si 2 3 and figure s1 first we assumed that between 6 and 20 of untreated rural wastewater are discharged directly into rivers and streams depending on the drainage density and the location of population centers relative to the stream wang et al 2011 furthermore we assumed that the rest of the rural wastewater 80 94 is applied in equal parts to agricultural fields i e no further contribution to risk is assumed liu et al 2015a or retained in pit latrines and septic tanks for which we both assume an average hormone removal efficiency of 20 similar to removal rates in primary wwtps in china liu et al 2014 using these baseline assumptions we concluded that between 38 and 58 of estrogens in untreated rural wastewaters reach rivers and streams directly and we used an average ddc factor of 50 in the baseline scenario no 3 in our model see 2 7 below for urban areas a higher ddc of 80 was assumed due to the presence of impervious surfaces leading to more direct disposal of wastewater to nearby rivers and streams it should be noted that the assumptions for both rural and urban ddc are associated with high levels of uncertainty we therefore used scenario and sensitivity analyses to provide additional insights into model performance and results see 3 2 and si 4 1 additionally we accounted for limited connectivity and variability in river density by using inverse distance weighting see si 2 2 to derive final contributions from the location of rural populations to the nearest river or stream 2 5 river and lake routing model an extension of the global routing model hydrorout grill et al 2016 lehner and grill 2013 was used for mass balance calculations in the river and lake network hydrorout processes the river network sequentially in the hydrological order from source to sink for river reaches a plug flow approach pistocchi et al 2010 is used that is a plug of substance mass i e the amount of contaminant released from the treatment plant is accumulated downstream as the sum of the input from the current and all upstream reaches flowing into the current reach see si 2 4 during the routing a first order decay function was applied using specified half lives for each chemical based on averages given in caldwell et al 2010 values of 0 3 0 3 5 7 and 0 07 were used for e1 e2 e3 and ee2 respectively as k day 1 the assumption that an estimated 50 of e2 is converted into e1 during transmission of sewage and wastewater treatment zhang et al 2014b was also accounted for as an important partial estrogen sink lakes were integrated and modelled as completely stirred reactors anderson et al 2004 2 6 environmental risk assessment after accumulation and degradation the pecs for each river reach were calculated by dividing the accumulated chemical mass by the discharge of the reach see also si 2 5 to account for the seasonal variability of river flows we calculated pecs at low flow conditions i e representing the worst case scenario with minimal dilution and maximal concentrations to represent low flow conditions typically the daily 90th percentile flow q90 is used i e a flow that is exceeded at 90 of the time however due to the unavailability of daily flow data in our large scale model we instead used the discharge of the lowest month of the annual flow regime to substitute for q90 the validity of substituting the lowest month of the annual flow regime for q90 has been tested in grill et al 2016 with data from 57 canadian gauging stations and confirmed good overall correlations between the two indices r2 0 97 since estrogens act in an additive manner thorpe et al 2001 and the eco toxicological potency of all estrogens is not equal anderson et al 2012 caldwell et al 2012 scher 2011 the total amount of estrogen released from residents was expressed in terms of equivalents of e2 the most potent natural estrogen specifically ee2 e1 and e3 were assumed to be 10 0 33 and 0 04 times as potent as e2 respectively khan and nicell 2014 after the weighting risk quotients rqs were calculated based on the ratios of pecs to pnec for all estrogens a combined pnec of 1 ng of e2 eq l williams et al 2009 was assumed that is any river reach with total e2 equivalent concentrations exceeding 1 ng l was assumed to be at risk and river reaches above 10 ng l were classified as being at high risk 2 7 sensitivity analysis and scenarios high model sensitivity was assumed with respect to the contributions of rural populations unserved by wwtps combined with a high parameter uncertainty while calibration can be used to improve the predictive accuracy of models we refrained from applying this step due to the limited availability of field measurements of estrogen concentrations and a lack of information on flow quantities at the time the measurements were taken which could lead to a skewed parameterization in a calibration process instead modelling experiments were conducted for 15 scenarios with parameter settings that reflected differing wwtp removal rates direct discharge coefficients ddc of untreated wastewater river decay and lake removal as illustrated in table 1 the scenario that was selected to represent the most plausible baseline scenario 3 was defined with parameters from a literature review to gain additional insights into the model s sensitivity and to systematically quantify uncertainties we followed the methods outlined in grill et al 2016 and performed a monte carlo style sensitivity analysis see section si 4 1 for details we assessed six key model parameters and allowed them to vary within reasonable boundaries see table s5 to estimate the average minimum maximum and standard deviation of model outcomes in particular the 95th percentile of contaminant concentrations we conducted two types of simulations the first was a local sensitivity analysis to estimate and compare the sensitivity of individual parameters and the second was a global sensitivity analysis aimed at estimating the sensitivity and uncertainty of all parameters combined the six parameters included in this analysis were a ddc rural b ddc urban c wwtp removal rate d excretion rate e decay and f discharge we gathered information regarding reasonable boundaries of individual parameter uncertainties from literature or own estimates see table s5 we used a normal distribution if the mean and standard deviation of the parameter distribution were known as was the case for wwtp removal rates and a triangular probability function if little was known about the true variability of a parameter 3 results 3 1 estrogen release inventory the total excretion of estrogens from residents in china was estimated at 28 4 tonnes per year mg yr this apportions to 5 5 2 7 and 20 1 mg yr of e1 e2 and e3 and 36 kg yr of ee2 respectively for the baseline scenario no 3 in table 1 a total of 9 039 kg of estrogen reaches rivers and lakes in china with 2 022 kg 894 kg 6 112 kg and 11 kg for each respective estrogen spatial patterns of estrogen emission densities per square kilometer fig 5 are generally consistent with the spatial pattern of population density shown in fig 4 fig 6 shows the sources pathways and fate of estrogen mass for the baseline scenario rural populations excrete 60 8 of total emissions compared to urban populations with 39 2 however only 5 4 of the load of rural populations is processed in wastewater treatment plants compared to urban populations with 48 9 therefore only 3 3 of the total estrogen excretion is treated in wwtps in rural areas compared to 19 2 in urban areas these results suggest that rural emissions into rivers from untreated populations are the greatest source of anthropogenic estrogen releases in china followed by emissions from urban sources not connected to wastewater treatment facilities urban connected sources and rural connected sources in that order due to the high efficiency of wwtps in removing estrogens they are estimated to only contribute 0 4 and 2 0 of the total estrogen emissions into rivers from rural and urban areas respectively in contrast 18 7 and 10 7 of estrogens are released into rivers from rural and urban untreated sources relative to the total emissions into rivers this accounts for 92 5 emissions from untreated sources versus 7 5 from wwtps with the largest emissions stemming from populations not served by treatment facilities estrogen removal in surface water becomes a critical process even though in river removal remains the dominant removal process in surface waters it was found that lakes and reservoirs play an important role in removing about 28 8 of estrogens reaching surface waters the importance of lake removal is slightly higher in rural areas most likely because urban areas tend to be located closer to larger streams which themselves tend to have fewer lakes in downstream reaches to process the contaminants compared to smaller streams in rural areas the sum of estrogens reaching the ocean neighboring countries or an inland sink amounts to 1 280 kg proportioned into 909 155 210 and 6 kg of e1 e2 e3 and ee2 respectively further details for each scenario can be found in table s7 3 2 environmental risk and sensitivity table 1 shows results for the 15 investigated scenarios and fig 7 shows spatially disaggregated environmental risk for rivers in china for the baseline scenario 3 this scenario run resulted in a predicted risk i e rq 1 for widespread parts of china as well as high risk i e rq 10 for substantial parts of china risk patterns loosely follow the population density patterns as shown in fig 4 modified by regional variations of precipitation and discharge and by local flow magnitude large parts of the north china plains appear with very high concentrations due to low river flow and high population density overall the baseline scenario indicates risk for 23 6 of all analyzed rivers expressed as percentage of river length in china of these 4 1 of rivers are at high risk 10 ng l adjusted concentration a value that falls at the lower end of reported extents ranging from 3 to 20 depending on scenario for the yellow river basin liu et al 2015a by examining different rivers by size classes we predict that 21 7 of the smallest rivers 0 1 1 m3 s average flow are at risk increasing to 23 6 and 37 3 for the next larger classes 1 10 m3 s and 10 100 m3 s respectively table 1 small streams are proportionally less affected due to lower population densities in headwater streams if only large rivers 100 1 000 m3 s are assessed 29 0 of rivers are at risk and 21 6 of very large rivers 1 000 10 000 m3 s the largest category of rivers 10 000 m3 s did not show any risk due to their high dilution capabilities if only treated sources are considered contributions from wwtps alone produce risk in 6 4 of medium sized rivers 10 100 m3 s as illustrated in scenario 9 table 1 this number increases 3 fold to 20 1 in scenario 8 highlighting the large contribution of populations who are not served by wwpts even if ddc is set low i e 20 for both urban and rural areas however removal by wwtps is increasingly important for larger rivers when comparing scenario 14 to scenario 3 risk without wwtp removal increases moderately by 2 1 in medium sized rivers 10 100 m3 s but increases strongly by 14 2 and 7 7 in large 100 1 000 m3 s and very large rivers 1 000 10 000 m3 s respectively even triggering some risk 0 2 in the largest river class 10 000 m3 s this indicates that wwtps play an important role in water quality control of increasingly large rivers without wwtp removal the risk quotient in many river reaches would exceed 1 pec pnec nevertheless releases from untreated population dominate by far the overall contribution to risk the removal of contaminant load due to processes in lakes and rivers is also very important a comparison between baseline scenario 3 and scenarios 12 and 13 shows that both lake and in stream removal reduce the risk in all river classes substantially by itself lake removal has an overall strong influence on results and contributed almost 50 more than in stream removal 3 7 increase in scenario 13 vs 2 5 increase in scenario 12 lake removal is important in rivers of all sizes except for the very largest with additional removal peaking at 6 4 for large rivers 100 1 000 m3 s in contrast in stream removal is most important for large and very large rivers without in stream removal 64 0 of the largest rivers in china 10 000 m3 s would exceed pnec compared to 0 with in stream removal and the risk would double for very large rivers 1 000 10 000 m3 s and increase 1 6 fold for large rivers 100 1 000 m3 s 3 3 model validation and sensitivity modelling results were validated by comparing predicted estrogen concentrations with available measurements in selected river reaches the results revealed that model predictions were generally within the range of concentrations reported in literature some explorations for individual sites at the yangtze river table 2 showed that model predictions were well within an order of magnitude compared to observations except for one site for e3 and all three ee2 sites see discussion below a more extensive amount of point by point comparisons has not been conducted yet as these comparisons are generally precluded by a lack of precise information on sampling locations a lack of data on stream flow quantities during sampling and uncertainty about the time when the concentrations in the rivers were measured additional validation using cumulative frequency plots do not require the spatial locations of measurements and can be used to reveal whether the distribution of modelling results matches observed distributions measurements from 20 studies see si 3 table s4 were plotted against the predicted concentrations of the 15 scenarios modelled fig 8 the distribution of e1 and e2 predictions for scenario 3 baseline under low flow conditions is in relatively good agreement with measurements from the literature for scenario 4 same as scenario 3 but under average flow conditions a general trend of model underprediction is observed which can be attributed to increased dilution due to larger discharges however as it remains unclear under which flow conditions the field measurements were taken i e they may be representative of average flows the underprediction could also reflect true model limitations such as a lack of accounting for animal husbandry estrogen sources the fact that scenario 4 i e the only scenario based on average rather than low flow conditions remains within the boundaries of other scenarios indicates that the uncertainties related to discharge levels low vs average are not exceeding those uncertainties introduced by other plausible parameter choices the predicted 95th percentile concentrations under the baseline scenario 3 for e1 17 8 ng l and e2 3 4 ng l match well with the 95th percentile measured concentrations of 17 6 ng l and 2 6 ng l respectively table s6 table s8 in si provides analysis for other scenarios the predicted 95th percentile concentration of e3 19 3 ng l seems slightly overestimated by the model compared to measurements 12 5 ng l nevertheless given the very low eco toxicological potency of e3 the overestimation of e3 has minor effects on the magnitude of combined risk concentration predictions for ee2 are vastly underpredicted relative to observed concentrations possible explanations for this discrepancy are that measurement data for ee2 may be skewed since non detects were conservatively plotted at their respective detection limits combined with the fact that ee2 has only been positively detected in 17 of the 338 chinese surface water samples analyzed thus far it is also possible that the consumption data used in this study for ee2 may not be fully representative and finally there may be unaccounted sources of ee2 to the chinese environment such as use in animal husbandry zhang et al 2014a and discharges from manufacturing operations which likely produce a significant portion of the global supply of ee2 destined for clinical use chang et al 2009 cui et al 2006 larsson and fick 2009 the possible underpredictions of ee2 combined with the high potency of ee2 in the environment suggest that the overall risk from estrogens may be higher than predicted here a local sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which parameters contributed the most to model uncertainty the results indicate that the 95th percentile concentrations are most sensitive to uncertainty regarding contaminant export into rivers ddc in rural areas hormone excretion and local discharge see si 4 1 1 the role of environmental decay removal in wwtps and urban ddc contributed far less to the 95th percentile concentrations however their role in local river concentrations in particular downstream of population centers may play an important role finally a global sensitivity analysis was conducted to further support the validation of the model we executed 20 000 monte carlo runs each for scenarios 3 and 4 low and average flow conditions and plotted the probability distributions of the predicted hormone concentrations along with measured concentrations see si 4 1 2 for details the results from this analysis suggest a large overall variability between plausible minimum and maximum boundaries of estimated concentrations with possible increases in concentrations by about one order of magnitude and possible decreases by multiple orders of magnitude reflecting the expected high model uncertainties and limitations nevertheless the predicted mean distributions of concentrations as well as the 95th percentile concentrations match reasonably well with the observed values with the exception of ee2 as was discussed above 4 discussion given the simplified large scale study design and the steady state approach of the current model implementation we anticipated significant uncertainties due to the lack of understanding of the behaviour of some chemicals and possibly significant unaccounted variability regarding input variables of the system indeed a high sensitivity of model output to the direct discharge coefficient ddc was observed which reflects the contaminant load discharged directly into rivers research on this issue at large spatial scales is sparse and as such available ddc estimates rely on limited evidence in urban areas the proportion of untreated wastewater reaching a water body is deemed higher than in rural areas due to a larger proportion of impervious surfaces although ddc is larger in urban areas the model sensitivity was much higher for rural populations because the proportion of untreated rural populations is generally much higher than for urban populations furthermore this issue varies spatially as it is a function of hydrological stream density and flow quantities in response to this inverse distance weighting was used as a means of accounting for population distributions in relation to stream density even then the proportion of wastewater reaching a significant surface water body and routed downstream may be exaggerated in our model and could lead to overestimation of risk in some areas in particular large areas of the north china plains where our model indicates high risk are mostly characterized by artificial hydrology consisting of a network of canals ongley et al 2010 a proper validation of our model predictions remained challenging due to the lack of adequate field measurements which generally lack precise locations and related river flow data nevertheless the results from literature comparisons as well as the monte carlo analysis suggest that our simulations are within the range of reported values and replicate the distributions of concentrations sufficiently well for screening and risk assessment purposes errors in the underlying hydrography and hydrology in particular in small river reaches contribute to the overall uncertainty of simulated in river concentrations and may in part explain high concentrations in small and medium rivers a thorough validation of the hydrological model could not be performed for chinese rivers due to the unavailability of a sufficient number of discharge records however we assume that the data quality is comparable to the demonstrated robustness at a global scale see data section 2 2 and in other regions grill et al 2016 in particular global comparisons showed that discharge estimates for the lowest month of the flow regime as used in the baseline scenario calculations exhibit a slight bias towards overestimating flows which would implicate a trend for excessive dilution and conservative contaminant concentrations regardless a region specific validation is recommended before future implementations of our model setup or results a known limitation of the presented model is that contributions of animal husbandry and manufacturing operations are not accounted for because their spatial locations and loads are difficult to determine with any degree of reliability this is a common problem when assessing risk from estrogens caldwell et al 2010 animals in livestock farms excrete several orders of magnitude higher levels of estrogen per head than humans zhang et al 2014b and can contribute to substantial hormone activity in rivers chen et al 2010 in china an average of 62 of e1 e2 and e3 load on the environment may stem from animals zhang et al 2014b due to the lack of data to account for these sources spatially the model predictions presented here should be interpreted as incomplete and as such the real risk is possibly underestimated as indicated in other studies zhang et al 2014b comprehensive spatial data should be collected to include animal and manufacturing sources in future studies in principle our presented contaminant fate model may be applied to address a wider range of similar contaminants without requiring significant additional model adjustments however some contaminants exhibit complex environmental interactions that require accounting for specific processes beyond those usually considered in such models e g liao et al 2015 rehmann and soupir 2009 further corroboration of the model with more contaminants and its application in different geographical contexts is necessary to broaden the confidence in the model outcomes despite the discussed limitations of the model it provides the most detailed and highest resolution source appropriation of estrogens in china currently available and it tracks multiple fate pathways in the environment as such the model could be used to test the effectiveness of management outcomes by for example comparing new wastewater treatment infrastructure in urban locations with measures to reduce direct discharge of rural populations by building latrines or septic tanks furthermore the model could be used to identify the location where such management actions could reduce risk for downstream populations most effectively 5 conclusion in this work a high resolution contaminant fate model has been developed with the goal of providing a screening tool aimed at rapid risk assessment of multiple contaminants in china and elsewhere the sources pathways and fate of estrogens in freshwater systems were explored in an environment driven by high hydrological variability and large contaminant contributions from populations not connected to wastewater treatment plants the model was used to predict high resolution patterns of environmental estrogen concentrations in china that were consistent with field measurements reported in the literature we find that the vast majority of estrogen sources stem from non treated sources which indicates that lowering the risk from hormones in the environment primarily requires efforts in rural regions of china where connectivity to wastewater treatment plants is low or non existent as a spatially explicit framework for modelling pathways of contaminants the model can support environmental risk assessments for other regions in the world and for many compounds of emerging concern in particular in applying the model to various sources of contaminants in a region the model can be used to 1 identify those contaminants that are likely to represent a significant environmental risk 2 pinpoint those water courses where the occurrence of contaminants has the potential to exceed concentrations at which eco toxicological risk is expected

19339,the contamination of freshwater systems arises in many river basins due to industrialization and population growth posing risks to ecosystems and human health despite these concerns the fate and potential impact of many emerging pollutants are currently unknown especially when the compounds are released into surface waters from populations distributed across large spatial scales in order to address this shortcoming a spatially explicit contaminant fate model was developed as an extension of the global vector based river routing model hydrorout hydrorout operates at very high spatial resolution 500 m simulates river and stream chemical transport with in stream removal and contains links to a set of lakes and reservoirs which act as a partial sink during the transport the chemical fate model was applied to china and includes a consumption and release module based on county level population demographics considers point source contributions from 2547 wastewater treatment plants and accumulates contributions of rural and urban populations not connected to sewage treatment plants as a case study the sources and fates of the estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 as well as the synthetic estrogenic steroid hormone 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 were modelled in chinese surface water bodies preliminary validation of the results showed predictions to be within the ranges of concentrations reported in literature with exception of ee2 the total estrogenic mass in the entire river and lake system amounted to 370 tonnes of estrogens with about 1 3 tonnes per year discharged to the ocean neighboring countries or to inland sinks under a selected baseline scenario eco toxicological risk i e contaminant concentrations in excess of the predicted no effect concentration pnec is found in 23 6 of all analyzed rivers of china with an average flow 0 1 m3 s out of these about 4 of rivers showed a high level of risk of 10 times or more above pnec medium to large rivers are disproportionally affected for example 23 6 37 3 29 0 and 21 6 of river length are at risk in rivers of 1 10 10 100 100 1 000 and 1 000 10 000 m3 s of discharge respectively whereas no risk was predicted in the largest rivers i e 10 000 m3 s of china wastewater treatment plants process 22 5 of the total hormone load and thus play an important role in water quality control by reducing the risk in substantial portions of the river network which would otherwise show elevated risk releases from untreated population dominate by far the overall contribution to risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords contaminant fate modelling hormones wastewater risk assessment eco toxicology large scale china 1 introduction widespread concerns have been raised in the recent past that environmental quality in china is deteriorating due to increasing urbanization population growth and industrial agricultural and economic intensification liu et al 2013 sepa 2013 varis et al 2014 wang et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 extensive contamination of chinese freshwaters due to releases from municipal and industrial treatment plants of untreated wastewater sewage and from runoff from agricultural production manufacturing operations and animal husbandry operations has been reported shao et al 2006 in addition the release of such emerging contaminants as pharmaceutically active compounds personal care products nanomaterials and natural hormones has gained increased attention khan et al 2017 khan and nicell 2010 2015 richardson et al 2005 zhang et al 2014b the extent to which these and other emerging contaminants contribute to overall freshwater degradation at large spatial scales i e entire countries often remains unclear because the identification of these compounds in the environment is hindered by the need to develop reliable analytical methods with sufficiently low detection limits and by the high costs associated with the field implementation of extensive monitoring campaigns as an alternative to conducting such measurements the modelling of the sources fate and risks of chemical contaminants has become a commonly used strategy to provide reasonable results at low cost for a variety of chemicals cowan ellsberry et al 2009 franco et al 2017 johnson et al 2008 spatially distributed contaminant fate models such as great er kehrein et al 2015 istreem ferrer and deleo 2017 lf2000 wqx williams et al 2012 phate anderson et al 2004 mappe pistocchi et al 2012 gwava johnson et al 2013 and hydrorout grill et al 2016 have been widely used to understand the impact of various chemical contaminants on european and north american waterways cunningham et al 2012 gimeno et al 2017 grill et al 2016 hannah et al 2009 johnson et al 2013 ort et al 2009 such models often share common assumptions and similar key modelling mechanisms keller et al 2006 pistocchi 2014 including a reasonable per capita mass emissions of a chemical contaminant of interest into individual wastewater treatment plants wwtps are calculated using the average per capita consumption use of the compound b if relevant adjustments for losses due to human metabolism and removal in wastewater treatment plants are made c dilution through advection after discharge into natural waters are modelled using stream length velocity volumetric discharge and a decay constant for the chemical d predicted environmental concentrations pecs are subsequently calculated based on the accumulated load and the river discharge at the river reach scale however these types of models have not been extensively applied in less data rich countries china poses a significant challenge to large scale contaminant fate models because of a large rural population not connected to wwtps the country s large variability of hydrological regimes and the lack of publicly available datasets regarding the geo spatial location of wwtps several studies have been conducted in an attempt to assess the risks associated with chemicals in china using non spatial screening techniques see review in wang et al 2012 others have used spatially limited models that either focussed on individual watersheds or assessed risk in primarily large rivers 1000 m3 s using a coarse scale 0 5 0 5 raster based hydrological and routing model liu et al 2015a whelan et al 2011 zhang et al 2014b the levels of risk arising from these spatially limited or coarse models may have been underestimated mostly due to two main challenges first the distribution of risk in smaller to mid sized headwater streams has not been well captured in previous models for china in these cases the dilution factors may have been too large resulting in low overall risk for smaller streams the risk contributed by communities not connected to wwtps is likely to be high in china where a significant proportion is not connected to any sewage treatment facility especially in rural areas approximately 26 of the population in large cities and 46 in small and medium cities lack wastewater treatment and the coverage in rural areas is practically non existent mohurd 2012 in addition the removal efficiency for emerging contaminants such as estrogens via secondary sewage treatment is generally high caldwell et al 2012 this may create a situation where even a relatively small population that is not connected to wastewater treatment facilities may produce significant risk which makes the assessment of the small scale contributions of local residents even more important second releases from wwtps may be unaccounted for or attributed imprecisely to the wrong river system giving rise to underestimation and inaccuracies in smaller to medium sized rivers to our knowledge there is currently no risk assessment model at the scale of entire mainland china that explicitly geolocates wwtps to their discharge points at individual river reaches to account for more localized impacts to address these challenges a realistic estimation of risk for small and medium rivers should account for sources and pathways of contaminants at high spatial resolution should take into account the locations capacity and discharge volumes of wwtps should include reasonable estimates of hydrological flow and should account for populations not connected to wastewater treatment facilities therefore the first goal of this study is to develop a high resolution spatially explicit contaminant fate model for china which considers local estimates of stream flow at the river reach scale and takes into account point sources of wwtps as well as sources of populations not connected to wwtps the second goal of this study is to apply the contaminant fate model to study the spatial distribution and magnitude of estrogen emission sources predict their fate in the environment and determine the environmental risk of these compounds in chinese surface water bodies to test whether the resulting model predictions for the case study of china are reasonable the environmental exposure and risk of the following four estrogens were calculated estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 as well as the synthetic estrogenic steroid hormone 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 in addition to being endogenously produced the first three can also result from the use of hormone replacement therapeutics in contrast ee2 is not naturally produced by humans and therefore is expected to be largely released to the environment due to its clinical use in medications such as birth control pills khan and nicell 2014 all estrogens except e1 are removed in secondary treatment plants at average rates that are in excess of 80 caldwell et al 2010 liu et al 2015a 2015b once released into the environment ee2 has been shown to be considerably more persistent than e1 e2 and e3 caldwell et al 2010 estrogens were selected for evaluation because every person releases natural estrogens in their excreta which allows for the evaluation of the relative significance of spatially distributed diffuse sources from residents not connected to wwtps versus localized point sources from populations connected to wwtps furthermore estrogens by their inherent nature are potent endocrine disruptors and are known to act in an additive way caldwell et al 2012 and thus may pose risk to aquatic life and humans even at low concentrations for example the feminization of fish leading to the collapse of a fish population caused by ee2 has been reported at concentrations as low as a few nanograms per liter kidd et al 2007 concentrations in excess of predicted no effect concentrations pnecs have been reported at several sites in rivers and lakes across china chang et al 2009 2011 jiang et al 2012 zhao et al 2009 jiang et al 2012 found alarmingly high levels of source water contamination in chinese rivers lakes and reservoirs yet the assessment of risk of estrogens in rivers and lakes based on contaminant fate models has mostly focused on north america and europe anderson et al 2012 caldwell et al 2010 writer et al 2010 while only limited such research has been conducted in china zhang et al 2014b due to substantial uncertainty regarding the sources and fate of contaminants in the environment several scenarios are used to explore the model s sensitivity with respect to key parameters overall this study presents the first comprehensive high resolution multi contaminant fate model for continental china and sets the stage for the application of the model to other areas of the world 2 methodology 2 1 general outline based on county and city level administrative units the per capita contributions of residents based on the demographics of each administrative unit were calculated by separating sources into urban and rural contaminant pathways either via wwtps or directly into the environment were then assessed fig 1 using a high resolution river hydrography and routing model the cumulative contaminant loads downstream in the river systems were calculated while accounting for contaminant decay transformation and removal in lakes the four assessed estrogens were then weighted by their relative potency and total concentrations in surface waters were calculated based on low flow discharge estimates generated from long term model simulations resulting pecs were compared to the pnec to evaluate risk the model was run for 15 scenarios each with varying settings of parameters that reflect contaminant removal in wwtps direct discharge coefficients ddc of untreated wastewater river decay and lake removal a brief description of the methodology used is presented in the sections below with further details provided in the supplementary information si 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 river network the baseline hydrographic data used in this study is provided by the hydrosheds database lehner et al 2008 a publicly available global suite of data layers representing river network topology and watershed boundaries fig 2 hydrosheds defines river flow directions at 500 m pixel resolution which are then used to create a vectorized network of river reaches for transport simulation of water and substances in a routing model called hydrorout this model has been previously applied to estimate risk for a variety of down the drain pharmaceuticals in north america grill et al 2016 lehner and grill 2013 at the 500 m resolution there are 622 150 river reaches with an average length of 4 24 km within the study area of mainland china each river reach has a contributing catchment which was used to aggregate fine scale spatial information a set of 22 952 lakes and their estimated storage volumes messager et al 2016 were integrated into hydrorout out of which 6177 are identified as reservoirs lehner et al 2011 2 2 2 discharge data hydrorout utilizes decoupled external discharge estimates as provided by the global integrated water balance model watergap döll et al 2003 version 2 2 as of 2014 for this study the time series of watergap s monthly discharge estimates for the period 1971 2000 was first aggregated to derive the long term annual average discharge as well as the annual flow regime i e the average discharge of each of the twelve calendar months these discharge values were then downscaled from the original 0 5 degree grid resolution of watergap to the 500 m pixel resolution of hydrorout by employing geospatial disaggregation and re accumulation procedures lehner and grill 2013 fig 2 for low flow assessments the lowest month of the annual flow regime was used to substitute for more traditional low flow indicators such as daily q90 flows smakhtin 2001 a preliminary validation of the resulting hydrorout discharge estimates against observations of 3003 global gauging stations grdc 2014 representing river sizes from 0 004 to 180 000 m3 s confirmed good overall correlations r2 0 99 with 0 2 positive bias for the annual average r2 0 97 with 12 positive bias for the lowest month of the flow regime the discharge estimates showed a symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape armstrong 1985 of 35 for the annual average improving to 13 for rivers 100 m3 s and 71 for the lowest month of the flow regime improving to 53 for rivers 100 m3 s these statistics indicate that errors in the discharge estimates of hydrorout are generally within reasonable boundaries and well below order of magnitude ranges even for low flows in small rivers 2 2 3 wastewater treatment plants the locations and characteristics of 2739 wwtps for china were obtained in tabular form mep 2011 corresponding to august 2010 a total of 192 wwtps with flow rates less than 1000 m3 d were excluded due to difficulties in determining the population served for these small plants resulting in 2547 wwtps considered in this study fig 3 the total designed treatment capacity of all wwtps was 125 0 million m3 d with a total average treatment capacity of 96 1 million m3 d nearly all wwtps considered used secondary treatment technologies i e biological treatment only two were considered primary treatment plants the population served by each wwtp was assigned based on data of the beijing municipal research institute of environmental protection the specific longitudes and latitudes of the wwtps were determined by using geolocation techniques which translate addresses into geographic coordinates each data point was manually verified for each individual plant and corrected using satellite imagery finally the locations were co registered to the river network of hydrorout 2 2 4 administrative units aus estimates of estrogen contributions were calculated at the county administrative level large cities such as beijing are composed of several smaller counties and these were grouped into homogenous city units to avoid inconsistencies in calculating treatment coverage due to the typical peripheral location of wwtps in these large conglomerates population demographics of a total of 2345 aus were determined based on the latest china population census conducted in 2010 china population census office 2012 see fig 4 2 3 per capita estrogen release per capita releases of the four estrogens i e e1 e2 e3 and ee2 were calculated from natural and synthetic sources for each au based on the demographic characteristics and consumption data of relevant formulations residents of each au were grouped based on gender and age group and per capita contributions of natural estrogen releases were calculated using average excretion rates khan and nicell 2014 synthetic estrogen contributions from contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy hrt were calculated using total national consumption cmsn 2012 and adjusted for elimination and metabolic conversion to other forms of estrogen khan and nicell 2014 the total consumption was distributed spatially based on relative consumption rates reported for each province cmsn 2012 see section si 1 in the supplementary information for details on these calculations 2 4 source separation and pathways two types of estrogen loading were incorporated into the model sources from 1 populations connected to a wwtp and 2 populations not connected to any wwtp the population count of treated versus untreated populations in each au was first determined based on the sum of populations treated by all wwtps in the au versus the total population loadings from treated and untreated populations were then calculated in each au separately for rural and urban populations based on data of a modis rural urban land use classification schneider et al 2010 the loading from rural and urban populations connected to wwtps were calculated using information about the capacity associated with each treatment plant see si 2 1 and the per capita estrogen excretion rates calculated previously see si 1 average removal rates in wwtps per substance of 66 8 85 97 and 84 for e1 e2 e3 and ee2 were assumed based on reported literature values caldwell et al 2010 after removal in the wwtp the load was linked to the river reach or lake into which the plant discharges its effluent the contribution of estrogens from the population not served by wwtps were calculated by taking the estimated total estrogen contributions of the entire population minus the contributions estimated for populations connected to wwtps see details in si 2 2 a population density map worldpop gaughan et al 2013 aggregated from its 100 m resolution to match hydrorout s 500 m spatial resolution was used to spatially distribute the contributions from untreated populations according to population density in the aus separated for rural and urban areas the downscaling procedure essentially resulted in a high resolution surface of estrogen input it was assumed that not all human releases of untreated wastewater enter directly into surface water bodies however the factors affecting this proportion are currently not well understood chang et al 2009 attributed almost 63 of the estrogen loads in 45 chinese rivers to discharges of untreated wastewater in rural areas this proportion could be lower for example wang et al 2011 report that 47 of untreated wastewater is discharged into trenches or ditches directly whereas only 7 is discharged into nearby rivers due to this large uncertainty a variable termed the direct discharge coefficient ddc was incorporated into the model to represent the proportion of estrogen load from untreated wastewater reaching the water body to derive a plausible estimate for ddc we made several assumptions see si 2 3 and figure s1 first we assumed that between 6 and 20 of untreated rural wastewater are discharged directly into rivers and streams depending on the drainage density and the location of population centers relative to the stream wang et al 2011 furthermore we assumed that the rest of the rural wastewater 80 94 is applied in equal parts to agricultural fields i e no further contribution to risk is assumed liu et al 2015a or retained in pit latrines and septic tanks for which we both assume an average hormone removal efficiency of 20 similar to removal rates in primary wwtps in china liu et al 2014 using these baseline assumptions we concluded that between 38 and 58 of estrogens in untreated rural wastewaters reach rivers and streams directly and we used an average ddc factor of 50 in the baseline scenario no 3 in our model see 2 7 below for urban areas a higher ddc of 80 was assumed due to the presence of impervious surfaces leading to more direct disposal of wastewater to nearby rivers and streams it should be noted that the assumptions for both rural and urban ddc are associated with high levels of uncertainty we therefore used scenario and sensitivity analyses to provide additional insights into model performance and results see 3 2 and si 4 1 additionally we accounted for limited connectivity and variability in river density by using inverse distance weighting see si 2 2 to derive final contributions from the location of rural populations to the nearest river or stream 2 5 river and lake routing model an extension of the global routing model hydrorout grill et al 2016 lehner and grill 2013 was used for mass balance calculations in the river and lake network hydrorout processes the river network sequentially in the hydrological order from source to sink for river reaches a plug flow approach pistocchi et al 2010 is used that is a plug of substance mass i e the amount of contaminant released from the treatment plant is accumulated downstream as the sum of the input from the current and all upstream reaches flowing into the current reach see si 2 4 during the routing a first order decay function was applied using specified half lives for each chemical based on averages given in caldwell et al 2010 values of 0 3 0 3 5 7 and 0 07 were used for e1 e2 e3 and ee2 respectively as k day 1 the assumption that an estimated 50 of e2 is converted into e1 during transmission of sewage and wastewater treatment zhang et al 2014b was also accounted for as an important partial estrogen sink lakes were integrated and modelled as completely stirred reactors anderson et al 2004 2 6 environmental risk assessment after accumulation and degradation the pecs for each river reach were calculated by dividing the accumulated chemical mass by the discharge of the reach see also si 2 5 to account for the seasonal variability of river flows we calculated pecs at low flow conditions i e representing the worst case scenario with minimal dilution and maximal concentrations to represent low flow conditions typically the daily 90th percentile flow q90 is used i e a flow that is exceeded at 90 of the time however due to the unavailability of daily flow data in our large scale model we instead used the discharge of the lowest month of the annual flow regime to substitute for q90 the validity of substituting the lowest month of the annual flow regime for q90 has been tested in grill et al 2016 with data from 57 canadian gauging stations and confirmed good overall correlations between the two indices r2 0 97 since estrogens act in an additive manner thorpe et al 2001 and the eco toxicological potency of all estrogens is not equal anderson et al 2012 caldwell et al 2012 scher 2011 the total amount of estrogen released from residents was expressed in terms of equivalents of e2 the most potent natural estrogen specifically ee2 e1 and e3 were assumed to be 10 0 33 and 0 04 times as potent as e2 respectively khan and nicell 2014 after the weighting risk quotients rqs were calculated based on the ratios of pecs to pnec for all estrogens a combined pnec of 1 ng of e2 eq l williams et al 2009 was assumed that is any river reach with total e2 equivalent concentrations exceeding 1 ng l was assumed to be at risk and river reaches above 10 ng l were classified as being at high risk 2 7 sensitivity analysis and scenarios high model sensitivity was assumed with respect to the contributions of rural populations unserved by wwtps combined with a high parameter uncertainty while calibration can be used to improve the predictive accuracy of models we refrained from applying this step due to the limited availability of field measurements of estrogen concentrations and a lack of information on flow quantities at the time the measurements were taken which could lead to a skewed parameterization in a calibration process instead modelling experiments were conducted for 15 scenarios with parameter settings that reflected differing wwtp removal rates direct discharge coefficients ddc of untreated wastewater river decay and lake removal as illustrated in table 1 the scenario that was selected to represent the most plausible baseline scenario 3 was defined with parameters from a literature review to gain additional insights into the model s sensitivity and to systematically quantify uncertainties we followed the methods outlined in grill et al 2016 and performed a monte carlo style sensitivity analysis see section si 4 1 for details we assessed six key model parameters and allowed them to vary within reasonable boundaries see table s5 to estimate the average minimum maximum and standard deviation of model outcomes in particular the 95th percentile of contaminant concentrations we conducted two types of simulations the first was a local sensitivity analysis to estimate and compare the sensitivity of individual parameters and the second was a global sensitivity analysis aimed at estimating the sensitivity and uncertainty of all parameters combined the six parameters included in this analysis were a ddc rural b ddc urban c wwtp removal rate d excretion rate e decay and f discharge we gathered information regarding reasonable boundaries of individual parameter uncertainties from literature or own estimates see table s5 we used a normal distribution if the mean and standard deviation of the parameter distribution were known as was the case for wwtp removal rates and a triangular probability function if little was known about the true variability of a parameter 3 results 3 1 estrogen release inventory the total excretion of estrogens from residents in china was estimated at 28 4 tonnes per year mg yr this apportions to 5 5 2 7 and 20 1 mg yr of e1 e2 and e3 and 36 kg yr of ee2 respectively for the baseline scenario no 3 in table 1 a total of 9 039 kg of estrogen reaches rivers and lakes in china with 2 022 kg 894 kg 6 112 kg and 11 kg for each respective estrogen spatial patterns of estrogen emission densities per square kilometer fig 5 are generally consistent with the spatial pattern of population density shown in fig 4 fig 6 shows the sources pathways and fate of estrogen mass for the baseline scenario rural populations excrete 60 8 of total emissions compared to urban populations with 39 2 however only 5 4 of the load of rural populations is processed in wastewater treatment plants compared to urban populations with 48 9 therefore only 3 3 of the total estrogen excretion is treated in wwtps in rural areas compared to 19 2 in urban areas these results suggest that rural emissions into rivers from untreated populations are the greatest source of anthropogenic estrogen releases in china followed by emissions from urban sources not connected to wastewater treatment facilities urban connected sources and rural connected sources in that order due to the high efficiency of wwtps in removing estrogens they are estimated to only contribute 0 4 and 2 0 of the total estrogen emissions into rivers from rural and urban areas respectively in contrast 18 7 and 10 7 of estrogens are released into rivers from rural and urban untreated sources relative to the total emissions into rivers this accounts for 92 5 emissions from untreated sources versus 7 5 from wwtps with the largest emissions stemming from populations not served by treatment facilities estrogen removal in surface water becomes a critical process even though in river removal remains the dominant removal process in surface waters it was found that lakes and reservoirs play an important role in removing about 28 8 of estrogens reaching surface waters the importance of lake removal is slightly higher in rural areas most likely because urban areas tend to be located closer to larger streams which themselves tend to have fewer lakes in downstream reaches to process the contaminants compared to smaller streams in rural areas the sum of estrogens reaching the ocean neighboring countries or an inland sink amounts to 1 280 kg proportioned into 909 155 210 and 6 kg of e1 e2 e3 and ee2 respectively further details for each scenario can be found in table s7 3 2 environmental risk and sensitivity table 1 shows results for the 15 investigated scenarios and fig 7 shows spatially disaggregated environmental risk for rivers in china for the baseline scenario 3 this scenario run resulted in a predicted risk i e rq 1 for widespread parts of china as well as high risk i e rq 10 for substantial parts of china risk patterns loosely follow the population density patterns as shown in fig 4 modified by regional variations of precipitation and discharge and by local flow magnitude large parts of the north china plains appear with very high concentrations due to low river flow and high population density overall the baseline scenario indicates risk for 23 6 of all analyzed rivers expressed as percentage of river length in china of these 4 1 of rivers are at high risk 10 ng l adjusted concentration a value that falls at the lower end of reported extents ranging from 3 to 20 depending on scenario for the yellow river basin liu et al 2015a by examining different rivers by size classes we predict that 21 7 of the smallest rivers 0 1 1 m3 s average flow are at risk increasing to 23 6 and 37 3 for the next larger classes 1 10 m3 s and 10 100 m3 s respectively table 1 small streams are proportionally less affected due to lower population densities in headwater streams if only large rivers 100 1 000 m3 s are assessed 29 0 of rivers are at risk and 21 6 of very large rivers 1 000 10 000 m3 s the largest category of rivers 10 000 m3 s did not show any risk due to their high dilution capabilities if only treated sources are considered contributions from wwtps alone produce risk in 6 4 of medium sized rivers 10 100 m3 s as illustrated in scenario 9 table 1 this number increases 3 fold to 20 1 in scenario 8 highlighting the large contribution of populations who are not served by wwpts even if ddc is set low i e 20 for both urban and rural areas however removal by wwtps is increasingly important for larger rivers when comparing scenario 14 to scenario 3 risk without wwtp removal increases moderately by 2 1 in medium sized rivers 10 100 m3 s but increases strongly by 14 2 and 7 7 in large 100 1 000 m3 s and very large rivers 1 000 10 000 m3 s respectively even triggering some risk 0 2 in the largest river class 10 000 m3 s this indicates that wwtps play an important role in water quality control of increasingly large rivers without wwtp removal the risk quotient in many river reaches would exceed 1 pec pnec nevertheless releases from untreated population dominate by far the overall contribution to risk the removal of contaminant load due to processes in lakes and rivers is also very important a comparison between baseline scenario 3 and scenarios 12 and 13 shows that both lake and in stream removal reduce the risk in all river classes substantially by itself lake removal has an overall strong influence on results and contributed almost 50 more than in stream removal 3 7 increase in scenario 13 vs 2 5 increase in scenario 12 lake removal is important in rivers of all sizes except for the very largest with additional removal peaking at 6 4 for large rivers 100 1 000 m3 s in contrast in stream removal is most important for large and very large rivers without in stream removal 64 0 of the largest rivers in china 10 000 m3 s would exceed pnec compared to 0 with in stream removal and the risk would double for very large rivers 1 000 10 000 m3 s and increase 1 6 fold for large rivers 100 1 000 m3 s 3 3 model validation and sensitivity modelling results were validated by comparing predicted estrogen concentrations with available measurements in selected river reaches the results revealed that model predictions were generally within the range of concentrations reported in literature some explorations for individual sites at the yangtze river table 2 showed that model predictions were well within an order of magnitude compared to observations except for one site for e3 and all three ee2 sites see discussion below a more extensive amount of point by point comparisons has not been conducted yet as these comparisons are generally precluded by a lack of precise information on sampling locations a lack of data on stream flow quantities during sampling and uncertainty about the time when the concentrations in the rivers were measured additional validation using cumulative frequency plots do not require the spatial locations of measurements and can be used to reveal whether the distribution of modelling results matches observed distributions measurements from 20 studies see si 3 table s4 were plotted against the predicted concentrations of the 15 scenarios modelled fig 8 the distribution of e1 and e2 predictions for scenario 3 baseline under low flow conditions is in relatively good agreement with measurements from the literature for scenario 4 same as scenario 3 but under average flow conditions a general trend of model underprediction is observed which can be attributed to increased dilution due to larger discharges however as it remains unclear under which flow conditions the field measurements were taken i e they may be representative of average flows the underprediction could also reflect true model limitations such as a lack of accounting for animal husbandry estrogen sources the fact that scenario 4 i e the only scenario based on average rather than low flow conditions remains within the boundaries of other scenarios indicates that the uncertainties related to discharge levels low vs average are not exceeding those uncertainties introduced by other plausible parameter choices the predicted 95th percentile concentrations under the baseline scenario 3 for e1 17 8 ng l and e2 3 4 ng l match well with the 95th percentile measured concentrations of 17 6 ng l and 2 6 ng l respectively table s6 table s8 in si provides analysis for other scenarios the predicted 95th percentile concentration of e3 19 3 ng l seems slightly overestimated by the model compared to measurements 12 5 ng l nevertheless given the very low eco toxicological potency of e3 the overestimation of e3 has minor effects on the magnitude of combined risk concentration predictions for ee2 are vastly underpredicted relative to observed concentrations possible explanations for this discrepancy are that measurement data for ee2 may be skewed since non detects were conservatively plotted at their respective detection limits combined with the fact that ee2 has only been positively detected in 17 of the 338 chinese surface water samples analyzed thus far it is also possible that the consumption data used in this study for ee2 may not be fully representative and finally there may be unaccounted sources of ee2 to the chinese environment such as use in animal husbandry zhang et al 2014a and discharges from manufacturing operations which likely produce a significant portion of the global supply of ee2 destined for clinical use chang et al 2009 cui et al 2006 larsson and fick 2009 the possible underpredictions of ee2 combined with the high potency of ee2 in the environment suggest that the overall risk from estrogens may be higher than predicted here a local sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which parameters contributed the most to model uncertainty the results indicate that the 95th percentile concentrations are most sensitive to uncertainty regarding contaminant export into rivers ddc in rural areas hormone excretion and local discharge see si 4 1 1 the role of environmental decay removal in wwtps and urban ddc contributed far less to the 95th percentile concentrations however their role in local river concentrations in particular downstream of population centers may play an important role finally a global sensitivity analysis was conducted to further support the validation of the model we executed 20 000 monte carlo runs each for scenarios 3 and 4 low and average flow conditions and plotted the probability distributions of the predicted hormone concentrations along with measured concentrations see si 4 1 2 for details the results from this analysis suggest a large overall variability between plausible minimum and maximum boundaries of estimated concentrations with possible increases in concentrations by about one order of magnitude and possible decreases by multiple orders of magnitude reflecting the expected high model uncertainties and limitations nevertheless the predicted mean distributions of concentrations as well as the 95th percentile concentrations match reasonably well with the observed values with the exception of ee2 as was discussed above 4 discussion given the simplified large scale study design and the steady state approach of the current model implementation we anticipated significant uncertainties due to the lack of understanding of the behaviour of some chemicals and possibly significant unaccounted variability regarding input variables of the system indeed a high sensitivity of model output to the direct discharge coefficient ddc was observed which reflects the contaminant load discharged directly into rivers research on this issue at large spatial scales is sparse and as such available ddc estimates rely on limited evidence in urban areas the proportion of untreated wastewater reaching a water body is deemed higher than in rural areas due to a larger proportion of impervious surfaces although ddc is larger in urban areas the model sensitivity was much higher for rural populations because the proportion of untreated rural populations is generally much higher than for urban populations furthermore this issue varies spatially as it is a function of hydrological stream density and flow quantities in response to this inverse distance weighting was used as a means of accounting for population distributions in relation to stream density even then the proportion of wastewater reaching a significant surface water body and routed downstream may be exaggerated in our model and could lead to overestimation of risk in some areas in particular large areas of the north china plains where our model indicates high risk are mostly characterized by artificial hydrology consisting of a network of canals ongley et al 2010 a proper validation of our model predictions remained challenging due to the lack of adequate field measurements which generally lack precise locations and related river flow data nevertheless the results from literature comparisons as well as the monte carlo analysis suggest that our simulations are within the range of reported values and replicate the distributions of concentrations sufficiently well for screening and risk assessment purposes errors in the underlying hydrography and hydrology in particular in small river reaches contribute to the overall uncertainty of simulated in river concentrations and may in part explain high concentrations in small and medium rivers a thorough validation of the hydrological model could not be performed for chinese rivers due to the unavailability of a sufficient number of discharge records however we assume that the data quality is comparable to the demonstrated robustness at a global scale see data section 2 2 and in other regions grill et al 2016 in particular global comparisons showed that discharge estimates for the lowest month of the flow regime as used in the baseline scenario calculations exhibit a slight bias towards overestimating flows which would implicate a trend for excessive dilution and conservative contaminant concentrations regardless a region specific validation is recommended before future implementations of our model setup or results a known limitation of the presented model is that contributions of animal husbandry and manufacturing operations are not accounted for because their spatial locations and loads are difficult to determine with any degree of reliability this is a common problem when assessing risk from estrogens caldwell et al 2010 animals in livestock farms excrete several orders of magnitude higher levels of estrogen per head than humans zhang et al 2014b and can contribute to substantial hormone activity in rivers chen et al 2010 in china an average of 62 of e1 e2 and e3 load on the environment may stem from animals zhang et al 2014b due to the lack of data to account for these sources spatially the model predictions presented here should be interpreted as incomplete and as such the real risk is possibly underestimated as indicated in other studies zhang et al 2014b comprehensive spatial data should be collected to include animal and manufacturing sources in future studies in principle our presented contaminant fate model may be applied to address a wider range of similar contaminants without requiring significant additional model adjustments however some contaminants exhibit complex environmental interactions that require accounting for specific processes beyond those usually considered in such models e g liao et al 2015 rehmann and soupir 2009 further corroboration of the model with more contaminants and its application in different geographical contexts is necessary to broaden the confidence in the model outcomes despite the discussed limitations of the model it provides the most detailed and highest resolution source appropriation of estrogens in china currently available and it tracks multiple fate pathways in the environment as such the model could be used to test the effectiveness of management outcomes by for example comparing new wastewater treatment infrastructure in urban locations with measures to reduce direct discharge of rural populations by building latrines or septic tanks furthermore the model could be used to identify the location where such management actions could reduce risk for downstream populations most effectively 5 conclusion in this work a high resolution contaminant fate model has been developed with the goal of providing a screening tool aimed at rapid risk assessment of multiple contaminants in china and elsewhere the sources pathways and fate of estrogens in freshwater systems were explored in an environment driven by high hydrological variability and large contaminant contributions from populations not connected to wastewater treatment plants the model was used to predict high resolution patterns of environmental estrogen concentrations in china that were consistent with field measurements reported in the literature we find that the vast majority of estrogen sources stem from non treated sources which indicates that lowering the risk from hormones in the environment primarily requires efforts in rural regions of china where connectivity to wastewater treatment plants is low or non existent as a spatially explicit framework for modelling pathways of contaminants the model can support environmental risk assessments for other regions in the world and for many compounds of emerging concern in particular in applying the model to various sources of contaminants in a region the model can be used to 1 identify those contaminants that are likely to represent a significant environmental risk 2 pinpoint those water courses where the occurrence of contaminants has the potential to exceed concentrations at which eco toxicological risk is expected and 3 focus detailed impact assessment studies and mitigation efforts e g on upgrading wastewater treatment plants on specific regions and sources acknowledgement funding for this study was provided
