diameter was close to 0 2 mm and had the tendency to aggregate 26 the consensual size of micro granular sludge is between 0 2 mm and 1 mm 27 30 recently it has been reported that anammox aggregates of 0 5 0 9 mm achieved a better performance in treating low strength wastewater 31 the size of anaob aggregates would influence mass transfer efficiency and microbial community distribution 22 30 31 and nitrogen removal efficiency 32 33 however to our knowledge how the size of aggregates influences the tdda has not be reported nitrite supplied by denitratation for anammox could also be further reduced to n2 via denitrification no2 no n2o n2 34 in tdda system it was well known that s2o3 2 s no3 n would influence bioreaction products of denitrification 35 and might consequently induce observable nitrite accumulation when it was under 1 4 16 maintaining s2o3 2 s no3 n above 1 2 would help the formation of sulfur intermediate as electron buffer 15 measured by the isotope tracing method only 70 80 nitrite was used for anammox in a one stage tdda system 15 further denitritation of nitrite in tdda led to excessive thiosulfate consumption and decrease ammonium removal 11 however the method for regulating the above two pathways to improve nitrogen removal efficiency remains unknown some researchers believe that the rate of denitratation was significantly higher than denitritation 36 and anaob has a high affinity for nitrite 37 due to its unique structure of anammoxosome and nitrite transporters 38 40 which support some sob as the cooperator for anaob in nitrite supply however the nitrate reduction rate was reported to be almost equal to nitrite reduction rate 41 furthermore starting with the co culture cultivation of anaob and sob candidatus kuenenia remained the dominant anaob and sob sulfurimonas was surprisingly taken over by sob sedimenticola 42 implying some sob as the potential competitor for anaob in nitrite acquisition the conflicting role of the sob in tdda system remains to be studied at the same time research on some sob in tdda systems was insufficient annwoodia a reclassified genus from thiobacillus 43 may play an unanticipated function in the tdda system due to its unique ability to grow on ammonium rather than nitrate as a nitrogen source 43 44 however it has not been documented in the tdda system literature to our

were successfully cultivated in asbr reactor fig 1 illustrates the different appearances of sludge in two reactors the sludge in r2 owned the appearance of a spherical or elliptical shape and compact and dense structure as previously reported 26 the sludge in r2 had a pale yellow color while the sludge in r1 was dark red the sem of three dimensional network structure of extracellular polymeric substances eps which would be responsible for the structural and functional integrity of the aggregates 54 as well as the pore structure as the mass transfer channel 55 of granular sludge were shown in fig s2 r2 showed a better settling ability after granulation table s2 granular sludge in r2 has an average diameter of 0 554 mm table s3 recent studies about anammox granular sludge showed that micro granular sludge 0 2 1 mm led to a high mass transfer efficiency which drove a better performance in nitrogen removal 30 31 at the same time the diameter for r1 was 0 195 mm r1 had the mean diameter close to the low limit of the granular sludge size definition 0 2 mm this kind of sludge can be seen as the early form of the granular sludge namely floc aggregates which originated from flocculent sludge and was under a critical period for the initial granulation the average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 39 r1 and 90 05 r2 were achieved during 40 days operation fig 2 the morphology physicochemical properties of the sludge and the overall performance of the reactors indicated tdda aggregates were successfully cultivated in both asbr reactors 3 2 bigger aggregates drove better nitrogen removal performance the overall nitrogen performance was shown in fig 2 r1 and r2 showed negligible differences in the capability of nitrate removal the average effluent nitrate concentration was 2 24 mg l and 2 29 mg l respectively correspondingly a very close nitrate removal efficiency of 88 64 and 88 41 was presented as to nh4 n removal efficiency the different capability was notable the average nh4 n removal efficiency was 83 38 for r1 but 92 09 for r2 to further investigate the difference in nitrogen removal a whole period reaction was monitored to find the cyclic nitrogen conversion of the two reactors fig 3 which can be divided into 3 phases according to the main reaction conducted in the system in phase i 0 1 h anammox process almost did not happen in the absence of nitrite and denitritation was the main reaction nitrate was consumed promptly 4 69 mg l for r1 and 4 02 mg l for r2 along with the generation of sulfate at the speed of 27 11 mg l h and 18 90 mg l h a similar rate of nitrate reduction was presented phase ii where rapid anammox reaction conducted ended until the nitrite was depleted so the time frame for r1 was 1 5 h but in r2 the nitrite did not reach an undetectable level in the effluent until 7 h a longer detectable nitrite supply time in r2 was observed indicating that the nitrite produced by thiosulfate driven denitratation was exposed slower to the anaob in r2 than r1 the nh4 n removal rate of r2 1 43 mg l h was much faster than that of r1 1 01 mg l h indicating the higher anammox activity however nitrate removal rate decreased rapidly compared to phase i 0 22 mg l h for r1 while 0 11 mg l h for r2 which illustrated the slower thiosulfate driven denitratation reaction in this phase it was worth mentioning that the nitrate concentration had a slight increase in phase ii in both two reactors due to the anammox reaction in phase iii slow anammox happened along with the denitritation although there were no no2 n detected the nh4 n was still consumed at the speed of 0 37 mg l h r1 and 0 54 mg l h r2 this can be explained that the nitrite was consumed by anaob immediately after its small amount generation by denitratation similar to phase ii the nh4 n consuming rate was much higher in r2 than r1 more than 1 5 times previous studies evaluating the nitrogen and sulfur conversions in tdda systems observed consistent results on the reaction stage 8 15 the overall nitrogen removal performance of the reactor and the cyclic nitrogen conversion revealed that the reactor with larger aggregates r2 outperformed r1 in terms of nitrogen removal the fundamental cause for this was the difference in nh4 n removal capability r2 had a considerably better nh4 n removal capability and a longer nitrite supply time 3 3 bigger aggregates supplied nitrite to anaob more efficiently to investigate the underlying cause for the variation in nh4 n elimination three batch tests bt a bt b and bt c were conducted to determine the anammox activity denitratation activity and denitritation activity respectively fig 4 the nh4 n removal rate was 1 86 mg l h for r1 and 2 11 mg l h for r2 along with the rate of 2 25 mg l h and 2 66 mg l h in no2 n removal the stoichiometric ratio of the nh4 n removal rate to the no2 n removal rate was 1 21 r1 and 1 26 r2 which also proved the occurrence of anammox 56 57 although anammox activity differed to some extent the nh4 n removal rate did not vary as much as it did in the cyclic nitrogen conversion where the rates for nh4 n removal were 1 01 mg l h and 1 43 mg l h in phase ii respectively under sufficient nitrite supply two reactors showed a higher and much closer anammox ability this phenomenon demonstrated that the lack of no2 n was the primary factor limiting the anammox process in r1 the linear regression was built to model the anammox process in which both reactors showed a high r2 table s4 as shown in fig 4c the no3 n was reduced to no2 n rapidly within 0 5 and 0 75 h in r1 and r2 respectively the no3 n removal rate in r1 21 11 mg l h and r2 21 66 mg l h was comparable indicating similar denitratation activity the reduction rate of no3 n was substantially higher in phase ii in cyclic nitrogen conversion and the time period for denitratation was likewise shorter fig 4d shows the no2 n concentration variations in denitritation activity test bt c the process can also be divided into two phases in phase i 0 1 h r2 shows a lower no2 n removal rate of 1 42 mg l h than r1 3 47 mg l h indicating a weaker denitritation activity the sulfur intermediates formation was responsible for obvious turning on both no3 n and no2 n consumption rate in bt b and bt c 15 58 notably a higher rate of nitrite consumption in denitritation 3 47 mg l h over that in anammox 2 25 mg l h was shown in r1 however nitrite consumption rate in anammox 2 66 mg l h exceeded that in denitritation in r2 1 42 mg l h which indicated a strong denitritation ability in nitrite utilization in r1 above all r1 and r2 had similar anammox and denitratation activities but differed in denitritation activity illustrating that the better performance in ammonium and nitrogen removal of r2 was due to the availability of no2 n for anaob in bigger aggregates rather than higher anammox activity in the process r2 with bigger aggregates was weaker in denitritation which increased the availability of no2 n for anaob 59 resulting in more excellent nitrogen removal performance 60 nitrite consuming rate in denitritation bt c was faster than that in anammox bt a in r1 8 11 which reversed in r2 implying that the functional microorganism that drives denitritation or anammox might be distinct in the two reactors 3 4 functional microorganism related to nitrogen conversion to estimate the relative abundance and diversity of the sludge 16s rrna gene sequencing was used alpha diversity index analysis was performed on the retrieved otu the community richness diversity and evenness were estimated and analyzed in table s5 the shannon index and smithiwilson index of micro granular aggregates r2 4 303 and 0 513 were higher than those of floc aggregates r1 3 993 and 0 486 showing higher community diversity and evenness the enhanced community richness in the floc aggregates reactor r1 was demonstrated by the chao index and ace index the difference in the microbial community of the two reactors at the phylum level was displayed in fig s3 proteobacteria was the most prevalent phylum in both reactors 36 9 in r1 and 25 2 in r2 microbes able to carry sulfur autotrophic denitrification 61 were discovered in different types of alpha beta gamma and epsilon proteobacteria it was generally known that anaob was a clade of deeply branching planctomycetes 62 and the abundance of planctomycetes accounted for 10 3 in r2 while 16 8 in r1 reactor various studies have shown that members of chloroflexi were ubiquitous in anammox bioreactors 63 65 which accounted for 18 3 in r2 and 18 6 in r1 they could scavenge organic matter derived from anaob cells 66 while reinforcing the granular structure 54 fig 5 presented the microbial community at the genus level several no rank and unclassified genera sequences were matched by blastn table s6 otu2118 unclassified f hydrogenophilaceae had a 98 02 similarity to annwoodia aquaesulis a further investigation on otu2118 was conducted by constructing the phylogenetic tree fig 6 where the otu2118 was closely related to the annwoodia aquaesulis both results supported that otu2118 could be identified as annwoodia aquaesulis candidatus brocadia was the predominant anammox genus accounting for 8 7 in r1 and 2 4 in r2 fig 5 floc aggregates have promoted the proliferation of anaob due to its favorable micro environment and macro retention 26 which was accorded with this study candidatus brocadia has been found a higher relative abundance than other anammox genera in granules 22 due to its role as an r strategist low substrate affinity associated with relatively greater growth rate 67 68 identified of 9 genera in the sludge sample were capable of sulfur oxidizing denitrification namely annwoodia 69 thiobacillus 70 ignavibacterium 71 sulfurovum 72 sulfuricurvum 73 thiovirga 74 limnobacter 75 rhodanobacter 76 and sulfurifustis 77 annwoodia 43 norank f hydrogenophilaceae was the most dominant sob 24 6 and 6 8 in r1 and r2 respectively as for thiobacillus a common sulfur autotrophic denitrificans was 1 0 in r1 and 2 3 in r2 rhodanobacter may have mutualistic or symbiotic relationships with thiobacillus 78 and can also autotrophically denitrify under certain conditions 79 80 accounting for 4 6 and 2 8 respectively 3 5 annwoodia was the pivotal microorganism involved nitrite utilization to explore the critical microorganism involved in nitrite utilization the difference analysis among relative abundance of top 100 otu were conducted 81 fig 7 the abundance of otu 2118 annwoodia aquaesulis was significantly elevated in r1 24 6 than r2 6 8 whereas other sob and anaob were not significantly different annwoodia was reclassified in 2017 as a separate genus from thiobacillus 82 43 its cells are much shorter and thinner than those of thiobacillus which was one of the reasons for the smaller size of aggregates 83 84 moreover it cannot grow on nitrate but ammonium as the only nitrogen source 43 44 so it was not a common genus in sulfur autotrophic denitrification systems annwoodia does not produce tetrathionate or other polythionates during the oxidizing thiosulfate 43 82 demonstrating the sox pathway in use like annwoodia sulfurimonas oxidizes sulfur compounds via the sox pathway 85 and showed a similar ability to reduce nitrate and nitrite 41 due to the usage of only periplasmic nitrate reductase nap not cytoplasmic membrane bound nitrate reductase nar for denitratation 86 the nitrite produced can be further reduced to nitrous oxide via nir in the periplasm resulting in simultaneous denitratation and denitritation this is accorded with the less nitrite accumulation in cyclic nitrogen conversion and the higher rate of nitrite consumption in denitritation bt c over than that in anammox bt a leading to less nitrite available for anaob in r1 moreover evidence showed that thiobacillus were not metabolically active in denitritation 41 and were significantly enriched when nitrate was used as an electron acceptor 87 in conclusion thiobacillus was mainly active in nitrate reduction while annwoodia performed the following nitrite uptake in the tdda system overall we propose the mechanism of the tdda system based on the nitrogen removal performance batch test and microbial community analysis fig 8 in general denitratation nitrate to nitrite was mainly driven by thiobacillus and annwoodia both anammox and denitritation processes can utilize the nitrite produced by denitratation candidatus brocadia was the main functional anaob while annwoodia was the primary rival for nitrite to anaob in the multipartite community of tdda system which could further conduct denitrification by using nitrite and s2o3 2 or other reduced sulfur compounds generated by sob like s0 or polythionates different proportions of annwoodia in microbial communities result in a difference in nh4 n and tn removal efficiency between the two reactors because of the less presence of competitive nitrite hunter annwoodia in the microbial community anaob in bigger aggregates acquired more nitrite resulting in more harmonious microbial communities to support effective nitrogen removal 4 conclusion this study revealed several aspects underlying the nitrogen removal and microbial communities performing thiosulfate driven denitrification and anammox process in asbr the main conclusions were as follows the overall performance of 85 39 r1 and 90 05 r2 in total nitrogen removal were achieved in tdda system as well as the 83 38 r1 and 92 02 r2 in nh4 n removal efficiency and close removal efficiency in no3 n as 88 63 r1 and 88 41 r2 in treating low strength ammonium and nitrate contained wastewater demonstrating a better nitrogen removal performance was conducted by bigger aggregates similar anammox activity and denitration activity were presented by different sizes of aggregates with 1 86 mg l h for r1 and 2 11 mg l h for r2 in nh4 n removal rate 21 11 mg l h for r1 and 21 66 mg l h for r2 in no3 n removal rate but a higher denitritation activity was performed by smaller aggregates 3 47 mg l h in r1 compared to 1 42 mg l h in r2 indicating weaker denitritation and more efficient nitrite supply to anaob in bigger aggregates which result in better nitrite utilization annwoodia was the significantly different genera in r1 and r2 which was the primary rival for nitrite to anaob in tdda bigger aggregates with less relative abundance of annwoodia established more harmonious microbial communities to support effective nitrogen removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

were successfully cultivated in asbr reactor fig 1 illustrates the different appearances of sludge in two reactors the sludge in r2 owned the appearance of a spherical or elliptical shape and compact and dense structure as previously reported 26 the sludge in r2 had a pale yellow color while the sludge in r1 was dark red the sem of three dimensional network structure of extracellular polymeric substances eps which would be responsible for the structural and functional integrity of the aggregates 54 as well as the pore structure as the mass transfer channel 55 of granular sludge were shown in fig s2 r2 showed a better settling ability after granulation table s2 granular sludge in r2 has an average diameter of 0 554 mm table s3 recent studies about anammox granular sludge showed that micro granular sludge 0 2 1 mm led to a high mass transfer efficiency which drove a better performance in nitrogen removal 30 31 at the same time the diameter for r1 was 0 195 mm r1 had the mean diameter close to the low limit of the granular sludge size definition 0 2 mm this kind of sludge can be seen as the early form of the granular sludge namely floc aggregates which originated from flocculent sludge and was under a critical period for the initial granulation the average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 39 r1 and 90 05 r2 were achieved during 40 days operation fig 2 the morphology physicochemical properties of the sludge and the overall performance of the reactors indicated tdda aggregates were successfully cultivated in both asbr reactors 3 2 bigger aggregates drove better nitrogen removal performance the overall nitrogen performance was shown in fig 2 r1 and r2 showed negligible differences in the capability of nitrate removal the average effluent nitrate concentration was 2 24 mg l and 2 29 mg l respectively correspondingly a very close nitrate removal efficiency of 88 64 and 88 41 was presented as to nh4 n removal efficiency the different capability was notable the average nh4 n removal efficiency was 83 38 for r1 but 92 09 for r2 to further investigate the difference in nitrogen removal a whole period reaction was monitored to find the cyclic nitrogen conversion of the two reactors fig 3 which can be divided into 3 phases according to the main reaction conducted in the system in phase i 0 1 h anammox process almost did not happen in the absence of nitrite and denitritation was the main reaction nitrate was consumed promptly 4 69 mg l for r1 and 4 02 mg l for r2 along with the generation of sulfate at the speed of 27 11 mg l h and 18 90 mg l h a similar rate of nitrate reduction was presented phase ii where rapid anammox reaction conducted ended until the nitrite was depleted so the time frame for r1 was 1 5 h but in r2 the nitrite did not reach an undetectable level in the effluent until 7 h a longer detectable nitrite supply time in r2 was observed indicating that the nitrite produced by thiosulfate driven denitratation was exposed slower to the anaob in r2 than r1 the nh4 n removal rate of r2 1 43 mg l h was much faster than that of r1 1 01 mg l h indicating the higher anammox activity however nitrate removal rate decreased rapidly compared to phase i 0 22 mg l h for r1 while 0 11 mg l h for r2 which illustrated the slower thiosulfate driven denitratation reaction in this phase it was worth mentioning that the nitrate concentration had a slight increase in phase ii in both two reactors due to the anammox reaction in phase iii slow anammox happened along with the denitritation although there were no no2 n detected the nh4 n was still consumed at the speed of 0 37 mg l h r1 and 0 54 mg l h r2 this can be explained that the nitrite was consumed by anaob immediately after its small amount generation by denitratation similar to phase ii the nh4 n consuming rate was much higher in r2 than r1 more than 1 5 times previous studies evaluating the nitrogen and sulfur conversions in tdda systems observed consistent results on the reaction stage 8 15 the overall nitrogen removal performance of the reactor and the cyclic nitrogen conversion revealed that the reactor with larger aggregates r2 outperformed r1 in terms of nitrogen removal the fundamental cause for this was the difference in nh4 n removal capability r2 had a considerably better nh4 n removal capability and a longer nitrite supply time 3 3 bigger aggregates supplied nitrite to anaob more efficiently to investigate the underlying cause for the variation in nh4 n elimination three batch tests bt a bt b and bt c were conducted to determine the anammox activity denitratation activity and denitritation activity respectively fig 4 the nh4 n removal rate was 1 86 mg l h for r1 and 2 11 mg l h for r2 along with the rate of 2 25 mg l h and 2 66 mg l h in no2 n removal the stoichiometric ratio of the nh4 n removal rate to the no2 n removal rate was 1 21 r1 and 1 26 r2 which also proved the occurrence of anammox 56 57 although anammox activity differed to some extent the nh4 n removal rate did not vary as much as it did in the cyclic nitrogen conversion where the rates for nh4 n removal were 1 01 mg l h and 1 43 mg l h in phase ii respectively under sufficient nitrite supply two reactors showed a higher and much closer anammox ability this phenomenon demonstrated that the lack of no2 n was the primary factor limiting the anammox process in r1 the linear regression was built to model the anammox process in which both reactors showed a high r2 table s4 as shown in fig 4c the no3 n was reduced to no2 n rapidly within 0 5 and 0 75 h in r1 and r2 respectively the no3 n removal rate in r1 21 11 mg l h and r2 21 66 mg l h was comparable indicating similar denitratation activity the reduction rate of no3 n was substantially higher in phase ii in cyclic nitrogen conversion and the time period for denitratation was likewise shorter fig 4d shows the no2 n concentration variations in denitritation activity test bt c the process can also be divided into two phases in phase i 0 1 h r2 shows a lower no2 n removal rate of 1 42 mg l h than r1 3 47 mg l h indicating a weaker denitritation activity the sulfur intermediates formation was responsible for obvious turning on both no3 n and no2 n consumption rate in bt b and bt c 15 58 notably a higher rate of nitrite consumption in denitritation 3 47 mg l h over that in anammox 2 25 mg l h was shown in r1 however nitrite consumption rate in anammox 2 66 mg l h exceeded that in denitritation in r2 1 42 mg l h which indicated a strong denitritation ability in nitrite utilization in r1 above all r1 and r2 had similar anammox and denitratation activities but differed in denitritation activity illustrating that the better performance in ammonium and nitrogen removal of r2 was due to the availability of no2 n for anaob in bigger aggregates rather than higher anammox activity in the process r2 with bigger aggregates was weaker in denitritation which increased the availability of no2 n for anaob 59 resulting in more excellent nitrogen removal performance 60 nitrite consuming rate in denitritation bt c was faster than that in anammox bt a in r1 8 11 which reversed in r2 implying that the functional microorganism that drives denitritation or anammox might be distinct in the two reactors 3 4 functional microorganism related to nitrogen conversion to estimate the relative abundance and diversity of the sludge 16s rrna gene sequencing was used alpha diversity index analysis was performed on the retrieved otu the community richness diversity and evenness were estimated and analyzed in table s5 the shannon index and smithiwilson index of micro granular aggregates r2 4 303 and 0 513 were higher than those of floc aggregates r1 3 993 and 0 486 showing higher community diversity and evenness the enhanced community richness in the floc aggregates reactor r1 was demonstrated by the chao index and ace index the difference in the microbial community of the two reactors at the phylum level was displayed in fig s3 proteobacteria was the most prevalent phylum in both reactors 36 9 in r1 and 25 2 in r2 microbes able to carry sulfur autotrophic denitrification 61 were discovered in different types of alpha beta gamma and epsilon proteobacteria it was generally known that anaob was a clade of deeply branching planctomycetes 62 and the abundance of planctomycetes accounted for 10 3 in r2 while 16 8 in r1 reactor various studies have shown that members of chloroflexi were ubiquitous in anammox bioreactors 63 65 which accounted for 18 3 in r2 and 18 6 in r1 they could scavenge organic matter derived from anaob cells 66 while reinforcing the granular structure 54 fig 5 presented the microbial community at the genus level several no rank and unclassified genera sequences were matched by blastn table s6 otu2118 unclassified f hydrogenophilaceae had a 98 02 similarity to annwoodia aquaesulis a further investigation on otu2118 was conducted by constructing the phylogenetic tree fig 6 where the otu2118 was closely related to the annwoodia aquaesulis both results supported that otu2118 could be identified as annwoodia aquaesulis candidatus brocadia was the predominant anammox genus accounting for 8 7 in r1 and 2 4 in r2 fig 5 floc aggregates have promoted the proliferation of anaob due to its favorable micro environment and macro retention 26 which was accorded with this study candidatus brocadia has been found a higher relative abundance than other anammox genera in granules 22 due to its role as an r strategist low substrate affinity associated with relatively greater growth rate 67 68 identified of 9 genera in the sludge sample were capable of sulfur oxidizing denitrification namely annwoodia 69 thiobacillus 70 ignavibacterium 71 sulfurovum 72 sulfuricurvum 73 thiovirga 74 limnobacter 75 rhodanobacter 76 and sulfurifustis 77 annwoodia 43 norank f hydrogenophilaceae was the most dominant sob 24 6 and 6 8 in r1 and r2 respectively as for thiobacillus a common sulfur autotrophic denitrificans was 1 0 in r1 and 2 3 in r2 rhodanobacter may have mutualistic or symbiotic relationships with thiobacillus 78 and can also autotrophically denitrify under certain conditions 79 80 accounting for 4 6 and 2 8 respectively 3 5 annwoodia was the pivotal microorganism involved nitrite utilization to explore the critical microorganism involved in nitrite utilization the difference analysis among relative abundance of top 100 otu were conducted 81 fig 7 the abundance of otu 2118 annwoodia aquaesulis was significantly elevated in r1 24 6 than r2 6 8 whereas other sob and anaob were not significantly different annwoodia was reclassified in 2017 as a separate genus from thiobacillus 82 43 its cells are much shorter and thinner than those of thiobacillus which was one of the reasons for the smaller size of aggregates 83 84 moreover it cannot grow on nitrate but ammonium as the only nitrogen source 43 44 so it was not a common genus in sulfur autotrophic denitrification systems annwoodia does not produce tetrathionate or other polythionates during the oxidizing thiosulfate 43 82 demonstrating the sox pathway in use like annwoodia sulfurimonas oxidizes sulfur compounds via the sox pathway 85 and showed a similar ability to reduce nitrate and nitrite 41 due to the usage of only periplasmic nitrate reductase nap not cytoplasmic membrane bound nitrate reductase nar for denitratation 86 the nitrite produced can be further reduced to nitrous oxide via nir in the periplasm resulting in simultaneous denitratation and denitritation this is accorded with the less nitrite accumulation in cyclic nitrogen conversion and the higher rate of nitrite consumption in denitritation bt c over than that in anammox bt a leading to less nitrite available for anaob in r1 moreover evidence showed that thiobacillus were not metabolically active in denitritation 41 and were significantly enriched when nitrate was used as an electron acceptor 87 in conclusion thiobacillus was mainly active in nitrate reduction while annwoodia performed the following nitrite uptake in the tdda system overall we propose the mechanism of the tdda system based on the nitrogen removal performance batch test and microbial community analysis fig 8 in general denitratation nitrate to nitrite was mainly driven by thiobacillus and annwoodia both anammox and denitritation processes can utilize the nitrite produced by denitratation candidatus brocadia was the main functional anaob while annwoodia was the primary rival for nitrite to anaob in the multipartite community of tdda system which could further conduct denitrification by using nitrite and s2o3 2 or other reduced sulfur compounds generated by sob like s0 or polythionates different proportions of annwoodia in microbial communities result in a difference in nh4 n and tn removal efficiency between the two reactors because of the less presence of competitive nitrite hunter annwoodia in the microbial community anaob in bigger aggregates acquired more nitrite resulting in more harmonious microbial communities to support effective nitrogen removal 4 conclusion this study revealed several aspects underlying the nitrogen removal and microbial communities performing thiosulfate driven denitrification and anammox process in asbr the main conclusions were as follows the overall performance of 85 39 r1 and 90 05 r2 in total nitrogen removal were achieved in tdda system as well as the 83 38 r1 and 92 02 r2 in nh4 n removal efficiency and close removal efficiency in no3 n as 88 63 r1 and 88 41 r2 in treating low strength ammonium and nitrate contained wastewater demonstrating a better nitrogen removal performance was conducted by bigger aggregates similar anammox activity and denitration activity were presented by different sizes of aggregates with 1 86 mg l h for r1 and 2 11 mg l h for r2 in nh4 n removal rate 21 11 mg l h for r1 and 21 66 mg l h for r2 in no3 n removal rate but a higher denitritation activity was performed by smaller aggregates 3 47 mg l h in r1 compared to 1 42 mg l h in r2 indicating weaker denitritation and more efficient nitrite supply to anaob in bigger aggregates which result in better nitrite utilization annwoodia was the significantly different genera in r1 and r2 which was the primary rival for nitrite to anaob in tdda bigger aggregates with less relative abundance of annwoodia established more harmonious microbial communities to support effective nitrogen removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12991,groundwater arsenic contamination is a serious threat that has affected the health of 130 million people globally long term exposure to arsenic leads to arsenic poisoning i e arsenicosis therefore the development of new technology to reject arsenic from water has been increased polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polymer possesses outstanding properties mainly as thermal stability chemical and mechanical resistance boehmite a polymorphic aluminium oxide is an essential industrial mineral used as an adsorbent due to its ability to retain high surface area it has a positive charge and its surface renders it easy for compounds with negative charges to be attached by electrostatic attraction also the nanoparticles have a high isoelectric value high adsorption is expected on a higher isoelectric point value pvdf boehmite composite membrane was prepared using solvent casting method at room temperature the nanoparticles were added in al as w w ratio of 0 1 50 1 200 1 and 500 1 al as ratio of 200 1 has shown the best result in batch process and in static adsorption study 65 rejection of arsenate ion was achieved from 100 μg l arsenate solution in 1 h flux was calculated in a dead end filtration setup at 1 bar trans membrane pressure the water flux of the membranes was in the range of 62 to 270 l m2h keywords water treatment arsenic membrane filtration adsorption solvent casting method 1 introduction the water quality in the water rich region has been a growing concern throughout the world contamination of drinking water with arsenic is a severe threat that damages millions of people s health around 77 million people have been exposed to arsenic poisoning in bangladesh alone which is considered the most significant mass poisoning in human history the symptoms associated with arsenic as exposure are skin lesions arsenicosis cardiovascular diseases diabetes cancer in various tissues neurological impairment pulmonary effects and development of reproductive toxicity arsenic was one of the six world s worst contaminants in 2010 1 5 bangladesh india china and vietnam are working with unicef to counter the serious threat of arsenic poisoning and promote awareness about the usage of filtration technologies to treat arsenic contaminated water in south asian countries groundwater arsenic contamination is unaffordable for many people and is limited 1 various treatment methods have been adopted for arsenic removal from water that majorly includes membrane filtration adsorption oxidation ion exchange technologies and coagulation flocculation membrane based technology has been widely used in separation processes and has vast applications in wastewater treatment some of the advantages include low energy consumption continuous separation easy up scaling and can be combined with other processes like adsorption for better efficiency some drawbacks are also associated which include low selectivity and membrane lifetime 6 8 filtration combined with adsorption is beneficial and this combination has been the most widely used inexpensive and faster groundwater treatment technology the particulate forms of arsenic can be removed using ultrafiltration and microfiltration pore sizes are 0 01 0 1 0 1 1 μm respectively still these membranes are not of enough size to remove arsenic from water 7 9 10 the two common arsenic forms and oxidation states are arsenite 3 and arsenate 5 these forms can be removed by adsorption technology also membranes are considered a promising technology in water purification due to outstanding thermal stability high mechanical and chemical resistance pvdf and its copolymers are becoming increasingly popular in water purification 11 12 furthermore the pvdf modified membranes have been extensively researched for the elimination of contaminants such as copper ions 13 boron 14 volatile organic compounds 15 and natural organic matter 16 17 very few studies have been reported for arsenic removal with pvdf membranes a zirconium polyvinyl alcohol coated onto pvdf membrane was prepared which showed high arsenic removal efficiency rejection of 90 was achieved in 5 h 18 pvdf zirconia membranes were also developed to reject arsenic ions 19 the system can efficiently remove as v but is not efficient in removing as iii pvdf membrane has shown higher rejection for both as iii and as v in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 20 still the membrane morphology changed after the experiment which restricted the long term usage pvdf hollow fiber membrane prepared using dry wet spinning process has arsenic rejection of 70 in 6 h duration this membrane can reject only as v ions 21 when the polymer crystallizes at 70 c a polar β phase pvdf is formed from the initial α phase pvdf this β phase has the highest di polar moment per unit cell 8 10 30 cm compared to the non polar α phase and can aid the adsorption process 22 pvdf composite membrane was prepared by embedding uio 66 particles for arsenate ion removal from water the particles take 120 min to reach the adsorption equilibrium in the filtration study arsenate rejection was preliminarily governed by the adsorption phenomenon with a flux of 27 9 l m2 h 23 composite membrane of pvdf was fabricated using manganese iron oxide as filler the prepared membrane has shown both as iii and as v removal 68 of the arsenate ions were rejected from water 24 pvdf fmbo membrane was fabricated for arsenate removal from polluted water the adsorption capacity of 21 32 mg g was achieved in the ph range of 6 8 also the membrane could be regenerated using sodium hydroxide 25 metal hydroxides or oxides have widely been used for the adsorption of arsenic ions for instance aluminium oxides like gibbsite alumina and kaolinite have already been studied in the past criteria for selecting these metal oxides or hydroxides are based on isoelectric point phiep since high adsorption is exhibited by higher isoelectric point phiep value 26 27 aluminium hydroxide has been tested and has shown the dependence of arsenic adsorption 28 the phiep value for boehmite a polymorph of aluminium oxide is 9 1 given in literature 29 therefore it can be used for the adsorption of arsenic ions also boehmite is an essential industrial mineral used as an adsorbent due to its ability to retain high surface area of 448 m2 g 30 31 hence a high surface area is available for adsorption of arsenate ions previously studied prevalent arsenate adsorbents are iron impregnated tablet ceramic s a of 45 6 m2 g copper ii oxide nanoparticles s a of 52 11 m2 g fe3o4 nanoparticles s a of 179 m2 g and γ al2o3 spherical nanoparticles s a of 231 497 m2 g 23 some outstanding properties of boehmite include non toxicity high resistance against chemical cleaning agents high hardness good mechanical strength transparency and high abrasive and corrosion resistance 32 furthermore it has a positive charge and its surface renders it easy for compounds with negative charges to be attached by electrostatic attraction boehmite has been used in the past as an adsorbent in water treatment application concerning as v removal boehmite and alumina nanoparticles were prepared these nanoparticles were considered a potential material for as v removal with the desired properties for removing as v 33 chitosan boehmite desiccant composite was used in batch and fixed bed column adsorption experiments and the made composite can effectively remove heavy metal pb ii cd ii and hg ii from water at a ph of 7 34 boehmite was also used for the fluoride removal from aqueous solutions and the fluoride retention was highest between the ph values of 4 5 and 7 5 35 thus pvdf boehmite composite membrane will promote the removal of arsenic from water and the combination of filtration and adsorption is a promising strategy for the removal of contaminants present in water in the present work boehmite nanoparticles were synthesized and incorporated into pvdf polymer matrix to form a composite membrane using solvent casting method at room temperature the prepared membrane was then used in a dead end setup and filtration was studied for different adsorption

analysis ftir spectrum of boehmite nanoparticles is shown in figure 1 the peaks are well matched with the earlier works reported in the literature 39 41 the characteristic stretching peaks at 3235 3062 1290 824 712 cm 1 as shown by the ftir spectrum correspond to the boehmite polymorph of aluminium oxide peaks at 3235 cm 1 and 3062 cm 1 correspond to oh bonded to al the frequencies 1040 cm 1 and 1290 cm 1 correspond to the symmetrical bending vibrations of the ohoh bond and frequencies 824 cm 1and 712 cm 1 are related to alo vibration modes 3 1 2 xrd analysis in xrd the peaks at 2θ 14 36 28 10 38 26 49 04 correspond to the crystalline structure of boehmite fig 2 the crystalline peaks are consistent with the reported work in the literature 42 43 the crystal size of the boehmite nanoparticle is 18 02 nm at 2θ 14 34 as calculated using equation 2 3 1 3 dynamic light scattering dls zeta potential zeta potential ζ provides valuable information i e isoelectric point value phiep the adsorption of a particle onto the metal oxide surface can be easily understood by this parameter adsorption of arsenate ion is mainly dependent on the ph of the solution and isoelectric point is a valuable parameter for the adsorption phenomenon 44 theoretically the stability of the suspended particle increases at a higher zeta potential value and good stability is attained above 30 mv 45 fig 3 shows that with the increase in ph the stability of nanoparticles decreases a decrease in zeta potential was observed in the basic medium and the boehmite nanoparticles were negatively charged above ph 9 4 the phiep value of 9 4 for boehmite nanoparticles is in agreement with the value given in the literature 46 thus adsorption of arsenic ions on boehmite nanoparticles is possible in the acidic environment as they are negatively charged 3 1 4 sem image of the nanoparticles figure 4 represents the sem image of the boehmite nanoparticles the nanoparticles have a crystalline structure with 34 77 nm as longer dimension the unit cell has an orthorhombic structure 39 the cubic crystals in the sem image are very close to the orthorhombic structure 3 2 composite membrane properties 3 2 1 sem sem was used for the assessment of the pvdf boehmite composite membrane morphology figure 5 show that microstructure evolves within the membrane with the increase of nanoparticle content the bare pvdf membrane represents a homogeneous porous structure distributed along the matrix boehmite nanoparticles are well dispersed within the polymer matrix and a sponge like structure can be seen there was no agglomeration or aggregation of the nanoparticles has been observed onto the membrane the binary phase diagram helps in determining the crystallization at 70 c and the morphology of the membrane is attributed due to liquid liquid demixing rate 47 the formation of spherulite is a characteristic of pvdf 48 and the induced particulate morphology or the reduction in spherulite diameter is also discussed in literature 49 the decrease in the spherulitic size has resulted in the dense morphology of the membrane the pvdf crystalline structure is mainly dependent on solvent evaporation rate during solvent casting process the cross sectional image in fig 6 and the top view image fig 5 confirm the formation of a spherulitic or bubble structure at room temperature the rate of evaporation has not affected or influenced the β phase crystallinity in the membrane formed the structure gets reduced as the filler concentration is increased due to the rate of liquid liquid demixing in the phase diagram 50 3 2 2 viscosity of casting solution as we increase the filler content in the pvdf casting solution the viscosity η of the solution also increases significantly the bare membrane has shown 560 mpa s viscosity and it increases to 1020 mpa s for al as ratio of 500 1 al as polymer solution fig 7 the increase in viscosity has resulted in a change in the prepared membrane s structure and hence its performance 51 the increase in viscosity may be due to the relative amount of solvent reduction and therefore weakens the pvdf boehmite dmf solubility another reason may be that the anions displace fluorine atoms resulting in crosslinks as more crosslinks form the viscosity will also increase 51 3 2 3 ftir of composite membranes ftir curves with different nano filler content within the membrane are presented in fig 8 a polar β phase pvdf is formed when the solution crystallizes at 70 c 22 in pvdf membranes the ftir spectra show characteristic strong bands at 840 882 1181 1404 cm 1 and characteristic weak bands at 603 763 1071 1272 cm 1 the characteristic band at 840 cm 1 is electro active β phase and 763 cm 1 is α phase which is practically invisible as seen in fig 8 the band s intensity at 840 cm 1 increases with nano filler addition the band at 882 cm 1 shows cf stretching and 1404 cm 1 shows ch2 bending the weak band at 1272 cm 1 shows out of plane deformation of the cf bond 22 by applying equation 1 the β phase content in the membranes was calculated the β phase content for the bare membrane is 45 and the same for 500 1 al as ratio is 43 therefore all the prepared polymeric membranes crystalize in the polar β phase which can aid in adsorption phenomenon 3 2 4 dsc of composite membranes fig 9 depicts the dsc curve the bare membrane has a peak at around 170 c which corresponds to the melting temperature of the pvdf s crystalline phase with the addition of filler the melting temperature slightly shifts to a higher degree contributing to higher thermal stability the degree of crystallinity of the bare pvdf membrane determined according to eq 3 is about 62 which agrees with the value given previously in the literature 52 however a slight increase in the percentage of the degree of crystallinity can be seen for different concentrations ranging up to 62 to 66 confirming that boehmite nanoparticles act as nucleating agent for polymer crystallization and is ascribed as good dispersion 53 3 2 5 contact angle measurement the contact angle measurement of membranes with different boehmite contents is shown in fig 10 the contact angle of the bare membrane was found to be 84 01 and the angle increases with nanofiller addition and has displayed hydrophobic characteristics the difference in the maximum and minimum values of contact angles is small therefore a regular structure of the membrane is formed 3 2 6 afm afm measurements are the alternative to studying the hydrophobicity of the membranes higher surface roughness leads to the increase in hydrophobicity of the membranes fig 11 is given for the bare pvdf membrane and the composite membrane we can see that in fig 11 b the roughness root mean square of the composite membrane 15 7 nm is increased compared to the bare pvdf membrane 6 40 nm an increase in surface roughness will increase the contact area this leads to an increase of free energy of the solid liquid interface thus making the surface more hydrophobic 3 2 7 porosity measurements gurley precision instrument measures the time for 100 ml air to pass through the membrane under a pressure of 4 bar theoretically shorter time means represents higher membrane porosity the results of different compositions are tabulated in table 1 it can be seen that the permeation time decreases with the addition of filler this indicates that the porosity of the membrane increases with filler addition the bare membrane show 85 85 s 100 ml air and there is a drastic decrease in time with the 50 1 al as ratio membrane 3 2 8 mechanical properties the stress strain curve is obtained by compressing all samples to 25 of the thickness the compressive strength of the membrane after compressing was above 100 kpa and has been increased with filler addition as seen in fig 12 this shows that the membranes can withstand 1 bar trans membrane pressure fig 13 represents water flux versus trans membrane pressure of ultrapure water it is observed that the membrane flux also increases with increasing pressure the flux of the bare membrane is higher than that of the composite membrane also the hydrophobicity induced by the boehmite nanoparticles has resulted in a decrease in flux therefore the surface morphology of the membranes is responsible for the increase or decrease of water flux the flux increases linearly with higher transmembrane pressure and the slope corresponds to its permeability 62 and 270 l h m2 bar for al as ratio of 500 1 and 50 1 respectively the highest permeability was 1550 l h m2 bar for the bare membrane and it has the lowest contact angle of 84 3 3 arsenate ion removal study the rejection percent of the arsenate solution was determined using equation 4 by measuring the feed and permeate solution firstly the boehmite nanoparticles were dispersed in the arsenic solution of 100 ppb to calculate the adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles it was found that the boehmite nanoparticles can effectively adsorb arsenic ions in the batch process with a maximum rejection of 40 for al as ratio of 200 1 and almost negligible adsorption was observed for other al as ratios all composite membranes were tested for 2 min of adsorption time adsorption time is the time for which the membrane is in contact with arsenic solution in the dead end filtration setup membrane with better rejection was tested for a higher duration of time as shown in fig 14 after 2 min rejection of 2 to 5 was observed for all the membranes the bare pvdf membrane has shown about 5 rejection indicating the potential of the bare pvdf membrane to remove arsenate ions from water the 200 1 al as ratio membrane was tested for a longer time interval a 65 of rejection was achieved after 1 h of adsorption time the prepared arsenic solution of 100 ppb has a ph of 3 and the arsenate ions rejected from water are as v it is interesting to note here that the prepared membrane can reject arsenic within its permissible limit in just 1 h of duration in comparison the majority of the pvdf based membrane has shown rejection in 5 6 h zirconium pva coated onto pvdf membrane takes 5 h of filtration time to reject arsenic and pvdf hollow fiber membrane takes about 6 h 18 21 4 adsorption mechanism the naturally occurring arsenic compounds are as iii and as v arsenic is distributed in water at different

12991,groundwater arsenic contamination is a serious threat that has affected the health of 130 million people globally long term exposure to arsenic leads to arsenic poisoning i e arsenicosis therefore the development of new technology to reject arsenic from water has been increased polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polymer possesses outstanding properties mainly as thermal stability chemical and mechanical resistance boehmite a polymorphic aluminium oxide is an essential industrial mineral used as an adsorbent due to its ability to retain high surface area it has a positive charge and its surface renders it easy for compounds with negative charges to be attached by electrostatic attraction also the nanoparticles have a high isoelectric value high adsorption is expected on a higher isoelectric point value pvdf boehmite composite membrane was prepared using solvent casting method at room temperature the nanoparticles were added in al as w w ratio of 0 1 50 1 200 1 and 500 1 al as ratio of 200 1 has shown the best result in batch process and in static adsorption study 65 rejection of arsenate ion was achieved from 100 μg l arsenate solution in 1 h flux was calculated in a dead end filtration setup at 1 bar trans membrane pressure the water flux of the membranes was in the range of 62 to 270 l m2h keywords water treatment arsenic membrane filtration adsorption solvent casting method 1 introduction the water quality in the water rich region has been a growing concern throughout the world contamination of drinking water with arsenic is a severe threat that damages millions of people s health around 77 million people have been exposed to arsenic poisoning in bangladesh alone which is considered the most significant mass poisoning in human history the symptoms associated with arsenic as exposure are skin lesions arsenicosis cardiovascular diseases diabetes cancer in various tissues neurological impairment pulmonary effects and development of reproductive toxicity arsenic was one of the six world s worst contaminants in 2010 1 5 bangladesh india china and vietnam are working with unicef to counter the serious threat of arsenic poisoning and promote awareness about the usage of filtration technologies to treat arsenic contaminated water in south asian countries groundwater arsenic contamination is unaffordable for many people and is limited 1 various treatment methods have been adopted for arsenic removal from water that majorly includes membrane filtration adsorption oxidation ion exchange technologies and coagulation flocculation membrane based technology has been widely used in separation processes and has vast applications in wastewater treatment some of the advantages include low energy consumption continuous separation easy up scaling and can be combined with other processes like adsorption for better efficiency some drawbacks are also associated which include low selectivity and membrane lifetime 6 8 filtration combined with adsorption is beneficial and this combination has been the most widely used inexpensive and faster groundwater treatment technology the particulate forms of arsenic can be removed using ultrafiltration and microfiltration pore sizes are 0 01 0 1 0 1 1 μm respectively still these membranes are not of enough size to remove arsenic from water 7 9 10 the two common arsenic forms and oxidation states are arsenite 3 and arsenate 5 these forms can be removed by adsorption technology also membranes are considered a promising technology in water purification due to outstanding thermal stability high mechanical and chemical resistance pvdf and its copolymers are becoming increasingly popular in water purification 11 12 furthermore the pvdf modified membranes have been extensively researched for the elimination of contaminants such as copper ions 13 boron 14 volatile organic compounds 15 and natural organic matter 16 17 very few studies have been reported for arsenic removal with pvdf membranes a zirconium polyvinyl alcohol coated onto pvdf membrane was prepared which showed high arsenic removal efficiency rejection of 90 was achieved in 5 h 18 pvdf zirconia membranes were also developed to reject arsenic ions 19 the system can efficiently remove as v but is not efficient in removing as iii pvdf membrane has shown higher rejection for both as iii and as v in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 20 still the membrane morphology changed after the experiment which restricted the long term usage pvdf hollow fiber membrane prepared using dry wet spinning process has arsenic rejection of 70 in 6 h duration this membrane can reject only as v ions 21 when the polymer crystallizes at 70 c a polar β phase pvdf is formed from the initial α phase pvdf this β phase has the highest di polar moment per unit cell 8 10 30 cm compared to the non polar α phase and can aid the adsorption process 22 pvdf composite membrane was prepared by embedding uio 66 particles for arsenate ion removal from water the particles take 120 min to reach the adsorption equilibrium in the filtration study arsenate rejection was preliminarily governed by the adsorption phenomenon with a flux of 27 9 l m2 h 23 composite membrane of pvdf was fabricated using manganese iron oxide as filler the prepared membrane has shown both as iii and as v removal 68 of the arsenate ions were rejected from water 24 pvdf fmbo membrane was fabricated for arsenate removal from polluted water the adsorption capacity of 21 32 mg g was achieved in the ph range of 6 8 also the membrane could be regenerated using sodium hydroxide 25 metal hydroxides or oxides have widely been used for the adsorption of arsenic ions for instance aluminium oxides like gibbsite alumina and kaolinite have already been studied in the past criteria for selecting these metal oxides or hydroxides are based on isoelectric point phiep since high adsorption is exhibited by higher isoelectric point phiep value 26 27 aluminium hydroxide has been tested and has shown the dependence of arsenic adsorption 28 the phiep value for boehmite a polymorph of aluminium oxide is 9 1 given in literature 29 therefore it can be used for the adsorption of arsenic ions also boehmite is an essential industrial mineral used as an adsorbent due to its ability to retain high surface area of 448 m2 g 30 31 hence a high surface area is available for adsorption of arsenate ions previously studied prevalent arsenate adsorbents are iron impregnated tablet ceramic s a of 45 6 m2 g copper ii oxide nanoparticles s a of 52 11 m2 g fe3o4 nanoparticles s a of 179 m2 g and γ al2o3 spherical nanoparticles s a of 231 497 m2 g 23 some outstanding properties of boehmite include non toxicity high resistance against chemical cleaning agents high hardness good mechanical strength transparency and high abrasive and corrosion resistance 32 furthermore it has a positive charge and its surface renders it easy for compounds with negative charges to be attached by electrostatic attraction boehmite has been used in the past as an adsorbent in water treatment application concerning as v removal boehmite and alumina nanoparticles were prepared these nanoparticles were considered a potential material for as v removal with the desired properties for removing as v 33 chitosan boehmite desiccant composite was used in batch and fixed bed column adsorption experiments and the made composite can effectively remove heavy metal pb ii cd ii and hg ii from water at a ph of 7 34 boehmite was also used for the fluoride removal from aqueous solutions and the fluoride retention was highest between the ph values of 4 5 and 7 5 35 thus pvdf boehmite composite membrane will promote the removal of arsenic from water and the combination of filtration and adsorption is a promising strategy for the removal of contaminants present in water in the present work boehmite nanoparticles were synthesized and incorporated into pvdf polymer matrix to form a composite membrane using solvent casting method at room temperature the prepared membrane was then used in a dead end setup and filtration was studied for different adsorption

analysis ftir spectrum of boehmite nanoparticles is shown in figure 1 the peaks are well matched with the earlier works reported in the literature 39 41 the characteristic stretching peaks at 3235 3062 1290 824 712 cm 1 as shown by the ftir spectrum correspond to the boehmite polymorph of aluminium oxide peaks at 3235 cm 1 and 3062 cm 1 correspond to oh bonded to al the frequencies 1040 cm 1 and 1290 cm 1 correspond to the symmetrical bending vibrations of the ohoh bond and frequencies 824 cm 1and 712 cm 1 are related to alo vibration modes 3 1 2 xrd analysis in xrd the peaks at 2θ 14 36 28 10 38 26 49 04 correspond to the crystalline structure of boehmite fig 2 the crystalline peaks are consistent with the reported work in the literature 42 43 the crystal size of the boehmite nanoparticle is 18 02 nm at 2θ 14 34 as calculated using equation 2 3 1 3 dynamic light scattering dls zeta potential zeta potential ζ provides valuable information i e isoelectric point value phiep the adsorption of a particle onto the metal oxide surface can be easily understood by this parameter adsorption of arsenate ion is mainly dependent on the ph of the solution and isoelectric point is a valuable parameter for the adsorption phenomenon 44 theoretically the stability of the suspended particle increases at a higher zeta potential value and good stability is attained above 30 mv 45 fig 3 shows that with the increase in ph the stability of nanoparticles decreases a decrease in zeta potential was observed in the basic medium and the boehmite nanoparticles were negatively charged above ph 9 4 the phiep value of 9 4 for boehmite nanoparticles is in agreement with the value given in the literature 46 thus adsorption of arsenic ions on boehmite nanoparticles is possible in the acidic environment as they are negatively charged 3 1 4 sem image of the nanoparticles figure 4 represents the sem image of the boehmite nanoparticles the nanoparticles have a crystalline structure with 34 77 nm as longer dimension the unit cell has an orthorhombic structure 39 the cubic crystals in the sem image are very close to the orthorhombic structure 3 2 composite membrane properties 3 2 1 sem sem was used for the assessment of the pvdf boehmite composite membrane morphology figure 5 show that microstructure evolves within the membrane with the increase of nanoparticle content the bare pvdf membrane represents a homogeneous porous structure distributed along the matrix boehmite nanoparticles are well dispersed within the polymer matrix and a sponge like structure can be seen there was no agglomeration or aggregation of the nanoparticles has been observed onto the membrane the binary phase diagram helps in determining the crystallization at 70 c and the morphology of the membrane is attributed due to liquid liquid demixing rate 47 the formation of spherulite is a characteristic of pvdf 48 and the induced particulate morphology or the reduction in spherulite diameter is also discussed in literature 49 the decrease in the spherulitic size has resulted in the dense morphology of the membrane the pvdf crystalline structure is mainly dependent on solvent evaporation rate during solvent casting process the cross sectional image in fig 6 and the top view image fig 5 confirm the formation of a spherulitic or bubble structure at room temperature the rate of evaporation has not affected or influenced the β phase crystallinity in the membrane formed the structure gets reduced as the filler concentration is increased due to the rate of liquid liquid demixing in the phase diagram 50 3 2 2 viscosity of casting solution as we increase the filler content in the pvdf casting solution the viscosity η of the solution also increases significantly the bare membrane has shown 560 mpa s viscosity and it increases to 1020 mpa s for al as ratio of 500 1 al as polymer solution fig 7 the increase in viscosity has resulted in a change in the prepared membrane s structure and hence its performance 51 the increase in viscosity may be due to the relative amount of solvent reduction and therefore weakens the pvdf boehmite dmf solubility another reason may be that the anions displace fluorine atoms resulting in crosslinks as more crosslinks form the viscosity will also increase 51 3 2 3 ftir of composite membranes ftir curves with different nano filler content

the band s intensity at 840 cm 1 increases with nano filler addition the band at 882 cm 1 shows cf stretching and 1404 cm 1 shows ch2 bending the weak band at 1272 cm 1 shows out of plane deformation

societies will become increasingly challenging and seawater desalination as well as wastewater treatment appear as the two only viable options 1 2 19 40 3 138 in both scenarii membrane technologies will play a significant role to sustain water demand among the well developed membrane technologies for water treatment the membrane distillation md process is a non isothermal technology developed primarily towards seawater desalination the md process utilizes a hydrophobic membrane with a porous structure which acts on a vapor pressure difference generated across the membrane wall md technology offers advantages compared to classical membrane desalination technologies since operating at low working pressures 1 bar which prevents typical fouling scaling challenges 4 94 196 md also generally offers high selectivity with a theoretical 100 rejection for all non volatile solutes the low sensitivity to solutes concentration in the feed stream and the fact that the osmotic pressure of the solution does not affect separation support the application of md to concentrate brines up to the crystallization point however there are also some disadvantages which md processes suffer from including low productivity compared with ro pore wetting risk which is the most important bottleneck for md membranes highly energy intensive etc furthermore md processes suffer from the lack of specific membranes which enable the process to perform for a long term operation 5 107 124 6 56 84 7 105 273 md has lately been playing a promising role in providing sustainable cost effective and innovative wastewater treatment technology towards greener approaches in water process engineering challenging wastewater streams such as textile effluents oily wastewater food processing effluent industrial wastewaters and refinery or petrochemical wastewater samples were successfully treated using different md configurations 8 101 315 9 2283 2294 10 101 112 this special issue entitled membrane distillation for wastewater treatment vsi md for wwt was oriented towards perspectives on the applications of the md process in wastewater treatment fourteen original research and review papers have been accepted and published in this vsi on membrane materials development with antifouling and anti wetting properties for md based effluent treatment process modeling as well as process optimization and integration to enhance the overall performance and efficiency 2 development of md membrane materials for wastewater treatment the design of md membranes enabling low fouling propensity was evaluated for textile wastewaters treatment 11 102 317 through the development of a new mixed matrix membrane for dcmd based treatment of textile effluent in this work the authors used mil101 fe for impregnating of pvdf hfp membranes to dye removal industrial wastewater using the most suitable membrane 20 pvdf hfp 0 5 mil101 fe and the optimized operating parameters the predicted responses were permeate flux 6 75 l m 2 h 1 and dye rejection 98 14 tio2 nanoparticles were used for enhancing the membrane performance in dye wastewater treatment the new membrane was then used under taguchi optimized operating conditions obtained results revealed that nanoparticle incorporated membrane showed higher permeate flux than the unmodified membrane 12 102 610 anti wetting hollow fiber membranes were fabricated using pvdf polymer and silica sol the developed membrane was used for treatment of highly saline produced water using the dcmd process the obtained results revealed that the membrane could perform properly after 60 h continuous operation and the salt rejection remained over 99 while the permeate flux reduced only about 7 which is quite interesting 13 102 345 small molecular weight additives are also promising for fabricating md membranes enable to process high salinity wastewater pvdf hollow fiber membranes were fabricated with addition of small molecular weight additives for treating the hypersaline brine 100 000 mg l 1 via the dcmd process it was concluded that the fabricated membrane could perform promisingly when the highly saline solution is introduced to the md system 14 102 528 membrane distillation is also promising technology for resource recovery when it is integrated with the crystallization technique water and salts can be recovered simultaneously 15 102 393 specific membranes were fabricated for membrane distillation crystallization mdcr the results demonstrated improved porosity and hydrophobicity for the tio2 modified membrane with nanocomposite structure which resulted in higher permeate flux and better salt rejection using real tannery industry wastewater the optimized membrane showed 5 9 kg m 2 h 1 permeate flux and 99 97 salt rejection furthermore the crystallization of salts revealed cubic nacl crystals and monoclinic na2so4 crystals in the wastewater md can also be applied for simultaneous water and nutrient recovery the application of md process was comprehensively investigated for water and nutrients recovery from fish farm wastewater using a modified membrane with super hydrophobic properties water contact angle 153 3 and low contact angle hysteresis 8 4 the obtained results revealed a steady permeate flux with a slight reduction of 1 4 kg m 2 h 1 the authors discussed it was due to the low fouling tendency of the surface printed membrane the authors concluded that in feed concentration process except for ammonia 86 rejection of all selected inorganic substances is higher than 99 16 102 573 3 development of md processes for wastewater treatment the stepwise flux decline during the initial stages of md processes is really important to provide a deep understanding of the membrane performance membrane fouling for a dcmd based system was monitored 17 102 296 in real time using the in situ optical coherence tomography oct technology this innovative technique could investigate the effect of operating parameters including feed temperature flow rate in the feed channel and the dye concentration as a result the fouling phenomenon of the md membrane could be monitored non destructively in real time when textile wastewater is addressed to be treated using the md process the concentration of dye matters tolentino 18 102 611 the effect of dye concentration up to 3000 mg l 1 was investigated on the membrane fouling and the permeate flux of the dcmd process the obtained results revealed that increasing the dye concentration can seriously reduce the permeate flux higher scale factor was observed for the disperse dye and the dye concentration did not affect the color rejection furthermore the dye concentration influence is stronger to disperse dyes group than the reactive dyes group the effect of the dye on the performance of the commercial md membranes pvdf ptfe and pp for treatment of textile effluent was investigated 19 102 339 the obtained results highlighted the effect of different dyes on the lep value for various membranes for instance acid class of dyes presented very low lep values with a higher propensity to wetting while high lep values were observed for reactive and disperse dyes this means stable md operation could be achieved for treating reactive and disperse dye contaminated wastewater integration of membrane distillation with membrane bioreactor which is also known as the mdbr technology is a promising approach for wastewater treatment this hybrid process was used for treating the textile effluent cod 3000 mg l 1 results revealed that the anerobic mdbr system could attain almost 99 inorganic salt rejection irrespective of the operating temperatures 35 50 c and high initial permeate fluxes of 5 9 11 5 l m 2 h 1 the investigated process could remove almost 40 69 of cod and 43 74 of color respectively the overall md performance was in the range of 99 for cod as well as color 20 102 603 further to these a new approach in modeling of mass transport within a dcmd membrane was investigated it was comprehensively discussed that the equimolar diffusion assumption underestimates the permeate flux by up to 15 however the neglection of knudsen diffusion significantly overestimates the permeate flux more than 150 it was discussed that the fick s law could be safely used to estimate the transmembrane flux of water vapor molecules 21 102 460 4 perspectives fabricating novel membranes with antifouling and antiwetting properties as well as high permeate flux and complete contaminant rejection can help to develop the application of md processes for wastewater treatment especially challenging industrial effluents which are hard to be treated via the conventional technique incorporation of nanoparticles into the membrane structure can enhance these properties however the nanoparticle release into the environment after long term operation should be investigated as a potential risk md processes also need further development with emphasis on energy efficiency new configurations and module design towards higher energy efficiency lower temperature and concentration polarizations as well as utilizing new energy resources should be taken into consideration the md process can be integrated with renewable energy sources such as solar and geothermal energy and promisingly the waste thermal energy in the industry as well furthermore the md process can also enjoy the waste cooling energy in industries and natural cold environment for instance in canada north america and scandinavian countries where cold weather 5 c is available at least six months of a year furthermore standalone md processes have not had much luck in treating the wastewater streams this is due to the high fouling tendency and pore wetting risk of hydrophobic membranes when highly contaminated wastewater sample is introduced in the feed stream hybridization of md processes with other technologies is a promising strategy for enhancing the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment hybrid md processes can improve pollution and fouling scaling mitigation while recovery of water and valuable resources from an effluent stream can efficiently be achieved for instance md crystallization instead of water losses and evaporation in ponds can be integrated to ro system to efficiently recover valuable metals such as li and rb from ro brine and industrial wastewater this approach may also decrease the production cost for fresh water with recovering value added metals and ions nutrients and p recovery from urine and digested sludge can also be achieved by hybridizing md with the forward osmosis md fo process this approach is also practical for lowering the pore wetting risk and enhancing the process efficiency for phosphorus and ammonia recovery from effluent sources furthermore md can be integrated with the membrane bioreactor technology mbr which is also known as mdbr using this hybrid process can efficiently remove a wide range of contaminants recover water and energy recovery simultaneously with efficient wastewater treatment via a compact system furthermore energy recovery generation can be achieved by integration of md and reverse electrodialysis md red and pressure retarded osmosis md pro the emergence of niche applications for md in the wastewater treatment area as demonstrated in this vsi will further progress in selective resource recovery and process integration capabilities several start up companies such as memsift ltd condorchem or memsys provide key in hand scalable solutions outside from the classical water desalination area in the pharmaceutical and petro chemical processing and waste treatment streams supporting process intensification leading to lower finite waste and wastewater rejects towards a circular economy approach key challenges in the area however remain related to both the membrane materials development requiring surfaces ultra resistant to wetting and fouling as well as stronger chemistries to operate in non pure water conditions and to integration of md systems into a broader energy mix scheme whereby waste heat or waste electricity generated as surplus from renewables for instance are coupled to md pilots and units such approaches have the potential to enable md as a truly competitive technique of choice to support its application in water process engineering

12993,a few years ago the elimination of organic pollutants was given high priority due to their harmful impacts on humans animals and the environment semiconductor photocatalysis is one of the most important and promising techniques in the field of wastewater treatment for many reasons such as ease of handling good reproducibility simplicity high efficiency and cost friendliness in addition it is environmentally friendly non energy intensive nontoxic and green technology this review focuses on the recent progress in semiconductor heterojunctions such as type ii heterojunction p n heterojunction n n heterojunction z scheme heterojunction and s scheme and their application in the photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants like organic dyes pesticides phenol and phenolic compounds petroleum refinery wastewater pollutants antibiotics and pharmaceutical pollutants the environmental factors affecting photocatalytic degradation activity such as photocatalyst concentration pollutant concentration solution ph light intensity reaction temperature photolysis scavengers adsorption performance in dark control running cycles and type of semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction were thoroughly discussed helping to design an ideal photoreactor with high photocatalytic efficiency and a cost effective process finally we believe this review is necessary for future improvement in the photocatalysis process by optimizing different operation parameters and selecting a suitable heterojunction for photocatalytic degradation of industrial organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords semiconductor heterojunction photocatalytic degradation organic pollutants industrial wastewater treatment environmental factors 1 introduction a few years ago a vast number of organic pollutants such as pigments synthetic dyes surfactants solvents and fertilizers are discharged from many industries like cosmetics plastics food paint leather textiles etc which have a significant harmful effect on human health the aquatic system and microbes 1 3 these pollutants are responsible about many diseases like renal damage hypertension epilepsy alzheimer nausea vomiting carcinogenic and mutagenic impacts profuse sweating and mental confusion 4 5 furthermore these organic effluents have several effects on the received water body by changing its vital parameters like color unpleasant odor toxicity biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand 6 the coloration of wastewater can be formed in the aquatic system even in the presence of a low concentration of colored organic traces 7 the color must be removed before discharging because it has negative environmental effects such as affecting the ecosystem and obstructing the penetration of sunlight to plants and aquatic organisms resulting in decreased photosynthesis 8 9 organic dyes are the most common industrial pollutants that originate from several industries such as textiles paper and other industries resulting in significant environmental damage 10 many studies have reported that 10 12 of dyes such as thymol blue black t ebt methylene blue mb eriochrome red 120 caramine indigo red rose bengal victoria blue and rhodamine b are consumed in the textiles industries more than 20 of these utilized dyes are lost during processing and synthesis operations and discharged into water bodies 11 these dye polluted wastewater contain highly toxic and non biodegradable colored pigments that are destructive to living creatures 12 many conventional techniques such as coagulation incineration adsorption on solid phases filtration ozonation reverse osmosis and biological treatment have been applied to eliminate different organic pollutants from wastewater 13 therefore each of these techniques has its own disadvantages that limit their dependence 14 thus biological treatment results in a ghastly smell and needs prolonged treatment time the incineration process can produce toxic volatile products and the ozonation process is highly affected by the variation of temperature ph and salts 15 the physical methods transform one phase into another without eliminating the organic molecules 16 chemical methods require a large amount of chemical dosage and it is proven to be costly and produce a large amount of sludge 17 in this regard it is important to develop new technologies to protect human health and the environment semiconductor photocatalysis is one of the most important and promising techniques in the field of wastewater treatment for many reasons such as ease of handling good reproducibility simplicity high efficiency and cost friendliness 18 in addition it is environmentally friendly non energy intensive nontoxic and green technology by utilizing solar light to remove hazardous pollutants and control environmental pollution 19 20 the solar light can supply the power of approximately 100 mw cm2 and can provide 107 photons per square centimeter therefore the atom can receive 100 photons in 1 s 21 22 the photocatalysis process is an advanced oxidation process aop that relies on the in situ generation of different oxidizing species to completely mineralize the organic compounds into co2 and h2o 23 many semiconductors were investigated as efficient photocatalysts in previous studies such as tio2 zno srtio3 fe2o3 cds wo3 zns 24 in addition because of their optical and electrical properties lower costs chemical stability nontoxicity high activity and environmental friendliness tio2 and zno have received the most attention in the degradation of organic pollutants 25 in recent years nanophotocatalysts have been extensively studied due to their high physiochemical ability and possessing excellent surface area 26 the removal efficiency of these photocatalysts is significantly influenced by various parameters starting from the synthesis of the nanocatalyst to the operating conditions of the degradation of effluent 27 in recent years more studies have been developed on semiconductor applications in environmental issues but more new investigations are also needed to be reviewed and summarized in this review the photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants such as organic dyes pesticides phenol and phenolic compounds petroleum refinery wastewater pollutants pharmaceutical pollutants etc for previously published works was discussed in detail in addition it focused on the applications of different types of semiconductor semiconductor heterojunctions in organic degradation under uv visible and solar irradiation this paper provided viable information about the parameters affecting the photocatalytic degradation efficiency such as photocatalyst concentration pollutants concentration solution ph light intensity reaction temperature direct photolysis scavengers adsorption performance in dark control running cycles and type of semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction using various photocatalyst heterojunctions each parameter was explained separately to remove organic pollutants as a crucial coefficient of performance this study aims to identify approaches for accelerating the development of efficient photocatalysis processes 2 the principles of photocatalysis semiconductors are the most commonly employed photocatalysts which have free electron conduction bands with higher energy and a full electron valence band with a definite band gap as shown in fig s1 when the semiconductor absorbs the photon energy from a light source the associated electron e hole h pairs will be generated by migrating the electrons from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb eq 1 the superoxide radical anion o2 can be formed by reacting the dissolved oxygen electron acceptor with the excited electrons on the surface of a photocatalyst eq 2 28 29 according to eqs 3 and 4 the free hydroxyl radicals can be generated by reacting the h2o and oh molecules with photogenerated holes on the photocatalyst surface 30 in addition the free holes on the surface of photocatalysts can directly oxidize organic pollutants due to their oxidation potential of 2 80 v the powerful hydroxyl radicals can effectively degrade the organic contaminates which adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst forming h2o and co2 eq 5 31 1 photocatalyst hγ e cb h vb 2 e cb o 2 o 2 3 h vb oh oh 4 h vb h 2 o h oh 5 oh o 2 h 2 o 2 h vb organic pollutants co 2 h 2 o other products in the past decade semiconductor photocatalysts such as zno 32 tio2 33 srtio3 34 cdse 35 fe2o3 36 wo3 37 etc have been applied to degrade a large number of organic pollutants some desirable properties should be included in the ideal photocatalyst such as highly stable towards photocorrosion biological robustness high activity under solar light or visible light easy availability low cost and nontoxic 38 the photocatalytic activity can be assessed depending on some factors including catalytic reaction efficiency charge transfer efficiency and photon absorption efficiency in this regard the photocatalytic activity of several semiconductors can be abstracted due to many limitations such as narrow absorption in the visible light region large band gap energy low photogenerated carrier separation efficiency fast recombination rate and defects and impurities 13 39 40 therefore large bandgap 3 0 3 2 ev semiconductors like tio2 zno ag2wo4 etc exhibit lower absorption for light in the visible region where they can only harvest uv light resulting in increasing the treatment cost on the other hand photogenerated carriers should be transferred to the photocatalyst surface to support the photoreaction this process must be accomplished in 3 10 s before the recombination process between the electrons and holes occurs in addition some photocatalysts have good absorption properties but exhibit lower photocatalytic activity this is attributed to the defects and impurities in the photocatalyst structure which accelerate the photocarrier recombination rate 41 42 to overcome these limitations different approaches have been taken to enhance the photocatalytic performance by modifying the electronic and morphological properties these modifications include semiconductor heterojunctions 43 surface or dye sensitizers 44 metal deposition 45 adding quantum dots 46 combining with noble metals 47 and doping with foreign elements 48 these strategies can modulate the band gap energy and increase visible light absorption making the photocatalysis treatment more cost effective 49 the semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction s s heterojunction is one of the most effective technologies to increase the number of charges and inhibit electron hole recombination via the synergistic effect between the two semiconductors generating a high amount of ros and oxidizing the organic compounds fig s2 depicts the example of s s heterojunction between two semiconductors some studies were investigated to develop s s heterojunction can be summarized in table s1 47 56 3 degradation of different organic pollutants in this section organic contaminants like organic dyes pesticides phenol and phenolic compounds petroleum refinery wastewater pollutants and some other common industrial chemicals are discussed like heavy metals these organic contaminants are non biodegradable persistent toxic and recalcitrant their removal techniques fate occurrences and sources have been reviewed elsewhere 61 3 1 organic dyes organic dyes are derived from various industries such as textiles leather electroplating food processing pharmaceuticals tanneries and pulp and paper 13 23 organic dyes can be classified into various classes and groups according to their source structure and fiber type 62 the chemical structure and other properties of cationic and anionic dyes that consumed in the textile industry can be summarized in table s2 10 azo dyes are among the major dye classifications that are utilized in industrial applications in addition 50 of all dyes that are utilized in industries are azoic dyes 62 according to the chemical structure dyes are classified into anionic and cationic dyes the anionic dyes are categorized as phenol red pr alizarin red s ars rose bengal rb eosin y ey acid red 14 ar14 acid orange 7 ao7 and methylene orange mo all anionic dyes contain functional groups such as carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid 63 on the other hand the cationic dyes are classified as safranin o so rhodamine 6g rh6g crystal violet cv rhodamine b rhb malachite green mg and methylene blue mb in an aquatic solution all cationic dyes have the ability to dissociate into positively charged ions due to their cationic functional groups 64 thus the photocatalysts of hydrophilic surfaces can effectively interact with these functional groups which have high solubility in water synthetic dyes can have a variety of toxic and harmful effects on human health including respiratory tract irritation skin irritation carcinogenicity disruption of blood formation hemoglobin adducts reductive cleavage chromosomal damage and so on 65 in addition dyes hinder the penetration of sunlight through water which negatively affects aquatic plants thus it is important to remove these dyes to control environmental pollution 66 67 synthetic dyes proved difficult to degrade using conventional methods such as biological decomposition electrochemical oxidation reduction floatation flocculation adsorption and precipitation due to their extremely complex structures these technologies can not completely remove the dyes from wastewater 68 recently numerous researchers have reported complete dye removal by using heterogeneous photocatalysts the removal efficiency of dyes is significantly affected by the charge separation and the recombination rate of electron hole thus various strategies like doping and semiconductor heterojunction were applied to address these limitations 69 zha et al reported 97 degradation of methyl orang mo dye within 30 min under uv light irradiation using tio2 zno heterojunction the high photocatalytic activity is caused by the p n heterojunction between the two semiconductors n tio2 p zno in one system which reduces the rate of electron hole recombination 70 fig 1a in another study ag2o ag bivo4 exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity towards rhodamine b rhb and methylene blue mb compared with pure bivo4 and ag2o completely decolorized in 15 and 48 respectively the z scheme heterojunction between bivo4 and ag2o plays an active role in the acceleration of charge separation and reduces the effect of electron hole recombination as shown in fig 1b 71 additionally an important study was conducted by nguyen et al they reported fabrication of a znfe2o4 tio2 composite using a facile solvothermal method as a visible light response photocatalyst eight 8 w blb lamps as shown in fig 1c the n tio2 and p znfe2o4 were well combined forming a p n heterojunction which promotes the complete degradation of bpa dye in 30 min of visible light irradiation 72 other studies on dye degradation can be summarized in table 1 3 2 pesticides in recent years the demand for vegetables and crops has been increased by the increasing human population a million tons per year of pesticides like insecticides herbicides fungicides fumigants rodenticides organochlorine organophosphate and n methyl carbamate play a vital role in the protection of animals and plants from different types of diseases and pests 91 these pollutants possess many adverse effects on the nervous systems reproductive systems and organs it can also induce cancer and birth defects the widespread use of pesticides in the agricultural sector causes an increase in their mobility via the food chain and surface and groundwater supplies resulting in their bioaccumulation in human bodies thus the removal of pesticides from the contaminated medium is a challenging proposition 92 93 bhoi et al reported 95 degradation of alachlor by type ii cus bifeo3 heterojunction in 60 min under visible light irradiation after heterojunction between the two semiconductors the holes in the vb of bfo can transfer to that of cus while the electrons in the cb of cus can transfer to that of bfo fig 2a the holes in the vb of cus can directly oxidize the alachlor furthermore oh can be formed by splitting the h2o in the vb of cus and by activating h2o2 this result was supported by scavenger experiments 94 in another study 95 of diuron 10 ppm was degraded in 3 h under visible light source 150 w xe lamp the type cus bi2w2o9 heterojunction played a critical role in improving photocatalytic performance as shown in fig 2b the trapping test confirmed the important role of hydroxyl radicals and holes in the photoreaction 95 another type of pesticide lindane was removed using the bioi0 5br0 5 photocatalyst which was fabricated by the co precipitation method bioi biobr exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity against lindane under visible light irradiation where 98 of lindane was eliminated at ph 8 in this study the photocatalyst dose and ph were optimized to be 1 g l and 8 respectively 96 a few semiconductor heterojunctions for photocatalytic degradation of pesticides can be summarized in table 2 3 3 phenols and derivatives phenol c6h5oh is one type of volatile aromatic hydrocarbon with a white crystalline structure which is utilized in the production of dyes drugs like aspirin explosives like picric acid and the fabrication of plastics phenol and its derivatives such as p nitrophenol m nitrophenol o nitrophenol p chlorophenol m chlorophenol o chlorophenol are highly soluble in water 103 unfortunately acute inhalation or dermal exposure to these contaminants causes severe irritation to human eyes skin muscle fatigue breast cancer metabolic disorders and mucous membranes 104 nitrophenols are very toxic water pollutants that are discharged into the environment as a result of the production of azo dyes organo phosphorous pesticides and medical products chlorophenols are moderately hazardous water contaminants that are formed intermediately during the water disinfection and oxidation processes of some chlorinated organic compounds such as phenolic compounds and herbicides 105 yang et al developed a p n heterojunction photocatalyst p lafeo3 n ag3po4 for the photocatalytic degradation of phenol it was revealed that 95 of phenol was degraded under visible light irradiation this enhancement in removal efficiency caused by the formation of a high number of hydroxyl radicals which was improved by p n heterojunction as shown in fig 3a the oh can be formed by oxidizing oh to oh due to the conduction band of p lafeo3 having a higher positively potential redox ability 2 115 ev vs nhe than that of oh oh 1 99 ev vs nhe 106 in another study the bi2o3 bi4v2o11 composite was synthesized by a high temperature calcination method for phenol degradation 40 mg l under a visible light source 300 w xe lamp when compared to pure bi2o3 and bi4v2o11 the bi2o3 bi4v2o11 system demonstrated complete degradation performance after 30 min the synergistic effect between the two semiconductors is responsible for enhanced removal efficiency as shown in fig 3b the cb potential of bi4v2o11 is more negative 0 23 ev than that of o2 o2 0 04 ev thus o2 was readily formed by reducing adsorbed o2 the trapping studies proved that h and o2 have significant contributions in photoreaction 107 lam et al reported that 95 of resorcinol was degraded in 6 h under visible light irradiation fluorescent lamp by ag2o zno which was fabricated by the co precipitation method the heterojunction between ag2o loaded on zno exhibited excellent electron hole pair separation during the photoreaction 108 in addition 99 4 of 2 4 dichlorophenol was degraded in 50 min using a nanosized na2ti2o13 tio2 composite which was fabricated using hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate 109 in another study different organic pollutants p nitrophenol ciprofloxacin and diethyl phthalate were degraded via graphene quantum dots mn n tio2 g c3n4 composite gqds tcn the 5 gqds tcn 0 4 sample showed improved degradation activity under simulated solar irradiation the type ii heterojunction in fig 3c was responsible for this improved photocatalytic performance the morphology studies in fig 3d suggested the formation of cns as a thin layer precipitated on the surface of mn n tio2 nanoparticles forming gqds tcn 0 4 composite 110 other studies on phenols degradation can be summarized in table 3 3 4 petroleum refinery wastewater petroleum refineries generate a large amount of wastewater containing various types of aromatic and aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbons petroleum hydrocarbons such as xylene ethylbenzene toluene benzene nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds long chain hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and others have a wide range of hazardous and harmful effects such as destroying natural sights contaminating the atmosphere affecting human health reducing crop production contaminating surface and groundwater and having numerous toxic effects on aquatic life 121 122 conventional methods do not have the ability to eliminate the toxicity of aromatic compounds thus modern technologies are still required to degrade this pollutant as much as possible 123 sangkhun et al reported improved photocatalytic performance of w doped tio2 compared to tio2 p25 against btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene under visible light irradiation 18 w fluorescent lamp the kinetic studies showed that the reaction rate was 17 23 34 and 43 ppm g s for each of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene respectively 124 in another investigation a tio2 bearing coating was used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of btex the photocatalytic degradation rate can be arranged in the following order o xylene ethylbenzene toluene benzene as shown in fig 4a the photocatalytic degradation activity was significantly affected by humidity a notable reduction in removal efficiency was detected by increasing the humidity from 0 to 90 125 dahash et al studied the photocatalytic ability of the ni zno0 6s0 4 composite for cod removal in refinery wastewater under a visible light source led lamp it was revealed that 89 of cod was degraded in 180 min the synergistic effect of zns and zno species was critical in improving degradation ability the recyclability test showed a 10 reduction in cod removal after five running cycles fig 4b 126 khan et al applied tio2 zno and h2o2 in the treatment of real refinery wastewater the experimental results showed that tio2 was more effective compared with zno and h2o2 for real refinery wastewater treatment 127 in another study a visible light responsive photocatalyst tio2 fe zsm 5 was fabricated via the sol gel method and applied for the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater prww after 240 min 80 of cod was eliminated at a photocatalyst dose of 2 1 g l 128 addition degradation experiments applied to petroleum refinery wastewater can be summarized in table 4 3 5 antibiotics and pharmaceutical pollutants common antibiotics and medicines are utilized for human agricultural veterinary medicine and other purposes every year a huge number of antibiotics and drugs are consumed worldwide recently approximately a milligram per liter range of pharmaceutical traces have been detected in venous water resources such as drinking water surface water municipal wastewater and so on pharmaceutical pollutants exhibit unknown reactive properties that have different harmful impacts on human health aquatic life and the environment in particular some adverse effects like chronic toxicity endocrine disruption and antibiotic resistance can result from these pollutants even at low concentrations in addition these pollutants cannot be eliminated by conventional wastewater treatment plants as they are poorly absorbable and difficult to metabolize 133 136 chen et al used a bi2o3 bio 2co3 composite to perform photo degradation against ciprofloxacin cip under visible light irradiation in 30 min bi2o3 bio 2co3 demonstrated an improved cip decay efficiency of 93 4 137 in addition complete degradation of cip was achieved after 120 min using zno sns2 heterojunction the zno sns2 exhibited an excellent degradation rate which is 10 times greater than pure sns2 this enhancement is attributed to improving the visible light absorption after heterojunction between sns2 and zno nanoparticles fig 5a 138 in another investigation plasmonic p n heterojunction p type ag2s n type bi2moo6 showed high performance in the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride tc and levofloxacin lev the ag ag2s bi2moo6 exhibited 92 8 and 87 3 degradation efficiency under visible light source for each of tc and lev respectively as shown in fig 5b the photodegradation of lev was explained in four pathways according to the intermediate identification 139 in another work organic inorganic tcpp bi2moo6 type ii heterojunction was developed by wang et al using a simple impregnation method the experimental results revealed an 87 5 degradation efficiency of tc under a 300 w xenon lamp it was detected that the photodegradation rate was 1 15 folds greater than that of pristine bi2moo6 the interfacial interaction between bi2moo6 and tcpp showed a superior role in enhancing the degradation performance fig 5c the scavenger experiments confirmed the main roles of oh o2 and h in photoreaction 140 li et al reported s scheme heterojunction taon bi2moo6 in the core shell structure towards lev degradation it was found that 92 7 of lev was degraded in 75 min using a 300 w xe lamp as a visible light source the s scheme hetero structure provided excellent electron hole separation a high absorption rate and a lower recombination rate due to the synergistic effect between the two semiconductors fig 5d 141 furthermore 90 78 of tc was degraded by the nife2o4 bi2o3 composite which was fabricated using a microwave assisted method the well matching of band potential was responsible for enhancing the removal efficiency which allowed efficient charge separation 142 in other work ag agcl ag2o heterostructures was fabricated using facile in situ growth strategy for degradation of ciprofloxacin the morphology studies fig 5e showed that the inner ag2o can be efficiently protected by the stable ag agcl nano shells against photocorrosion this heterostructure can enhance the transfer efficiency and the separation of photo induced electron hole pairs 143 other studies of semiconductor heterojunctions towards pharmaceutical pollutants degradation can be illustrated in table 5 4 factors affecting the photocatalytic degradation performance in this section different environmental factors like photocatalyst dosage initial pollutant concentration temperature solution ph scavenging agents light intensity anions and dopant content were investigated and summarized in practice it is necessary to have knowledge of these parameters to design an ideal photoreactor with high photocatalytic efficiency and a cost effective process 4 1 effect of photocatalyst concentration the photocatalyst concentration is known as the most important parameter affecting the photocatalytic activity it is important to optimize the amount of the photocatalyst during the photocatalytic process to avoid any additional dosage for the economic feasibility of photoreaction it should have a maximum efficiency with minimal photocatalyst concentration 91 when the amount of photocatalyst is increased the photocatalytic activity also increases this is due to the increase in the number of active sites on the photocatalyst surface thus a high number of hydroxyl radicals and other ros will be generated which is responsible for the actual destruction of organic pollutants 154 in contrast the photocatalytic degradation activity will be limited by using an excessive amount of photocatalyst resulting in a cloudy condition inside the reactor which reduces the light penetration through the solution 155 sun et al 156 reported that the increase in photocatalyst dose above the optimum value would reduce the degradation efficiency by increasing the aggregation effect of nanoparticles and reducing the photoactive surface area riga et al reported that the amount of adsorbed dye normally increases by an increase in the photocatalyst loading rate tio2 157 fig 6 depicts the photocatalyst effects on the photocatalytic degradation performance using different heterogenous nanocomposites photocatalysts fig 6a illustrates the photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization ods in the gasoline fuel by using different concentrations 0 5 to 1 5 g l of fe3o4 sio2 pt simo12 photocatalyst in the core shell structure 132 adeel et al investigated the effect of the percentage of co zno composites on the photocatalytic degradation of mo dye the experimental results in fig 6b showed that 10 co zno is the optimum photocatalyst with a degradation efficiency of 93 158 z h jabbar and s e ebrahim 159 showed that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency against mb dye was increased from 75 to 88 by increasing the sio2 fe3o4 ag2wo4 dose from 0 5 to 1 g l after 45 min of illumination time this is attributed to the increase in the formation of photogenerated electron hole pairs fig 6c another investigation was conducted by 160 using several concentrations of cfa znfe2o4 coal fly ash based zinc ferrite composite 20 200 mg l as a photocatalyst towards mb dye they discovered that increasing the photocatalyst concentration above 110 mg l reduces removal activity due to photocatalyst agglomeration and the release of fe ii ions that scavenge the produced hydroxyl radicals fig 3d other studies that explain the effect of photocatalyst dose on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants can be summarized in table 6 4 2 effect of pollutant concentration pollutant concentration is another important factor that can influence the photocatalytic degradation activity of hazardous chemicals and dyes the concentration of organic pollutants for most photocatalytic degradation studies was selected in the range of 10 200 ppm to simulate the discharged organic compounds concentrations of real industrial wastewater 33 the photocatalytic degradation performance against colored chemicals like dyes increases as their concentration increases but after reaching a critical concentration level it begins to decrease this is attributed to the fact that the dye molecules will screen the irradiated uv visible light before reaching the photocatalyst surface 167 b liu et al 168 reported that the photocatalytic degradation activity of ps g c3n4 nanosheets was decreased by increasing the bisphenol a bpa concentration from 5 mg l 100 to 20 mg l 70 this is due to bpa molecules competing for active sites on the ps g c3n4 nanosheets surface resulting in a reduction in photocatalytic degradation performance the same observation was reported by 169 when flower like mgo was used as a photocatalyst to oxidize the methylene blue dye mb under uv light irradiation it was detected that the mb degradation efficiency was 99 at an initial mb concentration of 100 mg l and an irradiation time of 24 24 min this degradation efficiency was sharply reduced to 18 74 in 315 07 min of irradiation time by using 500 mg l mb concentration fig 7a another study was developed by saffari et al fig 7b which exhibited an inverse relationship between the degradation rate and rhodamine b rhb concentration this is attributed to the enhancement of the adsorption activity by excessive rhb concentration resulting in a blocking effect of surface pores which leads to a reduction in the number of absorbed photons by the p zno1 8 photocatalyst 163 the reduction in the degradation rate could also be due to a lack of sufficient active species oh o2 h2o2 hvb which are necessary to react with the excessive contaminant concentration this result was observed by siboni et al fig 7c by using cu doped zno nanorods as a photocatalyst for insecticide diazinon degradation they found that the removal efficiency was reduced from 99 96 to 21 9 by increasing the diazinon concentration from 10 to 50 mg l 164 chu et al 165 studied the effect of the initial bpa concentration 5 30 mg l on the degradation activity of bpa using a constant dosage of bi2o3 sno2 photocatalyst under solar light irradiation photocatalytic faster degradation rates were exhibited in shorter times at lower initial concentrations of 5 mg l fig 8d this is attributed to the high rate of light penetration which results in the generation of a sufficient number of active species at a low contaminant concentration other studies showing the effect of initial contaminant concentration on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants can be summarized in table 7 4 3 effect of ph solution ph is one of the most investigated parameters that affecting the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants by different heterogenous photocatalysts since the photocatalytic reaction mixture is immensely sensitive to the ph furthermore it is necessary to examine the ph effect on the photocatalytic reaction due to the variability of ph in industrial wastewater 177 the solution ph can influence the catalytic performance by affecting the photocatalyst surface properties the decomposition of oxidants persulfates o3 h2o2 and the target contaminants structure therefore the ph of the reaction affects the photocatalytic reaction by controlling the surface charge of the photocatalyst and the contaminant and hence affects the adsorption of the pollutants on the surface of the photocatalyst 167 178 to study the effect of ph on the photocatalyst surface charge one should measure the point of zero charge phpzc for the photocatalyst thus the photocatalyst carries a positive charge at a ph value less than phpzc and a negative charge at a ph value greater than phpzc 179 yuan et al 180 studied the effect of ph on the catalytic ozonation performance of zvz g c3n4 zero valent zinc immobilized g c3n4 in atrazine atz degradation fig 8a the phpzc of the zvz g c3n4 catalyst was determined to be 5 96 the zvz g c3n4 catalyst showed improved atz degradation performance at ph values ranging from 7 0 to 9 0 because the zvz g c3n4 catalyst carries a negative charge and the reaction of o3 is more likely at a negatively charged condition another contribution was developed by li et al fig 8b by using feco2s4 g c3n4 as a catalyst in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx because the phpzc value of feco2s4 g c3n4 is 5 9 the surface charge is positive at ph values of 3 5 to 5 0 and negative at ph values of 6 5 to 9 5 the perforable degradation was detected at an initial ph value of 3 5 to 5 0 since the smx existed as an anionic species at a high ph range improving the adsorption between the smx and feco2s4 g c3n4 and promoting the degradation performance 181 saffari et al discovered that the p zno1 8 photocatalyst has higher degradation activity at alkaline conditions in the photocatalytic degradation of rhb under visible light irradiation 163 wang et al investigated the degradation activity of the graphene tio2 nanotube array gr tna in different ph solutions of dibutyl phthalate dbp fig 8c the gr tna revealed maximum degradation performance at a ph value of 11 5 this outcome is attributed to the production of oh under basic conditions in addition the phpzc of gr tna is 4 2 so the highest dbp adsorption was achieved at ph 11 5 182 z h jabbar et al explained the effect of ph on the photocatalytic ability of fe3o4 sio2 ag2wo4 ag2s in mb dye degradation under a visible source fig 8d they found that the degradation activity was increased from 95 to 100 by increasing the ph from 7 to 11 this is due to the formation of hydroxide ions at high ph conditions which react with photogenerated holes forming a high number of hydroxyl radicals 183 on the other hand the ph of the solution can influence the decomposition of oxidants in an alkali solution the h2o2 is likely to decompose into o2 and h2o resulting in a weak oxidation at a high ph value 184 furthermore the degradation of organic pollutants by o3 alone is unsatisfactory under acidic conditions however the o3 oxidant can react with the abundant oh to form oh which accelerates the degradation of organic contaminants 185 many studies investigating the effect of the solution ph on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants are reviewed in table 8 4 4 effect of light the photocatalytic kinetics and the quantum efficiency are highly influenced by the duration of light irradiation wavelength and light intensity 194 when the photon energy is absorbed by the photocatalyst the electrons in the vb are excited to cb forming electron hole pairs 195 196 the rate of photocatalytic degradation can be increased by increasing the intensity enhancing the probability of photocatalyst excitation 197 electron hole pair recombination is an experienced problem in the photocatalysis process at lower light intensity the photodegradation activity of organic molecules will be hindered by increasing the recombination rate and decreasing electron hole pair separation resulting in lower photogeneration of free radicals 198 to achieve acceptable degradation performance the photocatalyst should be able to absorb the full visible spectrum some commonly used photocatalysts like sno2 zno tio2 ag2wo4 etc have a wide band gap energy eg 3 0 ev which are effective only in the absorption of light in the uv region and can absorb only 5 of the visible spectrum at a wavelength λ of 388 nm 199 in recent years researchers have focused on utilizing visible light to achieve low cost treatment unfortunately most applied photocatalysts with a wide band gap energy are incapable of harvesting both infrared and visible light which comprise 43 and 52 of visible light 200 in contrast some photocatalysts such as agalo2 bioi bivo4 bi2wo6 ag2s etc showed excellent photocatalytic performance under visible light 201 thus the band gap energy should be modified to exploit the maximum benefit of photocatalysis 202 bhatia et al reported the impact of light intensity varying from 250 to 1000 w on the photocatalytic degradation of atenolol atl using graphene oxide tio2 tio2 g as visible light harvesting photocatalysts fig 9a it was revealed that the photocatalytic degradation activity was increased by increasing the light intensity due to an increase in the absorbed photons per unit area of the photocatalyst 203 another mechanism can contribute to enhance the catalytic activity by photothermal process fig 9b when the photocatalyst absorb the visible and infrared light the localized heating will be formed inducing the photothermal assisted photocatalysis 204 205 ollis et al 206 exhibited a linear relationship first order between the low light intensities 0 20 mw cm2 and the degradation rate the experimental results showed half order reaction was achieved at intermediate light intensities 25 mw cm2 at higher intensities no enhancement in degradation rate was detected with increasing light intensity as shown in fig 9c a kumar et al investigated the photocatalytic activity of the n tio2 sio2 fe3o4 photocatalyst in two different visible light sources light emitting diodes leds and compact fluorescent lamps cfls after 5 h of irradiation the cfls exhibited better photocatalytic performance of 94 compared with leds of 80 in the degradation of ibuprofen ibu with the presence of n tio2 sio2 fe3o4 as visible light response photocatalyst this result is attributed to the fact that cfls have peak emissive wavelengths in the green light spectrum of 400 460 nm compared with leds which have a violet light spectrum of 400 460 nm 207 another investigation was conducted by n nadeem et al 160 by degrading mb dye at three different light sources white leds sunlight and uv 254 nm in the presence of a cfa znfe2o4 photocatalyst the photocatalysis process by uv light 144 w and 254 nm showed maximum degradation performance against mb dye due to its short wavelength that has high photon energy n jallouli et al studied the effect of the number of led lumps on the photocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen ibu using 1 0 g l of tio2 as a photocatalyst fig 9d it was observed that the ibu photocatalytic degradation rate increased with the increase in the number of led lumps this is attributed to increasing the light intensity by increasing the leds which leads to generating high numbers of hydroxyl radicals improving the degradation activity 187 table 9 summarizes other studies that were conducted to explain the effect of light on the photocatalytic destruction of organic pollutants 4 5 effect of reaction temperature the photocatalytic degradation activity of organic pollutants is positively related to raising the reaction temperature the increase in reaction temperature stimulates the generation of reactive radicals caused by the formation of bubbles during the photoreaction process resulting in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity 3 furthermore an increment in reaction temperature can improve the degradation rate by reducing the recombination rate of electron hole pairs also a significant degradation rate can be achieved at the interface 216 tong et al studied the effect of temperature 10 to 40 c on the photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline dox in the presence of 50 mg of bivo4 h2o2 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 10a the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was increased from 76 93 to 97 03 by increasing the reaction temperature from 10 to 40 c this improvement could be attributed to the generation of more oh radicals by raising the reaction temperature 217 noticeable enhancement in the degradation activity of tio2 with increasing the reaction temperature was reported by mozia et al during the photocatalytic degradation of acid red 18 218 by using a 5cu zno catalyst mendoza et al proved the positive effect of temperature on the degradation activity of mb and mo dyes at 45 c the experimental results showed 99 of mo and mb were degraded after 75 and 15 min respectively this is due to a higher concentration of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the 5cu zno catalyst 219 karimi et al reported the photocatalytic degradation activity of nano strontium titanate against reactive orange 72 in different temperatures ranging from 30 c to 50 c fig 10b the degradation rate was increased by increasing the temperature due to the increase in the oxidation rate at the interface 25 another investigation was conducted by ammar et al through oxidative desulfurization ods from real gasoil fuels in three different reaction temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c using 1 g l of fe0 pedot pw12 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation the fe0 pedot pw12 photocatalyst exhibited a maximum desulfurization efficiency of 98 4 at 35 c as shown in fig 10c no significant impact on photocatalytic performance was revealed by increasing the reaction temperature to 45 c this may be caused by the decomposition of added h2o2 which leads to a reduction in the generation of polyoxo peroxo species at high temperatures 162 adeel et al examined the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of methyl orange dye mo 100 mg l by 0 05 g of 10 co zno 50 ml photocatalyst at three reaction temperatures of 30 40 and 50 c the mo degradation performance was significantly improved with an increase in temperature deep investigation was conducted using the eyring equation eq 7 and the arrhenius equation eq 6 the entropy δs and enthalpy δh were estimated to be 241 1 j mol and 12 5 kj mol respectively based on the eyring plot while the activation energy e was estimated to be 15 1 kj mol based on the arrhenius plot fig 10d in addition the free reaction energy δg was estimated to be 62 9 kj mol this research found that increasing the reaction temperature can accelerate the molecular diffusion of the mo dye towards the surface of the co zno photocatalyst 158 table 10 summarizes other studies that were conducted to explain the effect of reaction temperature on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants 6 ln k 1 t ln k b h δs r δh rt 7 ln k 1 ln a e rt 4 6 effect of scavengers a scavenger is a chemical agent that can be used to eliminate any unwanted reaction products or impurities such as oxygen in order to avoid any unfavorable reactions that may hinder the photocatalytic reaction moreover the scavengers are necessary to inactivate the reactive species such as oh o2 h2o2 h and e to investigate the role of each of these oxidants in photoreaction 224 common scavengers were applied to study the photocatalytic performance such as 1 4 benzoquinone bq for o2 scavenger tert butanol t buoh methanol and 2 propanol ipa for oh scavenger agno3 and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso for the e scavenger ammonium oxalate ao and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta 2na for the h scavenger 225 226 j li et al reported the role of each reactive species in the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b rhb using edta 2na fe ii 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidinyloxy tempol and isopropanol ipa to capture h h2o2 o2 and oh respectively after the addition of tempol tio2 x agi 20 exhibited a lower photocatalytic efficiency of 61 60 indicating that o2 is a key reactive species fig 11a 227 in another study three trapping materials terephthalic acid ta isopropyl alcohol ipa and 1 4 benzoquinone bq were utilized to scavenge each of oh h and o2 respectively in order to explain the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of rhodamine b degradation as shown in fig 11b the fe si znepr6o11 photocatalyst showed rhb degradation after the addition of bq implying that o2 plays a minor role in the photoreaction process 228 table 11 summarizes other studies that investigated the effect of scavenger addition into reaction mixture 4 7 effect of direct photolysis in direct photolysis the photo degradation of organic pollutants is achieved by applying light irradiation from a specific source without a photocatalyst different light sources can be used in the photolysis process such as solar light led lamps xenon lamps and uv lamps the photo degradation of organic pollutants by photolysis exhibited lower degradation activity compared with that of the photocatalysis process the photolysis process is affected by several operating parameters such as light intensity reaction temperature the concentration of organic pollutants and solution ph 229 in addition high photoelectric conversion efficiency can be produced using low pressure mercury lamps uv lamps with a wavelength of 254 nm thus the generation of mercury resonance lines at 185 nm and 254 nm can occur by irradiation with uv lamps these lumps exhibit photolysis removal efficiency of 8 to 25 depending on the manufacturer of uv lumps and their intensity 230 231 shemer et al reported the direct photolysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs like dibenzothiophene dbt fluorene flu and dibenzofuran dbf by uv lp or mp and uv h2o2 after the photolysis irradiation with uv fluence of 1000 mj cm2 no high removal efficiency was achieved only 15 of flu and 6 of each dbf and dbf were degraded fig 12a a significant enhancement in the photolysis degradation performance was produced after irradiation with uv h2o2 therefore the degradation rate was increased 36 fold compared with the uv lp lamp alone fig 12b this result is attributed to the generation of more hydroxyl radicals by photolysis of h2o2 molecules in the solution according to eq 8 232 other studies that explain the direct photolysis impact can be summarized in table 12 8 h 2 o 2 uv light 2 oh 4 8 effect of adsorption the adsorption process is one of the most important methods for the removal of different environmental pollutants the adsorption process has been considered a scalable sustainable and operational technology to address environmental pollution because of its unique properties such as energy considerations cost effectiveness and simplicity the adsorption process is a versatile technology adsorption is the surface phenomenon in which contaminants transfer from the liquid phase to the surface or pore spaces of a solid phase by physical forces or chemical bonding the removal of organic pollutants depends on several adsorption approaches like hydrogen bonding π π interactions acid base hydrophobic electrostatic and combinations of these interactions 248 250 the adsorption process plays important role in the photocatalytic degradation ability because the photocatalytic degradation occurs on the surface of the photocatalyst jabbar and esmail ebrahim 159 explained the synergistic effect between the sio2 fe3o4 adsorbent and ag2wo4 nanocrystals in enhancing the photocatalytic degradation of mb dye under visible light irradiation the sio2 fe3o4 ag2wo4 showed improved degradation performance compared with pure ag2wo4 due to the adsorption ability of sio2 fe3o4 in addition the effect of adsorption of sio2 fe3o4 ag2wo4 composite was studied by using different photocatalytic experiments with different ph values to control the adsorption activity it was detected that maximum photocatalytic activity was exhibited at ph 11 due to the high adsorption activity that was achieved in alkaline solution in another study lower photocatalytic degradation activity was achieved by the zno zns bc composite in alkaline conditions fig 13a this result is ascribed to the fact that low adsorption capacity was exhibited at ph 11 towards norfloxacin nof in the first 30 min of the dark control 251 hu et al reported higher rhb adsorption activity by gr ag2s composites in which 58 of rhb was removed during 60 min of adsorption in the dark control fig 13b these results are due to the presence of gr with an aromatic structure and a large surface area it was detected that the adsorption activity was increased by increasing the gr percentage in gr ag2s composites which led to an improvement in the photocatalytic performance 252 in another study low adsorption performance was detected by ayodhya et al when zn2sno4 cds was suspended in mo 10 mg l dye solution for 20 min in the dark control fig 13c a large particle size distribution of 1 2 μm for zn2sno4 and 500 nm for cds was detected using the sem technique which significantly negatively affected the adsorption performance of zn2sno4 cds 238 luo et al examined the adsorption performance of the g c3n4 bi3tao7 photocatalyst towards tc aqueous solution 10 mg l during 60 min of adsorption in the dark control as shown in fig 13d g c3n4 bi3tao7 exhibited enhanced adsorption activity about 17 towards tc compared with pure bi3tao7 and g c3n4 according to the bet result the high specific surface area 172 5 m2 g 1 of g c3n4 bi3tao7 is responsible for enhanced adsorption activity which is 2 9 and 2 3 times greater than each of pure bi3tao7 and g c3n4 respectively 253 other studies explaining the adsorption performance of the photocatalyst can be summarized in table 13 4 9 effect of running cycles it s important to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst heterojunction in many successive running cycles to assess its practical application and examine its stability during the photoreaction furthermore the stability test is important to avoid any metals released during the photocatalytic reaction which may exhibit secondary pollution in treated water 254 the stability and reusability tests can be performed in 3 4 or 5 successive running cycles after each cycle the photocatalyst is separated washed with ethanol or deionized water many times and dried at 105 c for the next application 255 wu et al reported mb dye degradation in five running cycles using g c3n4 ag2wo4 wo3 photocatalysts in the first cycle 98 68 of the mb was eliminated in 180 min after the five cycles the photocatalytic activity dropped to 90 the result showed excellent satiability of the g c3n4 ag2wo4 wo3 composite 256 in another observation there was no observable reduction in ag ag2wo4 rgo aar performance against mb after five successive running cycles the results in fig 13e confirmed the good stability and reusability of the aar composite 257 in another work s bi co doped f tio2 sio2 s bi f tio2 sio2 was synthesized by the simple sol gel method and performed for acrylonitrile degradation as shown in fig 13f the s bi f tio2 sio2 composite maintained good degradation ability after five running cycles suggesting its high stability during the photoreaction cycles 258 table 14 reviewed and summarized other studies explaining the effect of running cycles on the photocatalytic degradation performance 4 10 type of semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction in recent years numerous single semiconductor photocatalysts like tio2 zno v2o5 wo3 zro2 etc have been applied to the photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants such as dyes pesticides phenolic compounds solvents pharmaceuticals and so on 274 among these tio2 is one of the most employed photocatalysts due to its activity high stability eco friendliness low cost and biocompatibility 275 276 despite these advantages its application was limited due to poor separation of photogenerated charge carriers and its absorption of only the uv fraction of the visible light sources thus many modification approaches such as heterojunction of semiconductor composites core shell or supporting structures dye sensitization and doping were developed to address these drawbacks by reducing the electron hole pair recombination rate expanding the visible light absorption and modifying the bandgap 277 279 in summary heterojunctions are considered to be the interface between two or more semiconductors with different band structures among the modification of the photocatalysts and design approaches the construction of the heterojunction system is one of the most commonly employed methods for photocatalyst fabrication due to its feasibility visible light response high activity and effectiveness in the spatial electron hole pair separation with lower recombination rate there are two types of semiconductors heterojunctions p n heterojunctions and non p n heterojunctions 280 281 the formation of junctions at the interface and space charge region resulting in a built in potential that can guide electrons and holes to move in opposite directions is referred to as a p n heterojunction as a result a good separation of electrons and holes is possible 282 the non p n heterojunction is based on the difference in the cb and vb levels of the two materials to realize electron and hole transfer non p n heterojunctions are classified into three types based on how electrons and holes are transferred in semiconductors type i type ii and z scheme heterojunction 283 the detailed discussions of their mechanisms are provided below on the other hand other visible light active semiconductors non tio2 based such as fe2o3 ag3po4 ferrites znin2s4 bismuth catalysts mos2 g c3n4 cds etc were intensively examined in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants 284 286 these photocatalysts possess high efficiency for absorption of light in the visible region due to their lower band gap energy but they also have a high charge carrier recombination rate low stability high aggregation rate and lower redox potentials in their vb and cb hindering their reliance upon in photoreaction applications 287 heterojunction between semiconductors is an efficient way to overcome this constraint by developing different types of heterojunctions using tio2 and non tio2 based composite photocatalysts such as bi2moo6 bivo4 cds bi2moo6 g c3n4 bi2wo6 znfe2o4 g c3n4 biobr g c3n4 bivo4 tio2 bi2o3 bi2wo6 g c3n4 cds znfe2o4 tio2 bivo4 tio2 bi2wo6 tio2 g c3n4 tio2 cds tio2 etc 288 292 zhou et al created a three layer heterojunction photocatalyst using ti32 oxo cluster ctoc batio3 cuss composite photocatalyst that can effectively harvest vibration energy and visible light source xenon lamp 300 w the three layer heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation activity 100 within 60 min against tetracycline tc this result is attributed to the photo piezoelectric synergistic effect which is formed by the polarized electric field between p n heterojunction p type cuss n type ctoc and the piezoelectric material batio3 fig 14a this heterojunction promotes the charge carries separation and reduces the electron hole recombination rate enhancing the photocatalytic performance 293 zhang et al reported z scheme cds agbr rgo car nanocomposite for rhodamine b 50 μmol l 1 degradation under a visible light source 500 w xe lamp car 10 showed enhanced photocatalytic performance 95 8 in 60 min against rhb compared with pure photocatalysts cds agbr and agbr rgo the trapping experiment showed that h o2 and oh exhibited significant contributions in the photodegradation of rhb the enhanced removal efficiency is caused by forming z scheme heterojunction with high potential redox ability promoting the production of o2 in the cb of cds and oh in the vb of agbr as shown in fig 14b 294 in other work dual z scheme heterojunction was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method that was composed of carbon quantum dots cqds decorated ceo2 g c3n4 v2o5 ccgv this composite exhibited excellent absorption of light in the visible region solar light and near infra red region through charge transfer via two channel dual z scheme which led to a sufficient reduction in recombination rate and up conversion effect of cqds 295 arora et al reported improved photocatalytic activity towards rhodamine b rhb ciprofloxacin cip and antibiotics by developing the semiconductor heterojunction of ag agbr composite supported by g in one system ag agbr g fig 14c in this heterojunction g acts as an electron acceptor while ag agbr acts as an electron donor thus the electrons can sufficiently transfer from ag agbr to g promoting the separation of electron hole and reducing the recombination rate which leads to enhancing the photocatalytic performance 296 other investigations for semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction can be summarized in table 15 a z scheme heterojunction of bon br agbr was firstly designed via simple two step hydrothermal precipitation method for the enhanced photocatalytic performance the as prepared bon br agbr possessed an enhanced photocatalytic activity for rb 19 degradation when compared with pure bon 13 82 times bon br 8 44 times and pure agbr 2 48 times under visible light respectively the role of z scheme heterojunction was confirmed by photoluminescence pl emission and photocurrent responses pc techniques the bon br agbr composite showed a low recombination rate as low pl intensity in addition a higher photocurrent intensity suggests a higher separation efficiency and photo generated ros the heterojunction between bon br and agbr exhibited more efficient migration of charge carriers which proved using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis technique that recorded smaller arc radius 297 5 conclusions and future perspectives organic pollutants like organic dyes pesticides phenol and phenolic compounds petroleum refinery wastewater pollutants etc have been proven to have a significant harmful impact on human health the aquatic system and microbes like heavy metals these organic contaminants are non biodegradable persistent toxic and recalcitrant these pollutants proved difficult to degrade using conventional methods such as biological decomposition electrochemical oxidation reduction floatation flocculation adsorption and precipitation due to their extremely complex structures these technologies can not completely remove the dyes from wastewater the photocatalytic ability of semiconductor heterojunction has been shown to be one of the most employed methods for the elimination of different organic pollutants in other hand it is important to optimize the amount of the photocatalyst during the photocatalytic process to avoid any additional dosage for the economic feasibility of photoreaction it should have a maximum efficiency with minimal photocatalyst concentration the photocatalytic degradation performance against colored chemicals like dyes increases as their concentration increases but after reaching a critical concentration level it begins to decrease moreover the solution ph can influence the catalytic performance by affecting the photocatalyst surface properties in addition the rate of photocatalytic degradation can be increased by increasing the light intensity the photocatalytic degradation activity of organic pollutants is positively related to raising the reaction temperature the photo degradation of organic pollutants by photolysis exhibited lower degradation activity compared with that of the photocatalysis process finally the removal of organic pollutants depends on several adsorption approaches like hydrogen bonding π π interactions acid base hydrophobic electrostatic and combinations of these interactions regardless we believe there are a few aspects that are both interesting and challenging for future development 1 until now the explanations of the photocatalytic mechanism have still been based on indirect proof and are not very clear thus new techniques and new ideas related to electron hole pair separation and direct characterization are still full of challenges 2 the heterojunction of semiconductors showed a sufficient reduction in the recombination rate of electron hole pairs but the negative impacts on the photocatalytic process such as carrier scattering at the interface should be investigated 3 adopting a rational heterojunction type number of components fabrication method and structure is full of challenges and interests 4 more studies are concerned with the preparation of composite materials with high removal efficiencies but their fabrication is more complicated and requires more expensive materials therefore the development of novel photocatalysts with lower band gap for visible light harvesting low cost large surface area environmentally friendly and large scale must be addressed 5 other environmental factors affecting photocatalytic degradation still need to be studied to design an ideal photoreactor with high photocatalytic efficiency and a cost effective process 6 we believe that this review is important for future enhancements to the photocatalytic performance by optimizing different operation

12993,a few years ago the elimination of organic pollutants was given high priority due to their harmful impacts on humans animals and the environment semiconductor photocatalysis is one of the most important and promising techniques in the field of wastewater treatment for many reasons such as ease of handling good reproducibility simplicity high efficiency and cost friendliness in addition it is environmentally friendly non energy intensive nontoxic and green technology this review focuses on the recent progress in semiconductor heterojunctions such as type ii heterojunction p n heterojunction n n heterojunction z scheme heterojunction and s scheme and their application in the photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants like organic dyes pesticides phenol and phenolic compounds petroleum refinery wastewater pollutants antibiotics and pharmaceutical pollutants the environmental factors affecting photocatalytic degradation activity such as photocatalyst concentration pollutant concentration solution ph light intensity reaction temperature photolysis scavengers adsorption performance in dark control running cycles and type of semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction were thoroughly discussed helping to design an ideal photoreactor with high photocatalytic efficiency and a cost effective process finally we believe this review is necessary for future improvement in the photocatalysis process by optimizing different operation parameters and selecting a suitable heterojunction for photocatalytic degradation of industrial organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords semiconductor heterojunction photocatalytic degradation organic pollutants industrial wastewater treatment environmental factors 1 introduction a few years ago a vast number of organic pollutants such as pigments synthetic dyes surfactants solvents and fertilizers are discharged from many industries like cosmetics plastics food paint leather textiles etc which have a significant harmful effect on human health the aquatic system and microbes 1 3 these pollutants are responsible about many diseases like renal damage hypertension epilepsy alzheimer nausea vomiting carcinogenic and mutagenic impacts profuse sweating and mental confusion 4 5 furthermore these organic effluents have several effects on the received water body by changing its vital parameters like color unpleasant odor toxicity biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand 6 the coloration of wastewater can be formed in the aquatic system even in the presence of a low concentration of colored organic traces 7 the color must be removed before discharging because it has negative environmental effects such as affecting the ecosystem and obstructing the penetration of sunlight to plants and aquatic organisms resulting in decreased photosynthesis 8 9 organic dyes are the most common industrial pollutants that originate from several industries such as textiles paper and other industries resulting in significant environmental damage 10 many studies have reported that 10 12 of dyes such as thymol blue black t ebt methylene blue mb eriochrome red 120 caramine indigo red rose bengal victoria blue and rhodamine b are consumed in the textiles industries more than 20 of these utilized dyes are lost during processing and synthesis operations and discharged into water bodies 11 these dye polluted wastewater contain highly toxic and non biodegradable colored pigments that are destructive to living creatures 12 many conventional techniques such as coagulation incineration adsorption on solid phases filtration ozonation reverse osmosis and biological treatment have been applied to eliminate different organic pollutants from wastewater 13 therefore each of these techniques has its own disadvantages that limit their dependence 14 thus biological treatment results in a ghastly smell and needs prolonged treatment time the incineration process can produce toxic volatile products and the ozonation process is highly affected by the variation of temperature ph and salts 15 the physical methods transform one phase into another without eliminating the organic molecules 16 chemical methods require a large amount of chemical dosage and it is proven to be costly and produce a large amount of sludge 17 in this regard it is important to develop new technologies to protect human health and the environment semiconductor photocatalysis is one of the most important and promising techniques in the field of wastewater treatment for many reasons such as ease of handling good reproducibility simplicity high efficiency and cost friendliness 18 in addition it is environmentally friendly non energy intensive nontoxic and green technology by utilizing solar light to remove hazardous pollutants and control environmental pollution 19 20 the solar light can supply the power of approximately 100 mw cm2 and can provide 107 photons per square centimeter therefore the atom can receive 100 photons in 1 s 21 22 the photocatalysis process is an advanced oxidation process aop that relies on the in situ generation of different oxidizing species to completely mineralize the organic compounds into co2 and h2o 23 many semiconductors were investigated as efficient photocatalysts in previous studies such as tio2 zno srtio3 fe2o3 cds wo3 zns 24 in addition because of their optical and electrical properties lower costs chemical stability nontoxicity high activity and environmental friendliness tio2 and zno have received the most attention in the degradation of organic pollutants 25 in recent years nanophotocatalysts have been extensively studied due to their high physiochemical ability and possessing excellent surface area 26 the removal efficiency of these photocatalysts is significantly influenced by various parameters starting from the synthesis of the nanocatalyst to the operating conditions of the degradation of effluent 27 in recent years more studies have been developed on semiconductor applications in environmental issues but more new investigations are also needed to be reviewed and summarized in this review the photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants such as organic dyes pesticides phenol and phenolic compounds petroleum refinery wastewater pollutants pharmaceutical pollutants etc for previously published works was discussed in detail in addition it focused on the applications of different types of semiconductor semiconductor heterojunctions in organic degradation under uv visible and solar irradiation this paper provided viable information about the parameters affecting the photocatalytic degradation efficiency such as photocatalyst concentration pollutants concentration solution ph light intensity reaction temperature direct photolysis scavengers adsorption performance in dark control running cycles and type of semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction using various photocatalyst heterojunctions each parameter was explained separately to remove organic pollutants as a crucial coefficient of performance this study aims to identify approaches for accelerating the development of efficient photocatalysis processes 2 the principles of photocatalysis semiconductors are the most commonly employed photocatalysts which have free electron conduction bands with higher energy and a full electron valence band with a definite band gap as shown in fig s1 when the semiconductor absorbs the photon energy from a light source the associated electron e hole h pairs will be generated by migrating the electrons from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb eq 1 the superoxide radical anion o2 can be formed by reacting the dissolved oxygen electron acceptor with the excited electrons on the surface of a photocatalyst eq 2 28 29 according to eqs 3 and 4 the free hydroxyl radicals can be generated by reacting the h2o and oh molecules with photogenerated holes on the photocatalyst surface 30 in addition the free holes on the surface of photocatalysts can directly oxidize organic pollutants due to their oxidation potential of 2 80 v the powerful hydroxyl radicals can effectively degrade the organic contaminates which adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst forming h2o and co2 eq 5 31 1 photocatalyst hγ e cb h vb 2 e cb o 2 o 2 3 h vb oh oh 4 h vb h 2 o h oh 5 oh o 2 h 2 o 2 h vb organic pollutants co 2 h 2 o other products in the past decade semiconductor photocatalysts such as zno 32 tio2 33 srtio3 34 cdse 35 fe2o3 36 wo3 37 etc have been applied to degrade a large number of organic pollutants some desirable properties should be included in the ideal photocatalyst such as highly stable towards photocorrosion biological robustness high activity under solar light or visible light easy availability low cost and nontoxic 38 the photocatalytic activity can be assessed depending on some factors including catalytic reaction efficiency charge transfer efficiency and photon absorption efficiency in this regard the photocatalytic activity of several semiconductors can be abstracted due to many limitations such as narrow absorption in the visible light region large band gap energy low photogenerated carrier separation efficiency fast recombination rate and defects and impurities 13 39 40 therefore large bandgap 3 0 3 2 ev semiconductors like tio2 zno ag2wo4 etc exhibit lower absorption for light in the visible region where they can only harvest uv light resulting in increasing the treatment cost on the other hand photogenerated carriers should be transferred to the photocatalyst surface to support the photoreaction this process must be accomplished in 3 10 s before the recombination process between the electrons and holes occurs in addition some photocatalysts have good absorption properties but exhibit lower photocatalytic activity this is attributed to the defects and impurities in the photocatalyst structure which accelerate the photocarrier recombination rate 41 42 to overcome these limitations different approaches have been taken to enhance the photocatalytic performance by modifying the electronic and morphological properties these modifications include semiconductor heterojunctions 43 surface or dye sensitizers 44 metal deposition 45 adding quantum dots 46 combining with noble metals 47 and doping with foreign elements 48 these strategies can modulate the band gap energy and increase visible light absorption making the photocatalysis treatment more cost effective 49 the semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction s s heterojunction is one of the most effective technologies to increase the number of charges and inhibit electron hole recombination via the synergistic effect between the two semiconductors generating a high amount of ros and oxidizing the organic compounds fig s2 depicts the example of s s heterojunction between two semiconductors some studies were investigated to develop s s heterojunction can be summarized in table s1 47 56 3 degradation of different organic pollutants in this section organic contaminants like organic dyes pesticides phenol and phenolic compounds petroleum refinery wastewater pollutants and some other common industrial chemicals are discussed like heavy metals these organic contaminants are non biodegradable persistent toxic and recalcitrant their removal techniques fate occurrences and sources have been reviewed elsewhere 61 3 1 organic dyes organic dyes are derived from various industries such as textiles leather electroplating food processing pharmaceuticals tanneries and pulp and paper 13 23 organic dyes can be classified into various classes and groups according to their source structure and fiber type 62 the chemical structure and other properties of cationic and anionic dyes that consumed in the textile industry can be summarized in table s2 10 azo dyes are among the major dye classifications that are utilized in industrial applications in addition 50 of all dyes that are utilized in industries are azoic dyes 62 according to the chemical structure dyes are classified into anionic and cationic dyes the anionic dyes are categorized as phenol red pr alizarin red s ars rose bengal rb eosin y ey acid red 14 ar14 acid orange 7 ao7 and methylene orange mo all anionic dyes contain functional groups such as carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid 63 on the other hand the cationic dyes are classified as safranin o so rhodamine 6g rh6g crystal violet cv rhodamine b rhb malachite green mg and methylene blue mb in an aquatic solution all cationic dyes have the ability to dissociate into positively charged ions due to their cationic functional groups 64 thus the photocatalysts of hydrophilic surfaces can effectively interact with these functional groups which have high solubility in water synthetic dyes can have a variety of toxic and harmful effects on human health including respiratory tract irritation skin irritation carcinogenicity disruption of blood formation hemoglobin adducts reductive cleavage chromosomal damage and so on 65 in addition dyes hinder the penetration of sunlight through water which negatively affects aquatic plants thus it is important to remove these dyes to control environmental pollution 66 67 synthetic dyes proved difficult to degrade using conventional methods such as biological decomposition electrochemical oxidation reduction floatation flocculation adsorption and precipitation due to their extremely complex structures these technologies can not completely remove the dyes from wastewater 68 recently numerous researchers have reported complete dye removal by using heterogeneous photocatalysts the removal efficiency of dyes is significantly affected by the charge separation and the recombination rate of electron hole thus various strategies like doping and semiconductor heterojunction were applied to address these limitations 69 zha et al reported 97 degradation of methyl orang mo dye within 30 min under uv light irradiation using tio2 zno heterojunction the high photocatalytic activity is caused by the p n heterojunction between the two semiconductors n tio2 p zno in one system which reduces the rate of electron hole recombination 70 fig 1a in another study ag2o ag bivo4 exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity towards rhodamine b rhb and methylene blue mb compared with pure bivo4 and ag2o completely decolorized in 15 and 48 respectively the z scheme heterojunction between bivo4 and ag2o plays an active role in the acceleration of charge separation and reduces the effect of electron hole recombination as shown in fig 1b 71 additionally an important study was conducted by nguyen et al they reported fabrication of a znfe2o4 tio2 composite using a facile solvothermal method as a visible light response photocatalyst eight 8 w blb lamps as shown in fig 1c the n tio2 and p znfe2o4 were well combined forming a p n heterojunction which promotes the complete degradation of bpa dye in 30 min of visible light irradiation 72 other studies on dye degradation can be summarized in table 1 3 2 pesticides in recent years the demand for vegetables and crops has been increased by the increasing human population a million tons per year of pesticides like insecticides herbicides fungicides fumigants rodenticides organochlorine organophosphate and n methyl carbamate play a vital role in the protection of animals and plants from different types of diseases and pests 91 these pollutants possess many adverse effects on the nervous systems reproductive systems and organs it can also induce cancer and birth defects the widespread use of pesticides in the agricultural sector causes an increase in their mobility via the food chain and surface and groundwater supplies resulting in their bioaccumulation in human bodies thus the removal of pesticides from the contaminated medium is a challenging proposition 92 93 bhoi et al reported 95 degradation of alachlor by type ii cus bifeo3 heterojunction in 60 min under visible light irradiation after heterojunction between the two semiconductors the holes in the vb of bfo can transfer to that of cus while the electrons in the cb of cus can transfer to that of bfo fig 2a the holes in the vb of cus can directly oxidize the alachlor furthermore oh can be formed by splitting the h2o in the vb of cus and by activating h2o2 this result was supported by scavenger experiments 94 in another study 95 of diuron 10 ppm was degraded in 3 h under visible light source 150 w xe lamp the type cus bi2w2o9 heterojunction played a critical role in improving photocatalytic performance as shown in fig 2b the trapping test confirmed the important role of hydroxyl radicals and holes in the photoreaction 95 another type of pesticide lindane was removed using the bioi0 5br0 5 photocatalyst which was fabricated by the co precipitation method bioi biobr exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity against lindane under visible light irradiation where 98 of lindane was eliminated at ph 8 in this study the photocatalyst dose and ph were optimized to be 1 g l and 8 respectively 96 a few semiconductor heterojunctions for photocatalytic degradation of pesticides can be summarized in table 2 3 3 phenols and derivatives phenol c6h5oh is one type of volatile aromatic hydrocarbon with a white crystalline structure which is utilized in the production of dyes drugs like aspirin explosives like picric acid and the fabrication of plastics phenol and its derivatives such as p nitrophenol m nitrophenol o nitrophenol p chlorophenol m chlorophenol o chlorophenol are highly soluble in water 103 unfortunately acute inhalation or dermal exposure to these contaminants causes severe irritation to human eyes skin muscle fatigue breast cancer metabolic disorders and mucous membranes 104 nitrophenols are very toxic water pollutants that are discharged into the environment as a result of the production of azo dyes organo phosphorous pesticides and medical products chlorophenols are moderately hazardous water contaminants that are formed intermediately during the water disinfection and oxidation processes of some chlorinated organic compounds such as phenolic compounds and herbicides 105 yang et al developed a p n heterojunction photocatalyst p lafeo3 n ag3po4 for the photocatalytic degradation of phenol it was revealed that 95 of phenol was degraded under visible light irradiation this enhancement in removal efficiency caused by the formation of a high number of hydroxyl radicals which was improved by p n heterojunction as shown in fig 3a the oh can be formed by oxidizing oh to oh due to the conduction band of p lafeo3 having a higher positively potential redox ability 2 115 ev vs nhe than that of oh oh 1 99 ev vs nhe 106 in another study the bi2o3 bi4v2o11 composite was synthesized by a high temperature calcination method for phenol degradation 40 mg l under a visible light source 300 w xe lamp when compared to pure bi2o3 and bi4v2o11 the bi2o3 bi4v2o11 system demonstrated complete degradation performance after 30 min the synergistic effect between the two semiconductors is responsible for enhanced removal efficiency as shown in fig 3b the cb potential of bi4v2o11 is more negative 0 23 ev than that of o2 o2 0 04 ev thus o2 was readily formed by reducing adsorbed o2 the trapping studies proved that h and o2 have significant contributions in photoreaction 107 lam et al reported that 95 of resorcinol was degraded in 6 h under visible light irradiation fluorescent lamp by ag2o zno which was fabricated by the co precipitation method the heterojunction between ag2o loaded on zno exhibited excellent electron hole pair separation during the photoreaction 108 in addition 99 4 of 2 4 dichlorophenol was degraded in 50 min using a nanosized na2ti2o13 tio2 composite which was fabricated using hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate 109 in another study different organic pollutants p nitrophenol ciprofloxacin and diethyl phthalate were degraded via graphene quantum dots mn n tio2 g c3n4 composite gqds tcn the 5 gqds tcn 0 4 sample showed improved degradation activity under simulated solar irradiation the type ii heterojunction in fig 3c was responsible for this improved photocatalytic performance the morphology studies in fig 3d suggested the formation of cns as a thin layer precipitated on the surface of mn n tio2 nanoparticles forming gqds tcn 0 4 composite 110 other studies on phenols degradation can be summarized in table 3 3 4 petroleum refinery wastewater petroleum refineries generate a large amount of wastewater containing various types of aromatic and aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbons petroleum hydrocarbons such as xylene ethylbenzene toluene benzene nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds long chain hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and others have a wide range of hazardous and harmful effects such as destroying natural sights contaminating the atmosphere affecting human health reducing crop production contaminating surface and groundwater and having numerous toxic effects on aquatic life 121 122 conventional methods do not have the ability to eliminate the toxicity of aromatic compounds thus modern technologies are still required to degrade this pollutant as much as possible 123 sangkhun et al reported improved photocatalytic performance of w doped tio2 compared to tio2 p25 against btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene under visible light irradiation 18 w fluorescent lamp the kinetic studies showed that the reaction rate was 17 23 34 and 43 ppm g s for each of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene respectively 124 in another investigation a tio2 bearing coating was used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of btex the photocatalytic degradation rate can be arranged in the following order o xylene ethylbenzene toluene benzene as shown in fig 4a the photocatalytic degradation activity was significantly affected by humidity a notable reduction in removal efficiency was detected by increasing the humidity from 0 to 90 125 dahash et al studied the photocatalytic ability of the ni zno0 6s0 4 composite for cod removal in refinery wastewater under a visible light source led lamp it was revealed that 89 of cod was degraded in 180 min the synergistic effect of zns and zno species was critical in improving degradation ability the recyclability test showed a 10 reduction in cod removal after five running cycles fig 4b 126 khan et al applied tio2 zno and h2o2 in the treatment of real refinery wastewater the experimental results showed that tio2 was more effective compared with zno and h2o2 for real refinery wastewater treatment 127 in another study a visible light responsive photocatalyst tio2 fe zsm 5 was fabricated via the sol gel method and applied for the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater prww after 240 min 80 of cod was eliminated at a photocatalyst dose of 2 1 g l 128 addition degradation experiments applied to petroleum refinery wastewater can be summarized in table 4 3 5 antibiotics and pharmaceutical pollutants common antibiotics and medicines are utilized for human agricultural veterinary medicine and other purposes every year a huge number of antibiotics and drugs are consumed worldwide recently approximately a milligram per liter range of pharmaceutical traces have been detected in venous water resources such as drinking water surface water municipal wastewater and so on pharmaceutical pollutants exhibit unknown reactive properties that have different harmful impacts on human health aquatic life and the environment in particular some adverse effects like chronic toxicity endocrine disruption and antibiotic resistance can result from these pollutants even at low concentrations in addition these pollutants cannot be eliminated by conventional wastewater treatment plants as they are poorly absorbable and difficult to metabolize 133 136 chen et al used a bi2o3 bio 2co3 composite to perform photo degradation against ciprofloxacin cip under visible light irradiation in 30 min bi2o3 bio 2co3 demonstrated an improved cip decay efficiency of 93 4 137 in addition complete degradation of cip was achieved after 120 min using zno sns2 heterojunction the zno sns2 exhibited an excellent degradation rate which is 10 times greater than pure sns2 this enhancement is attributed to improving the visible light absorption after heterojunction between sns2 and zno nanoparticles fig 5a 138 in another investigation plasmonic p n heterojunction p type ag2s n type bi2moo6 showed high performance in the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride tc and levofloxacin lev the ag ag2s bi2moo6 exhibited 92 8 and 87 3 degradation efficiency under visible light source for each of tc and lev respectively as shown in fig 5b the photodegradation of lev was explained in four pathways according to the intermediate identification 139 in another work organic inorganic tcpp bi2moo6 type ii heterojunction was developed by wang et al using a simple impregnation method the experimental results revealed an 87 5 degradation efficiency of tc under a 300 w xenon lamp it was detected that the photodegradation rate was 1 15 folds greater than that of pristine bi2moo6 the interfacial interaction between bi2moo6 and tcpp showed a superior role in enhancing the degradation performance fig 5c the scavenger experiments confirmed the main roles of oh o2 and h in photoreaction 140 li et al reported s scheme heterojunction taon bi2moo6 in the core shell structure towards lev degradation it was found that 92 7 of lev was degraded in 75 min using a 300 w xe lamp as a visible light source the s scheme hetero structure provided excellent electron hole separation a high absorption rate and a lower recombination rate due to the synergistic effect between the two semiconductors fig 5d 141 furthermore 90 78 of tc was degraded by the nife2o4 bi2o3 composite which was fabricated using a microwave assisted method the well matching of band potential was responsible for enhancing the removal efficiency which allowed efficient charge separation 142 in other work ag agcl ag2o heterostructures was fabricated using facile in situ growth strategy for degradation of ciprofloxacin the morphology studies fig 5e showed that the inner ag2o can be efficiently protected by the stable ag agcl nano shells against photocorrosion this heterostructure can enhance the transfer efficiency and the separation of photo induced electron hole pairs 143 other studies of semiconductor heterojunctions towards pharmaceutical pollutants degradation can be illustrated in table 5 4 factors affecting the photocatalytic degradation performance in this section different environmental factors like photocatalyst dosage initial pollutant concentration temperature solution ph scavenging agents light intensity anions and dopant content were investigated and summarized in practice it is necessary to have knowledge of these parameters to design an ideal photoreactor with high photocatalytic efficiency and a cost effective process 4 1 effect of photocatalyst concentration the photocatalyst concentration is known as the most important parameter affecting the photocatalytic activity it is important to optimize the amount of the photocatalyst during the photocatalytic process to avoid any additional dosage for the economic feasibility of photoreaction it should have a maximum efficiency with minimal photocatalyst concentration 91 when the amount of photocatalyst is increased the photocatalytic activity also increases this is due to the increase in the number of active sites on the photocatalyst surface thus a high number of hydroxyl radicals and other ros will be generated which is responsible for the actual destruction of organic pollutants 154 in contrast the photocatalytic degradation activity will be limited by using an excessive amount of photocatalyst resulting in a cloudy condition inside the reactor which reduces the light penetration through the solution 155 sun et al 156 reported that the increase in photocatalyst dose above the optimum value would reduce the degradation efficiency by increasing the aggregation effect of nanoparticles and reducing the photoactive surface area riga et al reported that the amount of adsorbed dye normally increases by an increase in the photocatalyst loading rate tio2 157 fig 6 depicts the photocatalyst effects on the photocatalytic degradation performance using different heterogenous nanocomposites photocatalysts fig 6a illustrates the photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization ods in the gasoline fuel by using different concentrations 0 5 to 1 5 g l of fe3o4 sio2 pt simo12 photocatalyst in the core shell structure 132 adeel et al investigated the effect of the percentage of co zno composites on the photocatalytic degradation of mo dye the experimental results in fig 6b showed that 10 co zno is the optimum photocatalyst with a degradation efficiency of 93 158 z h jabbar and s e ebrahim 159 showed that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency against mb dye was increased from 75 to 88 by increasing the sio2 fe3o4 ag2wo4 dose from 0 5 to 1 g l after 45 min of illumination time this is attributed to the increase in the formation of photogenerated electron hole pairs fig 6c another investigation was conducted by 160 using several concentrations of cfa znfe2o4 coal fly ash based zinc ferrite composite 20 200 mg l as a photocatalyst towards mb dye they discovered that increasing the photocatalyst concentration above 110 mg l reduces removal activity due to photocatalyst agglomeration and the release of fe ii ions that scavenge the produced hydroxyl radicals fig 3d other studies that explain the effect of photocatalyst dose on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants can be summarized in table 6 4 2 effect of pollutant concentration pollutant concentration is another important factor that can influence the photocatalytic degradation activity of hazardous chemicals and dyes the concentration of organic pollutants for most photocatalytic degradation studies was selected in the range of 10 200 ppm to simulate the discharged organic compounds concentrations of real industrial wastewater 33 the photocatalytic degradation performance against colored chemicals like dyes increases as their concentration increases but after reaching a critical concentration level it begins to decrease this is attributed to the fact that the dye molecules will screen the irradiated uv visible light before reaching the photocatalyst surface 167 b liu et al 168 reported that the photocatalytic degradation activity of ps g c3n4 nanosheets was decreased by increasing the bisphenol a bpa concentration from 5 mg l 100 to 20 mg l 70 this is due to bpa molecules competing for active sites on the ps g c3n4 nanosheets surface resulting in a reduction in photocatalytic degradation performance the same observation was reported by 169 when flower like mgo was used as a photocatalyst to oxidize the methylene blue dye mb under uv light irradiation it was detected that the mb degradation efficiency was 99 at an initial mb concentration of 100 mg l and an irradiation time of 24 24 min this degradation efficiency was sharply reduced to 18 74 in 315 07 min of irradiation time by using 500 mg l mb concentration fig 7a another study was developed by saffari et al fig 7b which exhibited an inverse relationship between the degradation rate and rhodamine b rhb concentration this is attributed to the enhancement of the adsorption activity by excessive rhb concentration resulting in a blocking effect of surface pores which leads to a reduction in the number of absorbed photons by the p zno1 8 photocatalyst 163 the reduction in the degradation rate could also be due to a lack of sufficient active species oh o2 h2o2 hvb which are necessary to react with the excessive contaminant concentration this result was observed by siboni et al fig 7c by using cu doped zno nanorods as a photocatalyst for insecticide diazinon degradation they found that the removal efficiency was reduced from 99 96 to 21 9 by increasing the diazinon concentration from 10 to 50 mg l 164 chu et al 165 studied the effect of the initial bpa concentration 5 30 mg l on the degradation activity of bpa using a constant dosage of bi2o3 sno2 photocatalyst under solar light irradiation photocatalytic faster degradation rates were exhibited in shorter times at lower initial concentrations of 5 mg l fig 8d this is attributed to the high rate of light penetration which results in the generation of a sufficient number of active species at a low contaminant concentration other studies showing the effect of initial contaminant concentration on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants can be summarized in table 7 4 3 effect of ph solution ph is one of the most investigated parameters that affecting the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants by different heterogenous photocatalysts since the photocatalytic reaction mixture is immensely sensitive to the ph furthermore it is necessary to examine the ph effect on the photocatalytic reaction due to the variability of ph in industrial wastewater 177 the solution ph can influence the catalytic performance by affecting the photocatalyst surface properties the decomposition of oxidants persulfates o3 h2o2 and the target contaminants structure therefore the ph of the reaction affects the photocatalytic reaction by controlling the surface charge of the photocatalyst and the contaminant and hence affects the adsorption of the pollutants on the surface of the photocatalyst 167 178 to study the effect of ph on the photocatalyst surface charge one should measure the point of zero charge phpzc for the photocatalyst thus the photocatalyst carries a positive charge at a ph value less than phpzc and a negative charge at a ph value greater than phpzc 179 yuan et al 180 studied the effect of ph on the catalytic ozonation performance of zvz g c3n4 zero valent zinc immobilized g c3n4 in atrazine atz degradation fig 8a the phpzc of the zvz g c3n4 catalyst was determined to be 5 96 the zvz g c3n4 catalyst showed improved atz degradation performance at ph values ranging from 7 0 to 9 0 because the zvz g c3n4 catalyst carries a negative charge and the reaction of o3 is more likely at a negatively charged condition another contribution was developed by li et al fig 8b by using feco2s4 g c3n4 as a catalyst in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx because the phpzc value of feco2s4 g c3n4 is 5 9 the surface charge is positive at ph values of 3 5 to 5 0 and negative at ph values of 6 5 to 9 5 the perforable degradation was detected at an initial ph value of 3 5 to 5 0 since the smx existed as an anionic species at a high ph range improving the adsorption between the smx and feco2s4 g c3n4 and promoting the degradation performance 181 saffari et al discovered that the p zno1 8 photocatalyst has higher degradation activity at alkaline conditions in the photocatalytic degradation of rhb under visible light irradiation 163 wang et al investigated the degradation activity of the graphene tio2 nanotube array gr tna in different ph solutions of dibutyl phthalate dbp fig 8c the gr tna revealed maximum degradation performance at a ph value of 11 5 this outcome is attributed to the production of oh under basic conditions in addition the phpzc of gr tna is 4 2 so the highest dbp adsorption was achieved at ph 11 5 182 z h jabbar et al explained the effect of ph on the photocatalytic ability of fe3o4 sio2 ag2wo4 ag2s in mb dye degradation under a visible source fig 8d they found that the degradation activity was increased from 95 to 100 by increasing the ph from 7 to 11 this is due to the formation of hydroxide ions at high ph conditions which react with photogenerated holes forming a high number of hydroxyl radicals 183 on the other hand the ph of the solution can influence the decomposition of oxidants in an alkali solution the h2o2 is likely to decompose into o2 and h2o resulting in a weak oxidation at a high ph value 184 furthermore the degradation of organic pollutants by o3 alone is unsatisfactory under acidic conditions however the o3 oxidant can react with the abundant oh to form oh which accelerates the degradation of organic contaminants 185 many studies investigating the effect of the solution ph on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants are reviewed in table 8 4 4 effect of light the photocatalytic kinetics and the quantum efficiency are highly influenced by the duration of light irradiation wavelength and light intensity 194 when the photon energy is absorbed by the photocatalyst the electrons in the vb are excited to cb forming electron hole pairs 195 196 the rate of photocatalytic degradation can be increased by increasing the intensity enhancing the probability of photocatalyst excitation 197 electron hole pair recombination is an experienced problem in the photocatalysis process at lower light intensity the photodegradation activity of organic molecules will be hindered by increasing the recombination rate and decreasing electron hole pair separation resulting in lower photogeneration of free radicals 198 to achieve acceptable degradation performance the photocatalyst should be able to absorb the full visible spectrum some commonly used photocatalysts like sno2 zno tio2 ag2wo4 etc have a wide band gap energy eg 3 0 ev which are effective only in the absorption of light in the uv region and can absorb only 5 of the visible spectrum at a wavelength λ of 388 nm 199 in recent years researchers have focused on utilizing visible light to achieve low cost treatment unfortunately most applied photocatalysts with a wide band gap energy are incapable of harvesting both infrared and visible light which comprise 43 and 52 of visible light 200 in contrast some photocatalysts such as agalo2 bioi bivo4 bi2wo6 ag2s etc showed excellent photocatalytic performance under visible light 201 thus the band gap energy should be modified to exploit the maximum benefit of photocatalysis 202 bhatia et al reported the impact of light intensity varying from 250 to 1000 w on the photocatalytic degradation of atenolol atl using graphene oxide tio2 tio2 g as visible light harvesting photocatalysts fig 9a it was revealed that the photocatalytic degradation activity was increased by increasing the light intensity due to an increase in the absorbed photons per unit area of the photocatalyst 203 another mechanism can contribute to enhance the catalytic activity by photothermal process fig 9b when the photocatalyst absorb the visible and infrared light the localized heating will be formed inducing the photothermal assisted photocatalysis 204 205 ollis et al 206 exhibited a linear relationship first order between the low light intensities 0 20 mw cm2 and the degradation rate the experimental results showed half order reaction was achieved at intermediate light intensities 25 mw cm2 at higher intensities no enhancement in degradation rate was detected with increasing light intensity as shown in fig 9c a kumar et al investigated the photocatalytic activity of the n tio2 sio2 fe3o4 photocatalyst in two different visible light sources light emitting diodes leds and compact fluorescent lamps cfls after 5 h of irradiation the cfls exhibited better photocatalytic performance of 94 compared with leds of 80 in the degradation of ibuprofen ibu with the presence of n tio2 sio2 fe3o4 as visible light response photocatalyst this result is attributed to the fact that cfls have peak emissive wavelengths in the green light spectrum of 400 460 nm compared with leds which have a violet light spectrum of 400 460 nm 207 another investigation was conducted by n nadeem et al 160 by degrading mb dye at three different light sources white leds sunlight and uv 254 nm in the presence of a cfa znfe2o4 photocatalyst the photocatalysis process by uv light 144 w and 254 nm showed maximum degradation performance against mb dye due to its short wavelength that has high photon energy n jallouli et al studied the effect of the number of led lumps on the photocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen ibu using 1 0 g l of tio2 as a photocatalyst fig 9d it was observed that the ibu photocatalytic degradation rate increased with the increase in the number of led lumps this is attributed to increasing the light intensity by increasing the leds which leads to generating high numbers of hydroxyl radicals improving the degradation activity 187 table 9 summarizes other studies that were conducted to explain the effect of light on the photocatalytic destruction of organic pollutants 4 5 effect of reaction temperature the photocatalytic degradation activity of organic pollutants is positively related to raising the reaction temperature the increase in reaction temperature stimulates the generation of reactive radicals caused by the formation of bubbles during the photoreaction process resulting in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity 3 furthermore an increment in reaction temperature can improve the degradation rate by reducing the recombination rate of electron hole pairs also a significant degradation rate can be achieved at the interface 216 tong et al studied the effect of temperature 10 to 40 c on the photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline dox in the presence of 50 mg of bivo4 h2o2 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 10a the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was increased from 76 93 to 97 03 by increasing the reaction temperature from 10 to 40 c this improvement could be attributed to the generation of more oh radicals by raising the reaction temperature 217 noticeable enhancement in the degradation activity of tio2 with increasing the reaction temperature was reported by mozia et al during the photocatalytic degradation of acid red 18 218 by using a 5cu zno catalyst mendoza et al proved the positive effect of temperature on the degradation activity of mb and mo dyes at 45 c the experimental results showed 99 of mo and mb were degraded after 75 and 15 min respectively this is due to a higher concentration of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the 5cu zno catalyst 219 karimi et al reported the photocatalytic degradation activity of nano strontium titanate against reactive orange 72 in different temperatures ranging from 30 c to 50 c fig 10b the degradation rate was increased by increasing the temperature due to the increase in the oxidation rate at the interface 25 another investigation was conducted by ammar et al through oxidative desulfurization ods from real gasoil fuels in three different reaction temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c using 1 g l of fe0 pedot pw12 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation the fe0 pedot pw12 photocatalyst exhibited a maximum desulfurization efficiency of 98 4 at 35 c as shown in fig 10c no significant impact on photocatalytic performance was revealed by increasing the reaction temperature to 45 c this may be caused by the decomposition of added h2o2 which leads to a reduction in the generation of polyoxo peroxo species at high temperatures 162 adeel et al examined the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of methyl orange dye mo 100 mg l by 0 05 g of 10 co zno 50 ml photocatalyst at three reaction temperatures of 30 40 and 50 c the mo degradation performance was significantly improved with an increase in temperature deep investigation was conducted using the eyring equation eq 7 and the arrhenius equation eq 6 the entropy δs and enthalpy δh were estimated to be 241 1 j mol and 12 5 kj mol respectively based on the eyring plot while the activation energy e was estimated to be 15 1 kj mol based on the arrhenius plot fig 10d in addition the free reaction energy δg was estimated to be 62 9 kj mol this research found that increasing the reaction temperature can accelerate the molecular diffusion of the mo dye towards the surface of the co zno photocatalyst 158 table 10 summarizes other studies that were conducted to explain the effect of reaction temperature on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants 6 ln k 1 t ln k b h δs r δh rt 7 ln k 1 ln a e rt 4 6 effect of scavengers a scavenger is a chemical agent that can be used to eliminate any unwanted reaction products or impurities such as oxygen in order to avoid any unfavorable reactions that may hinder the photocatalytic reaction moreover the scavengers are necessary to inactivate the reactive species such as oh o2 h2o2 h and e to investigate the role of each of these oxidants in photoreaction 224 common scavengers were applied to study the photocatalytic performance such as 1 4 benzoquinone bq for o2 scavenger tert butanol t buoh methanol and 2 propanol ipa for oh scavenger agno3 and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso for the e scavenger ammonium oxalate ao and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta 2na for the h scavenger 225 226 j li et al reported the role of each reactive species in the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b rhb using edta 2na fe ii 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidinyloxy tempol and isopropanol ipa to capture h h2o2 o2 and oh respectively after the addition of tempol tio2 x agi 20 exhibited a lower photocatalytic efficiency of 61 60 indicating that o2 is a key reactive species fig 11a 227 in another study three trapping materials terephthalic acid ta isopropyl alcohol ipa and 1 4 benzoquinone bq were utilized to scavenge each of oh h and o2 respectively in order to explain the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of rhodamine b degradation as shown in fig 11b the fe si znepr6o11 photocatalyst showed rhb degradation after the addition of bq implying that o2 plays a minor role in the photoreaction process 228 table 11 summarizes other studies that investigated the effect of scavenger addition into reaction mixture 4 7 effect of direct photolysis in direct photolysis the photo degradation of organic pollutants is achieved by applying light irradiation from a specific source without a photocatalyst different light sources can be used in the photolysis process such as solar light led lamps xenon lamps and uv lamps the photo degradation of organic pollutants by photolysis exhibited lower degradation activity compared with that of the photocatalysis process the photolysis process is affected by several operating parameters such as light intensity reaction temperature the concentration of organic pollutants and solution ph 229 in addition high photoelectric conversion efficiency can be produced using low pressure mercury lamps uv lamps with a wavelength of 254 nm thus the generation of mercury resonance lines at 185 nm and 254 nm can occur by irradiation with uv lamps these lumps exhibit photolysis removal efficiency of 8 to 25 depending on the manufacturer of uv lumps and their intensity 230 231 shemer et al reported the direct photolysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs like dibenzothiophene dbt fluorene flu and dibenzofuran dbf by uv lp or mp and uv h2o2 after the photolysis irradiation with uv fluence of 1000 mj cm2 no high removal efficiency was achieved only 15 of flu and 6 of each dbf and dbf were degraded fig 12a a significant enhancement in the photolysis degradation performance was produced after irradiation with uv h2o2 therefore the degradation rate was increased 36 fold compared with the uv lp lamp alone fig 12b this result is attributed to the generation of more hydroxyl radicals by photolysis of h2o2 molecules in the solution according to eq 8 232 other studies that explain the direct photolysis impact can be summarized in table 12 8 h 2 o 2 uv light 2 oh 4 8 effect of adsorption the adsorption process is one of the most important methods for the removal of different environmental pollutants the adsorption process has been considered a scalable sustainable and operational technology to address environmental pollution because of its unique properties such as energy considerations cost effectiveness and simplicity the adsorption process is a versatile technology adsorption is the surface phenomenon in which contaminants transfer from the liquid phase to the surface or pore spaces of a solid phase by physical forces or chemical bonding the removal of organic pollutants depends on several adsorption approaches like hydrogen bonding π π interactions acid base hydrophobic electrostatic and combinations of these interactions 248 250 the adsorption process plays important role in the photocatalytic degradation ability because the photocatalytic degradation occurs on the surface of the photocatalyst jabbar and esmail ebrahim 159 explained the synergistic effect between the sio2 fe3o4 adsorbent and ag2wo4 nanocrystals in enhancing the photocatalytic degradation of mb dye under visible light irradiation the sio2 fe3o4 ag2wo4 showed improved degradation performance compared with pure ag2wo4 due to the adsorption ability of sio2 fe3o4 in addition the effect of adsorption of sio2 fe3o4 ag2wo4 composite was studied by using different photocatalytic experiments with different ph values to control the adsorption activity it was detected that maximum photocatalytic activity was exhibited at ph 11 due to the high adsorption activity that was achieved in alkaline solution in another study lower photocatalytic degradation activity was achieved by the zno zns bc composite in alkaline conditions fig 13a this result is ascribed to the fact that low adsorption capacity was exhibited at ph 11 towards norfloxacin nof in the first 30 min of the dark control 251 hu et al reported higher rhb adsorption activity by gr ag2s composites in which 58 of rhb was removed during 60 min of adsorption in the dark control fig 13b these results are due to the presence of gr with an aromatic structure and a large surface area it was detected that the adsorption activity was increased by increasing the gr percentage in gr ag2s composites which led to an improvement in the photocatalytic performance 252 in another study low adsorption performance was detected by ayodhya et al when zn2sno4 cds was suspended in mo 10 mg l dye solution for 20 min in the dark control fig 13c a large particle size distribution of 1 2 μm for zn2sno4 and 500 nm for cds was detected using the sem technique which significantly negatively affected the adsorption performance of zn2sno4 cds 238 luo et al examined the adsorption performance of the g c3n4 bi3tao7 photocatalyst towards tc aqueous solution 10 mg l during 60 min of adsorption in the dark control as shown in fig 13d g c3n4 bi3tao7 exhibited enhanced adsorption activity about 17 towards tc compared with pure bi3tao7 and g c3n4 according to the bet result the high specific surface area 172 5 m2 g 1 of g c3n4 bi3tao7 is responsible for enhanced adsorption activity which is 2 9 and 2 3 times greater than each of pure bi3tao7 and g c3n4 respectively 253 other studies explaining the adsorption performance of the photocatalyst can be summarized in table 13 4 9 effect of running cycles it s important to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst heterojunction in many successive running cycles to assess its practical application and examine its stability during the photoreaction furthermore the stability test is important to avoid any metals released during the photocatalytic reaction which may exhibit secondary pollution in treated water 254 the stability and reusability tests can be performed in 3 4 or 5 successive running cycles after each cycle the photocatalyst is separated washed with ethanol or deionized water many times and dried at 105 c for the next application 255 wu et al reported mb dye degradation in five running cycles using g c3n4 ag2wo4 wo3 photocatalysts in the first cycle 98 68 of the mb was eliminated in 180 min after the five cycles the photocatalytic activity dropped to 90 the result showed excellent satiability of the g c3n4 ag2wo4 wo3 composite 256 in another observation there was no observable reduction in ag ag2wo4 rgo aar performance against mb after five successive running cycles the results in fig 13e confirmed the good stability and reusability of the aar composite 257 in another work s bi co doped f tio2 sio2 s bi f tio2 sio2 was synthesized by the simple sol gel method and performed for acrylonitrile degradation as shown in fig 13f the s bi f tio2 sio2 composite maintained good degradation ability after five running cycles suggesting its high stability during the photoreaction cycles 258 table 14 reviewed and summarized other studies explaining the effect of running cycles on the photocatalytic degradation performance 4 10 type of semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction in recent years numerous single semiconductor photocatalysts like tio2 zno v2o5 wo3 zro2 etc have been applied to the photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants such as dyes pesticides phenolic compounds solvents pharmaceuticals and so on 274 among these tio2 is one of the most employed photocatalysts due to its activity high stability eco friendliness low cost and biocompatibility 275 276 despite these advantages its application was limited due to poor separation of photogenerated charge carriers and its absorption of only the uv fraction of the visible light sources thus many modification approaches such as heterojunction of semiconductor composites core shell or supporting structures dye sensitization and doping were developed to address these drawbacks by reducing the electron hole pair recombination rate expanding the visible light absorption and modifying the bandgap 277 279 in summary heterojunctions are considered to be the interface between two or more semiconductors with different band structures among the modification of the photocatalysts and design approaches the construction of the heterojunction system is one of the most commonly employed methods for photocatalyst fabrication due to its feasibility visible light response high activity and effectiveness in the spatial electron hole pair separation with lower recombination rate there are two types of semiconductors heterojunctions p n heterojunctions and non p n heterojunctions 280 281 the formation of junctions at the interface and space charge region resulting in a built in potential that can guide electrons and holes to move in opposite directions is referred to as a p n heterojunction as a result a good separation of electrons and holes is possible 282 the non p n heterojunction is based on the difference in the cb and vb levels of the two materials to realize electron and hole transfer non p n heterojunctions are classified into three types based on how electrons and holes are transferred in semiconductors type i type ii and z scheme heterojunction 283 the detailed discussions of their mechanisms are provided below on the other hand other visible light active semiconductors non tio2 based such as fe2o3 ag3po4 ferrites znin2s4 bismuth catalysts mos2 g c3n4 cds etc were intensively examined in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants 284 286 these photocatalysts possess high efficiency for absorption of light in the visible region due to their lower band gap energy but they also have a high charge carrier recombination rate low stability high aggregation rate and lower redox potentials in their vb and cb hindering their reliance upon in photoreaction applications 287 heterojunction between semiconductors is an efficient way to overcome this constraint by developing different types of heterojunctions using tio2 and non tio2 based composite photocatalysts such as bi2moo6 bivo4 cds bi2moo6 g c3n4 bi2wo6 znfe2o4 g c3n4 biobr g c3n4 bivo4 tio2 bi2o3 bi2wo6 g c3n4 cds znfe2o4 tio2 bivo4 tio2 bi2wo6 tio2 g c3n4 tio2 cds tio2 etc 288 292 zhou et al created a three layer heterojunction photocatalyst using ti32 oxo cluster ctoc batio3 cuss composite photocatalyst that can effectively harvest vibration energy and visible light source xenon lamp 300 w the three layer heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation activity 100 within 60 min against tetracycline tc this result is attributed to the photo piezoelectric synergistic effect which is formed by the polarized electric field between p n heterojunction p type cuss n type ctoc and the piezoelectric material batio3 fig 14a this heterojunction promotes the charge carries separation and reduces the electron hole recombination rate enhancing the photocatalytic performance 293 zhang et al reported z scheme cds agbr rgo car nanocomposite for rhodamine b 50 μmol l 1 degradation under a visible light source 500 w xe lamp car 10 showed enhanced photocatalytic performance 95 8 in 60 min against rhb compared with pure photocatalysts cds agbr and agbr rgo the trapping experiment showed that h o2 and oh exhibited significant contributions in the photodegradation of rhb the enhanced removal efficiency is caused by forming z scheme heterojunction with high potential redox ability promoting the production of o2 in the cb of cds and oh in the vb of agbr as shown in fig 14b 294 in other work dual z scheme heterojunction was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method that was composed of carbon quantum dots cqds decorated ceo2 g c3n4 v2o5 ccgv this composite exhibited excellent absorption of light in the visible region solar light and near infra red region through charge transfer via two channel dual z scheme which led to a sufficient reduction in recombination rate and up conversion effect of cqds 295 arora et al reported improved photocatalytic activity towards rhodamine b rhb ciprofloxacin cip and antibiotics by developing the semiconductor heterojunction of ag agbr composite supported by g in one system ag agbr g fig 14c in this heterojunction g acts as an electron acceptor while ag agbr acts as an electron donor thus the electrons can sufficiently transfer from ag agbr to g promoting the separation of electron hole and reducing the recombination rate which leads to enhancing the photocatalytic performance 296 other investigations for semiconductor semiconductor heterojunction can be summarized in table 15 a z scheme heterojunction of bon br agbr was firstly designed via simple two step hydrothermal precipitation method for the enhanced photocatalytic performance the as prepared bon br agbr possessed an enhanced photocatalytic activity for rb 19 degradation when compared with pure bon 13 82 times bon br 8 44 times and pure agbr 2 48 times under visible light respectively the role of z scheme heterojunction was confirmed by photoluminescence pl emission and photocurrent responses pc techniques the bon br agbr composite showed a low recombination rate as low pl intensity in addition a higher photocurrent intensity suggests a higher separation efficiency and photo generated ros the heterojunction between bon br and agbr exhibited more efficient migration of charge carriers which proved using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis technique that recorded smaller arc radius 297 5 conclusions and future perspectives organic pollutants like organic dyes pesticides phenol and phenolic compounds petroleum refinery wastewater pollutants etc have been proven to have a significant harmful impact on human health the aquatic system and microbes like heavy metals these organic contaminants are non biodegradable persistent toxic and recalcitrant these pollutants proved difficult to degrade using conventional methods such as biological decomposition electrochemical oxidation reduction floatation flocculation adsorption and precipitation due to their extremely complex structures these technologies can not completely remove the dyes from wastewater the photocatalytic ability of semiconductor heterojunction has been shown to be one of the most employed methods for the elimination of different organic pollutants in other hand it is important to optimize the amount of the photocatalyst during the photocatalytic process to avoid any additional dosage for the economic feasibility of photoreaction it should have a maximum efficiency with minimal photocatalyst concentration the photocatalytic degradation performance against colored chemicals like dyes increases as their concentration increases but after reaching a critical concentration level it begins to decrease moreover the solution ph can influence the catalytic performance by affecting the photocatalyst surface properties in addition the rate of photocatalytic degradation can be increased by increasing the light intensity the photocatalytic degradation activity of organic pollutants is positively related to raising the reaction temperature the photo degradation of organic pollutants by photolysis exhibited lower degradation activity compared with that of the photocatalysis process finally the removal of organic pollutants depends on several adsorption approaches like hydrogen bonding π π interactions acid base hydrophobic electrostatic and combinations of these interactions regardless we believe there are a few aspects that are both interesting and challenging for future development 1 until now the explanations of the photocatalytic mechanism have still been based on indirect proof and are not very clear thus new techniques and new ideas related to electron hole pair separation and direct characterization are still full of challenges 2 the heterojunction of semiconductors showed a sufficient reduction in the recombination rate of electron hole pairs but the negative impacts on the photocatalytic process such as carrier scattering at the interface should be investigated 3 adopting a rational heterojunction type number of components fabrication method and structure is full of challenges and interests 4 more studies are concerned with the preparation of composite materials with high removal efficiencies but their fabrication is more complicated and requires more expensive materials therefore the development of novel photocatalysts with lower band gap for visible light harvesting low cost large surface area environmentally friendly and large scale must be addressed 5 other environmental factors affecting photocatalytic degradation still need to be studied to design an ideal photoreactor with high photocatalytic efficiency and a cost effective process 6 we believe that this review is important for future enhancements to the photocatalytic performance by optimizing different operation parameters and selecting a suitable heterojunction for photocatalytic degradation of industrial organic pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

12994,biocomposites developed from lignocellulosic biomass have numerous potential applications in various sectors including food packaging and medical technologies wastewater treatment and purification however since the physicochemical properties of biocomposites are inferior to synthetic composites in various applications it has been imperative to enhance their properties by employing chemical and physical methods to modify their surface chemistry in most cases chemical methods have frequently been used due to the ability to form the intramolecular and intermolecular bonds between the polymers and the modifiers the aim of this review is to evaluate different methods used in the preparation of bio composites mainly those that are comprised of lignocellulosic derivatives and chitosan biopolymer in addition the review will critically looks at biocomposites as biosorbent materials in the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants in aqueous solutions by investigating the different classes different methods of preparation their advantages limitations and efficiency the review will also survey the different applications particularly the success in their deployment in the water purification and treatment keywords biocomposites lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biosorbents inorganic contaminants organic contaminants 1 introduction the term composite refers to a material prepared from mixing two or more constituents that differ markedly in terms of their physical and chemical properties in a composite the original constituents retain their identities and distinct properties however the composite will possess superior qualities which are preferential to those of the individual constituents composites can be naturally derived from different types of biomass or synthesized using different types of polymers synthetic composite in general synthetic composites are resilient to ordinary degradation and that can pose threat to ecological environment therefore it is important to improve or find alternative composite which are less toxic biodegradable cost effective sustainable and economical 1 2 where a composite is made up of at least one constituent that originates from a biological source plant microbial or animal or is biodegradable by microorganisms the composite is categorized as a biocomposite 3 for example de oliveira et al 4 mixed cellulose extracted from rice and oat husks with polyvinyl alcohol to produce a hydrogel biocomposite with high water absorption capacity 141 6 392 1 and opacity in most cases biomass especially lignocellulosic biomass forests products and agricultural by products are incinerated in order to clean the environment or generate energy to use in various industries 5 lignocellulosic biomass consists of chemical components that could be derivatized to produce valuable products which could be another alternative to manage this biomass 6 biocomposites that contains lignocellulosic derivatives have gain use in different applications such as film packaging in food industry 7 antibacterial wound dressing 8 and drug carrier 9 in medical industry and wastewater treatment as a biosorbent 10 there are several advantages of using natural materials like lignocellulosic derivatives as biosorbent in water or wastewater treatment such as low cost less toxic less sludge generated during operation and it is sustainable which is beneficial especially for developing countries 11 however the major disadvantage of lignocellulosic biomass derivatives as biosorbent is the poor adsorption capacity when compared to other synthetic adsorbents such as iron oxyhydroxide agglomerates adsorbent 12 and polypyrrole titanium iv phosphate nanocomposite 13 to improve the adsorption capacity various methods such as amination halogenation esterification etherification and oxidation are used to modify lignocellulosic biomass 14 although these methods are reported to enhance the adsorption capacity toxic chemicals are often used during modification which is one of the major drawbacks to address the aforementioned several studies have modified the lignocellulosic derived biomass with chitosan biopolymer to enhance the adsorption capacity of the material 15 16 17 18 chitosan is a derivative of chitin and it contains amine functional groups that can react chemically with various contaminants in aqueous solutions 19 it has been used as biosorbent for removal of various contaminants however the major disadvantage of chitosan as biosorbent is the poor mechanical strength and gets easily dissolved in acidic solution 10 in contrast although lignocellulosic biomass lacks active sites to remove contaminants in aqueous solution it has better mechanical properties for these reasons several studies have focused on combining lignocellulosic biomass derivatives such as biochar cellulose hemicellulose and lignin with chitosan biopolymer to produce the biocomposite to remove various types of contaminants from aqueous solution lignocellulosic biomass derivative chitosan bio composites are either formed using a physical grafting or chemical grafting method 4 however the latter is often recommended due to the resistance against friction and better compatibility 20 these bio composites are produced in different formats such as powders beads films sponge and hollow fibers 21 the aim of this review is to evaluate various techniques employed in the past few years 2015 2021 to form a bio composite comprised of lignocellulosic biomass derivatives and chitosan furthermore we will also evaluate the physicochemical properties of the bio composites and their mechanism on the adsorption of inorganic and organic contaminants in aqueous solutions 2 source and different types of biomass biomass is any organic renewable material derived from plants or animals 22 23 24 and these materials are found from different sources including agricultural waste industrial wastes and municipal solid wastes 25 among these types of wastes agricultural wastes and industrial wastes have been widely used to produce valuable products such as bioethanol enzymes bioplastic and biosorbent 26 these derived products from biomass have several advantages when compared to synthetic based products due to their renewability less toxicity and biodegradability 27 in addition using these low cost materials influences a circular green economy and cleaner production 28 2 1 industrial biomass industries are the backbone of the economic growth in many countries around the world however in the midst of producing different types of material by products such as sludge and saw dust from wood industry are often produced in large quantities 29 furthermore fishing industry is one of the industries which generate a lot of biomass wastes for example crustaceans such as crabs shrimp shells and lobsters are some of the by products produced from this industry 30 these wastes are rich with chitin which can be converted into value added product such as chitosan derivatives of chitosan have a potential to be used in various applications like synthesis of biosorbent and film 2 2 agricultural biomass agricultural practices generate a lot of residues that contains various types of lignocellulosic biomass 26 for examples sugarcane bagasse residues 31 banana peels residues 32 rice and oat husks residues 4 are among the wastes often produced in abundant lignocellulosic biomass is mainly comprised of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin as well as trace amounts of extractives that are crosslinked together by intra and inter hydrogen bonds and vander waal forces 33 these components especially cellulose hemicellulose and lignin are comprised of different functional groups which could be potentially functionalized to produce different types of value added products 34 3 chitosan biopolymer chitosan is a derivative of chitin and the second most abundant biopolymer on earth after cellulose 35 deacetylated chitin polymer is called chitosan when the degree of deacetylation is greater than 50 and molecular weight ranges between 10 and 103 kda in commercial products 10 this biopolymer is biodegradable biocompatible renewable and has antimicrobial properties 36 it is a polysaccharide consisting of a β 1 4 linkages of n acetyl d glucosamine and d glucosamine 22 18 37 fig 2 it contains high ratio of hydroxyl groups and amine groups which could be functionalized to produce new properties 38 these functional groups interact with pollutants either through the ion exchange or coordination process for example the amino and hydroxyl groups could chelate with various metallic ions in aqueous solution 39 nevertheless the effectiveness of pristine chitosan as an adsorbent in water treatment is limited by its poor mechanical strength 18 however various additives such as cellulose 40 hemicellulose 41 lignin 42 and crosslinking agents 43 are synthesized with chitosan to improve their properties hence enhancing the adsorption capacity 3 1 extraction of chitosan from crustaceans fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of conventional method used to fractionate chitin and chitosan from crustaceans chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid are used to deproteinate and mineralize respectively 44 furthermore isolated chitin treated with a high concentration of naoh to deacetylate the acetyl groups and that results in the formation of chitosan as presented in fig 2 al hoqani et al 45 extracted the chitosan from shrimp shells using different concentrations of acid and alkaline solutions dried powder of shrimp shells 1 g was subjected into various concentrations of hcl 50 ml 3 9 1 10 w v and stirred for 1 h at different temperatures 25 c 55 c after that treated material was washed with water to remove the residuals subsequently the demineralized sample was treated with an aqueous solution of different concentrations of naoh 50 ml 20 60 1 10 w v at various temperatures 80 c 110 c for 3 h then washed with distilled water and various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide 50 ml 10 30 1 10 w v for 3 h and dried overnight at 50 c to get the chitosan extracted chitin was treated with different concentrations of naoh 10 20 30 and 50 1 10 w v in an autoclave for 15 min at 121 c fourier transform near infrared ft nir spectroscopy was used to analyze the extracted chitin and chitosan according to the ft nir spectra 3 hcl at 25 c and 50 naoh at 110 c was the optimum parameters to isolate chitin in addition optimum concentrations to decolorize and deacetylate the isolated chitin were 30 h202 and 50 naoh respectively however these chemicals are toxic and cause corrosion in autoclave yang et al 46 extracted the chitin from shrimp shells using hot water and carbonic acid dried shrimp shell powder was treated in the autoclave at desired temperature and time solid residues were recovered using a centrifuge 1000 rpm 5 min washed with distilled water and dried at 70 c for 24 h prior to the next step next the deproteinized shrimp shell powder was placed in the autoclave containing distilled water and the solution mixture continues to stir in room temperature in the presence of carbon dioxide co2 gas this method is rendered environmentally friendly when compared to other conventional methods 4 components of lignocellulosic biomass 4 1 cellulose biopolymer cellulose is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear homopolymer of β 1 4 d glucose unit linked by the glycosidic bond 10 fig 4a each unit of d glucose c6h10o5 n is corkscrewed 180 with respect to its neighbors 47 it is consisting of free hydroxyl oh groups attached at c 2 c 3 and c 6 however these hydroxyl groups have distinct reactivity 11 for example the hydroxyl at position c 6 is more reactive because it is attached to the primary carbon this biopolymer is produced either in micrometers or nanometers scale and both have their own advantages and disadvantages these cellulose derivatives comprised of a crystalline and amorphous region however a large portion is presented at the crystalline region 33 the major advantage of cellulose in micrometer size it is cost effective since is produced in large quantities during industrial production 48 however the disadvantages of cellulose in micrometers are poor mechanical properties like strength and low surface area in contrast the cellulose in nanometers scale nanowhiskers and nanofibers has a high surface area good thermal stability low density high tensile strength and elastic modulus 49 nevertheless converting of cellulose into nanomaterials especially cellulose nanowhiskers has certain shortcomings such as corrosion of hydrolysis reactor since strong acids like sulphuric hydrochloric phosphoric hydromic and nitric acids are often used 10 these acids are also detrimental to animal and human health if the insufficiently treated wastewater can reach the aquatic environment another major drawback that limits the industrial production of nanomaterials is the low yield during production 48 all these could limit their broad application in industries therefore to minimize the production cost researchers are focusing on using environmental friendly methods 10 for example alternative hydrolysis techniques such as enzymatic hydrolysis are used as it does not produce hazardous waste 50 4 2 lignin biopolymer lignin is one of the major components found in the lignocellulosic biomass and the second abundant on earth after the cellulose biopolymer however the content of lignin differs depending on the type of plant biomass for example wood biomass and softwood biomass like sugarcane bagasse contain 16 24 and 24 25 respectively this biopolymer is hydrophobic and comprising mainly of three major phenolic components fig 4c 51 which include p hydroxyphenyl h guaiacyl g and syringyl s 52 held together by different linkages such as ethers and carbon carbon bonds 53 54 these phenolic compounds of lignin influence the lignocellulose to be resistant against enzyme or chemical hydrolysis furthermore lignin biopolymer is non toxic biodegradable contains antioxidant and antimicrobial properties therefore due to these aforementioned properties different composites containing lignin are produced and used in various applications like biosorbents in water treatment 55 4 3 hemicellulose biopolymer hemicellulose is a heterogeneous biopolymer that accounts for about 20 35 of the lignocellulosic biomass 56 unlike cellulose hemicellulose contains shortly branched and has a low degree of polymerization which is approximated between 80 and 200 fig 4b 53 it is comprised of pentoses xylose arabinose hexoses mannose glucose galactose fucose and uronic acids glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid however these components vary depending on the source or type of lignocellulosic biomass 57 for example hardwood biomass mainly consists of o acetyl 4 o methylglucurono b d xylans whereas the soft wood is predominated by acetylated galacto glucomannans 53 therefore these properties make hemicellulose to be potentially useful in different applications including thermoplastics hydrogels additives in paper making and drug carriers in medicine 58 nevertheless the major disadvantage of hemicellulose it easily dissolves in various solvents such as water however the addition of different additives could enhance its properties 41 5 pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass 5 1 extraction of cellulose from lignocellulose biomass pre treatment is the limiting step in biorefinery during the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into valuable products such as cellulose lignin hemicellulose and biofuel cellulose biopolymer is isolated using different methods such as physical chemical biological and physicochemical pretreatments 59 fig 3 however in respect with the biological treatment will only focus on the physical chemical and physicochemical pretreatments since are often used to extract the cellulose from lignocellulosic biomass the efficiency of these methods depends on the type of biomass to be treated 60 in addition the selection of methods also depends on various factors such as economic feasibility and environmental impact pre treatment destroys the intra and inter molecular hydrogen bonds of lignocellulosic biomass which fractionate biopolymers into different parts as presented in fig 4 table 1 shows the content of cellulose extracted from various types of lignocellulosic biomass 5 1 1 physical extraction physical treatment is the most environmentally friendly method that is often employed during the first stage of pretreatment different techniques that are used during physical treatment includes milling chipping grinding freezing and radiation 51 these techniques alter the structure of the lignocellulosic biomass which enhances the surface area of the biomass and reduces the degree of polymerization dp although physical pretreatment is the most environmentally friendly technique the disadvantages of these methods are the demanding of energy and longer pretreatment time to achieve the intended product 5 1 2 chemical extraction chemical treatment is the most employed method due to the ability to reduce the content of hemicellulose and lignin while enhancing the content of cellulose biopolymer 60 acid and alkaline solutions are the most used chemicals in biorefinery 67 acid generally solubilized the hemicellulose by cleaving the arabinoxylan and acetyl groups 60 whereas the alkaline react with coniferyl sinapyl and coumaryl groups of lignin structure which leads to the dissolution and breaking of crosslinking between these respective monomers 31 however the effectiveness of these chemicals depends on the type of lignocellulosic biomass 5 1 2 1 acid extraction brienzo et al 60 extracted cellulose from 19 different materials of sugarcane bagasse using dilute acid dried sugarcane bagasse was added into separate reactors containing sulphuric acid and treated at different temperatures 150 c 160 c and 180 c for about 15 min after that acid treated sugarcane bagasse was washed with the large volume of distilled water to get rid of the residues they reported that high temperature was crucial in the removal of hemicelluloses in most of the samples except for few after treatment the average content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 66 77 1 55 and 29 22 respectively garcia et al 68 used the weak organic acid citric acid to isolate the cellulose from raw sugarcane bagasse dried sugarcane bagasse was transferred into different round bottom flask containing various concentrations 0 35 wt to 11 6 wt of citric acid next the solution mixture was treated under atmospheric pressure at 100 c at different time 17 6 min 102 4 min then the mixture solution was filtered washed with distilled water oven dried and stored in sealed zip lock plastic bag prior to characterizations and application they reported that high concentration of citric acid and longer treatment was crucial during the isolation of cellulose additionally the major advantage of this method it uses renewable acid which is sustainable and less toxic however the major disadvantages are the demanding of high energy and longer pretreating period 5 1 2 2 alkaline extraction the removal of lignin biopolymer is important as it further reduces the recalcitrance of lignocellulose biomass for this reason researchers have developed methods to reduce both the hemicellulose and lignin biopolymers for example wang et al 64 investigated the effect of sodium hydroxide naoh in the treatment of herbaceous wheat straw corn straw and sugarcane bagasse softwood cypress and hardwood pterocarpus soyauxii biomass lignocellulosic biomass was subjected into separate solution of naoh 2 w v ratio 1 10 w v at 80 c for 2 h after that sodium treated biomass was filtered washed with distilled water to remove the residuals and oven dried at 60 c after treatment more than 70 removal of lignin was recorded on treated herbaceous biomass and among the treated herbaceous biomass sodium treated corn cobs shows highest removal recorded content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 60 7 22 5 and 6 5 respectively lignin removal on softwood biomass and hardwood was 16 and 39 respectively a significant difference of lignin removal was attributed to the components of lignin contained in these different types of biomass herbaceous and hardwood contained three principal phenylpropane units namely guaiacyl g syringyl s and p hydroxyphenyl h softwood biomass only consists of g and h units which could be responsible for recalcitrance of this biomass marković nikolić et al 61 explored green liquids na2co3 and nacl to extract the cellulose from lignocellulose biomass l vulgaris shell dried shell 5 g was treated with 100 ml of weak alkaline solution 1 na2co3 and 1 nacl for 4 h at 25 c next the solution mixture was stirred at a speed of 150 rpm under the atmospheric pressure and subsequently washed with distilled water then dried at 80 c after pretreatment the content of cellulose and lignin increased which was attributed to the dissolution of hemicellulose 5 1 2 3 alkaline and acid extractions a combination of alkaline solution and acid solution has been reported as the most effective method to remove lignin and hemicellulose thiangtham et al 65 used the combination of dilute alkaline peroxide and dilute acid to extract the microcrystalline cellulose from sugarcane bagasse dried sugarcane bagasse was treated with alkaline peroxide 10 w v for 4 h at 80 c to remove the lignin hemicellulose and some organics to remove the coloring matters sodium treated material was subjected into a bleaching agent h2o2 10 v v 0 5 m naoh for 1 h at 80 c solid particles was recovered by filtering and washed with distilled water to remove the remaining residues subsequently bleached material was treated with hydrochloric acid 4 m hcl for 1 h at 80 c to obtain the microcrystalline cellulose after pretreatment the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 87 3 6 9 and 6 5 respectively ayeni and daramola 63 fractionated cellulose hemicellulose and lignin from corn cobs lignocellulosic biomass using six different pretreatment methods a certain grams of dried corn cobs were subjected into the aqueous solutions containing a 1 v v h2o2 b 0 1 g naoh g dry biomass c 0 1 g ca oh 2 g dry biomass d 1 v v h2o2 and 0 2 g naoh g dry biomass e 1 v v h2o2 and 0 6 g ca oh 2 g dry biomass and f 0 1 g 10 w w h2so4 g dry biomass all experiments were conducted in the autoclave with a pressure of 0 14 mpa and the reaction was performed at 120 c for about 30 min among these solutions a combination of hydrogen peroxide h202 and naoh was the most effective method to fractionate polysaccharides in this method the recorded content of cellulose hemicellulose lignin and ash was 58 66 17 37 12 98 and 3 44 respectively all the other methods the content of extracted cellulose was below 50 de oliveira et al 4 extracted cellulose from rice husk and oat husk using a dilute sodium hydroxide dilute acetic acid and dilute sodium chlorite a specific grams of milled husks from rice and oak were subjected into a jacketed glass reactor containing a solution of sodium hydroxide 4 w v and the mixture was stirred for 4 h at 90 c subsequently sodium treated husks was bleached four times using the solution mixture of sodium hydroxide acetic acid and an aqueous solution of sodium chlorite at 90 c for 4 h after pretreatment of rice husk the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 93 1 4 2 and 0 8 respectively whereas the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin on treated oat husk was 94 1 1 4 and 1 0 respectively although a chemical method is efficient when compared to counterpart physical method major disadvantages are the high cost of chemicals and their toxicity towards the environment therefore it is important to use non or less toxic chemicals to protect the ecological environment 5 1 3 physicochemical extraction different types of physicochemical pretreatment that are used include hydrothermal pretreatment or liquid hot water and steam explosion treatment route 69 these methods are environmentally friendly as they only uses heat and water to fractionate cellulose hemicellulose and lignin from lignocellulosic biomass 70 lee and park 66 compared the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment and non thermal pre treatment milling in fractionating the cellulose hemicellulose and lignin from sunflower residues stem leaf and flower dried sunflower residues was subjected into a stainless steel vessel containing 300 ml of distilled water and treated for 30 min at different temperatures 160 c to 220 c solid residues were separated from liquid using a centrifuge instrument dried and grounded into a desired particle size separately the dried sunflower was milled into desired particles size a significant difference was observed between the two methods after hydrothermal treatment the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 78 1 3 0 and 18 9 respectively whereas after non hydrothermal pretreatment the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 61 1 27 6 and 11 3 respectively hydrothermal treatment was effective as other reported chemical methods however the demands of high energy are the major disadvantage associated to this technique 5 2 extraction of lignin from lignocellulosic biomass during biorefinery a large volume of by products are generated and lignin biopolymer forms a large part of this waste solution in most cases this waste gets burned to provide heat and energy for the particular industry 71 due to the aforementioned valorization of lignin has gained interest in various applications including medicine as wound dressing 72 and water treatment technology as biosorbent table 2 represents different methods such as organosolv acid solution alkaline solution and microwaves which are often employed to extract the lignin from lignocellulosic biomass the quality of lignin produced differs as it depends on the effectiveness of selected methods and the source of biomass 73 furthermore these methods are reported to have their advantages and disadvantages for example organosolv produces high yield of lignin but with a highly modified structure acid treatment has the advantage of hydrolysing other carbohydrates however undesired condensation reaction might also occur in addition acid causes the corrosion of equipment and ionic liquid could be recovered after extraction however the process of extraction is complex as compared to other methods 52 5 2 1 alkaline and acid extractions ratanasumarn and chitpraser 74 employed the response surface methodology rsm to investigate the optimum parameters for the extraction of lignin from sugarcane bagasse using an alkaline solution sugarcane bagasse 0 5 g was added into separate autoclaves containing different concentrations of sodium hydroxide 3 7 w v prior to the pretreating process at various temperatures 110 130 c and different times 30 60 min after subjected to alkaline hydrolysis extracts were filtered using the nylon filter 0 45 μm followed by the dialysis against distilled water 50 1 volume ratio at room temperature to reach the neutral ph solution and the collected solid product was placed at 20 c they found that the optimum parameters were sodium hydroxide solution concentration of 7 w v temperature of 135 c and time of 47 92 min in addition the recorded extraction efficiency weight average molecular weight and a number of average molecular weight was 78 93 3954 da and 2025 da respectively ftir analysis was used to confirm the functional groups of extracted lignin and the bands at 1592 cm 1 1511 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 were attributed to the aromatic skeletal vibrations of lignin whereas the bands at 1461 cm 1 1383 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 were correlated to the ch deformations the vibration of hydroxyl phenolic groups oh and conjugated carbonyl groups co respectively in addition ftir analysis also shows that the extracted lignin had some impurities which were related to the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and some carbohydrate sugars frança et al 52 extracted lignin from cashew apple bagasse cab using different types of pretreatment methods including dilute acid da acid alkali aa and alkaline hydrogen peroxide ahp in da extraction cab was loaded into an autoclave containing 0 6 m h2so4 solution and treated for 15 min at 121 c then the liquid containing lignin was recovered and washed with distilled water a combination of acid and alkaline was conducted using 0 6 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh respectively and the process of extraction was conducted for 15 min at 121 c in each step sulphuric acid was expected to remove the hemicellulose by hydrolysing the ether bonds in lignin phenolics carbohydrates complexes whereas sodium hydroxide produces the liquid solution which is free of unwanted carbohydrates ahp extraction was conducted by loading cab in the mixture solution containing sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide 4 3 v v at ph 11 then the mixture solution was treated using the orbital shaker for 6 h at 35 c lignin was recovered and washed with distilled water to remove the residuals lignin removal rates for da aa and ahp were 11 7 98 0 and 96 9 respectively 5 2 2 alkaline and ultrasound extractions lignin was extracted from rice straw using the combination of ultrasound and alkaline solution 75 rice straw was sonicated at different times intervals 0 40 min in the presence of 2 m naoh solution at 90 c then suspension mixture continued to stir for 1 5 h at 90 c and filtrated using the nylon cloth the filtrate was acidified before been precipitated with three volumes of ethanol 95 for 6 h next solid rich in hemicellulose was washed with ethanol 70 and air dried to recover the lignin dried material was acidified to ph 1 5 using hcl followed by washing and freeze drying they reported that ultrasound has effectively enhanced the lignin separation yield from the rice straw with 84 9 recorded 5 2 3 organosolv and acid extractions sohni et al 55 extracted lignin from the residues of palm kernel shell pks biomass dried pks 5 g was added into a flask containing the solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran 90 ml and 2 n h2so4 10 ml then stirred for 30 min at 70 c to recover the lignin the solution was filtered and tetrahydrofuran recovered using a rotary evaporator after that the filtrate containing dissolved lignin was slowly added into warm distilled water before centrifuging freitas et al 54 employed the green method to produce lignin of different size scales including microparticles and nanoparticles they extracted lignin from corncobs using two sequential pretreatment methods firstly biomass was subjected under liquid hot water at 200 c for 30 min and then treated with ethanol 60 v v solution at 140 c for 40 min therefore crude lignin was treated with ethanol 100 and the dissolved lignin was dripped into the water to produce different particles the solvent was removed through vacuum evaporation process at a constant temperature of 40 c and the remaining lignin was freeze dried to get the final particle size in another study chen et al 76 extracted lignin from switchgrass using deep eutectic solvent des switchgrass 10 g was added into a glass bottle containing the solvent of choline chloride ethylene glycol 250 ml and acidified with 1 h2so4 before been placed into a preheated oil bath then the solution mixture containing various concentrations of switch grass 10 wt 20 wt and 27 was pretreated in different periods 30 min and 45 min at 130 c subsequently 50 ml of acetone and water 50 50 v v was added and the solution was filtered using the vacuum then the filtrate containing lignin was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and the recovered lignin was washed with the solution mixture of ethanol and water 50 50 v v to remove the residuals in another work masilompane et al 77 isolated lignin from the black liquor generated from the pulp and paper industry to recover the lignin the solution was acidified to ph 3 using sulphuric acid then the acidified solution was placed at 4 c for 3 days to allow appropriate coagulation and precipitation subsequently the solution mixture was centrifuged washed with sulphuric acid and distilled water to remove the residues respectively 5 2 4 organosolv and microwave extractions the lignin was extracted from wood powder using the combination of ionic liquid and microwave irradiation by sun et al 78 and they obtained the solution which was rich in carbohydrates then the filtrate was slowly dropped into the acidified water ph 2 to precipitate the lignin finally the recovered solid was washed with distilled water to remove the remaining residues they reported that approximately 45 8 of lignin was extracted within 40 min at 140 c this method was reported to be green and economical as the ionic liquid was recovered from the solution using the evaporation process angelini et al 57 isolated the lignin from phragmites australis common reed using steam explosion and microwave assisted in the presence of g valerolactone gvl as organosolv this method was reported to be more greenish because there was no addition of acid as reported in other techniques 5 3 extraction of hemicellulose from lignocellulosic biomass hemicellulose polysaccharides are often treated as waste along with lignin and other extractives during the process of biorefinery this biopolymer is covalently crosslinked with the lignin and cellulose through hydrogen linkage consequently robust methods are required to isolate these biopolymers 79 techniques that are used often to isolate hemicellulose from lignocellulosic biomass are tabulated in table 2 5 3 1 alkaline extraction alkaline is regarded as one of the most effective methods used for the extraction of hemicellulose due to the ability to disrupt the ethers and esters bonds linking the hemicellulose and lignin in the plant cell 53 58 geng et al 53 used the alkaline method to extract hemicellulose from different types of biomass including hardwood biomass and soft wood biomass biomass was added into a 250 ml boiling flask containing sodium hydroxide 10 w v solution and treated for 3 h at 50 c then the solution mixture was vacuum filtered and the filtrate was adjusted to ph 5 using acetic acid subsequently the solution was precipitated using ethanol 95 washed with ethanol 70 filtered using a filter paper and freeze dried they found that high content of hemicellulose was extracted from softwood biomass 23 26 as compared to the hardwood biomass 17 19 in another work farhat et al 58 employed the alkaline method to isolate hemicellulose from bleached hardwood pulp b hwp and partially delignified switchgrass swg lignin was extracted from the switchgrass before it was subjected to hemicellulose isolation milled swg was treated with a solution mixture containing naoh 2 wt and anhydrous alcohol 70 and this was conducted at 75 c for 2 5 h using a mechanical stirrer to recover the solid solution mixture was vacuum filtered using a whatman filter paper after that partially swg was treated with different concentrations of sodium hydroxide 3 wt 7 wt 10 wt 13 wt and 17 wt for 3 h at 50 c to extract the hemicellulose b hwp was also treated separately with sodium hydroxide 10 at a similar time and temperature solution mixture containing solubilized hemicellulose was filtered using a vacuum filter and the solution ph of filtrate was adjusted between 5 and 6 using acetic acid 25 then the solution mixture was treated with ethanol 70 to further precipitate the material and allowed to settle for 2 days without stirring the final product was filtered and freeze dried to yield hemicellulose powder they reported that low extraction of hemicellulose about 40 yield in swg when using 3 wt of naoh whereas high extraction about 72 yield recorded when using 10 wt of naoh this shows that alkaline solution was crucial in breaking down the esters and ether bonds connecting lignin and hemicellulose biopolymers however lower yield was recorded when the concentration of alkaline 13 wt and 17 wt increases which was attributed to the degradation of hemicellulose 5 3 2 ultrasound and acid extractions mohammadabadi and javanbakh 80 used ultrasound and dilute acid to extract the hemicellulose biopolymer from barley straws waste dried barley straws were added into an erlenmeyer flask containing sulphuric acid 3 7 wt and placed into an ultrasonic bath for 40 min at 80 c subsequently the solution mixture was stirred for 23 min at 90 c prior to filtration after that sodium hydroxide was added to adjust the solution to ph 7 then the adjusted solution was transferred into another flask containing ethanol stirred for 6 h and the solid was recovered and dried at 50 c 6 preparation of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites for the removal of inorganic contaminants different techniques such as blending method 16 solution casting method 81 freeze drying method 82 sol gel phase inversion method 83 and electrospinning method 84 are used during the preparation of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites to validate the efficacy of selected method different instruments including fourier transform infrared ftir x ray diffractometer xrd scanning electron microscope sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and thermogravimetric analysis tga are used to analyze the physicochemical properties of the biocomposite 6 1 synthesis of biochar chitosan biocomposite biochar is produced through a slow or fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass at the temperature ranging between 300 c and 800 c in the absence of oxygen 17 recently researchers have been focusing on using biochar as adsorbents for the removal of various soluble contaminants from aqueous solutions 85 however similarly to other lignocellulosic derivatives raw biochar contained low adsorption capacity and for this reason different techniques and modifying agents including chitosan are used to enhance the effectiveness of biochar adsorbent 16 6 1 1 blending technique huang et al 85 employed the blending method to prepare the crosslinked biochar chitosan composite and used it for the adsorption of phosphate in aqueous solutions they converted the biochar from wheat straw reacted it with chitosan solution quaternary ammonium salt and lanthanum to form the biocomposite composite was crosslinked with glutaraldehyde using two different approaches in the first approach amine of chitosan was directly reacted with the crosslinking agent the second approach amine was protected with the formaldehyde before reacted with the crosslinking agent masih et al 16 converted rice husk into biochar and blended it with chitosan solution to form the gel which was used for the adsorption of copper cu ii from aqueous solution prepared chitosan solution was blended with rice husk biochar 100 g at a speed of 150 rpm for 24 h then the formed gel was washed with deionized water and oven dried prior to the next step dried material was treated with the solution of naoh 0 5 for 3 h washed with deionized water and oven dried although the modified lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites shows the potential to remove various contaminants from aqueous solution separating the material after adsorption remain a challenge however incorporating magnetic particles within the composite reported to enhance the separation between the liquid and saturated material xiao et al 17 prepared the magnetic composite which was comprised of biochar from loofah sponge iron chloride and chitosan for the adsorption of chromium cr vi and cu ii from aqueous solutions different concentrations of chitosan 0 04 w v 0 06 w v 0 08 w v and 0 1 w v were prepared mixed with the suspension of magnetic biochar and glutaraldehyde solution for about 30 min at 60 c subsequently the solution mixture was adjusted to ph 11 using naoh and continue to stir for the next 2 h this method is not only simple but faster comparing to other reported techniques 6 1 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite xiao et al 17 reported the difference between the unmodified biochar and modified magnetic biochar chitosan composite ftir spectrum of modified composite shows the peaks at 3340 cm 1 and 569 cm 1 that were due to the presence of nh stretching bands and feo bands respectively according to the sem analysis the morphology of modified biochar contained pore channels and internal mesopores whereas the pristine biochar exhibits smooth surface huang et al 85 found that according to the ftir analysis the spectrum of unprotected amine composite shows the strong band at 1658 4 cm 1 which was correlated to the cn bond therefore this demonstrated that the amine functional groups reacted with the carbonyl groups of glutaraldehyde they reported that amine was significant during the adsorption of phosphate as lower removal and higher removal was recorded for unprotected amine composite and protected amine composite respectively 6 2 synthesis of cellulose chitosan biocomposite 6 2 1 blending and solution casting techniques the blending and casting methods were employed by rahmi et al 19 to prepare the chitosan cellulose biocomposite film for adsorption of cadmium cd ii ions from aqueous solution they investigated the impact of adding different content of cellulose extracted from oil palm empty fruit in the formation of biocomposite film a chitosan solution was prepared and mixed at room temperature with various concentrations of cellulose suspension 0 1 10 30 and 50 w w to form the biocomposite film to form a film solution mixture was added into a polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic container and dried for 24 h at room temperature advantage of this method is facile and it requires less energy as it performed in ambient temperature 6 2 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite rahmi et al 19 reported that 10 of cellulose was enough to enhance the mechanical strength of the chitosan cellulose biocomposite film xrd shows the cellulose chitosan biocomposite has low crystallinity when compared to the isolated pristine cellulose and chitosan biopolymers therefore this indicated that the biocomposite was amorphous which was beneficial for the adsorption of cd ii according to sem analysis the morphology of biocomposite film shows a homogenous but rough surface was observed after the addition of cellulose particles 6 2 2 blending and freeze drying techniques the freeze drying method was employed by li et al 40 to develop a chitosan nanofabricated cellulose cs nfc aerogel for the adsorption of lead pb in aqueous solution nanofibrillated cellulose suspensions were collected from the local company tianjin haojia cellulose co ltd chitosan solution 2 wt was prepared using acetic acid 1 v v and mixed with the suspension of nanofibrillated cellulose nfc then solution mixture was vigorously blended at a speed of 2000 rpm the formed mixture was added into the cylindrical ptfe mold and frozen using liquid nitrogen aerogel was formed by placing the frozen mixture in a shelf lyophilizer for 24 h prepared biocomposite was washed with naoh 2 wt solution and deionized water to remove the residual zhang et al 86 also used the freeze drying technique to prepare the crosslinked chitosan cellulose biocomposite sponge for the adsorption of mercury hg ii from aqueous solution however unlike the method reported by li et al 40 they obtained their intended composite in few hours chitosan solution and polyvinyl alcohol pva was prepared in a beaker pva was added into the mixture as a supporting filler and also for the formation of pores structure subsequently different volume 7 5 75 ml of cellulose suspension 2 wt was added into the solution and stirred for 1 h after that glutaraldehyde was slowly added as a crosslinking agent and continues to stir for 1 h to obtain the sponge the homogenous mixture was lyophilized at 67 c and 1 pa yang et al 87 synthesized the cellulose chitosan composites hydrogels that were used as sorbents for the removal of copper cu2 from aqueous solution cellulose and chitosan biopolymers were transferred into a glass bottle containing the lithium bromide libr 60 wt solution and stirred for 1 min in room temperature the total concentration of cellulose chitosan dissolved in libr was 2 wt however the cellulose to chitosan loading ratio were varied 37 63 50 50 75 25 80 20 90 10 and 100 0 respectively next the mixture solution was blended under high temperature 110 c for 4 min to dissolve the cellulose and chitosan subsequently the solution mixture was poured into a dish and allowed to cool to form the gel after that the hydrogel was washed with the distilled water to remove the salt of libr and to regenerate the cellulose and chitosan then the hydrogel composite was solvent exchanged with water ethanol and tert butanol prior to freeze drying 6 2 2 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite li et al 40 reported that the cs nfc aerogel biocomposite had the highly porous structure after employing the freeze drying technique which was favorable for the adsorption of pb from aqueous solution ftir analysis confirms the addition of new functional groups the spectrum of cs nfc shows that the peak at 1560 cm 1 gets weakened which was attributed to the interaction between the amine n h of chitosan and hydroxyl groups of cellulose zhang et al 86 applied the xps analysis to investigate the interaction within chitosan cellulose composite and they found that formation was through the schiff base reaction cn 287 9 ev in addition modified sponge exhibits the absorption band at 1638 cm 1 which was also attributed to the cn bonds it was found that adding more volume of cellulose suspensions decreases the removal of hg ii in aqueous solutions however the cellulose was critical in enhancing the thermal stability of the composite yang et al 87 reported that increasing the cellulose loading in the cellulose chitosan hydrogel composite enhances the density of hydrogel while decreasing the surface area in addition composite hydrogel shows high mechanical strength which was attributed to the interaction or formation of strong bond between the hydroxyl group oh of cellulose and nitrogen in amine group nh2 of chitosan furthermore bet analysis shows that the addition of chitosan in the composite hydrogel increases the surface area however the pore size distribution curve of the composite was smaller than that of cellulose hydrogel which was related to the strong bonding between functional groups of cellulose and chitosan biopolymers according to the sem analysis the cellulose chitosan composite hydrogel and pure cellulose hydrogel had different morphology with the former hydrogel showing a thicker framework than the latter hydrogel therefore this shows that the synthesized composite hydrogel had better improved properties which are potential for adsorption of metal ions 6 3 synthesis of hemicellulose chitosan biocomposite 6 3 1 blending and freeze drying techniques wu et al 41 synthesized the crosslinked biocomposite resin consisting of carboxymethyl chitosan cmc and hemicellulose hc for the adsorption of ni ii cd ii cu ii hg ii mn vii and cr vi from aqueous solution the interaction between the cmc and hc was reported to occur through the schiff based reaction process in another study wu et al 38 prepared the ternary biocomposite comprised of carboxymethyl chitosan cmc hemicellulose hc and nanosized tio2 chnt for the removal of ni ii cd ii cu ii hg ii mn vii and cr vi from aqueous solution tio2 nanoparticles powder was added into a flask containing a solution of glacial acetic acid 50 ml 2 v v and sodium dodecyl sulfate 56 mg then the solution mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature subsequently cmc 1 5 g was added into the solution and stirred for 4 h after that the solution mixture was exposed to ultrasonic treatment for 15 min in each half hour intervals next hc 6 g was added into the suspension temperature was raised to 100 c and stirred for 2 h under reflux to obtain a hydrogel then the hydrogel was collected and heated for 7 h in the oven under atmospheric pressure at 40 c washed with distilled water and freeze dried for 24 h at 50 c 6 3 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite wu et al 41 found that after employing the blending and freeze dying process synthesized biocomposite comprising of carboxylmethyl chitosan cmc and hemicellulose hc shows different properties as compared to the pristine cmc and hc polymers ftir analysis shows a broad signal peak at 1043 cm 1 which was attributed to the stretching and vibration of co cc or coh found in hemicellulose polysaccharides whereas the cmc spectrum shows the peaks at 1629 cm 1 and 1401 cm 1 corresponding to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching of carboxyl functional groups synthesized biocomposite exhibits a new peak at 1644 cm 1 that was due to the cn groups therefore this shows that the reaction between cmc and hc was through a schiff base reaction moreover according to the sem analysis synthesized composite shows the morphology with a connected 3d structure and open pores structure the formation of pores was attributed to various factors such as freezing rate wu et al 38 reported that according to sem analysis the surface of chnt was very smooth which was correlated to the addition of tio2 nanoparticles in addition bet specific surface area 430 m2 g of synthesized chnt was increased while the porosity was reported to reach a maximum of 90 after the addition of tio2 nanoparticles this shows that the addition of nanoparticles significantly influenced the final properties of the synthesized biocomposite 6 4 synthesis of lignin chitosan biocomposite 6 4 1 blending and free radical polymerization techniques the free radical polymerization method was used by mu et al 88 to synthesize the biocomposites comprising of lignosulfonate and chitosan csl for the adsorption of copper ion cu ii and cobalt ion co ii from aqueous solution sodium sulfonate 0 75 g was dissolved into deionized water 30 ml and subsequently blended with chitosan 2 5 v v solution using the magnetic stir at 30 c after that acrylic acid 10 ml n n methylenedipropylamide 0 1 g and ammonium persulfate 0 1 g were added into the above solution mixture the temperature was raised to 60 c and continue to stir for 3 h under nitrogen condition during the process of heating and mixing sulfate radicals are expected to initiate the formation of oh radicals as a result these radicals will attack the functional groups oh nh2 and so3 of lignin sulfonate and chitosan hence forming the chains within the biocomposite 6 4 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite mu et al 88 reported that according to the sem analysis surface morphology of the prepared lignosulfonate chitosan biocomposite csl shows the porous structure pore diameter was below 2 μm and more folds were also detected around the pores therefore these detected porous structure reported to induce the interaction between the contaminants cu ii and co ii and surface site of biocomposite during adsorption process ftir analysis further confirms the physicochemical changes in the new prepared biocomposite absorption bands at 3540 cm 1 1720 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 were attributed to the vibration stretching of hydroxyl groups and nh groups and aromatic ring vibration respectively in addition the bands at 1390 cm 1 1160 cm 1 and 810 cm 1 were associated to the sulfonic acid characteristic therefore all these functional groups confirmed that chitosan and lignosulfonate was successfully synthesized 6 5 adsorption of inorganic contaminants from aqueous solution using the synthesized lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites lignocellulosic derivatives have been used as adsorbents for the removal of different inorganic contaminants from aqueous solution as summarized in table 3 however it has been recognized that these materials exhibit limited adsorption capacity and in order to improve the adsorption capacity chitosan was added into the lignocellulosic based derivatives as a modifying agent see table 3 in general the presence of chitosan improved the adsorption capacity when compared lignocellulosic derivatives adsorbents this was attributed to the additional functional groups amines brought by chitosan as discussed in the next sections 6 5 1 heavy metals wastewater from anthropogenic sources such as mining and chemical industries often contains high concentrations of heavy metals 95 this wastewater diffuses into the aquatic environment and potentially reduces the quality of water and soil 96 the major problems of heavy metals are non degradable and persist in the aquatic environment for a long period of time 86 in traces heavy metals are essential in living things however high concentrations are harmful and cause diseases such as renal disorder and high blood pressure 19 16 human beings get exposed to heavy metals either through inhalation or by directly drinking the contaminated water 97 different types of adsorbents such as activated carbon and silica gel have been used to remove heavy metals in wastewater however they are expensive especially for developing countries 11 17 as such biocomposites made of lignocellulosic derivatives and chitosan biopolymers have been explored as low cost adsorbents to remove heavy metals in wastewater 6 5 2 adsorption mechanism of heavy metals on synthesized biocomposites heavy metals are removed from aqueous solution either through physical adsorption precipitation complexation and ion exchange as illustrated in fig 5 17 however the adsorption rate is based on the availability of functional groups or activate site on the surface of modified biocomposite 27 6 5 2 1 biochar chitosan biocomposite masih et al 16 shows that the biocomposite made of rice husk biochar and chitosan successfully reduced the concentrations of cu ii from aqueous solution according to their results when the concentration of cu ii was 5 mg l the adsorption capacity of raw rice husk rrh acid treated rice husk atrh and carbon chitosan rice husk ccrh were 3 685 mg g 4 222 mg g and 4 939 mg g respectively highest removal observed for ccrh composite was attributed to the addition of chitosan furthermore the adsorption of cu ii increases with the increasing of ph in solution with the optimum recorded at ph 7 and the adsorption equilibrium was reached after 480 min experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second kinetic model suggesting the adsorption mechanism was due to the chemical attraction among the studied adsorption isotherms the experimental data best fitted to the langmuir adsorption isotherm r2 0 995 demonstrating the homogeneous surface and monolayer adsorption in addition according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm the maximum adsorption for rrh atrh and synthesized ccrh were 1 395 mg g 4 127 mg g and 90 909 mg g respectively thermodynamic parameters show the negative values of enthalpy h and entropy s demonstrating the adsorption of cu ii was exothermic and randomness respectively magnetic biochar chitosan biocomposite prepared by xiao et al 17 was quick to adsorbs cr iv and cu ii in aqueous solutions removal was high within the first 2 h gradually decreases as the time increases and the equilibrium was reached within 18 h however the adsorption was ph dependent and high adsorption capacity was recorded at ph 2 30 14 mg g and ph 7 54 68 mg g for cr iv and cu ii respectively moreover the experimental data best fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model for both metals demonstrating the adsorption was due to the chemical attractions between the ions furthermore the material was recyclable however the removal decreases after three cycles which was attributed to the changes in physical properties of adsorbents although the adsorption of heavy metals was ph dependent the synthesized biochar chitosan biocomposites shows the potential to remove these contaminants from aqueous solutions 6 5 2 2 cellulose chitosan biocomposite the synthesized chitosan cellulose biocomposite film prepared by rahmi et al 19 successfully removes the cd ii from aqueous solution they found that increasing the concentration of cellulose in the film decreases the removal of cd ii from aqueous solution this shows that chitosan enhanced the adsorption site due to the coordination between the metal ion and amino functional groups for adsorption purpose the film was grinded into fine particles and they recorded the adsorption capacity and percentage removal of 0 952 mg g and 79 respectively however the adsorption of cd ii on modified adsorbent was ph dependent and the lowest removal recorded at acidic range was due to the electrostatic repulsion between the ions the experimental data both fitted to the langmuir and freundlich isotherm model indicating the adsorbent surface was homogenous and heterogeneous respectively moreover the modified biocomposite film was recyclable and it was used for several cycles without losing its original form yang et al 87 found that the adsorption of cu2 ions using the freeze dried synthesized cellulose chitosan composite hydrogel 92 7 mg g was 10 times higher than that of pure cellulose hydrogel 9 7 mg g and this shows the significant of chitosan within the composite high removal on synthesized composite was due to the interaction between amine and metal ion through chelation process however the removal of cu2 ion was low at acidic conditions which was related to the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated amine nh3 and positive charge of metal ion moreover the experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir adsorption isotherm demonstrating the adsorption was through chemical binding and monolayer occurs respectively additionally the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by the langmuir adsorption isotherm was 94 3 mg g which was closer to the experimental results 93 6 mg g li et al 40 found that the synthesized aerogel was quick to adsorb pb ii and the adsorption capacity of 248 5 mg g was achieved after equilibrium of 1 h experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir adsorption isotherm indicating the adsorption of pd ii was chemical and occur in the form of monolayer respectively according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm the maximum adsorption capacity was 252 6 mg g which is closer to the reported experimental data moreover the interaction between pd ii and biocomposite was attributed to the microchannel structure and amino functional groups within the surface of biosorbent regeneration study was done and the material was re used for several cycles without losing much of its adsorption capacity zhang et al 86 also observed quick removal of hg ii when using the crosslinked chitosan cellulose biocomposite sponge in 2 min about 97 of hg ii was removed and the adsorption capacity of 495 mg g was achieved at equilibrium time of 60 min however the adsorption of hg ii was ph dependent and the optimum value recorded at ph 5 5 low removal was related to the competition between the hydrogen ions h and positive charges of hg ii metal species in addition low removal was also attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated amine functional groups in chitosan and the positive charge of hg ii according to the kinetic models and isotherm models experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir adsorption isotherm demonstrating the adsorption of hg ii on the surface site was through chemisorption and occurs as a monolayer respectively furthermore the biocomposite was renewable and 85 removal was maintained after five cycles in another work li et al 82 adsorbs cu ii from aqueous solution using hydrogel biocomposite comprised of chitosan and office waste paper they found that the removal of cu ii ion on synthesized adsorbent was through the coordination between the metal ion and amino functional groups demonstrating that the addition of chitosan had a major impact on the adsorption of metal ions batch studies show that the adsorption of cu ii was through chemisorption as the kinetic model favors the pseudo second order model high removal was observed after 3 5 h and the equilibrium was reached after 8 5 h furthermore the adsorption capacity increases with the increasing of initial concentration according to the isotherm study langmuir adsorption isotherm was the best fitting model indicating the morphology of composite was uniform and a single layer molecule was formed moreover the modified biocomposite was regenerable and easily recovered as it floats on top of the solution which was due to its low density 6 5 2 3 hemicellulose chitosan biocomposite wu et al 41 reported that the adsorption of ni ii cd ii cu ii hg ii mn vii and cr vi by synthesized biocomposite cmch was ph dependent with the highest removal recorded between 3 and 4 ph solution low removal at ph 3 was due to the repulsion of ions as the surface was highly protonated whereas at higher ph metals reported to precipitate after interactions with the hydroxyl ions oh and thus limit their interaction with the surface active site ftir analysis shows that the nh2 cooh and oh functional groups were involved during the process of adsorbing metals from an aqueous solution moreover the composite reached equilibrium after 7 h which is quite long as compared to other biocomposites reported by other researchers furthermore the experimental data were best fitted to the pseudo second order model and langmuir adsorption isotherm model demonstrating that the adsorption of metals on the surface of cmch biocomposite was through chemisorption and monolayer adsorption according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm the recorded maximum adsorption capacity for ni ii cd ii cu ii mn vii hg ii and cr vi were 362 3 mg g 909 1 mg g 333 3 mg g 42 0 mg g 28 2 mg g and 49 0 mg g respectively regeneration study shows these heavy metals could be easily desorbed from the surface by using 0 1 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and then the material was used again for several cycles wu et al 38 found that the removal of ni ii cd ii cu ii hg ii mn vii and cr vi on synthesized chnt biocomposite was also ph dependent and the optimum ph values recorded between 2 and 4 protonation of surface area at lower ph was reported to be responsible for lower removal whereas at higher ph 4 hydroxyl coordination with metal might have occurred and thus reduces the interaction of heavy metals with the surface site of biosorbent according to ftir analysis on saturated chnt adsorbent the intensity of cn and nh functional groups decreases demonstrating that the hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups interacted with the metal ions through chelating process therefore this shows that chitosan had increased the removal of these heavy metals from aqueous solution furthermore the interaction of heavy metals with the surface of biocomposite differs and the pattern was in the following orders ni ii cd ii cu ii mn vii hg ii cr vi the highest removal was recorded as the time increases and the equilibrium was reached approximately after 7 h adsorption capacity for ni ii cd ii cu ii mn vii hg ii and cr vi were 32 2 mg g 27 6 mg g 13 5 mg g 9 4 mg g 4 8 mg g and 4 3 mg g respectively experimental data were fitted to the kinetic models and the pseudo second order model shows a higher correlation coefficient demonstrating the removal was through chemisorption furthermore experimental data was fitted to the intraparticle diffusion indicating the adsorption of heavy metals was fast at the beginning and then slows again therefore this shows the adsorption occurs in multiple steps moreover according to the isotherms models the experimental data best fitted to the langmuir adsorption isotherm demonstrating that the surface of chnt was homogenous and the adsorption mechanisms occurs through a monolayer 6 5 2 4 lignin chitosan biocomposite the adsorption of cu ii and co ii on synthesized lignosulfonate chitosan biocomposite csl was quick at the begging and gradually decreases as the time increases 88 removal of heavy metals was ph dependent and the lowest adsorption was recorded at the acidic region which was due to the repulsion between the positive ion of heavy metals and the positive ion of surface area furthermore experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion indicating the adsorption of heavy metals was through chemisorption and multiple processes occur highest adsorption capacity for cu ii and co ii was 283 mg g and 386 mg g respectively among the fitted adsorption isotherm models langmuir was reported as the best fit demonstrating that the adsorption of heavy metals on the surface of csl occurs as a monolayer they reported that the adsorbent was recyclable by using 0 1 m hcl and up to 5 cycles were conducted and the removal was kept above 80 therefore this indicated that the material was economical 6 5 3 phosphates phosphates are one of the essential elements used during the production of chemical fertilizers 98 it is the limiting nutrient during plant growth however an excess of phosphates reduces the quality of water induces eutrophication which leads to algal bloom 85 in abundance of algae inhibit penetration of light in water and when the algae die it get degraded by aerobic bacteria which leads to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water 99 therefore it is important to reduce the level of phosphate into permissible environmental water standards for the protection of our ecosystem conventional technologies such as chemical precipitation and biological method using activated sludge are often employed during the treatment of phosphate in wastewater 61 however chemicals are expensive and activated sludge may cause secondary pollution 100 therefore adsorption technology using biodegradable materials is recommended because is not only sustainable but as well as economical 101 6 5 4 adsorption mechanism of phosphates on modified biocomposites 6 5 4 1 biochar chitosan biocomposite huang et al 85 removes the phosphate from aqueous solution using the crosslinked biocomposite comprised of biochar chitosan quaternary ammonium salt and lanthanum according to the obtained results the adsorption of phosphate on the surface of modified biocomposite was driven by various mechanisms including electrostatic interaction ligand exchange and lewis acid base interaction fig 6 adsorption was ph dependent as the removal decreases with the increase of ph furthermore the composite was quick to adsorb about 96 removal was achieved just after 5 min when 100 mg l was the initial concentration of phosphate and the equilibrium was reached after 30 min isotherm study shows that the adsorption capacity increases from 51 5 mg g to 92 12 mg g when the initial concentration increases in addition among the adsorption isotherm the experimental data best fitted to the langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity of 108 86 mg g was recorded therefore this demonstrated that the adsorption of phosphate on synthesized composite occurs as a monolayer according to kinetic models the pseudo second order model was the best fit indicating the mechanisms of adsorption were via chemisorption moreover the modified biocomposite adsorbent shows poor renewability 34 removal which was attributed to the strong binding of phosphate on the surface of the composite 7 preparation of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites for the removal of organic contaminants the techniques reported in section 6 are also employed during the synthesis of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites for the removal of organic contaminants from aqueous solution as also reported in the biocomposites used for removal of inorganic contaminants lignocellulosic derivatives generally increased the mechanical strength of the synthesized biocomposites whereas the chitosan biopolymer enhanced the adsorption capacity as shown in table 4 7 1 cellulose chitosan biocomposite 7 1 1 blending and solution casting techniques zheng et al 102 prepared the composite film consisting of dialdehyde microfibrillated mfc cellulose and chitosan for the adsorption of anionic dye from wastewater to obtain microfibrillated cellulose a powder of microcrystalline mcc cellulose was reacted with naoh solution 10 for 2 h washed with distilled water to remove the residuals subsequently alkali treated mcc was homogenized under pressure to obtain a white milky mfc suspensions dialdehyde was prepared using sodium periodate in the absence of light before blended with chitosan solution hu et al 103 and simsek et al 104 employed the blending method to prepare the composite for adsorption of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and aromatic carbons respectively hu et al 103 prepared the cellulose nanocrystals chitosan beads for the adsorption of diclofenac sodium ds in aqueous solutions simsek et al 104 prepared the composite comprised of carbon fibers cf chitosan cht and polyvinyl alcohol pva composite for removal of bisphenol a bpa in aqueous solution different weight fractions of cf ranging between 0 5 and 3 was added into the mixture of cht pva solution and the composite was denoted cht pva cf 0 5 3 depending on the weight fractions of cf cht pva gopi et al 105 used the blending and casting methods to develop the biocomposite film comprised of cellulose acetate and chitosan polymers for removal of anionic dyes from aqueous solution chitosan powder was added into a beaker containing acetic acid and stirred at room temperature for 3 h subsequently different concentrations of cellulose acetate were added after that a solution mixture was sonicated for 45 min to get rid of the bubbles and casted in the polystyrene petri dish to form the desired film to remove the solvent petri dish was left for 24 h in room temperature it was dried and tested for the adsorption of dyes acid orange 7 and brilliant yellow from aqueous solution 7 1 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite zheng et al 102 found that according to sem analysis oxidized cellulose has rough morphology as compared to the pristine microcrystalline cellulose the change in surface was further confirmed by ftir as the spectrum of composite film shows peaks at 1729 cm 1 and 790 cm 1 attributed to the carbonyl co and the bending vibration of ch of the aldehyde groups respectively reaction between the oxidized hydroxyl groups of cellulose and amine of chitosan reported to occur through schiff s base and this was confirmed by a peak at 1648 cm 1 attributing to the cn stretching vibrations furthermore the addition of oxidized cellulose enriches the tensile strength of chitosan film from 34 8 mpa to 56 3 mpa after adding just 2 wt of dialdehyde microfibrillated cellulose damfc simsek et al 104 also found that the addition of cf enhances the tensile structure of the composite they observed rough surface on the morphology of synthesized composite which was attributed to the addition of cf hu et al 103 reported that the ftir spectrum of modified cellulose nanocrystals chitosan beads shows the band at 1551 cm 1 corresponding to cn stretching vibration demonstrating that the interaction between biopolymers was through the schiff base reaction gopi et al 105 reported that according to sem analysis modified film exhibits micro pore which was attributed to the solvent separation during drying process or phase separation moreover the addition of chitosan was significant as it enhances the hydrophilicity and adsorption removal efficiency of the dye from aqueous solution 7 1 2 blending and freeze drying techniques liu et al 106 used the blending and freeze drying methods to prepare the crosslinked composite comprised of nanofibrillated cellulose nfc and chitosan cs for adsorption of cationic dye and anionic dyes from aqueous solutions chitosan solution was prepared in acetic acid and mixed with nfc using the magnetic stir then nfc cs composite was crosslinked with epichlorohydrin and ethylenediamine was added into the solution mixture material denoted e nfc cs kim et al 15 prepared a biocomposite foam comprised of cellulose and chitosan for the adsorption of congo red dye from aqueous solution cellulose and chitosan were dissolved in lithium bromide libr aqueous solution at 150 c then the gel was treated with methanol to regenerate the chitosan after that the solution of dialdehyde cellulose was added into the mixture of cellulose and chitosan to form the crosslinked composite followed by subsequent reduction using sodium borohydride nabh4 the mixture was crosslinked for about 24 h at 25 c prior to washing with deionized water and ethanol to remove residuals freeze dried composite was denoted cclbd in another work zhu et al 107 produced different types of xerogel consisting of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose nacmc and chitosan cs for the adsorption of indigo blue ib dye from aqueous solution nacmc was dissolved in 0 1 m phosphate buffer saline pbs of ph 7 0 certain grams of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide and n hydroxysuccinimide added into the solution to activate the carbonyl groups subsequently different concentrations of chitosan solution were added into the mixture and stirred for about 4 h at room temperature to form the xerogel the mixture was freeze dried 45 c for 24 h and the reaction between cs and nacmc occur through the amidation process material denoted as cmc cs a separately chitosan solution was also added into the suspension of nacmc and stirred under similar parameters however there was no activation of carbonyl and the reaction between cs and nacmc occur through the electrostatic attraction material was denoted cmc cs e 7 1 2 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite liu et al 106 reported that the modified biocomposite had superior mechanical strength when compared to pristine cellulose thermal stability of pristine cellulose nfc cs and e nfc cs composites were 274 c 338 c and 311 c respectively this indicated that the addition of nfc significantly enhanced the mechanical strength of the composite ftir spectrum of nfc cs composite shows the increase of intensity at a wavelength of 1632 cm 1 and 1380 cm 1 which were attributed to the amine grafted on the surface of cellulose in addition the band at 1065 cm 1 was ascribed to the combined effects of cn stretching vibration of primary amines and the co stretching of a primary alcohol in chitosan kim et al 15 found that according to sem analysis cclbd composite exhibits the porous structure with long nanofibrils interconnected with pores ranging from 200 to 400 nm zhu et al 107 found that the composite cmc cs e shows loose surface with nanopores whereas the composite cmc cs a exhibits the surface with highly interconnected porous network structure which was favorable for the adsorption indigo blue ib dye from aqueous solution 7 2 hemicellulose chitosan biocomposite 7 2 1 blending and freeze drying techniques the dialdehyde hemicellulose extracted from wheat straw was synthesized with chitosan and iron oxide to produce a magnetic aerogel which was used for the adsorption of congo red dye from aqueous solution 56 dialdehyde hemicellulose 3 3 g was prepared added into a flask containing chitosan solution 3 and the mixture was vigorously stirred at 40 c for 30 min to obtain a homogenous solution to form the aerogel the prepared solution mixture was freeze dried material denoted aerogel0 magnetic nanoparticles were added in different concentrations 0 025 g 0 05 g 0 1 g and material denoted aerogel0 025 aerogel0 05 and aerogel0 1 depending on the added amount of iron oxide 7 2 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite guan et al 56 found that the synthesized dialdehyde hemicellulose chitosan fe3o4 composite shows distinct properties when compared with the dialdehyde hemicellulose and chitosan according to the ftir analysis dialdehyde hemicellulose shows a peak at 1726 cm 1 that was corresponding to the carbonyl vibration co of aldehyde functional groups synthesized composite shows the disappearance of the aldehyde groups which was due to the reaction of hemicellulose with chitosan the spectrum of fe3o4 exhibits the peak at 577 cm 1 that was related to the feo stretching vibration therefore this confirms the incorporation of the magnetic particles the addition of fe3o4 was reported to enhance the thermal stability of the synthesized aerogels moreover sem analysis shows that the morphology of synthesized aerogel contains finer porous and regular structure which was reported to enhance the adsorption of dye from aqueous solution 7 3 lignin chitosan biocomposite 7 3 1 blending and freeze drying techniques masilompane et al 77 employed the blending method to synthesize nanocomposite comprised of lignin chitosan and titanium dioxide for the adsorption of brilliant black dye from an aqueous solution dried lignin and chitosan was dissolved separately in beakers containing acetic acid 2 to form the homogenous mixture then lignin solution was slowly added into the chitosan solution and blended at 3000 rpm for 3 h titanium dioxide was added and the solution continued to stir overnight prior to drying at 40 c in another work sohni et al 55 employed the blending and freeze drying method to synthesize the composite comprised of nano lignin particles and chitosan for the adsorption of methylene blue mb from wastewater chitosan 2 g was dissolved in 100 ml of acetic acid 2 v v mixed with nano lignin 0 2 g and the suspension was exposed under ultrasonic to disperse for 30 min after that the suspension was stirred for 6 h before been placed under the freeze dryer lyophilized composite was washed with the distilled water to remove the residuals 7 3 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite masilompane et al 77 compared the physicochemical properties of the prepared lignin chitosan tio2 nanocomposite with lignin and chitosan biopolymers ftir analysis shows that the interaction between lignin and chitosan was through the aromatic ring and secondary amine of chitosan this was confirmed by the shifting of cc bonds to a lower wavelength number furthermore the interaction was also due to the hydrogen bonding which could have occurred between the hydroxyl of lignin and β1 4glycosidic linkages of chitosan peaks at 2923 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 were correlated to the stretching of the ch bond found in the aromatic methoxy and alkyl groups of lignin biopolymer in addition the peaks at 839 cm 1 and 660 cm 1 were related to the tio and tioti bonds respectively according to the sem analysis lignin was observed as flakes whereas the chitosan biopolymer agglomerated within the surface and titanium nanoparticles were well distributed on the surface of the composite therefore this confirms that the nanocomposite was successfully synthesized sohni et al 55 found that according to the ftir analysis there was no stronger interaction between the nano lignin and chitosan in the synthesized composite however few low energy dipole dipole interactions were detected occurring between the carbonyl of chitosan and hydroxyl from lignin in addition to that the shifting and reduction of peaks intensity were detected chitosan biopolymer shows peaks at 1652 cm 1 and 1637 9 cm 1 which were correlated to the bending of nh in amine groups and nh stretching of amine respectively however after the reaction with nano lignin the peak at 1652 cm 1 disappeared and the peak 1637 9 cm 1 shifted to broader peak at 1638 7 cm 1 furthermore the peaks at 1561 cm 1 and 1544 cm 1 correlated to the primary amine of chitosan disappeared which was due to the interaction with the aromatic ring of nano lignin the intensity of the peak at 1030 39 cm 1 associated with the hydroxyl oh in chitosan was reduced in the synthesized biocomposite addition of lignin was reported to increase the stability of the composite according to the sem analysis the morphology of the synthesized chitosan nano lignin showed a rough and porous structure which was due to the addition of lignin the surface area of the composite was lower than that of chitosan and the reduction was correlated to the addition of lignin which was reported to might have blocked the chitosan porosities 7 4 adsorption of organic contaminants from aqueous solution using the synthesized lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites organic pollutants generated from various anthropogenic sources such as chemical industries have the potential to reduce the quality of surface water therefore it is important to develop cost effective technologies especially for developing countries natural sources such as lignocellulose biomass have been explored as adsorbent for the removal of these organic contaminants table 4 listed different types of adsorbents used for the adsorption of various organic contaminants from aqueous solutions as also reported in the adsorption of inorganic contaminants lignocellulosic derivatives adsorbent are less effective in removing organic contaminants from aqueous solution however after introducing chitosan the adsorption capacity significantly increased which was associated to the availability of more activate sites see table 4 7 4 1 dyes dyes are important substances in industries such as textiles rubber paper plastic and cosmetics 109 however the wastewater from these industries contains synthetic dyes that are known to be carcinogenic due to their aromatic structure 102 synthetic dyes cause chronic diseases and their presence in water prevents the penetration of light which potential affects the aquatic organisms 107 therefore conventional technologies such as adsorption precipitation electrodialysis filtration coagulation oxidation and membrane separation have been developed for the removal of synthetic dyes in wastewater however excluding adsorption method these methods are not cost effective 110 for this reason researchers have embarked on investigating composite comprised of natural polysaccharides such as chitosan and lignocellulosic derivatives as potential biosorbents for the removal of dyes in aqueous solutions 15 7 4 2 adsorption mechanism of dyes on synthesized biocomposites 7 4 2 1 cellulose chitosan biocomposite the amino groups of chitosan interact with dyes especially anionic dyes for example zheng et al 102 found that the adsorption of congo red dye on modified biocomposite occurs through attraction between the protonated amine of chitosan and negative ions of sulfonate groups fig 7 in addition they also found that the attraction was among the hydroxyl groups and functional groups of congo red dye they reported that adsorption of congo red on modified damfc chitosan composite was slightly affected by ph as there was no significant difference between ph values of 3 and 8 therefore this shows that this material has the potential to be applied in wastewater treatment plant modified composite was quick to remove with the equilibrium reached just after 10 min adsorption capacity was increasing with the initial concentration highest adsorption capacity of 152 5 mg g recorded when initial concentration was 300 mg l moreover according to the kinetic models and isotherm modes experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order and langmuir isotherm demonstrating the adsorption was through chemisorption and monolayer coverage respectively liu et al 106 tested the crosslinked biocomposite comprised of nanofibrillated cellulose nfc and chitosan cs as adsorbent to remove cationic dye methylene blue mb and anionic new coccine nc dye from aqueous solution high removal of mb and nc was recorded at ph 4 and ph 2 respectively they found that the removal of nc was attributed to the ionic attractions between the anions dyes and protonated amine of chitosan at equilibrium the maximum adsorption capacity of 0 061 mmol g and 0 16 mmol g was reached after 30 and 50 min for mb and nc respectively moreover the adsorbent was reported to be economical as the regeneration study shows high removal 98 even after 3 cycles the xerogel comprised of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and chitosan prepared by zhu et al 107 was also quick to remove indigo blue ib dye from aqueous solution according to their experimental results the addition of chitosan increased the adsorption of ib from aqueous solution and the adsorption capacity of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and synthesized biocomposite was 3 mg g and 27 mg g respectively they recorded a removal of about 88 2 adsorption capacity of 23 8 mg g after 20 min and the equilibrium was reached after 1 h as there was no significant changes observed after that time furthermore the experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order model and langmuir isotherm model demonstrating the chemisorption adsorption and the monolayer coverage of dye on the surface of modified composite respectively kim et al 15 investigated the adsorption of congo red dye using the modified cellulose chitosan biocomposite foam they reported that the addition of chitosan has significantly enhanced the removal of congo red on synthesized biocomposite and the adsorption capacity of cellulose chitosan composite 520 9 mg g was 1 7 times higher than the raw cellulose 300 mg g furthermore the adsorption was ph dependent as the removal decreases when the ph increases with the highest adsorption 952 mg g recorded at ph 5 reduction of adsorption removal at higher ph was attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the positive of amino groups nh3 and negative charge of the congo red dye dosage was also critical as the removal increases as the dosage increases experimental data best fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model and sips isotherm model demonstrating the adsorption was chemisorption and the surface of modified composite was heterogeneous respectively according to the desorption study the adsorbent was recyclable and it maintained almost similar adsorption capacity even after 15 cycles 7 4 2 2 hemicellulose chitosan biocomposite guan et al 56 found that the addition of ferric oxide particles on synthesized dialdehyde hemicellulose chitosan aerogels significantly enhanced the removal of congo red dye from aqueous solution they reported that when the amounts of fe3o4 were 0 g 0 025 g 0 05 g and 0 1 g the adsorption capacity of congo red dye was 103 64 mg g 111 47 mg g 137 74 mg g and 114 92 mg g respectively nevertheless free amino groups of chitosan were also reported to provide an adsorption site for the dye in addition the presence of magnetic particles induces the recovery of saturated aerogels after adsorption 7 4 2 3 lignin chitosan biocomposite masilompane et al 77 found that the adsorption of brilliant black dye bb on synthesized lignin chitosan tio2 nanocomposite was ph dependent with the highest removal recorded at ph 9 and the highest percentage removal of 83 recorded at optimum ph 5 8 high removal under acidic conditions was due to the protonation of chitosan amine functional groups within the synthesized nanocomposite in addition as the ph increases towards the alkaline region amine get deprotonated which causes the adsorption reduction of bb dye furthermore the point of zero charge was 9 22 which complemented the recorded ph results moreover the nanocomposite was quick to remove the bb dye as the equilibrium was reached just within 30 min experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order and freundlich adsorption isotherm demonstrating the mechanisms of adsorption was chemically and dominated by the multilayer according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model the maximum adsorption capacity of bb was 15 8 mg g at 25 c the adsorption of cationic dye on synthesized chitosan nano lignin was reported to occur within a wide range of ph 55 which was attributed to the strong adsorption and complexation interaction through hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction ion exchange and van der waals forces however at lower ph 3 removal was low which was due to the repulsion between the positive ion of cationic dye and ion of protonated composite moreover the synthesized composite effectively removes mb dye in lower concentration which was due to the large available site furthermore adsorption removal of mb dye increases with the increasing of temperature demonstrating that the process was through an endothermic process according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model the highest adsorption capacity recorded was 74 07 mg g they reported that the experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second adsorption model demonstrating that the adsorption was through the chemical attraction between the cationic dye and composite site moreover the experimental data was also best fitted to the langmuir adsorption isotherm indicating the adsorption of dye on the surface of composite occurs as a monolayer furthermore the composite was recyclable and used for up to 4 cycles which shows that the material was economical 7 4 3 pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps such as diclofenac sodium ds are emerging organic contaminants that are found in surface water as well as drinking water 111 they often available in traces however even at low concentration can be harmful for example ds affect the gastrointestinal in humans which leads to acute renal insufficient 103 therefore it is essential to remove these contaminants to improve the quality of water and protect the health of human beings 112 7 4 4 adsorption mechanism of ppcps on synthesized biocomposites 7 4 4 1 cellulose chitosan biocomposite hu et al 103 prepared the cellulose nanocrystals chitosan biocomposite for the removal of ds in aqueous solution they reported that the addition of chitosan significantly enhances the adsorption capacity of the synthesized composite as compared to the pristine cellulose nanocrystals adsorption capacity increases with the increasing of initial ds concentration adsorption capacity of 348 24 mg g recorded when the initial concentration was 1000 mg l however the higher the concentration of ds the longer adsorption time needed to reach equilibrium furthermore the adsorption of ds on modified composite was ph dependent and the optimum value recorded at ph 4 5 at lower ph amino groups get protonated and were more likely to react with the negative charge ions of ds hence high removal recorded under acidic conditions mechanisms of adsorption were through the acid base interaction and hydrogen bonding fig 8 in addition experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model implying that the removal of ds was chemically driven 7 4 5 aromatic hydrocarbons pollutants the pollution caused by aromatic hydrocarbons has increased since the industrial revolution these pollutants are harmful to human beings as they are carcinogenic and mutagenic 113 traditional techniques such as adsorption by activated carbon oxidation by ozone and chlorine dioxide reverse osmosis solvent extraction and ion exchange are used for removal of aromatic carbons in wastewater 114 however among these techniques adsorption especially using biocomposite regarded as the best method due to its simplicity and economical 7 4 6 adsorption mechanism of aromatic hydrocarbons on synthesized biocomposites 7 4 6 1 cellulose chitosan biocomposite simsek et al 104 investigated the biocomposite consisting of carbon fibers cf chitosan cs and polyvinyl alcohol pva as the potential biosorbent for removal of bisphenol a bpa from aqueous solution removal of bpa on modified composite increases with the increasing of cf concentration however the removal was ph dependent and high removal recorded at the acidic region furthermore the experimental data fitted to the pseudo second data model demonstrating the adsorption was through chemisorption according to the adsorption isotherms freundlich and dubinin radushkevich models best fitted the experimental data indicating that the surface of modified composite was heterogeneous the adsorption thermodynamics show the negative value of g and positive value of h demonstrating the adsorption of bpa was spontaneous and endothermic in nature respectively 8 conclusion and recommendations lignocellulosic and chitosan biopolymers are not only the most abundant biomass on planet earth but are also eco friendly sustainable and biodegradable by microorganisms this review reported different types of biocomposites developed from these biopolymers and their potential on the adsorption of inorganic and organic contaminants in aqueous solutions it was demonstrated that lignocellulosic derivatives such as cellulose particles hemicellulose lignin and biochar were frequently employed during the formation of the lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites different techniques such as blending solvent casting and freeze drying methods were often employed during the formation of biocomposite these methods are facile and they significantly enhanced the physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites as compared to the raw lignocellulose derivatives and pristine chitosan furthermore the modified biocomposites show a potential to remove organic and inorganic contaminants from aqueous solutions heavy metals were the most investigated inorganic contaminants and although some few studies reported the removal of anions e g phosphate we found that less studies were directed towards the removal of this type of contaminants for these reasons it is recommended to have more studies also targeting various types of anions as they contribute to the lack of quality water moreover in most cases the reported lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites were quick to remove the contaminants in aqueous solution however the removal was ph dependent in addition the adsorption of contaminants on modified biocomposites was driven by the electrostatic forces and the synthesized biocomposites material was recyclable which is economical therefore this shows the synthesized biocomposites have the potential to replace or supplement the current contaminants removal technologies nevertheless some of the lignocellulosic derivatives e g cellulose hemicellulose and lignin used during the formation of the composite were purchased commercially for economic reasons it is substantial to investigate the use of derivatives extracted from local lignocellulosic biomass as this will reduce the cost of production although chitosan biopolymer is more expensive as compared to the lignocellulosic derivatives however it significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the synthesized lignocellulosic chitosan biocomposites additionally compared to other modifying chemical agent chitosan is less toxic and biodegradable as produced from natural sources chitosan is produced in different types for example viscosity molecular weight and the degree of deacetylation differs therefore it is recommended for future studies to investigate the effect of using different types of chitosan during the formation of biocomposites furthermore the total cost of all the materials and equipment used during the synthesis process must be calculated as this could help to have more insight into the feasibility of the proposed method moreover the adsorption studies were often tested on synthetic water therefore further investigations in real water samples are recommended additionally pilot studies are recommended as this will be a step closer to the commercialization of these synthesized materials lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites could be an alternative to the hard biodegradable polymers however further research is imperative to address all these

12994,biocomposites developed from lignocellulosic biomass have numerous potential applications in various sectors including food packaging and medical technologies wastewater treatment and purification however since the physicochemical properties of biocomposites are inferior to synthetic composites in various applications it has been imperative to enhance their properties by employing chemical and physical methods to modify their surface chemistry in most cases chemical methods have frequently been used due to the ability to form the intramolecular and intermolecular bonds between the polymers and the modifiers the aim of this review is to evaluate different methods used in the preparation of bio composites mainly those that are comprised of lignocellulosic derivatives and chitosan biopolymer in addition the review will critically looks at biocomposites as biosorbent materials in the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants in aqueous solutions by investigating the different classes different methods of preparation their advantages limitations and efficiency the review will also survey the different applications particularly the success in their deployment in the water purification and treatment keywords biocomposites lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biosorbents inorganic contaminants organic contaminants 1 introduction the term composite refers to a material prepared from mixing two or more constituents that differ markedly in terms of their physical and chemical properties in a composite the original constituents retain their identities and distinct properties however the composite will possess superior qualities which are preferential to those of the individual constituents composites can be naturally derived from different types of biomass or synthesized using different types of polymers synthetic composite in general synthetic composites are resilient to ordinary degradation and that can pose threat to ecological environment therefore it is important to improve or find alternative composite which are less toxic biodegradable cost effective sustainable and economical 1 2 where a composite is made up of at least one constituent that originates from a biological source plant microbial or animal or is biodegradable by microorganisms the composite is categorized as a biocomposite 3 for example de oliveira et al 4 mixed cellulose extracted from rice and oat husks with polyvinyl alcohol to produce a hydrogel biocomposite with high water absorption capacity 141 6 392 1 and opacity in most cases biomass especially lignocellulosic biomass forests products and agricultural by products are incinerated in order to clean the environment or generate energy to use in various industries 5 lignocellulosic biomass consists of chemical components that could be derivatized to produce valuable products which could be another alternative to manage this biomass 6 biocomposites that contains lignocellulosic derivatives have gain use in different applications such as film packaging in food industry 7 antibacterial wound dressing 8 and drug carrier 9 in medical industry and wastewater treatment as a biosorbent 10 there are several advantages of using natural materials like lignocellulosic derivatives as biosorbent in water or wastewater treatment such as low cost less toxic less sludge generated during operation and it is sustainable which is beneficial especially for developing countries 11 however the major disadvantage of lignocellulosic biomass derivatives as biosorbent is the poor adsorption capacity when compared to other synthetic adsorbents such as iron oxyhydroxide agglomerates adsorbent 12 and polypyrrole titanium iv phosphate nanocomposite 13 to improve the adsorption capacity various methods such as amination halogenation esterification etherification and oxidation are used to modify lignocellulosic biomass 14 although these methods are reported to enhance the adsorption capacity toxic chemicals are often used during modification which is one of the major drawbacks to address the aforementioned several studies have modified the lignocellulosic derived biomass with chitosan biopolymer to enhance the adsorption capacity of the material 15 16 17 18 chitosan is a derivative of chitin and it contains amine functional groups that can react chemically with various contaminants in aqueous solutions 19 it has been used as biosorbent for removal of various contaminants however the major disadvantage of chitosan as biosorbent is the poor mechanical strength and gets easily dissolved in acidic solution 10 in contrast although lignocellulosic biomass lacks active sites to remove contaminants in aqueous solution it has better mechanical properties for these reasons several studies have focused on combining lignocellulosic biomass derivatives such as biochar cellulose hemicellulose and lignin with chitosan biopolymer to produce the biocomposite to remove various types of contaminants from aqueous solution lignocellulosic biomass derivative chitosan bio composites are either formed using a physical grafting or chemical grafting method 4 however the latter is often recommended due to the resistance against friction and better compatibility 20 these bio composites are produced in different formats such as powders beads films sponge and hollow fibers 21 the aim of this review is to evaluate various techniques employed in the past few years 2015 2021 to form a bio composite comprised of lignocellulosic biomass derivatives and chitosan furthermore we will also evaluate the physicochemical properties of the bio composites and their mechanism on the adsorption of inorganic and organic contaminants in aqueous solutions 2 source and different types of biomass biomass is any organic renewable material derived from plants or animals 22 23 24 and these materials are found from different sources including agricultural waste industrial wastes and municipal solid wastes 25 among these types of wastes agricultural wastes and industrial wastes have been widely used to produce valuable products such as bioethanol enzymes bioplastic and biosorbent 26 these derived products from biomass have several advantages when compared to synthetic based products due to their renewability less toxicity and biodegradability 27 in addition using these low cost materials influences a circular green economy and cleaner production 28 2 1 industrial biomass industries are the backbone of the economic growth in many countries around the world however in the midst of producing different types of material by products such as sludge and saw dust from wood industry are often produced in large quantities 29 furthermore fishing industry is one of the industries which generate a lot of biomass wastes for example crustaceans such as crabs shrimp shells and lobsters are some of the by products produced from this industry 30 these wastes are rich with chitin which can be converted into value added product such as chitosan derivatives of chitosan have a potential to be used in various applications like synthesis of biosorbent and film 2 2 agricultural biomass agricultural practices generate a lot of residues that contains various types of lignocellulosic biomass 26 for examples sugarcane bagasse residues 31 banana peels residues 32 rice and oat husks residues 4 are among the wastes often produced in abundant lignocellulosic biomass is mainly comprised of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin as well as trace amounts of extractives that are crosslinked together by intra and inter hydrogen bonds and vander waal forces 33 these components especially cellulose hemicellulose and lignin are comprised of different functional groups which could be potentially functionalized to produce different types of value added products 34 3 chitosan biopolymer chitosan is a derivative of chitin and the second most abundant biopolymer on earth after cellulose 35 deacetylated chitin polymer is called chitosan when the degree of deacetylation is greater than 50 and molecular weight ranges between 10 and 103 kda in commercial products 10 this biopolymer is biodegradable biocompatible renewable and has antimicrobial properties 36 it is a polysaccharide consisting of a β 1 4 linkages of n acetyl d glucosamine and d glucosamine 22 18 37 fig 2 it contains high ratio of hydroxyl groups and amine groups which could be functionalized to produce new properties 38 these functional groups interact with pollutants either through the ion exchange or coordination process for example the amino and hydroxyl groups could chelate with various metallic ions in aqueous solution 39 nevertheless the effectiveness of pristine chitosan as an adsorbent in water treatment is limited by its poor mechanical strength 18 however various additives such as cellulose 40 hemicellulose 41 lignin 42 and crosslinking agents 43 are synthesized with chitosan to improve their properties hence enhancing the adsorption capacity 3 1 extraction of chitosan from crustaceans fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of conventional method used to fractionate chitin and chitosan from crustaceans chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid are used to deproteinate and mineralize respectively 44 furthermore isolated chitin treated with a high concentration of naoh to deacetylate the acetyl groups and that results in the formation of chitosan as presented in fig 2 al hoqani et al 45 extracted the chitosan from shrimp shells using different concentrations of acid and alkaline solutions dried powder of shrimp shells 1 g was subjected into various concentrations of hcl 50 ml 3 9 1 10 w v and stirred for 1 h at different temperatures 25 c 55 c after that treated material was washed with water to remove the residuals subsequently the demineralized sample was treated with an aqueous solution of different concentrations of naoh 50 ml 20 60 1 10 w v at various temperatures 80 c 110 c for 3 h then washed with distilled water and various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide 50 ml 10 30 1 10 w v for 3 h and dried overnight at 50 c to get the chitosan extracted chitin was treated with different concentrations of naoh 10 20 30 and 50 1 10 w v in an autoclave for 15 min at 121 c fourier transform near infrared ft nir spectroscopy was used to analyze the extracted chitin and chitosan according to the ft nir spectra 3 hcl at 25 c and 50 naoh at 110 c was the optimum parameters to isolate chitin in addition optimum concentrations to decolorize and deacetylate the isolated chitin were 30 h202 and 50 naoh respectively however these chemicals are toxic and cause corrosion in autoclave yang et al 46 extracted the chitin from shrimp shells using hot water and carbonic acid dried shrimp shell powder was treated in the autoclave at desired temperature and time solid residues were recovered using a centrifuge 1000 rpm 5 min washed with distilled water and dried at 70 c for 24 h prior to the next step next the deproteinized shrimp shell powder was placed in the autoclave containing distilled water and the solution mixture continues to stir in room temperature in the presence of carbon dioxide co2 gas this method is rendered environmentally friendly when compared to other conventional methods 4 components of lignocellulosic biomass 4 1 cellulose biopolymer cellulose is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear homopolymer of β 1 4 d glucose unit linked by the glycosidic bond 10 fig 4a each unit of d glucose c6h10o5 n is corkscrewed 180 with respect to its neighbors 47 it is consisting of free hydroxyl oh groups attached at c 2 c 3 and c 6 however these hydroxyl groups have distinct reactivity 11 for example the hydroxyl at position c 6 is more reactive because it is attached to the primary carbon this biopolymer is produced either in micrometers or nanometers scale and both have their own advantages and disadvantages these cellulose derivatives comprised of a crystalline and amorphous region however a large portion is presented at the crystalline region 33 the major advantage of cellulose in micrometer size it is cost effective since is produced in large quantities during industrial production 48 however the disadvantages of cellulose in micrometers are poor mechanical properties like strength and low surface area in contrast the cellulose in nanometers scale nanowhiskers and nanofibers has a high surface area good thermal stability low density high tensile strength and elastic modulus 49 nevertheless converting of cellulose into nanomaterials especially cellulose nanowhiskers has certain shortcomings such as corrosion of hydrolysis reactor since strong acids like sulphuric hydrochloric phosphoric hydromic and nitric acids are often used 10 these acids are also detrimental to animal and human health if the insufficiently treated wastewater can reach the aquatic environment another major drawback that limits the industrial production of nanomaterials is the low yield during production 48 all these could limit their broad application in industries therefore to minimize the production cost researchers are focusing on using environmental friendly methods 10 for example alternative hydrolysis techniques such as enzymatic hydrolysis are used as it does not produce hazardous waste 50 4 2 lignin biopolymer lignin is one of the major components found in the lignocellulosic biomass and the second abundant on earth after the cellulose biopolymer however the content of lignin differs depending on the type of plant biomass for example wood biomass and softwood biomass like sugarcane bagasse contain 16 24 and 24 25 respectively this biopolymer is hydrophobic and comprising mainly of three major phenolic components fig 4c 51 which include p hydroxyphenyl h guaiacyl g and syringyl s 52 held together by different linkages such as ethers and carbon carbon bonds 53 54 these phenolic compounds of lignin influence the lignocellulose to be resistant against enzyme or chemical hydrolysis furthermore lignin biopolymer is non toxic biodegradable contains antioxidant and antimicrobial properties therefore due to these aforementioned properties different composites containing lignin are produced and used in various applications like biosorbents in water treatment 55 4 3 hemicellulose biopolymer hemicellulose is a heterogeneous biopolymer that accounts for about 20 35 of the lignocellulosic biomass 56 unlike cellulose hemicellulose contains shortly branched and has a low degree of polymerization which is approximated between 80 and 200 fig 4b 53 it is comprised of pentoses xylose arabinose hexoses mannose glucose galactose fucose and uronic acids glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid however these components vary depending on the source or type of lignocellulosic biomass 57 for example hardwood biomass mainly consists of o acetyl 4 o methylglucurono b d xylans whereas the soft wood is predominated by acetylated galacto glucomannans 53 therefore these properties make hemicellulose to be potentially useful in different applications including thermoplastics hydrogels additives in paper making and drug carriers in medicine 58 nevertheless the major disadvantage of hemicellulose it easily dissolves in various solvents such as water however the addition of different additives could enhance its properties 41 5 pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass 5 1 extraction of cellulose from lignocellulose biomass pre treatment is the limiting step in biorefinery during the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into valuable products such as cellulose lignin hemicellulose and biofuel cellulose biopolymer is isolated using different methods such as physical chemical biological and physicochemical pretreatments 59 fig 3 however in respect with the biological treatment will only focus on the physical chemical and physicochemical pretreatments since are often used to extract the cellulose from lignocellulosic biomass the efficiency of these methods depends on the type of biomass to be treated 60 in addition the selection of methods also depends on various factors such as economic feasibility and environmental impact pre treatment destroys the intra and inter molecular hydrogen bonds of lignocellulosic biomass which fractionate biopolymers into different parts as presented in fig 4 table 1 shows the content of cellulose extracted from various types of lignocellulosic biomass 5 1 1 physical extraction physical treatment is the most environmentally friendly method that is often employed during the first stage of pretreatment different techniques that are used during physical treatment includes milling chipping grinding freezing and radiation 51 these techniques alter the structure of the lignocellulosic biomass which enhances the surface area of the biomass and reduces the degree of polymerization dp although physical pretreatment is the most environmentally friendly technique the disadvantages of these methods are the demanding of energy and longer pretreatment time to achieve the intended product 5 1 2 chemical extraction chemical treatment is the most employed method due to the ability to reduce the content of hemicellulose and lignin while enhancing the content of cellulose biopolymer 60 acid and alkaline solutions are the most used chemicals in biorefinery 67 acid generally solubilized the hemicellulose by cleaving the arabinoxylan and acetyl groups 60 whereas the alkaline react with coniferyl sinapyl and coumaryl groups of lignin structure which leads to the dissolution and breaking of crosslinking between these respective monomers 31 however the effectiveness of these chemicals depends on the type of lignocellulosic biomass 5 1 2 1 acid extraction brienzo et al 60 extracted cellulose from 19 different materials of sugarcane bagasse using dilute acid dried sugarcane bagasse was added into separate reactors containing sulphuric acid and treated at different temperatures 150 c 160 c and 180 c for about 15 min after that acid treated sugarcane bagasse was washed with the large volume of distilled water to get rid of the residues they reported that high temperature was crucial in the removal of hemicelluloses in most of the samples except for few after treatment the average content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 66 77 1 55 and 29 22 respectively garcia et al 68 used the weak organic acid citric acid to isolate the cellulose from raw sugarcane bagasse dried sugarcane bagasse was transferred into different round bottom flask containing various concentrations 0 35 wt to 11 6 wt of citric acid next the solution mixture was treated under atmospheric pressure at 100 c at different time 17 6 min 102 4 min then the mixture solution was filtered washed with distilled water oven dried and stored in sealed zip lock plastic bag prior to characterizations and application they reported that high concentration of citric acid and longer treatment was crucial during the isolation of cellulose additionally the major advantage of this method it uses renewable acid which is sustainable and less toxic however the major disadvantages are the demanding of high energy and longer pretreating period 5 1 2 2 alkaline extraction the removal of lignin biopolymer is important as it further reduces the recalcitrance of lignocellulose biomass for this reason researchers have developed methods to reduce both the hemicellulose and lignin biopolymers for example wang et al 64 investigated the effect of sodium hydroxide naoh in the treatment of herbaceous wheat straw corn straw and sugarcane bagasse softwood cypress and hardwood pterocarpus soyauxii biomass lignocellulosic biomass was subjected into separate solution of naoh 2 w v ratio 1 10 w v at 80 c for 2 h after that sodium treated biomass was filtered washed with distilled water to remove the residuals and oven dried at 60 c after treatment more than 70 removal of lignin was recorded on treated herbaceous biomass and among the treated herbaceous biomass sodium treated corn cobs shows highest removal recorded content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 60 7 22 5 and 6 5 respectively lignin removal on softwood biomass and hardwood was 16 and 39 respectively a significant difference of lignin removal was attributed to the components of lignin contained in these different types of biomass herbaceous and hardwood contained three principal phenylpropane units namely guaiacyl g syringyl s and p hydroxyphenyl h softwood biomass only consists of g and h units which could be responsible for recalcitrance of this biomass marković nikolić et al 61 explored green liquids na2co3 and nacl to extract the cellulose from lignocellulose biomass l vulgaris shell dried shell 5 g was treated with 100 ml of weak alkaline solution 1 na2co3 and 1 nacl for 4 h at 25 c next the solution mixture was stirred at a speed of 150 rpm under the atmospheric pressure and subsequently washed with distilled water then dried at 80 c after pretreatment the content of cellulose and lignin increased which was attributed to the dissolution of hemicellulose 5 1 2 3 alkaline and acid extractions a combination of alkaline solution and acid solution has been reported as the most effective method to remove lignin and hemicellulose thiangtham et al 65 used the combination of dilute alkaline peroxide and dilute acid to extract the microcrystalline cellulose from sugarcane bagasse dried sugarcane bagasse was treated with alkaline peroxide 10 w v for 4 h at 80 c to remove the lignin hemicellulose and some organics to remove the coloring matters sodium treated material was subjected into a bleaching agent h2o2 10 v v 0 5 m naoh for 1 h at 80 c solid particles was recovered by filtering and washed with distilled water to remove the remaining residues subsequently bleached material was treated with hydrochloric acid 4 m hcl for 1 h at 80 c to obtain the microcrystalline cellulose after pretreatment the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 87 3 6 9 and 6 5 respectively ayeni and daramola 63 fractionated cellulose hemicellulose and lignin from corn cobs lignocellulosic biomass using six different pretreatment methods a certain grams of dried corn cobs were subjected into the aqueous solutions containing a 1 v v h2o2 b 0 1 g naoh g dry biomass c 0 1 g ca oh 2 g dry biomass d 1 v v h2o2 and 0 2 g naoh g dry biomass e 1 v v h2o2 and 0 6 g ca oh 2 g dry biomass and f 0 1 g 10 w w h2so4 g dry biomass all experiments were conducted in the autoclave with a pressure of 0 14 mpa and the reaction was performed at 120 c for about 30 min among these solutions a combination of hydrogen peroxide h202 and naoh was the most effective method to fractionate polysaccharides in this method the recorded content of cellulose hemicellulose lignin and ash was 58 66 17 37 12 98 and 3 44 respectively all the other methods the content of extracted cellulose was below 50 de oliveira et al 4 extracted cellulose from rice husk and oat husk using a dilute sodium hydroxide dilute acetic acid and dilute sodium chlorite a specific grams of milled husks from rice and oak were subjected into a jacketed glass reactor containing a solution of sodium hydroxide 4 w v and the mixture was stirred for 4 h at 90 c subsequently sodium treated husks was bleached four times using the solution mixture of sodium hydroxide acetic acid and an aqueous solution of sodium chlorite at 90 c for 4 h after pretreatment of rice husk the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 93 1 4 2 and 0 8 respectively whereas the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin on treated oat husk was 94 1 1 4 and 1 0 respectively although a chemical method is efficient when compared to counterpart physical method major disadvantages are the high cost of chemicals and their toxicity towards the environment therefore it is important to use non or less toxic chemicals to protect the ecological environment 5 1 3 physicochemical extraction different types of physicochemical pretreatment that are used include hydrothermal pretreatment or liquid hot water and steam explosion treatment route 69 these methods are environmentally friendly as they only uses heat and water to fractionate cellulose hemicellulose and lignin from lignocellulosic biomass 70 lee and park 66 compared the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment and non thermal pre treatment milling in fractionating the cellulose hemicellulose and lignin from sunflower residues stem leaf and flower dried sunflower residues was subjected into a stainless steel vessel containing 300 ml of distilled water and treated for 30 min at different temperatures 160 c to 220 c solid residues were separated from liquid using a centrifuge instrument dried and grounded into a desired particle size separately the dried sunflower was milled into desired particles size a significant difference was observed between the two methods after hydrothermal treatment the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 78 1 3 0 and 18 9 respectively whereas after non hydrothermal pretreatment the content of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was 61 1 27 6 and 11 3 respectively hydrothermal treatment was effective as other reported chemical methods however the demands of high energy are the major disadvantage associated to this technique 5 2 extraction of lignin from lignocellulosic biomass during biorefinery a large volume of by products are generated and lignin biopolymer forms a large part of this waste solution in most cases this waste gets burned to provide heat and energy for the particular industry 71 due to the aforementioned valorization of lignin has gained interest in various applications including medicine as wound dressing 72 and water treatment technology as biosorbent table 2 represents different methods such as organosolv acid solution alkaline solution and microwaves which are often employed to extract the lignin from lignocellulosic biomass the quality of lignin produced differs as it depends on the effectiveness of selected methods and the source of biomass 73 furthermore these methods are reported to have their advantages and disadvantages for example organosolv produces high yield of lignin but with a highly modified structure acid treatment has the advantage of hydrolysing other carbohydrates however undesired condensation reaction might also occur in addition acid causes the corrosion of equipment and ionic liquid could be recovered after extraction however the process of extraction is complex as compared to other methods 52 5 2 1 alkaline and acid extractions ratanasumarn and chitpraser 74 employed the response surface methodology rsm to investigate the optimum parameters for the extraction of lignin from sugarcane bagasse using an alkaline solution sugarcane bagasse 0 5 g was added into separate autoclaves containing different concentrations of sodium hydroxide 3 7 w v prior to the pretreating process at various temperatures 110 130 c and different times 30 60 min after subjected to alkaline hydrolysis extracts were filtered using the nylon filter 0 45 μm followed by the dialysis against distilled water 50 1 volume ratio at room temperature to reach the neutral ph solution and the collected solid product was placed at 20 c they found that the optimum parameters were sodium hydroxide solution concentration of 7 w v temperature of 135 c and time of 47 92 min in addition the recorded extraction efficiency weight average molecular weight and a number of average molecular weight was 78 93 3954 da and 2025 da respectively ftir analysis was used to confirm the functional groups of extracted lignin and the bands at 1592 cm 1 1511 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 were attributed to the aromatic skeletal vibrations of lignin whereas the bands at 1461 cm 1 1383 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 were correlated to the ch deformations the vibration of hydroxyl phenolic groups oh and conjugated carbonyl groups co respectively in addition ftir analysis also shows that the extracted lignin had some impurities which were related to the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and some carbohydrate sugars frança et al 52 extracted lignin from cashew apple bagasse cab using different types of pretreatment methods including dilute acid da acid alkali aa and alkaline hydrogen peroxide ahp in da extraction cab was loaded into an autoclave containing 0 6 m h2so4 solution and treated for 15 min at 121 c then the liquid containing lignin was recovered and washed with distilled water a combination of acid and alkaline was conducted using 0 6 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh respectively and the process of extraction was conducted for 15 min at 121 c in each step sulphuric acid was expected to remove the hemicellulose by hydrolysing the ether bonds in lignin phenolics carbohydrates complexes whereas sodium hydroxide produces the liquid solution which is free of unwanted carbohydrates ahp extraction was conducted by loading cab in the mixture solution containing sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide 4 3 v v at ph 11 then the mixture solution was treated using the orbital shaker for 6 h at 35 c lignin was recovered and washed with distilled water to remove the residuals lignin removal rates for da aa and ahp were 11 7 98 0 and 96 9 respectively 5 2 2 alkaline and ultrasound extractions lignin was extracted from rice straw using the combination of ultrasound and alkaline solution 75 rice straw was sonicated at different times intervals 0 40 min in the presence of 2 m naoh solution at 90 c then suspension mixture continued to stir for 1 5 h at 90 c and filtrated using the nylon cloth the filtrate was acidified before been precipitated with three volumes of ethanol 95 for 6 h next solid rich in hemicellulose was washed with ethanol 70 and air dried to recover the lignin dried material was acidified to ph 1 5 using hcl followed by washing and freeze drying they reported that ultrasound has effectively enhanced the lignin separation yield from the rice straw with 84 9 recorded 5 2 3 organosolv and acid extractions sohni et al 55 extracted lignin from the residues of palm kernel shell pks biomass dried pks 5 g was added into a flask containing the solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran 90 ml and 2 n h2so4 10 ml then stirred for 30 min at 70 c to recover the lignin the solution was filtered and tetrahydrofuran recovered using a rotary evaporator after that the filtrate containing dissolved lignin was slowly added into warm distilled water before centrifuging freitas et al 54 employed the green method to produce lignin of different size scales including microparticles and nanoparticles they extracted lignin from corncobs using two sequential pretreatment methods firstly biomass was subjected under liquid hot water at 200 c for 30 min and then treated with ethanol 60 v v solution at 140 c for 40 min therefore crude lignin was treated with ethanol 100 and the dissolved lignin was dripped into the water to produce different particles the solvent was removed through vacuum evaporation process at a constant temperature of 40 c and the remaining lignin was freeze dried to get the final particle size in another study chen et al 76 extracted lignin from switchgrass using deep eutectic solvent des switchgrass 10 g was added into a glass bottle containing the solvent of choline chloride ethylene glycol 250 ml and acidified with 1 h2so4 before been placed into a preheated oil bath then the solution mixture containing various concentrations of switch grass 10 wt 20 wt and 27 was pretreated in different periods 30 min and 45 min at 130 c subsequently 50 ml of acetone and water 50 50 v v was added and the solution was filtered using the vacuum then the filtrate containing lignin was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and the recovered lignin was washed with the solution mixture of ethanol and water 50 50 v v to remove the residuals in another work masilompane et al 77 isolated lignin from the black liquor generated from the pulp and paper industry to recover the lignin the solution was acidified to ph 3 using sulphuric acid then the acidified solution was placed at 4 c for 3 days to allow appropriate coagulation and precipitation subsequently the solution mixture was centrifuged washed with sulphuric acid and distilled water to remove the residues respectively 5 2 4 organosolv and microwave extractions the lignin was extracted from wood powder using the combination of ionic liquid and microwave irradiation by sun et al 78 and they obtained the solution which was rich in carbohydrates then the filtrate was slowly dropped into the acidified water ph 2 to precipitate the lignin finally the recovered solid was washed with distilled water to remove the remaining residues they reported that approximately 45 8 of lignin was extracted within 40 min at 140 c this method was reported to be green and economical as the ionic liquid was recovered from the solution using the evaporation process angelini et al 57 isolated the lignin from phragmites australis common reed using steam explosion and microwave assisted in the presence of g valerolactone gvl as organosolv this method was reported to be more greenish because there was no addition of acid as reported in other techniques 5 3 extraction of hemicellulose from lignocellulosic biomass hemicellulose polysaccharides are often treated as waste along with lignin and other extractives during the process of biorefinery this biopolymer is covalently crosslinked with the lignin and cellulose through hydrogen linkage consequently robust methods are required to isolate these biopolymers 79 techniques that are used often to isolate hemicellulose from lignocellulosic biomass are tabulated in table 2 5 3 1 alkaline extraction alkaline is regarded as one of the most effective methods used for the extraction of hemicellulose due to the ability to disrupt the ethers and esters bonds linking the hemicellulose and lignin in the plant cell 53 58 geng et al 53 used the alkaline method to extract hemicellulose from different types of biomass including hardwood biomass and soft wood biomass biomass was added into a 250 ml boiling flask containing sodium hydroxide 10 w v solution and treated for 3 h at 50 c then the solution mixture was vacuum filtered and the filtrate was adjusted to ph 5 using acetic acid subsequently the solution was precipitated using ethanol 95 washed with ethanol 70 filtered using a filter paper and freeze dried they found that high content of hemicellulose was extracted from softwood biomass 23 26 as compared to the hardwood biomass 17 19 in another work farhat et al 58 employed the alkaline method to isolate hemicellulose from bleached hardwood pulp b hwp and partially delignified switchgrass swg lignin was extracted from the switchgrass before it was subjected to hemicellulose isolation milled swg was treated with a solution mixture containing naoh 2 wt and anhydrous alcohol 70 and this was conducted at 75 c for 2 5 h using a mechanical stirrer to recover the solid solution mixture was vacuum filtered using a whatman filter paper after that partially swg was treated with different concentrations of sodium hydroxide 3 wt 7 wt 10 wt 13 wt and 17 wt for 3 h at 50 c to extract the hemicellulose b hwp was also treated separately with sodium hydroxide 10 at a similar time and temperature solution mixture containing solubilized hemicellulose was filtered using a vacuum filter and the solution ph of filtrate was adjusted between 5 and 6 using acetic acid 25 then the solution mixture was treated with ethanol 70 to further precipitate the material and allowed to settle for 2 days without stirring the final product was filtered and freeze dried to yield hemicellulose powder they reported that low extraction of hemicellulose about 40 yield in swg when using 3 wt of naoh whereas high extraction about 72 yield recorded when using 10 wt of naoh this shows that alkaline solution was crucial in breaking down the esters and ether bonds connecting lignin and hemicellulose biopolymers however lower yield was recorded when the concentration of alkaline 13 wt and 17 wt increases which was attributed to the degradation of hemicellulose 5 3 2 ultrasound and acid extractions mohammadabadi and javanbakh 80 used ultrasound and dilute acid to extract the hemicellulose biopolymer from barley straws waste dried barley straws were added into an erlenmeyer flask containing sulphuric acid 3 7 wt and placed into an ultrasonic bath for 40 min at 80 c subsequently the solution mixture was stirred for 23 min at 90 c prior to filtration after that sodium hydroxide was added to adjust the solution to ph 7 then the adjusted solution was transferred into another flask containing ethanol stirred for 6 h and the solid was recovered and dried at 50 c 6 preparation of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites for the removal of inorganic contaminants different techniques such as blending method 16 solution casting method 81 freeze drying method 82 sol gel phase inversion method 83 and electrospinning method 84 are used during the preparation of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites to validate the efficacy of selected method different instruments including fourier transform infrared ftir x ray diffractometer xrd scanning electron microscope sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and thermogravimetric analysis tga are used to analyze the physicochemical properties of the biocomposite 6 1 synthesis of biochar chitosan biocomposite biochar is produced through a slow or fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass at the temperature ranging between 300 c and 800 c in the absence of oxygen 17 recently researchers have been focusing on using biochar as adsorbents for the removal of various soluble contaminants from aqueous solutions 85 however similarly to other lignocellulosic derivatives raw biochar contained low adsorption capacity and for this reason different techniques and modifying agents including chitosan are used to enhance the effectiveness of biochar adsorbent 16 6 1 1 blending technique huang et al 85 employed the blending method to prepare the crosslinked biochar chitosan composite and used it for the adsorption of phosphate in aqueous solutions they converted the biochar from wheat straw reacted it with chitosan solution quaternary ammonium salt and lanthanum to form the biocomposite composite was crosslinked with glutaraldehyde using two different approaches in the first approach amine of chitosan was directly reacted with the crosslinking agent the second approach amine was protected with the formaldehyde before reacted with the crosslinking agent masih et al 16 converted rice husk into biochar and blended it with chitosan solution to form the gel which was used for the adsorption of copper cu ii from aqueous solution prepared chitosan solution was blended with rice husk biochar 100 g at a speed of 150 rpm for 24 h then the formed gel was washed with deionized water and oven dried prior to the next step dried material was treated with the solution of naoh 0 5 for 3 h washed with deionized water and oven dried although the modified lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites shows the potential to remove various contaminants from aqueous solution separating the material after adsorption remain a challenge however incorporating magnetic particles within the composite reported to enhance the separation between the liquid and saturated material xiao et al 17 prepared the magnetic composite which was comprised of biochar from loofah sponge iron chloride and chitosan for the adsorption of chromium cr vi and cu ii from aqueous solutions different concentrations of chitosan 0 04 w v 0 06 w v 0 08 w v and 0 1 w v were prepared mixed with the suspension of magnetic biochar and glutaraldehyde solution for about 30 min at 60 c subsequently the solution mixture was adjusted to ph 11 using naoh and continue to stir for the next 2 h this method is not only simple but faster comparing to other reported techniques 6 1 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite xiao et al 17 reported the difference between the unmodified biochar and modified magnetic biochar chitosan composite ftir spectrum of modified composite shows the peaks at 3340 cm 1 and 569 cm 1 that were due to the presence of nh stretching bands and feo bands respectively according to the sem analysis the morphology of modified biochar contained pore channels and internal mesopores whereas the pristine biochar exhibits smooth surface huang et al 85 found that according to the ftir analysis the spectrum of unprotected amine composite shows the strong band at 1658 4 cm 1 which was correlated to the cn bond therefore this demonstrated that the amine functional groups reacted with the carbonyl groups of glutaraldehyde they reported that amine was significant during the adsorption of phosphate as lower removal and higher removal was recorded for unprotected amine composite and protected amine composite respectively 6 2 synthesis of cellulose chitosan biocomposite 6 2 1 blending and solution casting techniques the blending and casting methods were employed by rahmi et al 19 to prepare the chitosan cellulose biocomposite film for adsorption of cadmium cd ii ions from aqueous solution they investigated the impact of adding different content of cellulose extracted from oil palm empty fruit in the formation of biocomposite film a chitosan solution was prepared and mixed at room temperature with various concentrations of cellulose suspension 0 1 10 30 and 50 w w to form the biocomposite film to form a film solution mixture was added into a polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic container and dried for 24 h at room temperature advantage of this method is facile and it requires less energy as it performed in ambient temperature 6 2 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite rahmi et al 19 reported that 10 of cellulose was enough to enhance the mechanical strength of the chitosan cellulose biocomposite film xrd shows the cellulose chitosan biocomposite has low crystallinity when compared to the isolated pristine cellulose and chitosan biopolymers therefore this indicated that the biocomposite was amorphous which was beneficial for the adsorption of cd ii according to sem analysis the morphology of biocomposite film shows a homogenous but rough surface was observed after the addition of cellulose particles 6 2 2 blending and freeze drying techniques the freeze drying method was employed by li et al 40 to develop a chitosan nanofabricated cellulose cs nfc aerogel for the adsorption of lead pb in aqueous solution nanofibrillated cellulose suspensions were collected from the local company tianjin haojia cellulose co ltd chitosan solution 2 wt was prepared using acetic acid 1 v v and mixed with the suspension of nanofibrillated cellulose nfc then solution mixture was vigorously blended at a speed of 2000 rpm the formed mixture was added into the cylindrical ptfe mold and frozen using liquid nitrogen aerogel was formed by placing the frozen mixture in a shelf lyophilizer for 24 h prepared biocomposite was washed with naoh 2 wt solution and deionized water to remove the residual zhang et al 86 also used the freeze drying technique to prepare the crosslinked chitosan cellulose biocomposite sponge for the adsorption of mercury hg ii from aqueous solution however unlike the method reported by li et al 40 they obtained their intended composite in few hours chitosan solution and polyvinyl alcohol pva was prepared in a beaker pva was added into the mixture as a supporting filler and also for the formation of pores structure subsequently different volume 7 5 75 ml of cellulose suspension 2 wt was added into the solution and stirred for 1 h after that glutaraldehyde was slowly added as a crosslinking agent and continues to stir for 1 h to obtain the sponge the homogenous mixture was lyophilized at 67 c and 1 pa yang et al 87 synthesized the cellulose chitosan composites hydrogels that were used as sorbents for the removal of copper cu2 from aqueous solution cellulose and chitosan biopolymers were transferred into a glass bottle containing the lithium bromide libr 60 wt solution and stirred for 1 min in room temperature the total concentration of cellulose chitosan dissolved in libr was 2 wt however the cellulose to chitosan loading ratio were varied 37 63 50 50 75 25 80 20 90 10 and 100 0 respectively next the mixture solution was blended under high temperature 110 c for 4 min to dissolve the cellulose and chitosan subsequently the solution mixture was poured into a dish and allowed to cool to form the gel after that the hydrogel was washed with the distilled water to remove the salt of libr and to regenerate the cellulose and chitosan then the hydrogel composite was solvent exchanged with water ethanol and tert butanol prior to freeze drying 6 2 2 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite li et al 40 reported that the cs nfc aerogel biocomposite had the highly porous structure after employing the freeze drying technique which was favorable for the adsorption of pb from aqueous solution ftir analysis confirms the addition of new functional groups the spectrum of cs nfc shows that the peak at 1560 cm 1 gets weakened which was attributed to the interaction between the amine n h of chitosan and hydroxyl groups of cellulose zhang et al 86 applied the xps analysis to investigate the interaction within chitosan cellulose composite and they found that formation was through the schiff base reaction cn 287 9 ev in addition modified sponge exhibits the absorption band at 1638 cm 1 which was also attributed to the cn bonds it was found that adding more volume of cellulose suspensions decreases the removal of hg ii in aqueous solutions however the cellulose was critical in enhancing the thermal stability of the composite yang et al 87 reported that increasing the cellulose loading in the cellulose chitosan hydrogel composite enhances the density of hydrogel while decreasing the surface area in addition composite hydrogel shows high mechanical strength which was attributed to the interaction or formation of strong bond between the hydroxyl group oh of cellulose and nitrogen in amine group nh2 of chitosan furthermore bet analysis shows that the addition of chitosan in the composite hydrogel increases the surface area however the pore size distribution curve of the composite was smaller than that of cellulose hydrogel which was related to the strong bonding between functional groups of cellulose and chitosan biopolymers according to the sem analysis the cellulose chitosan composite hydrogel and pure cellulose hydrogel had different morphology with the former hydrogel showing a thicker framework than the latter hydrogel therefore this shows that the synthesized composite hydrogel had better improved properties which are potential for adsorption of metal ions 6 3 synthesis of hemicellulose chitosan biocomposite 6 3 1 blending and freeze drying techniques wu et al 41 synthesized the crosslinked biocomposite resin consisting of carboxymethyl chitosan cmc and hemicellulose hc for the adsorption of ni ii cd ii cu ii hg ii mn vii and cr vi from aqueous solution the interaction between the cmc and hc was reported to occur through the schiff based reaction process in another study wu et al 38 prepared the ternary biocomposite comprised of carboxymethyl chitosan cmc hemicellulose hc and nanosized tio2 chnt for the removal of ni ii cd ii cu ii hg ii mn vii and cr vi from aqueous solution tio2 nanoparticles powder was added into a flask containing a solution of glacial acetic acid 50 ml 2 v v and sodium dodecyl sulfate 56 mg then the solution mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature subsequently cmc 1 5 g was added into the solution and stirred for 4 h after that the solution mixture was exposed to ultrasonic treatment for 15 min in each half hour intervals next hc 6 g was added into the suspension temperature was raised to 100 c and stirred for 2 h under reflux to obtain a hydrogel then the hydrogel was collected and heated for 7 h in the oven under atmospheric pressure at 40 c washed with distilled water and freeze dried for 24 h at 50 c 6 3 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite wu et al 41 found that after employing the blending and freeze dying process synthesized biocomposite comprising of carboxylmethyl chitosan cmc and hemicellulose hc shows different properties as compared to the pristine cmc and hc polymers ftir analysis shows a broad signal peak at 1043 cm 1 which was attributed to the stretching and vibration of co cc or coh found in hemicellulose polysaccharides whereas the cmc spectrum shows the peaks at 1629 cm 1 and 1401 cm 1 corresponding to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching of carboxyl functional groups synthesized biocomposite exhibits a new peak at 1644 cm 1 that was due to the cn groups therefore this shows that the reaction between cmc and hc was through a schiff base reaction moreover according to the sem analysis synthesized composite shows the morphology with a connected 3d structure and open pores structure the formation of pores was attributed to various factors such as freezing rate wu et al 38 reported that according to sem analysis the surface of chnt was very smooth which was correlated to the addition of tio2 nanoparticles in addition bet specific surface area 430 m2 g of synthesized chnt was increased while the porosity was reported to reach a maximum of 90 after the addition of tio2 nanoparticles this shows that the addition of nanoparticles significantly influenced the final properties of the synthesized biocomposite 6 4 synthesis of lignin chitosan biocomposite 6 4 1 blending and free radical polymerization techniques the free radical polymerization method was used by mu et al 88 to synthesize the biocomposites comprising of lignosulfonate and chitosan csl for the adsorption of copper ion cu ii and cobalt ion co ii from aqueous solution sodium sulfonate 0 75 g was dissolved into deionized water 30 ml and subsequently blended with chitosan 2 5 v v solution using the magnetic stir at 30 c after that acrylic acid 10 ml n n methylenedipropylamide 0 1 g and ammonium persulfate 0 1 g were added into the above solution mixture the temperature was raised to 60 c and continue to stir for 3 h under nitrogen condition during the process of heating and mixing sulfate radicals are expected to initiate the formation of oh radicals as a result these radicals will attack the functional groups oh nh2 and so3 of lignin sulfonate and chitosan hence forming the chains within the biocomposite 6 4 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite mu et al 88 reported that according to the sem analysis surface morphology of the prepared lignosulfonate chitosan biocomposite csl shows the porous structure pore diameter was below 2 μm and more folds were also detected around the pores therefore these detected porous structure reported to induce the interaction between the contaminants cu ii and co ii and surface site of biocomposite during adsorption process ftir analysis further confirms the physicochemical changes in the new prepared biocomposite absorption bands at 3540 cm 1 1720 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 were attributed to the vibration stretching of hydroxyl groups and nh groups and aromatic ring vibration respectively in addition the bands at 1390 cm 1 1160 cm 1 and 810 cm 1 were associated to the sulfonic acid characteristic therefore all these functional groups confirmed that chitosan and lignosulfonate was successfully synthesized 6 5 adsorption of inorganic contaminants from aqueous solution using the synthesized lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites lignocellulosic derivatives have been used as adsorbents for the removal of different inorganic contaminants from aqueous solution as summarized in table 3 however it has been recognized that these materials exhibit limited adsorption capacity and in order to improve the adsorption capacity chitosan was added into the lignocellulosic based derivatives as a modifying agent see table 3 in general the presence of chitosan improved the adsorption capacity when compared lignocellulosic derivatives adsorbents this was attributed to the additional functional groups amines brought by chitosan as discussed in the next sections 6 5 1 heavy metals wastewater from anthropogenic sources such as mining and chemical industries often contains high concentrations of heavy metals 95 this wastewater diffuses into the aquatic environment and potentially reduces the quality of water and soil 96 the major problems of heavy metals are non degradable and persist in the aquatic environment for a long period of time 86 in traces heavy metals are essential in living things however high concentrations are harmful and cause diseases such as renal disorder and high blood pressure 19 16 human beings get exposed to heavy metals either through inhalation or by directly drinking the contaminated water 97 different types of adsorbents such as activated carbon and silica gel have been used to remove heavy metals in wastewater however they are expensive especially for developing countries 11 17 as such biocomposites made of lignocellulosic derivatives and chitosan biopolymers have been explored as low cost adsorbents to remove heavy metals in wastewater 6 5 2 adsorption mechanism of heavy metals on synthesized biocomposites heavy metals are removed from aqueous solution either through physical adsorption precipitation complexation and ion exchange as illustrated in fig 5 17 however the adsorption rate is based on the availability of functional groups or activate site on the surface of modified biocomposite 27 6 5 2 1 biochar chitosan biocomposite masih et al 16 shows that the biocomposite made of rice husk biochar and chitosan successfully reduced the concentrations of cu ii from aqueous solution according to their results when the concentration of cu ii was 5 mg l the adsorption capacity of raw rice husk rrh acid treated rice husk atrh and carbon chitosan rice husk ccrh were 3 685 mg g 4 222 mg g and 4 939 mg g respectively highest removal observed for ccrh composite was attributed to the addition of chitosan furthermore the adsorption of cu ii increases with the increasing of ph in solution with the optimum recorded at ph 7 and the adsorption equilibrium was reached after 480 min experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second kinetic model suggesting the adsorption mechanism was due to the chemical attraction among the studied adsorption isotherms the experimental data best fitted to the langmuir adsorption isotherm r2 0 995 demonstrating the homogeneous surface and monolayer adsorption in addition according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm the maximum adsorption for rrh atrh and synthesized ccrh were 1 395 mg g 4 127 mg g and 90 909 mg g respectively thermodynamic parameters show the negative values of enthalpy h and entropy s demonstrating the adsorption of cu ii was exothermic and randomness respectively magnetic biochar chitosan biocomposite prepared by xiao et al 17 was quick to adsorbs cr iv and cu ii in aqueous solutions removal was high within the first 2 h gradually decreases as the time increases and the equilibrium was reached within 18 h however the adsorption was ph dependent and high adsorption capacity was recorded at ph 2 30 14 mg g and ph 7 54 68 mg g for cr iv and cu ii respectively moreover the experimental data best fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model for both metals demonstrating the adsorption was due to the chemical attractions between the ions furthermore the material was recyclable however the removal decreases after three cycles which was attributed to the changes in physical properties of adsorbents although the adsorption of heavy metals was ph dependent the synthesized biochar chitosan biocomposites shows the potential to remove these contaminants from aqueous solutions 6 5 2 2 cellulose chitosan biocomposite the synthesized chitosan cellulose biocomposite film prepared by rahmi et al 19 successfully removes the cd ii from aqueous solution they found that increasing the concentration of cellulose in the film decreases the removal of cd ii from aqueous solution this shows that chitosan enhanced the adsorption site due to the coordination between the metal ion and amino functional groups for adsorption purpose the film was grinded into fine particles and they recorded the adsorption capacity and percentage removal of 0 952 mg g and 79 respectively however the adsorption of cd ii on modified adsorbent was ph dependent and the lowest removal recorded at acidic range was due to the electrostatic repulsion between the ions the experimental data both fitted to the langmuir and freundlich isotherm model indicating the adsorbent surface was homogenous and heterogeneous respectively moreover the modified biocomposite film was recyclable and it was used for several cycles without losing its original form yang et al 87 found that the adsorption of cu2 ions using the freeze dried synthesized cellulose chitosan composite hydrogel 92 7 mg g was 10 times higher than that of pure cellulose hydrogel 9 7 mg g and this shows the significant of chitosan within the composite high removal on synthesized composite was due to the interaction between amine and metal ion through chelation process however the removal of cu2 ion was low at acidic conditions which was related to the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated amine nh3 and positive charge of metal ion moreover the experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir adsorption isotherm demonstrating the adsorption was through chemical binding and monolayer occurs respectively additionally the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by the langmuir adsorption isotherm was 94 3 mg g which was closer to the experimental results 93 6 mg g li et al 40 found that the synthesized aerogel was quick to adsorb pb ii and the adsorption capacity of 248 5 mg g was achieved after equilibrium of 1 h experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir adsorption isotherm indicating the adsorption of pd ii was chemical and occur in the form of monolayer respectively according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm the maximum adsorption capacity was 252 6 mg g which is closer to the reported experimental data moreover the interaction between pd ii and biocomposite was attributed to the microchannel structure and amino functional groups within the surface of biosorbent regeneration study was done and the material was re used for several cycles without losing much of its adsorption capacity zhang et al 86 also observed quick removal of hg ii when using the crosslinked chitosan cellulose biocomposite sponge in 2 min about 97 of hg ii was removed and the adsorption capacity of 495 mg g was achieved at equilibrium time of 60 min however the adsorption of hg ii was ph dependent and the optimum value recorded at ph 5 5 low removal was related to the competition between the hydrogen ions h and positive charges of hg ii metal species in addition low removal was also attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated amine functional groups in chitosan and the positive charge of hg ii according to the kinetic models and isotherm models experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir adsorption isotherm demonstrating the adsorption of hg ii on the surface site was through chemisorption and occurs as a monolayer respectively furthermore the biocomposite was renewable and 85 removal was maintained after five cycles in another work li et al 82 adsorbs cu ii from aqueous solution using hydrogel biocomposite comprised of chitosan and office waste paper they found that the removal of cu ii ion on synthesized adsorbent was through the coordination between the metal ion and amino functional groups demonstrating that the addition of chitosan had a major impact on the adsorption of metal ions batch studies show that the adsorption of cu ii was through chemisorption as the kinetic model favors the pseudo second order model high removal was observed after 3 5 h and the equilibrium was reached after 8 5 h furthermore the adsorption capacity increases with the increasing of initial concentration according to the isotherm study langmuir adsorption isotherm was the best fitting model indicating the morphology of composite was uniform and a single layer molecule was formed moreover the modified biocomposite was regenerable and easily recovered as it floats on top of the solution which was due to its low density 6 5 2 3 hemicellulose chitosan biocomposite wu et al 41 reported that the adsorption of ni ii cd ii cu ii hg ii mn vii and cr vi by synthesized biocomposite cmch was ph dependent with the highest removal recorded between 3 and 4 ph solution low removal at ph 3 was due to the repulsion of ions as the surface was highly protonated whereas at higher ph metals reported to precipitate after interactions with the hydroxyl ions oh and thus limit their interaction with the surface active site ftir analysis shows that the nh2 cooh and oh functional groups were involved during the process of adsorbing metals from an aqueous solution moreover the composite reached equilibrium after 7 h which is quite long as compared to other biocomposites reported by other researchers furthermore the experimental data were best fitted to the pseudo second order model and langmuir adsorption isotherm model demonstrating that the adsorption of metals on the surface of cmch biocomposite was through chemisorption and monolayer adsorption according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm the recorded maximum adsorption capacity for ni ii cd ii cu ii mn vii hg ii and cr vi were 362 3 mg g 909 1 mg g 333 3 mg g 42 0 mg g 28 2 mg g and 49 0 mg g respectively regeneration study shows these heavy metals could be easily desorbed from the surface by using 0 1 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and then the material was used again for several cycles wu et al 38 found that the removal of ni ii cd ii cu ii hg ii mn vii and cr vi on synthesized chnt biocomposite was also ph dependent and the optimum ph values recorded between 2 and 4 protonation of surface area at lower ph was reported to be responsible for lower removal whereas at higher ph 4 hydroxyl coordination with metal might have occurred and thus reduces the interaction of heavy metals with the surface site of biosorbent according to ftir analysis on saturated chnt adsorbent the intensity of cn and nh functional groups decreases demonstrating that the hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups interacted with the metal ions through chelating process therefore this shows that chitosan had increased the removal of these heavy metals from aqueous solution furthermore the interaction of heavy metals with the surface of biocomposite differs and the pattern was in the following orders ni ii cd ii cu ii mn vii hg ii cr vi the highest removal was recorded as the time increases and the equilibrium was reached approximately after 7 h adsorption capacity for ni ii cd ii cu ii mn vii hg ii and cr vi were 32 2 mg g 27 6 mg g 13 5 mg g 9 4 mg g 4 8 mg g and 4 3 mg g respectively experimental data were fitted to the kinetic models and the pseudo second order model shows a higher correlation coefficient demonstrating the removal was through chemisorption furthermore experimental data was fitted to the intraparticle diffusion indicating the adsorption of heavy metals was fast at the beginning and then slows again therefore this shows the adsorption occurs in multiple steps moreover according to the isotherms models the experimental data best fitted to the langmuir adsorption isotherm demonstrating that the surface of chnt was homogenous and the adsorption mechanisms occurs through a monolayer 6 5 2 4 lignin chitosan biocomposite the adsorption of cu ii and co ii on synthesized lignosulfonate chitosan biocomposite csl was quick at the begging and gradually decreases as the time increases 88 removal of heavy metals was ph dependent and the lowest adsorption was recorded at the acidic region which was due to the repulsion between the positive ion of heavy metals and the positive ion of surface area furthermore experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion indicating the adsorption of heavy metals was through chemisorption and multiple processes occur highest adsorption capacity for cu ii and co ii was 283 mg g and 386 mg g respectively among the fitted adsorption isotherm models langmuir was reported as the best fit demonstrating that the adsorption of heavy metals on the surface of csl occurs as a monolayer they reported that the adsorbent was recyclable by using 0 1 m hcl and up to 5 cycles were conducted and the removal was kept above 80 therefore this indicated that the material was economical 6 5 3 phosphates phosphates are one of the essential elements used during the production of chemical fertilizers 98 it is the limiting nutrient during plant growth however an excess of phosphates reduces the quality of water induces eutrophication which leads to algal bloom 85 in abundance of algae inhibit penetration of light in water and when the algae die it get degraded by aerobic bacteria which leads to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water 99 therefore it is important to reduce the level of phosphate into permissible environmental water standards for the protection of our ecosystem conventional technologies such as chemical precipitation and biological method using activated sludge are often employed during the treatment of phosphate in wastewater 61 however chemicals are expensive and activated sludge may cause secondary pollution 100 therefore adsorption technology using biodegradable materials is recommended because is not only sustainable but as well as economical 101 6 5 4 adsorption mechanism of phosphates on modified biocomposites 6 5 4 1 biochar chitosan biocomposite huang et al 85 removes the phosphate from aqueous solution using the crosslinked biocomposite comprised of biochar chitosan quaternary ammonium salt and lanthanum according to the obtained results the adsorption of phosphate on the surface of modified biocomposite was driven by various mechanisms including electrostatic interaction ligand exchange and lewis acid base interaction fig 6 adsorption was ph dependent as the removal decreases with the increase of ph furthermore the composite was quick to adsorb about 96 removal was achieved just after 5 min when 100 mg l was the initial concentration of phosphate and the equilibrium was reached after 30 min isotherm study shows that the adsorption capacity increases from 51 5 mg g to 92 12 mg g when the initial concentration increases in addition among the adsorption isotherm the experimental data best fitted to the langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity of 108 86 mg g was recorded therefore this demonstrated that the adsorption of phosphate on synthesized composite occurs as a monolayer according to kinetic models the pseudo second order model was the best fit indicating the mechanisms of adsorption were via chemisorption moreover the modified biocomposite adsorbent shows poor renewability 34 removal which was attributed to the strong binding of phosphate on the surface of the composite 7 preparation of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites for the removal of organic contaminants the techniques reported in section 6 are also employed during the synthesis of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites for the removal of organic contaminants from aqueous solution as also reported in the biocomposites used for removal of inorganic contaminants lignocellulosic derivatives generally increased the mechanical strength of the synthesized biocomposites whereas the chitosan biopolymer enhanced the adsorption capacity as shown in table 4 7 1 cellulose chitosan biocomposite 7 1 1 blending and solution casting techniques zheng et al 102 prepared the composite film consisting of dialdehyde microfibrillated mfc cellulose and chitosan for the adsorption of anionic dye from wastewater to obtain microfibrillated cellulose a powder of microcrystalline mcc cellulose was reacted with naoh solution 10 for 2 h washed with distilled water to remove the residuals subsequently alkali treated mcc was homogenized under pressure to obtain a white milky mfc suspensions dialdehyde was prepared using sodium periodate in the absence of light before blended with chitosan solution hu et al 103 and simsek et al 104 employed the blending method to prepare the composite for adsorption of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and aromatic carbons respectively hu et al 103 prepared the cellulose nanocrystals chitosan beads for the adsorption of diclofenac sodium ds in aqueous solutions simsek et al 104 prepared the composite comprised of carbon fibers cf chitosan cht and polyvinyl alcohol pva composite for removal of bisphenol a bpa in aqueous solution different weight fractions of cf ranging between 0 5 and 3 was added into the mixture of cht pva solution and the composite was denoted cht pva cf 0 5 3 depending on the weight fractions of cf cht pva gopi et al 105 used the blending and casting methods to develop the biocomposite film comprised of cellulose acetate and chitosan polymers for removal of anionic dyes from aqueous solution chitosan powder was added into a beaker containing acetic acid and stirred at room temperature for 3 h subsequently different concentrations of cellulose acetate were added after that a solution mixture was sonicated for 45 min to get rid of the bubbles and casted in the polystyrene petri dish to form the desired film to remove the solvent petri dish was left for 24 h in room temperature it was dried and tested for the adsorption of dyes acid orange 7 and brilliant yellow from aqueous solution 7 1 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite zheng et al 102 found that according to sem analysis oxidized cellulose has rough morphology as compared to the pristine microcrystalline cellulose the change in surface was further confirmed by ftir as the spectrum of composite film shows peaks at 1729 cm 1 and 790 cm 1 attributed to the carbonyl co and the bending vibration of ch of the aldehyde groups respectively reaction between the oxidized hydroxyl groups of cellulose and amine of chitosan reported to occur through schiff s base and this was confirmed by a peak at 1648 cm 1 attributing to the cn stretching vibrations furthermore the addition of oxidized cellulose enriches the tensile strength of chitosan film from 34 8 mpa to 56 3 mpa after adding just 2 wt of dialdehyde microfibrillated cellulose damfc simsek et al 104 also found that the addition of cf enhances the tensile structure of the composite they observed rough surface on the morphology of synthesized composite which was attributed to the addition of cf hu et al 103 reported that the ftir spectrum of modified cellulose nanocrystals chitosan beads shows the band at 1551 cm 1 corresponding to cn stretching vibration demonstrating that the interaction between biopolymers was through the schiff base reaction gopi et al 105 reported that according to sem analysis modified film exhibits micro pore which was attributed to the solvent separation during drying process or phase separation moreover the addition of chitosan was significant as it enhances the hydrophilicity and adsorption removal efficiency of the dye from aqueous solution 7 1 2 blending and freeze drying techniques liu et al 106 used the blending and freeze drying methods to prepare the crosslinked composite comprised of nanofibrillated cellulose nfc and chitosan cs for adsorption of cationic dye and anionic dyes from aqueous solutions chitosan solution was prepared in acetic acid and mixed with nfc using the magnetic stir then nfc cs composite was crosslinked with epichlorohydrin and ethylenediamine was added into the solution mixture material denoted e nfc cs kim et al 15 prepared a biocomposite foam comprised of cellulose and chitosan for the adsorption of congo red dye from aqueous solution cellulose and chitosan were dissolved in lithium bromide libr aqueous solution at 150 c then the gel was treated with methanol to regenerate the chitosan after that the solution of dialdehyde cellulose was added into the mixture of cellulose and chitosan to form the crosslinked composite followed by subsequent reduction using sodium borohydride nabh4 the mixture was crosslinked for about 24 h at 25 c prior to washing with deionized water and ethanol to remove residuals freeze dried composite was denoted cclbd in another work zhu et al 107 produced different types of xerogel consisting of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose nacmc and chitosan cs for the adsorption of indigo blue ib dye from aqueous solution nacmc was dissolved in 0 1 m phosphate buffer saline pbs of ph 7 0 certain grams of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide and n hydroxysuccinimide added into the solution to activate the carbonyl groups subsequently different concentrations of chitosan solution were added into the mixture and stirred for about 4 h at room temperature to form the xerogel the mixture was freeze dried 45 c for 24 h and the reaction between cs and nacmc occur through the amidation process material denoted as cmc cs a separately chitosan solution was also added into the suspension of nacmc and stirred under similar parameters however there was no activation of carbonyl and the reaction between cs and nacmc occur through the electrostatic attraction material was denoted cmc cs e 7 1 2 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite liu et al 106 reported that the modified biocomposite had superior mechanical strength when compared to pristine cellulose thermal stability of pristine cellulose nfc cs and e nfc cs composites were 274 c 338 c and 311 c respectively this indicated that the addition of nfc significantly enhanced the mechanical strength of the composite ftir spectrum of nfc cs composite shows the increase of intensity at a wavelength of 1632 cm 1 and 1380 cm 1 which were attributed to the amine grafted on the surface of cellulose in addition the band at 1065 cm 1 was ascribed to the combined effects of cn stretching vibration of primary amines and the co stretching of a primary alcohol in chitosan kim et al 15 found that according to sem analysis cclbd composite exhibits the porous structure with long nanofibrils interconnected with pores ranging from 200 to 400 nm zhu et al 107 found that the composite cmc cs e shows loose surface with nanopores whereas the composite cmc cs a exhibits the surface with highly interconnected porous network structure which was favorable for the adsorption indigo blue ib dye from aqueous solution 7 2 hemicellulose chitosan biocomposite 7 2 1 blending and freeze drying techniques the dialdehyde hemicellulose extracted from wheat straw was synthesized with chitosan and iron oxide to produce a magnetic aerogel which was used for the adsorption of congo red dye from aqueous solution 56 dialdehyde hemicellulose 3 3 g was prepared added into a flask containing chitosan solution 3 and the mixture was vigorously stirred at 40 c for 30 min to obtain a homogenous solution to form the aerogel the prepared solution mixture was freeze dried material denoted aerogel0 magnetic nanoparticles were added in different concentrations 0 025 g 0 05 g 0 1 g and material denoted aerogel0 025 aerogel0 05 and aerogel0 1 depending on the added amount of iron oxide 7 2 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite guan et al 56 found that the synthesized dialdehyde hemicellulose chitosan fe3o4 composite shows distinct properties when compared with the dialdehyde hemicellulose and chitosan according to the ftir analysis dialdehyde hemicellulose shows a peak at 1726 cm 1 that was corresponding to the carbonyl vibration co of aldehyde functional groups synthesized composite shows the disappearance of the aldehyde groups which was due to the reaction of hemicellulose with chitosan the spectrum of fe3o4 exhibits the peak at 577 cm 1 that was related to the feo stretching vibration therefore this confirms the incorporation of the magnetic particles the addition of fe3o4 was reported to enhance the thermal stability of the synthesized aerogels moreover sem analysis shows that the morphology of synthesized aerogel contains finer porous and regular structure which was reported to enhance the adsorption of dye from aqueous solution 7 3 lignin chitosan biocomposite 7 3 1 blending and freeze drying techniques masilompane et al 77 employed the blending method to synthesize nanocomposite comprised of lignin chitosan and titanium dioxide for the adsorption of brilliant black dye from an aqueous solution dried lignin and chitosan was dissolved separately in beakers containing acetic acid 2 to form the homogenous mixture then lignin solution was slowly added into the chitosan solution and blended at 3000 rpm for 3 h titanium dioxide was added and the solution continued to stir overnight prior to drying at 40 c in another work sohni et al 55 employed the blending and freeze drying method to synthesize the composite comprised of nano lignin particles and chitosan for the adsorption of methylene blue mb from wastewater chitosan 2 g was dissolved in 100 ml of acetic acid 2 v v mixed with nano lignin 0 2 g and the suspension was exposed under ultrasonic to disperse for 30 min after that the suspension was stirred for 6 h before been placed under the freeze dryer lyophilized composite was washed with the distilled water to remove the residuals 7 3 1 1 physicochemical properties of biocomposite masilompane et al 77 compared the physicochemical properties of the prepared lignin chitosan tio2 nanocomposite with lignin and chitosan biopolymers ftir analysis shows that the interaction between lignin and chitosan was through the aromatic ring and secondary amine of chitosan this was confirmed by the shifting of cc bonds to a lower wavelength number furthermore the interaction was also due to the hydrogen bonding which could have occurred between the hydroxyl of lignin and β1 4glycosidic linkages of chitosan peaks at 2923 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 were correlated to the stretching of the ch bond found in the aromatic methoxy and alkyl groups of lignin biopolymer in addition the peaks at 839 cm 1 and 660 cm 1 were related to the tio and tioti bonds respectively according to the sem analysis lignin was observed as flakes whereas the chitosan biopolymer agglomerated within the surface and titanium nanoparticles were well distributed on the surface of the composite therefore this confirms that the nanocomposite was successfully synthesized sohni et al 55 found that according to the ftir analysis there was no stronger interaction between the nano lignin and chitosan in the synthesized composite however few low energy dipole dipole interactions were detected occurring between the carbonyl of chitosan and hydroxyl from lignin in addition to that the shifting and reduction of peaks intensity were detected chitosan biopolymer shows peaks at 1652 cm 1 and 1637 9 cm 1 which were correlated to the bending of nh in amine groups and nh stretching of amine respectively however after the reaction with nano lignin the peak at 1652 cm 1 disappeared and the peak 1637 9 cm 1 shifted to broader peak at 1638 7 cm 1 furthermore the peaks at 1561 cm 1 and 1544 cm 1 correlated to the primary amine of chitosan disappeared which was due to the interaction with the aromatic ring of nano lignin the intensity of the peak at 1030 39 cm 1 associated with the hydroxyl oh in chitosan was reduced in the synthesized biocomposite addition of lignin was reported to increase the stability of the composite according to the sem analysis the morphology of the synthesized chitosan nano lignin showed a rough and porous structure which was due to the addition of lignin the surface area of the composite was lower than that of chitosan and the reduction was correlated to the addition of lignin which was reported to might have blocked the chitosan porosities 7 4 adsorption of organic contaminants from aqueous solution using the synthesized lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites organic pollutants generated from various anthropogenic sources such as chemical industries have the potential to reduce the quality of surface water therefore it is important to develop cost effective technologies especially for developing countries natural sources such as lignocellulose biomass have been explored as adsorbent for the removal of these organic contaminants table 4 listed different types of adsorbents used for the adsorption of various organic contaminants from aqueous solutions as also reported in the adsorption of inorganic contaminants lignocellulosic derivatives adsorbent are less effective in removing organic contaminants from aqueous solution however after introducing chitosan the adsorption capacity significantly increased which was associated to the availability of more activate sites see table 4 7 4 1 dyes dyes are important substances in industries such as textiles rubber paper plastic and cosmetics 109 however the wastewater from these industries contains synthetic dyes that are known to be carcinogenic due to their aromatic structure 102 synthetic dyes cause chronic diseases and their presence in water prevents the penetration of light which potential affects the aquatic organisms 107 therefore conventional technologies such as adsorption precipitation electrodialysis filtration coagulation oxidation and membrane separation have been developed for the removal of synthetic dyes in wastewater however excluding adsorption method these methods are not cost effective 110 for this reason researchers have embarked on investigating composite comprised of natural polysaccharides such as chitosan and lignocellulosic derivatives as potential biosorbents for the removal of dyes in aqueous solutions 15 7 4 2 adsorption mechanism of dyes on synthesized biocomposites 7 4 2 1 cellulose chitosan biocomposite the amino groups of chitosan interact with dyes especially anionic dyes for example zheng et al 102 found that the adsorption of congo red dye on modified biocomposite occurs through attraction between the protonated amine of chitosan and negative ions of sulfonate groups fig 7 in addition they also found that the attraction was among the hydroxyl groups and functional groups of congo red dye they reported that adsorption of congo red on modified damfc chitosan composite was slightly affected by ph as there was no significant difference between ph values of 3 and 8 therefore this shows that this material has the potential to be applied in wastewater treatment plant modified composite was quick to remove with the equilibrium reached just after 10 min adsorption capacity was increasing with the initial concentration highest adsorption capacity of 152 5 mg g recorded when initial concentration was 300 mg l moreover according to the kinetic models and isotherm modes experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order and langmuir isotherm demonstrating the adsorption was through chemisorption and monolayer coverage respectively liu et al 106 tested the crosslinked biocomposite comprised of nanofibrillated cellulose nfc and chitosan cs as adsorbent to remove cationic dye methylene blue mb and anionic new coccine nc dye from aqueous solution high removal of mb and nc was recorded at ph 4 and ph 2 respectively they found that the removal of nc was attributed to the ionic attractions between the anions dyes and protonated amine of chitosan at equilibrium the maximum adsorption capacity of 0 061 mmol g and 0 16 mmol g was reached after 30 and 50 min for mb and nc respectively moreover the adsorbent was reported to be economical as the regeneration study shows high removal 98 even after 3 cycles the xerogel comprised of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and chitosan prepared by zhu et al 107 was also quick to remove indigo blue ib dye from aqueous solution according to their experimental results the addition of chitosan increased the adsorption of ib from aqueous solution and the adsorption capacity of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and synthesized biocomposite was 3 mg g and 27 mg g respectively they recorded a removal of about 88 2 adsorption capacity of 23 8 mg g after 20 min and the equilibrium was reached after 1 h as there was no significant changes observed after that time furthermore the experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order model and langmuir isotherm model demonstrating the chemisorption adsorption and the monolayer coverage of dye on the surface of modified composite respectively kim et al 15 investigated the adsorption of congo red dye using the modified cellulose chitosan biocomposite foam they reported that the addition of chitosan has significantly enhanced the removal of congo red on synthesized biocomposite and the adsorption capacity of cellulose chitosan composite 520 9 mg g was 1 7 times higher than the raw cellulose 300 mg g furthermore the adsorption was ph dependent as the removal decreases when the ph increases with the highest adsorption 952 mg g recorded at ph 5 reduction of adsorption removal at higher ph was attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the positive of amino groups nh3 and negative charge of the congo red dye dosage was also critical as the removal increases as the dosage increases experimental data best fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model and sips isotherm model demonstrating the adsorption was chemisorption and the surface of modified composite was heterogeneous respectively according to the desorption study the adsorbent was recyclable and it maintained almost similar adsorption capacity even after 15 cycles 7 4 2 2 hemicellulose chitosan biocomposite guan et al 56 found that the addition of ferric oxide particles on synthesized dialdehyde hemicellulose chitosan aerogels significantly enhanced the removal of congo red dye from aqueous solution they reported that when the amounts of fe3o4 were 0 g 0 025 g 0 05 g and 0 1 g the adsorption capacity of congo red dye was 103 64 mg g 111 47 mg g 137 74 mg g and 114 92 mg g respectively nevertheless free amino groups of chitosan were also reported to provide an adsorption site for the dye in addition the presence of magnetic particles induces the recovery of saturated aerogels after adsorption 7 4 2 3 lignin chitosan biocomposite masilompane et al 77 found that the adsorption of brilliant black dye bb on synthesized lignin chitosan tio2 nanocomposite was ph dependent with the highest removal recorded at ph 9 and the highest percentage removal of 83 recorded at optimum ph 5 8 high removal under acidic conditions was due to the protonation of chitosan amine functional groups within the synthesized nanocomposite in addition as the ph increases towards the alkaline region amine get deprotonated which causes the adsorption reduction of bb dye furthermore the point of zero charge was 9 22 which complemented the recorded ph results moreover the nanocomposite was quick to remove the bb dye as the equilibrium was reached just within 30 min experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order and freundlich adsorption isotherm demonstrating the mechanisms of adsorption was chemically and dominated by the multilayer according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model the maximum adsorption capacity of bb was 15 8 mg g at 25 c the adsorption of cationic dye on synthesized chitosan nano lignin was reported to occur within a wide range of ph 55 which was attributed to the strong adsorption and complexation interaction through hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction ion exchange and van der waals forces however at lower ph 3 removal was low which was due to the repulsion between the positive ion of cationic dye and ion of protonated composite moreover the synthesized composite effectively removes mb dye in lower concentration which was due to the large available site furthermore adsorption removal of mb dye increases with the increasing of temperature demonstrating that the process was through an endothermic process according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model the highest adsorption capacity recorded was 74 07 mg g they reported that the experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second adsorption model demonstrating that the adsorption was through the chemical attraction between the cationic dye and composite site moreover the experimental data was also best fitted to the langmuir adsorption isotherm indicating the adsorption of dye on the surface of composite occurs as a monolayer furthermore the composite was recyclable and used for up to 4 cycles which shows that the material was economical 7 4 3 pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps such as diclofenac sodium ds are emerging organic contaminants that are found in surface water as well as drinking water 111 they often available in traces however even at low concentration can be harmful for example ds affect the gastrointestinal in humans which leads to acute renal insufficient 103 therefore it is essential to remove these contaminants to improve the quality of water and protect the health of human beings 112 7 4 4 adsorption mechanism of ppcps on synthesized biocomposites 7 4 4 1 cellulose chitosan biocomposite hu et al 103 prepared the cellulose nanocrystals chitosan biocomposite for the removal of ds in aqueous solution they reported that the addition of chitosan significantly enhances the adsorption capacity of the synthesized composite as compared to the pristine cellulose nanocrystals adsorption capacity increases with the increasing of initial ds concentration adsorption capacity of 348 24 mg g recorded when the initial concentration was 1000 mg l however the higher the concentration of ds the longer adsorption time needed to reach equilibrium furthermore the adsorption of ds on modified composite was ph dependent and the optimum value recorded at ph 4 5 at lower ph amino groups get protonated and were more likely to react with the negative charge ions of ds hence high removal recorded under acidic conditions mechanisms of adsorption were through the acid base interaction and hydrogen bonding fig 8 in addition experimental data best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model implying that the removal of ds was chemically driven 7 4 5 aromatic hydrocarbons pollutants the pollution caused by aromatic hydrocarbons has increased since the industrial revolution these pollutants are harmful to human beings as they are carcinogenic and mutagenic 113 traditional techniques such as adsorption by activated carbon oxidation by ozone and chlorine dioxide reverse osmosis solvent extraction and ion exchange are used for removal of aromatic carbons in wastewater 114 however among these techniques adsorption especially using biocomposite regarded as the best method due to its simplicity and economical 7 4 6 adsorption mechanism of aromatic hydrocarbons on synthesized biocomposites 7 4 6 1 cellulose chitosan biocomposite simsek et al 104 investigated the biocomposite consisting of carbon fibers cf chitosan cs and polyvinyl alcohol pva as the potential biosorbent for removal of bisphenol a bpa from aqueous solution removal of bpa on modified composite increases with the increasing of cf concentration however the removal was ph dependent and high removal recorded at the acidic region furthermore the experimental data fitted to the pseudo second data model demonstrating the adsorption was through chemisorption according to the adsorption isotherms freundlich and dubinin radushkevich models best fitted the experimental data indicating that the surface of modified composite was heterogeneous the adsorption thermodynamics show the negative value of g and positive value of h demonstrating the adsorption of bpa was spontaneous and endothermic in nature respectively 8 conclusion and recommendations lignocellulosic and chitosan biopolymers are not only the most abundant biomass on planet earth but are also eco friendly sustainable and biodegradable by microorganisms this review reported different types of biocomposites developed from these biopolymers and their potential on the adsorption of inorganic and organic contaminants in aqueous solutions it was demonstrated that lignocellulosic derivatives such as cellulose particles hemicellulose lignin and biochar were frequently employed during the formation of the lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites different techniques such as blending solvent casting and freeze drying methods were often employed during the formation of biocomposite these methods are facile and they significantly enhanced the physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites as compared to the raw lignocellulose derivatives and pristine chitosan furthermore the modified biocomposites show a potential to remove organic and inorganic contaminants from aqueous solutions heavy metals were the most investigated inorganic contaminants and although some few studies reported the removal of anions e g phosphate we found that less studies were directed towards the removal of this type of contaminants for these reasons it is recommended to have more studies also targeting various types of anions as they contribute to the lack of quality water moreover in most cases the reported lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites were quick to remove the contaminants in aqueous solution however the removal was ph dependent in addition the adsorption of contaminants on modified biocomposites was driven by the electrostatic forces and the synthesized biocomposites material was recyclable which is economical therefore this shows the synthesized biocomposites have the potential to replace or supplement the current contaminants removal technologies nevertheless some of the lignocellulosic derivatives e g cellulose hemicellulose and lignin used during the formation of the composite were purchased commercially for economic reasons it is substantial to investigate the use of derivatives extracted from local lignocellulosic biomass as this will reduce the cost of production although chitosan biopolymer is more expensive as compared to the lignocellulosic derivatives however it significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the synthesized lignocellulosic chitosan biocomposites additionally compared to other modifying chemical agent chitosan is less toxic and biodegradable as produced from natural sources chitosan is produced in different types for example viscosity molecular weight and the degree of deacetylation differs therefore it is recommended for future studies to investigate the effect of using different types of chitosan during the formation of biocomposites furthermore the total cost of all the materials and equipment used during the synthesis process must be calculated as this could help to have more insight into the feasibility of the proposed method moreover the adsorption studies were often tested on synthetic water therefore further investigations in real water samples are recommended additionally pilot studies are recommended as this will be a step closer to the commercialization of these synthesized materials lignocellulosic derivative chitosan biocomposites could be an alternative to the hard biodegradable polymers however further research is imperative to address all these
