3360,phosphorus p is an essential nutrient in aquatic ecosystems and its dynamics in river systems are greatly affected by human activities based on the in situ measurements of water discharge q suspended sediment concentrations ssc and concentrations c of total p tp particulate p pp and total dissolved p tdp from 1997 to 2017 p transport in the three gorges reservoir tgr and the combined effects of cascade reservoirs operation and anthropogenic emissions have been explored the whole period was divided into three sequential periods of january 1997 to may 2003 period 1 june 2003 to september 2012 period 2 and october 2012 to december 2017 period 3 corresponding to the period prior to impoundment of the tgr during the operation of the tgr and after the impoundment of upstream cascade reservoirs respectively results showed that the p concentrations were positively skewed and generally followed the three parameter gamma and log normal distributions there was significant difference for ssc tp pp and tdp between adjacent periods but not for q the ssc tp and pp presented downward trends during the periods affected by the impoundment of cascade reservoirs while the tdp increased in period 2 especially after 2007 and decreased in period 3 due to the upstream reservoirs regulation and the pollution management in the tributaries for the monthly variation the ssc tp and pp became more evenly distributed throughout the year after the impoundment of cascade reservoirs while the tdp tended to show a pattern of higher in dry season and lower in flood season the c q relationships indicated that the tp in the tgr was positively correlated with q transport limited while negatively with q for tdp source limited generally the tp pp and tdp were positively correlated with both ssc and anthropogenic p emissions thus the p concentrations declined with sediment retention in the reservoir but increased with time due to the increasing pollutant emissions correspondingly the p dynamics were better depicted after considering the effects of sediment and pollutant emissions than using a simple c q relationship keywords three gorges reservoir phosphorus transport sediment transport river damming anthropogenic emission 1 introduction as an elementary biogenic material in ecosystems phosphorus p is of great importance for supporting life activities elser and bennett 2011 penuelas et al 2020 vitousek et al 2009 p transport in rivers constitutes a major part of the global p cycle meybeck 1982 and has been intensively disturbed by human activities such as river damming and p enrichment by anthropogenic emissions maavara et al 2015 reservoir operation increases the hydraulic residence time and thus impedes the p transport to downstream rivers lakes or estuaries it is estimated that approximately 44 of p in rivers has been retained in reservoirs globally maavara et al 2020 meanwhile anthropogenic p emissions including point and nonpoint sources have greatly raised the p load to watersheds carpenter et al 1998 withers and jarvie 2008 and may even exceed the reservoir retention capacities and exacerbate the eutrophication of global aquatic ecosystems conley et al 2009 lewis et al 2011 maavara et al 2015 nixon 2003 like most rivers in the world p in the yangtze river of china is mainly in the particulate form and is a key limiting nutrient in the local ecosystems elser et al 2007 huang et al 2020 li et al 2019 nie et al 2021 shen and liu 2009 the upstream cascade reservoirs will trap p together with sediment causing p accumulation in the reservoirs which become potential internal pollution sources and altering the nutrient structure of downstream rivers which may trigger a number of ecological and environmental issues dai et al 2011 nilsson 2005 zhou et al 2015 meanwhile the anthropogenic p emissions increase gradually with urbanization and agricultural intensification in the yangtze river basin dai et al 2011 hu et al 2020 powers et al 2016 therefore clarifying the effects of human activities on the relationships among water sediment and p in rivers and on the biogeochemical cycle of p is urgent in order to better understand and alleviate the increasingly severe ecological and environmental problems along the yangtze river he et al 2019 stream flow directly drives the p transport in rivers the relationship between p concentrations c and water discharge q which connects the hydrological processes with the biogeochemical processes has been widely used at catchment and sub catchment scales bieroza et al 2018 godsey et al 2009 moatar et al 2017 the c q curve indicates the inherent properties of p e g solubility reactivity and the watershed characteristics e g soil vegetation topography population agriculture intensity and the variation in the shape of c q curve may reflect the shift of these characteristics ali et al 2017 boix canadell et al 2019 moatar et al 2017 rose et al 2018 the power law relationship of c aqb which can be rewritten as logc loga blogq i e a double logarithmic linear form is a useful tool providing insight into the c q patterns godsey et al 2009 however the existing studies moatar et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 indicate that the linear form is usually difficult to meet and the measured data are too dispersed to fit well as other factors besides q also affect p transport accordingly a number of studies have been conducted to improve the understanding of the c q relationships e g piecewise fitting with consideration of the magnitude of water discharge meybeck and moatar 2012 moatar et al 2017 incorporating the hysteresis response of c to q minaudo et al 2017 distinguishing the impacts of point and nonpoint sources and taking into account the different responses of c to q during storm events and seasonal variations minaudo et al 2019 and applying weighted regression with incorporation of the long term trend and seasonal fluctuation of c hirsch et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 sediment has a strong affinity for p in river systems fang et al 2013 meybeck 1982 müller et al 2006 from the perspective of p source a considerable proportion of p is adsorbed on the surface of sediment particles and enters the water body together with sediment huang et al 2015b then p transports in both dissolved and particulate phases and these two phases transform through adsorption and desorption cui et al 2017 fang et al 2017 li et al 2021 meanwhile p in the water layer exchanges with that in the river bed via sediment deposition and resuspension huang et al 2015a therefore it is crucial to further explore the effects of sediment in order to shed light on p transport in rivers for example zhou et al 2013 developed statistical relationships among c q and suspended sediment concentration ssc and discussed the effect of dams on p transport in the yangtze river huang et al 2015b proposed a coupled model of flow sediment and p transport to quantify the effects of reservoir operation on sediment transport and p retention the three gorges reservoir tgr located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river is the largest hydraulic project in the world ren et al 2020 yang et al 2006 the study of p transport in the tgr is crucial for understanding the p dynamics in big rivers affected by human activities considerable amount of works have been conducted in the tgr primarily focusing on the impacts of reservoirs operation on the spatial temporal characteristics of p concentrations huang et al 2017 tang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 xiang et al 2021 p species ding et al 2019 han et al 2018 ran et al 2016 p retention huang et al 2015b ran et al 2016 tang et al 2020 and p bioavailability and eutrophication tang et al 2018a wang et al 2020 however i most of these studies are based on short term cruise data of short term probably with significant data uncertainties due to the highly dynamics of p concentrations ii the impacts of tgr regulation on p transport are mainly considered while the effects of upstream cascade reservoirs are often ignored and unknown iii the dynamics of dissolved p have received relatively less attention as compared with the total p and particulate p iv the relationships between p dynamics and the flow and sediment transport are still unclear and v studies on pollutant emissions in the tgr are limited to the tributaries and upstream segment while how anthropogenic emissions affect the p transport in the whole reservoir is also unclear to address the problems mentioned above here consecutively measured data of the q ssc and p concentrations in the tgr over the past two decades were collected the whole period was divided into three sequential periods based on the critical time nodes of reservoirs operation to distinguish the effects of tgr and upstream cascade reservoirs on p transport in the tgr the temporal characteristics of p concentrations were explored by successively analyzing the p dynamics in the scales of periods years and months and the spatial characteristics were revealed through classification and comparison among monitoring stations a framework between p concentrations and the key factors e g q ssc and anthropogenic emissions was developed based on which the multi linear regression was explored to further assess the combined impacts of reservoirs regulation and anthropogenic emissions on p transport in the tgr 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data description the river shaped tgr has a surface area of 1084 km2 and a water storage capacity of 393 108 m3 it extends a total length of 670 km and controls the runoff of nearly half of the yangtze river basin ren et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate the annual precipitation 900 mm in the tgr is concentrated in the wet summer and thus a year is divided into the flood season june october and dry season november next may chen et al 2014 guo et al 2018 daily data of q ssc and monthly measurements of total p tp and total dissolved p tdp concentrations from 1997 to 2017 at 9 monitoring stations namely zhutuo zt tongguanyi tgy cuntan ct qingxichang qxc wanxian wx guandukou gdk and nanjinguan njg in the mainstream and beibei bb and wulong wl in the tributaries fig 1 were acquired from the ecological and environmental monitoring system of the three gorges project and the changjiang hydrological bureau here tp and tdp refer to the p concentrations in the unfiltered samples and the samples filtered by the 0 45 μm membrane respectively all these samples were digested with potassium persulfate and p concentrations were determined using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method environment protection administration of china epa china 1989 the concentration of particulate p pp is defined as the difference between tp and tdp i e pp tp tdp the corresponding monthly data of q and ssc which are matched with the monitoring date of p concentrations were used in the subsequent analyses the tgr initialized impoundment in june 2003 the water level was then elevated progressively and reached the normal pool level of 175 m for the first time in october 2010 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2014 the xjb and xld reservoirs fig 1 constructed along the lower jinsha river where most of the sediment in the tgr comes from li et al 2018 began impounding in october 2012 and may 2013 respectively yang et al 2014 the tgr regulation caused a large scale sediment trapping behind the tgd altered the downstream flow regime and profoundly decreased the sediment delivered to the east china sea dai et al 2016 wang et al 2013 after the completion of the upstream cascade reservoirs e g xjb and xld the sediment load transported into the tgr decreased sharply and the yangtze river was dammed more heavily ren et al 2020 yan et al 2021 guo et al 2019 accordingly p dynamics in the tgr is supposed to change with the alteration of the flow and sediment to clarify the effects of cascade reservoirs on p transport in the tgr the whole period of 1997 2017 was divided into three sequential periods according to the critical time nodes of cascade reservoirs operation i e january 1997 to may 2003 as period 1 june 2003 to september 2012 as period 2 and october 2012 to december 2017 as period 3 corresponding to the period prior to impoundment of the tgr during the operation of the tgr and after the impoundment of upstream cascade reservoirs respectively 2 2 statistical methods 2 2 1 analysis of spatial temporal characteristics the gamma distribution and log normal distribution were used for the frequency analysis of p concentrations the three parameter gamma distribution also frequently called the pearson type iii distribution by hydrologists is found to be useful for describing skewed hydrologic variables associated with random processes in time such as meteorological precipitation and annual maximum flood peaks chow et al 1988 and the corresponding probability density function takes the form of eq 1 where α β and γ are the shape scale and location parameters respectively johnson et al 1994 meanwhile the probability density function of the three parameter log normal distribution takes the form of eq 2 where ζ σ and θ are the mean standard deviation and threshold of the variables on the log scale respectively johnson et al 1994 the l moment method was used to estimate the parameters hosking 2019 hosking and wallis 1997 and the two sided kolmogorov goodness of fit test was subsequently performed to determine if the measured p concentration samples agree with the estimated distribution at a certain level of significance conover 1999 r core team 2020 1 p x x β α γ α 1 x γ α 1 e x p x γ β α 0 β 0 x γ 2 p x x x θ 2 π σ 1 exp log x θ ζ 2 2 σ 2 x θ the two sided mann whitney test a nonparametric analysis of variance anova in two sample situation was performed on the monthly data to assess the difference for q ssc tp tdp and pp between adjacent periods conover 1999 r core team 2020 moreover the nonparametric mann kendall test was used on the monthly data to detect the temporal trend of variables in these periods gilbert 1987 pohlert 2020 2 2 2 log linear regression analysis the relationships among q ssc p concentrations and other factors are presented in fig 2 here the factors affecting p concentrations were divided into two categories i e factors correlated with q or ssc f trend and f season denote the corresponding trend and seasonality components respectively and more attention will be paid to f trend as the change is what we concern and factors not correlated with q or ssc denoted as r it is assumed that the temporal trend for natural processes which correlate with q or ssc and exert effects on p concentrations is negligible in a short period as studied in this paper compared with the geological time scale despite that factors like climate change do have impacts on the p transport michalak 2016 sinha et al 2017 therefore f trend mainly refers to the trend of anthropogenic factors as previously described there are two major human interference on p transport in fluvial systems i e dam construction and p enrichment by anthropogenic emissions maavara et al 2015 the impacts of river damming on p transport are largely mediated by modifying q and ssc thus f trend mainly represents the trend for anthropogenic p emission from sources like agricultural practices urban activities and p rock mining carpenter et al 1998 chen and graedel 2016 penuelas et al 2020 overall fig 2 comprehensively considers the effects of human activities such as river damming and pollutant emission on p transport the log linear regression of the key parameters i e power law representation was used to explore the relationships between c and q for each monitoring station as shown in eq 3 where u is the error term taking into account the potential nonlinearity each sample was split into two parts at the median value of q for piecewise fitting meybeck and moatar 2012 moatar et al 2017 the slope β 1 is a useful indicator for p transport pattern in watersheds according to moatar et al 2017 the cases of β 1 0 β 1 0 and β 1 0 are regarded as transport limited chemostatic and source limited respectively 3 log c β 0 β 1 log q u according to fig 2 we successively added the variables ssc and f trend to the regression eqs 4 and 5 to further explore their effects on p transport 4 log c β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c u 5 log c β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c β 3 f t r e n d u moreover time was used as a proxy variable for f trend since they are directly correlated but f trend is unobservable wooldridge 2016 the relationship between time and f trend is assumed to be linear eq 6 then eq 7 was obtained by substituting eq 6 into eq 5 which can be further rewritten as eq 8 6 f t r e n d δ 0 δ 1 time v 7 log c β 0 β 3 δ 0 β 1 log q β 2 logssc β 3 δ 1 time β 3 v u 8 log c β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c β 3 time u in light of multiple linear regression theory the coefficients β i quantify the association between the corresponding independent variables and the dependent variable stock and watson 2019 wooldridge 2016 for example β 2 in eq 8 can be interpreted as that c increases by β 2 with ssc increasing by 1 holding q and time constant therefore a larger absolute value of β 2 suggests that c is more sensitive to the change of ssc it is worth noting that β 3 in eq 5 is positive according to the definition of f trend indicating that β 3 i e β 3 δ 1 in eq 8 has the same sign with δ 1 in eq 6 therefore a positive or negative β 3 suggests the upward or downward trend of anthropogenic p emission moreover we defined r ps as the p adsorption amount per unit mass of sediment eq 9 and r dp as the ratio of the concentrations of tdp and pp eq 10 r ps indicates the residual buffering capacity of sediment to p in water bodies i e a greater r ps corresponds to a smaller residual buffering capacity fang et al 2017 huang et al 2015b pan and liss 1998 while r dp provides insight into the partition of p between the particulate and dissolved phases similarly multi linear regression relationships for r ps and r dp were also developed considering the effects of q ssc and time eqs 11 and 12 respectively 9 r p s pp ssc 10 r d p tdp pp 11 log r p s β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c β 3 time u 12 log r d p β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c β 3 time u in this study each sample size for regression is about 200 fig 4 which meets the requirement of large sample normality the coefficients in the regression equations indicate the correlation rather than causality because the omitted variable bias is difficult to eliminate as time series data are used for regression the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity exist thus the heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent robust standard errors were used to adjust the confidence interval of the coefficients so that the statistical inference is still valid stock and watson 2019 wooldridge 2016 the variance inflation factor was calculated and found to be less than 10 for each regression indicating that the multicollinearity is negligible james et al 2013 all statistical analyses in this study were conducted in r r core team 2020 the results of eqs 3 4 8 11 and 12 will be discussed in the following sections 3 results and discussion the monthly variations of ssc and tp at ct in the tail of the tgr and njg the outflow station of the tgr stations are presented in fig 3 and the variations of q and tdp refer to fig s1 in the supplementary materials both the ssc and tp exhibit higher values during the flood season and lower values during the dry season especially at ct station there are obvious declines of ssc and tp around 2003 at njg station fig 3b and d and around 2013 at ct station fig 3a and c largely due to the impoundment of the tgr and the xjb and xld reservoirs respectively which indicates that the division of these three sequent periods is reasonable and necessary for further analysis 3 1 descriptive statistics the statistics for q ssc tp and tdp at these nine monitoring stations are presented in fig 4 it shows that the values of q and ssc for the monitoring stations on the main stream are obviously larger than those on the tributaries fig 4a and b meanwhile the q generally increases along the main stream from zt to njg due to the inflow from the tributaries like wu and jialing rivers fig 4a while the ssc generally diminishes as a combined results of the sediment settlement in the tgr ren et al 2020 and the dilution of the tributaries fig 4b the average value of tp is 0 20 mg l 1 for the main stream stations and 0 16 mg l 1 for the tributary stations while the corresponding average values of tdp are 0 07 and 0 11 mg l 1 for the main stream and tributaries stations respectively the tp value at bb station is significantly lower than that at other monitoring stations p 0 001 fig 4c and the tdp value at wl station varies greatly fig 4d largely due to the pollution caused by p rock mining in the wu river which will be discussed in detail later han et al 2016 in addition q ssc tp and tdp are positively skewed at all monitoring stations the calculated skewness of the variables is not shown here fig 5 a shows the comparisons of the estimated gamma distribution to the samples of tp at gdk station for the three periods compared with the tp in period 1 tp in periods 2 and 3 is lower at the same quantile which indicates a general decrease for tp from period 1 to periods 2 and 3 in addition tp in period 3 is higher at small quantile but lower at large quantile than that in period 2 which suggests less volatility in period 3 as compared to period 2 overall the frequency analysis provides a perspective of probability distribution to describe the temporal changes of tp at gdk station which is consistent with the results shown in fig 8 b and 9a however there is no simple law to summarize the change of probability distribution of p concentrations among periods for all stations as demonstrated by the complicated behaviors shown in figs 7 9 fig 5b and c display the results p values of the two sided kolmogorov goodness of fit test of gamma distribution and log normal distribution for tp tdp and pp respectively the result indicates that p concentrations at these monitoring stations generally follow the gamma and log normal distributions except for a few samples e g pp at wx station in periods 2 and 3 in addition the log normal distribution performs slightly better than the gamma distribution e g pp at qxc in period 3 follows the log normal distribution but not the gamma distribution 3 2 spatial temporal characteristics of p transport 3 2 1 analysis of variance the results of anova for tp at the main stream stations are provided in fig 6 and the corresponding results for q ssc pp and tdp refer to fig s2 there is no significant p greater than 0 05 difference for q between adjacent periods except for periods 1 and 2 at zt station fig s2a which indicates that q from the perspective of period is little affected by dam constructions and remains almost constant across the whole time scale dai et al 2011 although significant decrease in flood season and increase in dry season have been observed for q as a result of the reservoirs regulation wang et al 2013 yan et al 2021 in contrast ssc shows significant p 0 05 difference between adjacent periods except for periods 1 and 2 at ct station with generally a decreasing trend at each station fig s2b which is consistent with the previous studies dai et al 2011 guo et al 2018 ren et al 2020 similarly tp and pp show significant p 0 05 difference between adjacent periods except for periods 1 and 2 at wx station fig 6 and fig s2c and tdp also shows significant p 0 05 difference between adjacent periods except for periods 1 and 2 at ct station fig s2d overall there is significant difference for ssc tp pp and tdp between adjacent periods but not for q in the tgr it is worth noting that these comparisons are based on the average values of q ssc tp pp and tdp in each period more details such as the reasons for these differences will be further revealed by interpreting the interannual and monthly variations of these variables 3 2 2 analysis of interannual variation the variations of the annual average values of ssc tp tdp and pp are presented in fig 7 including the tdp values at xjb and gc stations fig 7i meanwhile the p values of the mann kendall test are provided in fig 8 showing the temporal trend of these variables in periods 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 and 1 3 according to figs 7 and 8 we classify the monitoring stations on the main stream into two categories i the upper monitoring stations ums including zt tgy ct qxc and wx 289 km from the three gorges dam stations and ii the lower monitoring stations lms including gdk 76 km from the three gorges dam and njg stations the tp at ums stations presents a downward trend in period 2 3 at the significance level of 0 05 fig 8b specifically the decrease happens in period 3 because no downward trend is observed in period 2 fig 8b fig 7a d as a combined result of the p retention effect of upstream cascade reservoirs liu et al 2019 and the management of pollution in tributaries han et al 2016 qin et al 2018 the tp at lms stations decreases in period 1 2 and increases in period 2 3 at the 0 05 significance level but no trend is shown in period 1 2 and 3 fig 8b indicating that tp at lms stations declines around 2003 and then rises slightly around 2013 fig 7e and f meanwhile fig 7a f show that there is a downward trend for tp from upstream to downstream along the yangtze river largely due to the p retention in the tgr wang et al 2021 overall the ssc and pp present downward trend p 0 05 during the periods affected by cascade reservoirs impoundment fig 8a and c and the closer the monitoring station is to the dams including the tgr xjb and xld reservoirs the more significant the corresponding decline is fig 7a f in addition the ssc and pp also generally diminish along the yangtze river han et al 2018 ren et al 2020 tang et al 2018b as pp represents the adsorbed p by sediment and generally constitute the main part of tp similar behavior exists for the ssc pp and tp tang et al 2018a zhou et al 2013 as shown in fig 7a d and fig 8d the tdp at ums stations increases in period 2 p 0 001 especially after 2007 and decreases in period 3 p 0 001 with the turning point around 2013 the former may be related to the p pollution e g p rock mining in tributaries such as min river fig 7i and wu river fig 7h which show a significant increase in the tdp concentration around 2007 2013 han et al 2016 qin et al 2018 these increases are gradually offset along the main stream due to the adsorption and deposition of sediment huang et al 2015a ren et al 2020 and consequently no obvious increase at gdk and njg stations the latter on the one hand is because that the upstream reservoirs retain p and reduce tdp at the outflow xjb station fig 7i on the other hand it is also due to the management and improvement of water quality in tributaries mitigating the p pollution fig 7h and i han et al 2016 qin et al 2018 meanwhile the ssc of all stations are relatively low in period 3 and the sediment deposition is less significant in the tgr fig 7a f therefore tdp shows a smaller magnitude of decrease along the main stream and consequently leads to a higher level of tdp in period 3 than that in period 2 at gdk and njg stations fig 7e and f the variations of tdp are not only affected by sediment transport huang et al 2015a but also directly influenced by point source emissions such as p rock mining which is usually in the dissolved form carpenter et al 1998 jarvie et al 2006 withers and jarvie 2008 thus showing more complicated behaviors for example fig 7h shows that tdp changes intensely with p emission while pp is little affected overall a simple and reasonable explanation for the spatial temporal characteristics of tdp in the tgr which are not well known han et al 2018 or discussed in detail in the previous studies tang et al 2019 2018a 2018b wu et al 2021 xiang et al 2021 has been developed here taking into account the operation of cascade reservoirs and anthropogenic emissions 3 2 3 analysis of monthly variation fig 9 shows the monthly variations for tp and tdp in these three periods and the monthly variations for ssc and pp refer to fig s3 the impoundment of reservoirs leads to the reduction of ssc at all monitoring stations especially in the flood season yan et al 2021 consequently ssc distributes more evenly throughout the year fig s3a in period 1 the tp is higher in flood season than in dry season for all monitoring stations thus the water quality is worse in flood season than that in dry season xiang et al 2021 and the tp at lms stations distributes more evenly throughout the year than at ums stations fig 9a the tp at lms stations decreases throughout the year after the impoundment of tgr i e period 2 versus period 1 and similarly the tp at ums stations decreases after the impoundment of xjb and xld reservoirs i e period 3 versus period 2 correspondingly the magnitude of tp variation throughout the year decreases with time fig 9a i e a more uniform distribution in a year meanwhile the pp shows a similar behavior as tp in general fig s3b as shown in fig 9b the tdp at lms stations declines after the impoundment of tgr which is similar to the change of tp due to the p retention in the reservoir in addition the tdp in period 3 is generally higher than in period 2 for all monitoring stations as a combined results of the increase in 2007 2013 and decrease in 2013 2017 fig 7a d compared with period 1 the tdp tends to show a pattern of higher in dry season and lower in flood season in periods 2 and 3 due to the smaller water discharge in dry season and thus less significant dilution effect on the input of p emissions jarvie et al 2006 3 3 log linear regression analysis 3 3 1 relationships of c versus q the relationships between c including the tp and tdp concentrations and q for each monitoring stations are plotted in fig 10 and the corresponding coefficients β 1 of the regression using eq 3 are shown in fig 11 here piecewise fitting is conducted at the median value of q taking into account the potential nonlinearity moatar et al 2017 at the low discharge condition both the tp and tdp concentrations increase slightly not significantly with the increasing q in most stations fig 11a however the c q relationships are obviously different for tp and tdp at the high discharge condition specifically the coefficients β 1 s u p are significantly p 0 05 negative for tdp except at ct station while are significantly p 0 001 positive for tp at all stations fig 11b indicating that the tdp concentrations decrease with the increasing q i e source limited while the tp concentrations increase with the increasing q i e transport limited which can also be observed in fig 10 moatar et al 2017 the former may be related to the dilution effect of water discharge while the latter may be the result of more sediment and pp washed into the river by runoff the obvious differences in the sign and significance level between β 1 i n f and β 1 s u p also suggest the nonlinearity in the c q relationships for both tp and tdp which is partly due to the neglect of other factors affecting c such as ssc and p emissions quinlan et al 2021 moreover the coefficient β 1 i n f s u p shows similar behavior as β 1 s u p fig 11c implying that the c q patterns are dominated by those at the high discharge condition it is also observed that β 1 i n f s u p for tp tends to be smaller at lms stations than that at ums stations i e tp at lms stations is less affected by the variation of q this is another interpretation for the results shown in fig 9a i e tp distributes more evenly throughout the year at lms stations than at ums stations in the same vein there is no obvious difference between β 1 i n f s u p for tdp at all stations corresponding to the similar monthly distributions among the stations fig 9b 3 3 2 relationships of c versus q and ssc table 1 provides the results of the regression for tp tdp and pp using eq 4 the corresponding adjusted r2 using eq 3 namely r3 is also listed in table 1 as mentioned before it is the trend not the seasonality that we are mainly concerned with considering the unidirectional causality between q and ssc fig 2 and that there is no significant trend for q fig s2a here we will focus on the characteristics of β 2 as shown in table 1 the β 2 value is significantly p 0 001 positive for pp indicating that there is a significantly positive correlation between pp and ssc meanwhile the corresponding r4 value is basically larger than 0 6 with an obvious increase compared with r3 reflecting that the fitting results can be greatly improved by incorporating ssc moreover the β 2 value shows a downward trend along the main stream i e the pp value at the ums stations is more sensitive with the change of ssc in contrast the tdp shows significantly p 0 01 negative correlation with ssc for each monitoring station except njg station and the corresponding r4 and r3 values are both much smaller than those for pp thus the tdp is less correlated with ssc than pp which is consistent with the intuition meanwhile the absolute value of β 2 also shows a downward trend along the main stream which can be interpreted in the same way as pp by definition tp is the sum of pp and tdp therefore the correlation between tp and ssc and the corresponding adjusted r2 are at the level between those for pp and tdp overall the r4 values for tp tdp and pp are generally larger than the corresponding r3 3 3 3 relationships of c versus q ssc and time the results of the regression for tp tdp and pp using eq 8 are listed in table s1 and here we focus on the characteristics of β 2 and β 3 i e the coefficients corresponding to the variables ssc and time respectively both tp and pp are positively correlated with ssc at the significance level of 0 05 for almost all monitoring stations and β 2 shows a downward trend along the main stream which is consistent with the results for eq 4 as presented in table 1 actually the soil erosion in the upstream is intense ren et al 2020 thus the input sediment may dominate the changes of tp and pp hence a larger β 2 due to the sediment deposition along the main stream and the relatively small erosion intensity downstream liu et al 2022 the effect of sediment on tp and pp gradually diminishes hence a smaller β 2 however there are differences for β 2 when comparing the regression results of eq 4 and eq 8 i e β 2 for tdp is basically positive but not significant at most stations in table s1 which is obviously contrary to the results in table 1 it indicates that after controlling the impacts of time i e the proxy variable for f trend fig 2 on p concentrations there is generally a positive but not significant correlation between tdp and ssc this is consistent with the previous findings that the tdp has been retained together with sediment deposition in the reservoirs therefore the results for the correlation between variables e g the correlation between tdp and ssc should be treated with caution since the omitted variable bias in statistics may lead to wrong conclusions if the key variables are not considered in the regression or correlation analysis stock and watson 2019 tang et al 2018a 2018b as shown in table s1 β 3 for tp tdp and pp are positive at almost all monitoring stations indicating that anthropogenic emission has been increasing in recent years and accordingly elevated the p concentrations in rivers which is consistent with the previous findings in fig 7 the effects of anthropogenic emission on p concentrations are considered in eq 8 using time as a proxy variable thus the adjusted r2 using eq 8 namely r8 is generally larger than r4 and r3 specifically the magnitude of increase in the adjusted r2 is remarkable for tdp especially at ums stations e g from 0 0435 and 0 1679 to 0 4859 at zt station but relatively mild for pp meanwhile β 3 for tdp is larger than pp at the same stations indicating that tdp changes more intensely with time or f trend than pp this is probably due to the fact that anthropogenic emission is usually in the dissolved form carpenter et al 1998 jarvie et al 2006 withers and jarvie 2008 and thus tdp is more directly affected by pollutant emissions in addition β 3 for tp tdp and pp shows a downward trend from upstream to downstream because the pollution mainly occurs at the upstream tributaries and thus p concentrations are more affected by p emission at upstream stations in general the fitting results can be greatly improved by incorporating the variables of ssc and time especially for the ums stations with a greater ability to elaborate the variations in p concentrations the comparisons between the observed and predicted tp using eqs 3 4 and 8 are presented in fig 12 and the results for pp and tdp refer to figs s4 and s5 it can also be found that the p dynamics are better depicted after considering the effects of sediment and anthropogenic emissions however to better predict the p concentrations nonlinear relationships and more complex mathematical models are still needed considering that p concentrations are highly dynamic huang et al 2015b zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 3 3 4 relationships of r ps and r dp versus q ssc and time the monthly variations of r ps and r dp at each monitoring station are presented in fig s6 which represent the p adsorption amount per unit mass of sediment and the ratio of tdp and pp concentrations respectively table s2 provides the results of the regression using eqs 11 and 12 as shown in table s2 r ps and r dp are both negatively correlated with ssc at all monitoring stations p 0 05 while generally positively correlated with time not significant for the negative correlation between r ps and ssc p adsorption experiments show that a smaller ssc corresponds to a larger r ps given a constant equilibrium concentration of dissolved p huang et al 2015b meanwhile both the ssc and sediment size decrease due to the sediment retention in the upstream cascade reservoirs and tgr and finer particles correspond to a larger r ps due to the higher specific surface area wang et al 2020 for the negative correlation between r dp and ssc a smaller ssc implies less amount of dissolved p adsorbed by the sediment and thus a larger r dp in addition the increase in anthropogenic p emissions with time leads to a higher dissolved p concentration in waters and therefore a higher r dp and r ps huang et al 2015b overall both the increase in anthropogenic p emissions and the reservoirs operation hence a decrease in ssc may lead to the increase of r ps and r dp with time fig s6 an upward trend of r ps with time suggests a reduced sediment p buffering capacity and an increasing risk of water pollution considering that tdp is a critical driver of eutrophication wang et al 2020 4 conclusions in this paper the spatial temporal characteristics of p dynamics the relationships between p concentrations and the key factors i e flow sediment and p emissions and the combined impacts of dams construction and pollutant emissions on p transport in the tgr are analyzed based on the long term observations of q ssc tp and tdp at nine monitoring stations from 1997 to 2017 the main conclusions are as follows 1 the p concentrations are positively skewed for each monitoring station and generally follow the three parameter gamma and log normal distributions although the latter performs slightly better than the former 2 p transport exhibits obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the tgr analysis of variance shows that there is significant difference for ssc tp pp and tdp between adjacent periods but not for q analysis of interannual variation suggests that i the ssc tp and pp show downward trend during the periods affected by reservoirs regulation which is more significant for the monitoring stations closer to the dams and generally diminish in a longitudinal direction from upstream to downstream of the tgr and ii the tdp at ums stations increases in period 2 especially after 2007 due to the p emissions in tributaries such as min and wu rivers and it decreases in period 3 as a combined result of the upstream cascade reservoirs impoundment and the pollution management in the tributaries moreover analysis of monthly variation indicates that i the ssc tp and pp are higher in flood season than in dry season but become more evenly distributed throughout the year after the impoundment of cascade reservoirs and ii the tdp tends to show a pattern of higher in dry season and lower in flood season in periods 2 and 3 3 the c q relationships indicate that at the high discharge condition the tp in the tgr is transport limited while tdp is source limited the c q relationships for both tp and tdp are dominated by those at the high discharge conditions and the nonlinearity exists the multi linear regression for p concentrations and q ssc and time shows that the tp pp and tdp are generally positively correlated with ssc and time that is the p concentrations decline with sediment retention in the reservoir but increase with time due to the increasing pollutant emissions overall the p dynamics in the tgr are better depicted after considering the effects of sediment and anthropogenic emissions especially for the ums stations credit authorship contribution statement xiong zeng formal analysis investigation writing original draft lei huang

3360,phosphorus p is an essential nutrient in aquatic ecosystems and its dynamics in river systems are greatly affected by human activities based on the in situ measurements of water discharge q suspended sediment concentrations ssc and concentrations c of total p tp particulate p pp and total dissolved p tdp from 1997 to 2017 p transport in the three gorges reservoir tgr and the combined effects of cascade reservoirs operation and anthropogenic emissions have been explored the whole period was divided into three sequential periods of january 1997 to may 2003 period 1 june 2003 to september 2012 period 2 and october 2012 to december 2017 period 3 corresponding to the period prior to impoundment of the tgr during the operation of the tgr and after the impoundment of upstream cascade reservoirs respectively results showed that the p concentrations were positively skewed and generally followed the three parameter gamma and log normal distributions there was significant difference for ssc tp pp and tdp between adjacent periods but not for q the ssc tp and pp presented downward trends during the periods affected by the impoundment of cascade reservoirs while the tdp increased in period 2 especially after 2007 and decreased in period 3 due to the upstream reservoirs regulation and the pollution management in the tributaries for the monthly variation the ssc tp and pp became more evenly distributed throughout the year after the impoundment of cascade reservoirs while the tdp tended to show a pattern of higher in dry season and lower in flood season the c q relationships indicated that the tp in the tgr was positively correlated with q transport limited while negatively with q for tdp source limited generally the tp pp and tdp were positively correlated with both ssc and anthropogenic p emissions thus the p concentrations declined with sediment retention in the reservoir but increased with time due to the increasing pollutant emissions correspondingly the p dynamics were better depicted after considering the effects of sediment and pollutant emissions than using a simple c q relationship keywords three gorges reservoir phosphorus transport sediment transport river damming anthropogenic emission 1 introduction as an elementary biogenic material in ecosystems phosphorus p is of great importance for supporting life activities elser and bennett 2011 penuelas et al 2020 vitousek et al 2009 p transport in rivers constitutes a major part of the global p cycle meybeck 1982 and has been intensively disturbed by human activities such as river damming and p enrichment by anthropogenic emissions maavara et al 2015 reservoir operation increases the hydraulic residence time and thus impedes the p transport to downstream rivers lakes or estuaries it is estimated that approximately 44 of p in rivers has been retained in reservoirs globally maavara et al 2020 meanwhile anthropogenic p emissions including point and nonpoint sources have greatly raised the p load to watersheds carpenter et al 1998 withers and jarvie 2008 and may even exceed the reservoir retention capacities and exacerbate the eutrophication of global aquatic ecosystems conley et al 2009 lewis et al 2011 maavara et al 2015 nixon 2003 like most rivers in the world p in the yangtze river of china is mainly in the particulate form and is a key limiting nutrient in the local ecosystems elser et al 2007 huang et al 2020 li et al 2019 nie et al 2021 shen and liu 2009 the upstream cascade reservoirs will trap p together with sediment causing p accumulation in the reservoirs which become potential internal pollution sources and altering the nutrient structure of downstream rivers which may trigger a number of ecological and environmental issues dai et al 2011 nilsson 2005 zhou et al 2015 meanwhile the anthropogenic p emissions increase gradually with urbanization and agricultural intensification in the yangtze river basin dai et al 2011 hu et al 2020 powers et al 2016 therefore clarifying the effects of human activities on the relationships among water sediment and p in rivers and on the biogeochemical cycle of p is urgent in order to better understand and alleviate the increasingly severe ecological and environmental problems along the yangtze river he et al 2019 stream flow directly drives the p transport in rivers the relationship between p concentrations c and water discharge q which connects the hydrological processes with the biogeochemical processes has been widely used at catchment and sub catchment scales bieroza et al 2018 godsey et al 2009 moatar et al 2017 the c q curve indicates the inherent properties of p e g solubility reactivity and the watershed characteristics e g soil vegetation topography population agriculture intensity and the variation in the shape of c q curve may reflect the shift of these characteristics ali et al 2017 boix canadell et al 2019 moatar et al 2017 rose et al 2018 the power law relationship of c aqb which can be rewritten as logc loga blogq i e a double logarithmic linear form is a useful tool providing insight into the c q patterns godsey et al 2009 however the existing studies moatar et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 indicate that the linear form is usually difficult to meet and the measured data are too dispersed to fit well as other factors besides q also affect p transport accordingly a number of studies have been conducted to improve the understanding of the c q relationships e g piecewise fitting with consideration of the magnitude of water discharge meybeck and moatar 2012 moatar et al 2017 incorporating the hysteresis response of c to q minaudo et al 2017 distinguishing the impacts of point and nonpoint sources and taking into account the different responses of c to q during storm events and seasonal variations minaudo et al 2019 and applying weighted regression with incorporation of the long term trend and seasonal fluctuation of c hirsch et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 sediment has a strong affinity for p in river systems fang et al 2013 meybeck 1982 müller et al 2006 from the perspective of p source a considerable proportion of p is adsorbed on the surface of sediment particles and enters the water body together with sediment huang et al 2015b then p transports in both dissolved and particulate phases and these two phases transform through adsorption and desorption cui et al 2017 fang et al 2017 li et al 2021 meanwhile p in the water layer exchanges with that in the river bed via sediment deposition and resuspension huang et al 2015a therefore it is crucial to further explore the effects of sediment in order to shed light on p transport in rivers for example zhou et al 2013 developed statistical relationships among c q and suspended sediment concentration ssc and discussed the effect of dams on p transport in the yangtze river huang et al 2015b proposed a coupled model of flow sediment and p transport to quantify the effects of reservoir operation on sediment transport and p retention the three gorges reservoir tgr located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river is the largest hydraulic project in the world ren et al 2020 yang et al 2006 the study of p transport in the tgr is crucial for understanding the p dynamics in big rivers affected by human activities considerable amount of works have been conducted in the tgr primarily focusing on the impacts of reservoirs operation on the spatial temporal characteristics of p concentrations huang et al 2017 tang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 xiang et al 2021 p species ding et al 2019 han et al 2018 ran et al 2016 p retention huang et al 2015b ran et al 2016 tang et al 2020 and p bioavailability and eutrophication tang et al 2018a wang et al 2020 however i most of these studies are based on short term cruise data of short term probably with significant data uncertainties due to the highly dynamics of p concentrations ii the impacts of tgr regulation on p transport are mainly considered while the effects of upstream cascade reservoirs are often ignored and unknown iii the dynamics of dissolved p have received relatively less attention as compared with the total p and particulate p iv the relationships between p dynamics and the flow and sediment transport are still unclear and v studies on pollutant emissions in the tgr are limited to the tributaries and upstream segment while how anthropogenic emissions affect the p transport in the whole reservoir is also unclear to address the problems mentioned above here consecutively measured data of the q ssc and p concentrations in the tgr over the past two decades were collected the whole period was divided into three sequential periods based on the critical time nodes of reservoirs operation to distinguish the effects of tgr and upstream cascade reservoirs on p transport in the tgr the temporal characteristics of p concentrations were explored by successively analyzing the p dynamics in the scales of periods years and months and the spatial characteristics were revealed through classification and comparison among monitoring stations a framework between p concentrations and the key factors e g q ssc and anthropogenic emissions was developed based on which the multi linear regression was explored to further assess the combined impacts of reservoirs regulation and anthropogenic emissions on p transport in the tgr 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data description the river shaped tgr has a surface area of 1084 km2 and a water storage capacity of 393 108 m3 it extends a total length of 670 km and controls the runoff of nearly half of the yangtze river basin ren et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate the annual precipitation 900 mm in the tgr is concentrated in the wet summer and thus a year is divided into the flood season june october and dry season november next may chen et al 2014 guo et al 2018 daily data of q ssc and monthly measurements of total p tp and total dissolved p tdp concentrations from 1997 to 2017 at 9 monitoring stations namely zhutuo zt tongguanyi tgy cuntan ct qingxichang qxc wanxian wx guandukou gdk and nanjinguan njg in the mainstream and beibei bb and wulong wl in the tributaries fig 1 were acquired from the ecological and environmental monitoring system of the three gorges project and the changjiang hydrological bureau here tp and tdp refer to the p concentrations in the unfiltered samples and the samples filtered by the 0 45 μm membrane respectively all these samples were digested with potassium persulfate and p concentrations were determined using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method environment protection administration of china epa china 1989 the concentration of particulate p pp is defined as the difference between tp and tdp i e pp tp tdp the corresponding monthly data of q and ssc which are matched with the monitoring date of p concentrations were used in the subsequent analyses the tgr initialized impoundment in june 2003 the water level was then elevated progressively and reached the normal pool level of 175 m for the first time in october 2010 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2014 the xjb and xld reservoirs fig 1 constructed along the lower jinsha river where most of the sediment in the tgr comes from li et al 2018 began impounding in october 2012 and may 2013 respectively yang et al 2014 the tgr regulation caused a large scale sediment trapping behind the tgd altered the downstream flow regime and profoundly decreased the sediment delivered to the east china sea dai et al 2016 wang et al 2013 after the completion of the upstream cascade reservoirs e g xjb and xld the sediment load transported into the tgr decreased sharply and the yangtze river was dammed more heavily ren et al 2020 yan et al 2021 guo et al 2019 accordingly p dynamics in the tgr is supposed to change with the alteration of the flow and sediment to clarify the effects of cascade reservoirs on p transport in the tgr the whole period of 1997 2017 was divided into three sequential periods according to the critical time nodes of cascade reservoirs operation i e january 1997 to may 2003 as period 1 june 2003 to september 2012 as period 2 and october 2012 to december 2017 as period 3 corresponding to the period prior to impoundment of the tgr during the operation of the tgr and after the impoundment of upstream cascade reservoirs respectively 2 2 statistical methods 2 2 1 analysis of spatial temporal characteristics the gamma distribution and log normal distribution were used for the frequency analysis of p concentrations the three parameter gamma distribution also frequently called the pearson type iii distribution by hydrologists is found to be useful for describing skewed hydrologic variables associated with random processes in time such as meteorological precipitation and annual maximum flood peaks chow et al 1988 and the corresponding probability density function takes the form of eq 1 where α β and γ are the shape scale and location parameters respectively johnson et al 1994 meanwhile the probability density function of the three parameter log normal distribution takes the form of eq 2 where ζ σ and θ are the mean standard deviation and threshold of the variables on the log scale respectively johnson et al 1994 the l moment method was used to estimate the parameters hosking 2019 hosking and wallis 1997 and the two sided kolmogorov goodness of fit test was subsequently performed to determine if the measured p concentration samples agree with the estimated distribution at a certain level of significance conover 1999 r core team 2020 1 p x x β α γ α 1 x γ α 1 e x p x γ β α 0 β 0 x γ 2 p x x x θ 2 π σ 1 exp log x θ ζ 2 2 σ 2 x θ the two sided mann whitney test a nonparametric analysis of variance anova in two sample situation was performed on the monthly data to assess the difference for q ssc tp tdp and pp between adjacent periods conover 1999 r core team 2020 moreover the nonparametric mann kendall test was used on the monthly data to detect the temporal trend of variables in these periods gilbert 1987 pohlert 2020 2 2 2 log linear regression analysis the relationships among q ssc p concentrations and other factors are presented in fig 2 here the factors affecting p concentrations were divided into two categories i e factors correlated with q or ssc f trend and f season denote the corresponding trend and seasonality components respectively and more attention will be paid to f trend as the change is what we concern and factors not correlated with q or ssc denoted as r it is assumed that the temporal trend for natural processes which correlate with q or ssc and exert effects on p concentrations is negligible in a short period as studied in this paper compared with the geological time scale despite that factors like climate change do have impacts on the p transport michalak 2016 sinha et al 2017 therefore f trend mainly refers to the trend of anthropogenic factors as previously described there are two major human interference on p transport in fluvial systems i e dam construction and p enrichment by anthropogenic emissions maavara et al 2015 the impacts of river damming on p transport are largely mediated by modifying q and ssc thus f trend mainly represents the trend for anthropogenic p emission from sources like agricultural practices urban activities and p rock mining carpenter et al 1998 chen and graedel 2016 penuelas et al 2020 overall fig 2 comprehensively considers the effects of human activities such as river damming and pollutant emission on p transport the log linear regression of the key parameters i e power law representation was used to explore the relationships between c and q for each monitoring station as shown in eq 3 where u is the error term taking into account the potential nonlinearity each sample was split into two parts at the median value of q for piecewise fitting meybeck and moatar 2012 moatar et al 2017 the slope β 1 is a useful indicator for p transport pattern in watersheds according to moatar et al 2017 the cases of β 1 0 β 1 0 and β 1 0 are regarded as transport limited chemostatic and source limited respectively 3 log c β 0 β 1 log q u according to fig 2 we successively added the variables ssc and f trend to the regression eqs 4 and 5 to further explore their effects on p transport 4 log c β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c u 5 log c β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c β 3 f t r e n d u moreover time was used as a proxy variable for f trend since they are directly correlated but f trend is unobservable wooldridge 2016 the relationship between time and f trend is assumed to be linear eq 6 then eq 7 was obtained by substituting eq 6 into eq 5 which can be further rewritten as eq 8 6 f t r e n d δ 0 δ 1 time v 7 log c β 0 β 3 δ 0 β 1 log q β 2 logssc β 3 δ 1 time β 3 v u 8 log c β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c β 3 time u in light of multiple linear regression theory the coefficients β i quantify the association between the corresponding independent variables and the dependent variable stock and watson 2019 wooldridge 2016 for example β 2 in eq 8 can be interpreted as that c increases by β 2 with ssc increasing by 1 holding q and time constant therefore a larger absolute value of β 2 suggests that c is more sensitive to the change of ssc it is worth noting that β 3 in eq 5 is positive according to the definition of f trend indicating that β 3 i e β 3 δ 1 in eq 8 has the same sign with δ 1 in eq 6 therefore a positive or negative β 3 suggests the upward or downward trend of anthropogenic p emission moreover we defined r ps as the p adsorption amount per unit mass of sediment eq 9 and r dp as the ratio of the concentrations of tdp and pp eq 10 r ps indicates the residual buffering capacity of sediment to p in water bodies i e a greater r ps corresponds to a smaller residual buffering capacity fang et al 2017 huang et al 2015b pan and liss 1998 while r dp provides insight into the partition of p between the particulate and dissolved phases similarly multi linear regression relationships for r ps and r dp were also developed considering the effects of q ssc and time eqs 11 and 12 respectively 9 r p s pp ssc 10 r d p tdp pp 11 log r p s β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c β 3 time u 12 log r d p β 0 β 1 log q β 2 log s s c β 3 time u in this study each sample size for regression is about 200 fig 4 which meets the requirement of large sample normality the coefficients in the regression equations indicate the correlation rather than causality because the omitted variable bias is difficult to eliminate as time series data are used for regression the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity exist thus the heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent robust standard errors were used to adjust the confidence interval of the coefficients so that the statistical inference is still valid stock and watson 2019 wooldridge 2016 the variance inflation factor was calculated and found to be less than 10 for each regression indicating that the multicollinearity is negligible james et al 2013 all statistical analyses in this study were conducted in r r core team 2020 the results of eqs 3 4 8 11 and 12 will be discussed in the following sections 3 results and discussion the monthly variations of ssc and tp at ct in the tail of the tgr and njg the outflow station of the tgr stations are presented in fig 3 and the variations of q and tdp refer to fig s1 in the supplementary materials both the ssc and tp exhibit higher values during the flood season and lower values during the dry season especially at ct station there are obvious declines of ssc and tp around 2003 at njg station fig 3b and d and around 2013 at ct station fig 3a and c largely due to the impoundment of the tgr and the xjb and xld reservoirs respectively which indicates that the division of these three sequent periods is reasonable and necessary for further analysis 3 1 descriptive statistics the statistics for q ssc tp and tdp at these nine monitoring stations are presented in fig 4 it shows that the values of q and ssc for the monitoring stations on the main stream are obviously larger than those on the tributaries fig 4a and b meanwhile the q generally increases along the main stream from zt to njg due to the inflow from the tributaries like wu and jialing rivers fig 4a while the ssc generally diminishes as a combined results of the sediment settlement in the tgr ren et al 2020 and the dilution of the tributaries fig 4b the average value of tp is 0 20 mg l 1 for the main stream stations and 0 16 mg l 1 for the tributary stations while the corresponding average values of tdp are 0 07 and 0 11 mg l 1 for the main stream and tributaries stations respectively the tp value at bb station is significantly lower than that at other monitoring stations p 0 001 fig 4c and the tdp value at wl station varies greatly fig 4d largely due to the pollution caused by p rock mining in the wu river which will be discussed in detail later han et al 2016 in addition q ssc tp and tdp are positively skewed at all monitoring stations the calculated skewness of the variables is not shown here fig 5 a shows the comparisons of the estimated gamma distribution to the samples of tp at gdk station for the three periods compared with the tp in period 1 tp in periods 2 and 3 is lower at the same quantile which indicates a general decrease for tp from period 1 to periods 2 and 3 in addition tp in period 3 is higher at small quantile but lower at large quantile than that in period 2 which suggests less volatility in period 3 as compared to period 2 overall the frequency analysis provides a perspective of probability distribution to describe the temporal changes of tp at gdk station which is consistent with the results shown in fig 8 b and 9a however there is no simple law to summarize the change of probability distribution of p concentrations among periods for all stations as demonstrated by the complicated behaviors shown in figs 7 9 fig 5b and c display the results p values of the two sided kolmogorov goodness of fit test of gamma distribution and log normal distribution for tp tdp and pp respectively the result indicates that p concentrations at these monitoring stations generally follow the gamma and log normal distributions except for a few samples e g pp at wx station in periods 2 and 3 in addition the log normal distribution performs slightly better than the gamma distribution e g pp at qxc in period 3 follows the log normal distribution but not the gamma distribution 3 2 spatial temporal characteristics of p transport 3 2 1 analysis of variance the results of anova for tp at the main stream stations are provided in fig 6 and the corresponding results for q ssc pp and tdp refer to fig s2 there is no significant p greater than 0 05 difference for q between adjacent periods except for periods 1 and 2 at zt station fig s2a which indicates that q from the perspective of period is little affected by dam constructions and remains almost constant across the whole time scale dai et al 2011 although significant decrease in flood season and increase in dry season have been observed for q as a result of the reservoirs regulation wang et al 2013 yan et al 2021 in contrast ssc shows significant p 0 05 difference between adjacent periods except for periods 1 and 2 at ct station with generally a decreasing trend at each station fig s2b which is consistent with the previous studies dai et al 2011 guo et al 2018 ren et al 2020 similarly tp and pp show significant p 0 05 difference between adjacent periods except for periods 1 and 2 at wx station fig 6 and fig s2c and tdp also shows significant p 0 05 difference between adjacent periods except for periods 1 and 2 at ct station fig s2d overall there is significant difference for ssc tp pp and tdp between adjacent periods but not for q in the tgr it is worth noting that these comparisons are based on the average values of q ssc tp pp and tdp in each period more details such as the reasons for these differences will be further revealed by interpreting the interannual and monthly variations of these variables 3 2 2 analysis of interannual variation the variations of the annual average values of ssc tp tdp and pp are presented in fig 7 including the tdp values at xjb and gc stations fig 7i meanwhile the p values of the mann kendall test are provided in fig 8 showing the temporal trend of these variables in periods 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 and 1 3 according to figs 7 and 8 we classify the monitoring stations on the main stream into two categories i the upper monitoring stations ums including zt tgy ct qxc and wx 289 km from the three gorges dam stations and ii the lower monitoring stations lms including gdk 76 km from the three gorges dam and njg stations the tp at ums stations presents a downward trend in period 2 3 at the significance level of 0 05 fig 8b specifically the decrease happens in period 3 because no downward trend is observed in period 2 fig 8b fig 7a d as a combined result of the p retention effect of upstream cascade reservoirs liu et al 2019 and the management of pollution in tributaries han et al 2016 qin et al 2018 the tp at lms stations decreases in period 1 2 and increases in period 2 3 at the 0 05 significance level but no trend is shown in period 1 2 and 3 fig 8b indicating that tp at lms stations declines around 2003 and then rises slightly around 2013 fig 7e and f meanwhile fig 7a f show that there is a downward trend for tp from upstream to downstream along the yangtze river largely due to the p retention in the tgr wang et al 2021 overall the ssc and pp present downward trend p 0 05 during the periods affected by cascade reservoirs impoundment fig 8a and c and the closer the monitoring station is to the dams including the tgr xjb and xld reservoirs the more significant the corresponding decline is fig 7a f in addition the ssc and pp also generally diminish along the yangtze river han et al 2018 ren et al 2020 tang et al 2018b as pp represents the adsorbed p by sediment and generally constitute the main part of tp similar behavior exists for the ssc pp and tp tang et al 2018a zhou et al 2013 as shown in fig 7a d and fig 8d the tdp at ums stations increases in period 2 p 0 001 especially after 2007 and decreases in period 3 p 0 001 with the turning point around 2013 the former may be related to the p pollution e g p rock mining in tributaries such as min river fig 7i and wu river fig 7h which show a significant increase in the tdp concentration around 2007 2013 han et al 2016 qin et al 2018 these increases are gradually offset along the main stream due to the adsorption and deposition of sediment huang et al 2015a ren et al 2020 and consequently no obvious increase at gdk and njg stations the latter on the one hand is because that the upstream reservoirs retain p and reduce tdp at the outflow xjb station fig 7i on the other hand it is also due to the management and improvement of water quality in tributaries mitigating the p pollution fig 7h and i han et al 2016 qin et al 2018 meanwhile the ssc of all stations are relatively low in period 3 and the sediment deposition is less significant in the tgr fig 7a f therefore tdp shows a smaller magnitude of decrease along the main stream and consequently leads to a higher level of tdp in period 3 than that in period 2 at gdk and njg stations fig 7e and f the variations of tdp are not only affected by sediment transport huang et al 2015a but also directly influenced by point source emissions such as p rock mining which is usually in the dissolved form carpenter et al 1998 jarvie et al 2006 withers and jarvie 2008 thus showing more complicated behaviors for example fig 7h shows that tdp changes intensely with p emission while pp is little affected overall a simple and reasonable explanation for the spatial temporal characteristics of tdp in the tgr which are not well known han et al 2018 or discussed in detail in the previous studies tang et al 2019 2018a 2018b wu et al 2021 xiang et al 2021 has been developed here taking into account the operation of cascade reservoirs and anthropogenic emissions 3 2 3 analysis of monthly variation fig 9 shows the monthly variations for tp and tdp in these three periods and the monthly variations for ssc and pp refer to fig s3 the impoundment of reservoirs leads to the reduction of ssc at all monitoring stations especially in the flood season yan et al 2021 consequently ssc distributes more evenly throughout the year fig s3a in period 1 the tp is higher in flood season than in dry season for all monitoring stations thus the water quality is worse in flood season than that in dry season xiang et al 2021 and the tp at lms stations distributes more evenly throughout the year than at ums stations fig 9a the tp at lms stations decreases throughout the year after the impoundment of tgr i e period 2 versus period 1 and similarly the tp at ums stations decreases after the impoundment of xjb and xld reservoirs i e period 3 versus period 2 correspondingly the magnitude of tp variation throughout the year decreases with time fig 9a i e a more uniform distribution in a year meanwhile the pp shows a similar behavior as tp in general fig s3b as shown in fig 9b the tdp at lms stations declines after the impoundment of tgr which is similar to the change of tp due to the p retention in the reservoir in addition the tdp in period 3 is generally higher than in period 2 for all monitoring stations as a combined results of the increase in 2007 2013 and decrease in 2013 2017 fig 7a d compared with period 1 the tdp tends to show a pattern of higher in dry season and lower in flood season in periods 2 and 3 due to the smaller water discharge in dry season and thus less significant dilution effect on the input of p emissions jarvie et al 2006 3 3 log linear regression analysis 3 3 1 relationships of c versus q the relationships between c including the tp and tdp concentrations and q for each monitoring stations are plotted in fig 10 and the corresponding coefficients β 1 of the regression using eq 3 are shown in fig 11 here piecewise fitting is conducted at the median value of q taking into account the potential nonlinearity moatar et al 2017 at the low discharge condition both the tp and tdp concentrations increase slightly not significantly with the increasing q in most stations fig 11a however the c q relationships are obviously different for tp and tdp at the high discharge condition specifically the coefficients β 1 s u p are significantly p 0 05 negative for tdp except at ct station while are significantly p 0 001 positive for tp at all stations fig 11b indicating that the tdp concentrations decrease with the increasing q i e source limited while the tp concentrations increase with the increasing q i e transport limited which can also be observed in fig 10 moatar et al 2017 the former may be related to the dilution effect of water discharge while the latter may be the result of more sediment and pp washed into the river by runoff the obvious differences in the sign and significance level between β 1 i n f and β 1 s u p also suggest the nonlinearity in the c q relationships for both tp and tdp which is partly due to the neglect of other factors affecting c such as ssc and p emissions quinlan et al 2021 moreover the coefficient β 1 i n f s u p shows similar behavior as β 1 s u p fig 11c implying that the c q patterns are dominated by those at the high discharge condition it is also observed that β 1 i n f s u p for tp tends to be smaller at lms stations than that at ums stations i e tp at lms stations is less affected by the variation of q this is another interpretation for the results shown in fig 9a i e tp distributes more evenly throughout the year at lms stations than at ums stations in the same vein there is no obvious difference between β 1 i n f s u p for tdp at all stations corresponding to the similar monthly distributions among the stations fig 9b 3 3 2 relationships of c versus q and ssc table 1 provides the results of the regression for tp tdp and pp using eq 4 the corresponding adjusted r2 using eq 3 namely r3 is also listed in table 1 as mentioned before it is the trend not the seasonality that we are mainly concerned with considering the unidirectional causality between q and ssc fig 2 and that there is no significant trend for q fig s2a here we will focus on the characteristics of β 2 as shown in table 1 the β 2 value is significantly p 0 001 positive for pp indicating that there is a significantly positive correlation between pp and ssc meanwhile the corresponding r4 value is basically larger than 0 6 with an obvious increase compared with r3 reflecting that the fitting results can be greatly improved by incorporating ssc moreover the β 2 value shows a downward trend along the main stream i e the pp value at the ums stations is more sensitive with the change of ssc in contrast the tdp shows significantly p 0 01 negative correlation with ssc for each monitoring station except njg station and the corresponding r4 and r3 values are both much smaller than those for pp thus the tdp is less correlated with ssc than pp which is consistent with the intuition meanwhile the absolute value of β 2 also shows a downward trend along the main stream which can be interpreted in the same way as pp by definition tp is the sum of pp and tdp therefore the correlation between tp and ssc and the corresponding adjusted r2 are at the level between those for pp and tdp overall the r4 values for tp tdp and pp are generally larger than the corresponding r3 3 3 3 relationships of c versus q ssc and time the results of the regression for tp tdp and pp using eq 8 are listed in table s1 and here we focus on the characteristics of β 2 and β 3 i e the coefficients corresponding to the variables ssc and time respectively both tp and pp are positively correlated with ssc at the significance level of 0 05 for almost all monitoring stations and β 2 shows a downward trend along the main stream which is consistent with the results for eq 4 as presented in table 1 actually the soil erosion in the upstream is intense ren et al 2020 thus the input sediment may dominate the changes of tp and pp hence a larger β 2 due to the sediment deposition along the main stream and the relatively small erosion intensity downstream liu et al 2022 the effect of sediment on tp and pp gradually diminishes hence a smaller β 2 however there are differences for β 2 when comparing the regression results of eq 4 and eq 8 i e β 2 for tdp is basically positive but not significant at most stations in table s1 which is obviously contrary to the results in table 1 it indicates that after controlling the impacts of time i e the proxy variable for f trend fig 2 on p concentrations there is generally a positive but not significant correlation between tdp and ssc this is consistent with the previous findings that the tdp has been retained together with sediment deposition in the reservoirs therefore the results for the correlation between variables e g the correlation between tdp and ssc should be treated with caution since the omitted variable bias in statistics may lead to wrong conclusions if the key variables are not considered in the regression or correlation analysis stock and watson 2019 tang et al 2018a 2018b as shown in table s1 β 3 for tp tdp and pp are positive at almost all monitoring stations indicating that anthropogenic emission has been increasing in recent years and accordingly elevated the p concentrations in rivers which is consistent with the previous findings in fig 7 the effects of anthropogenic emission on p concentrations are considered in eq 8 using time as a proxy variable thus the adjusted r2 using eq 8 namely r8 is generally larger than r4 and r3 specifically the magnitude of increase in the adjusted r2 is remarkable for tdp especially at ums stations e g from 0 0435 and 0 1679 to 0 4859 at zt station but relatively mild for pp meanwhile β 3 for tdp is larger than pp at the same stations indicating that tdp changes more intensely with time or f trend than pp this is probably due to the fact that anthropogenic emission is usually in the dissolved form carpenter et al 1998 jarvie et al 2006 withers and jarvie 2008 and thus tdp is more directly affected by pollutant emissions in addition β 3 for tp tdp and pp shows a downward trend from upstream to downstream because the pollution mainly occurs at the upstream tributaries and thus p concentrations are more affected by p emission at upstream stations in general the fitting results can be greatly improved by incorporating the variables of ssc and time especially for the ums stations with a greater ability to elaborate the variations in p concentrations the comparisons between the observed and predicted tp using eqs 3 4 and 8 are presented in fig 12 and the results for pp and tdp refer to figs s4 and s5 it can also be found that the p dynamics are better depicted after considering the effects of sediment and anthropogenic emissions however to better predict the p concentrations nonlinear relationships and more complex mathematical models are still needed considering that p concentrations are highly dynamic huang et al 2015b zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 3 3 4 relationships of r ps and r dp versus q ssc and time the monthly variations of r ps and r dp at each monitoring station are presented in fig s6 which represent the p adsorption amount per unit mass of sediment and the ratio of tdp and pp concentrations respectively table s2 provides the results of the regression using eqs 11 and 12 as shown in table s2 r ps and r dp are both negatively correlated with ssc at all monitoring stations p 0 05 while generally positively correlated with time not significant for the negative correlation between r ps and ssc p adsorption experiments show that a smaller ssc corresponds to a larger r ps given a constant equilibrium concentration of dissolved p huang et al 2015b meanwhile both the ssc and sediment size decrease due to the sediment retention in the upstream cascade reservoirs and tgr and finer particles correspond to a larger r ps due to the higher specific surface area wang et al 2020 for the negative correlation between r dp and ssc a smaller ssc implies less amount of dissolved p adsorbed by the sediment and thus a larger r dp in addition the increase in anthropogenic p emissions with time leads to a higher dissolved p concentration in waters and therefore a higher r dp and r ps huang et al 2015b overall both the increase in anthropogenic p emissions and the reservoirs operation hence a decrease in ssc may lead to the increase of r ps and r dp with time fig s6 an upward trend of r ps with time suggests a reduced sediment p buffering capacity and an increasing risk of water pollution considering that tdp is a critical driver of eutrophication wang et al 2020 4 conclusions in this paper the spatial temporal characteristics of p dynamics the relationships between p concentrations and the key factors i e flow sediment and p emissions and the combined impacts of dams construction and pollutant emissions on p transport in the tgr are analyzed based on the long term observations of q ssc tp and tdp at nine monitoring stations from 1997 to 2017 the main conclusions are as follows 1 the p concentrations are positively skewed for each monitoring station and generally follow the three parameter gamma and log normal distributions although the latter performs slightly better than the former 2 p transport exhibits obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the tgr analysis of variance shows that there is significant difference for ssc tp pp and tdp between adjacent periods but not for q analysis of interannual variation suggests that i the ssc tp and pp show downward trend during the periods affected by reservoirs regulation which is more significant for the monitoring stations closer to the dams and generally diminish in a longitudinal direction from upstream to downstream of the tgr and ii the tdp at ums stations increases in period 2 especially after 2007 due to the p emissions in tributaries such as min and wu rivers and it decreases in period 3 as a combined result of the upstream cascade reservoirs impoundment and the pollution management in the tributaries moreover analysis of monthly variation indicates that i the ssc tp and pp are higher in flood season than in dry season but become more evenly distributed throughout the year after the impoundment of cascade reservoirs and ii the tdp tends to show a pattern of higher in dry season and lower in flood season in periods 2 and 3 3 the c q relationships indicate that at the high discharge condition the tp in the tgr is transport limited while tdp is source limited the c q relationships for both tp and tdp are dominated by those at the high discharge conditions and the nonlinearity exists the multi linear regression for p concentrations and q ssc and time shows that the tp pp and tdp are generally positively correlated with ssc and time that is the p concentrations decline with sediment retention in the reservoir but increase with time due to the increasing pollutant emissions overall the p dynamics in the tgr are better depicted after considering the effects of sediment and anthropogenic emissions especially for the ums stations credit authorship contribution statement xiong zeng formal analysis investigation writing original draft lei huang

response wetland hydration water management eco hydrological models 1 introduction agricultural lands have traditionally been valued for food fiber and fuel production clément et al 2017 pastor et al 2019 but their role in regulating and sustaining environmental services and enhancing biodiversity has also been receiving increased attention norris 2008 gonthier et al 2014 huntsinger and oviedo 2014 page and bellotti 2015 boughton et al 2019 agricultural lands including ranches often contain wetlands which are considered biodiversity hotspots and a hub of environmental services swain et al 2013 however loss of these wetlands to support agricultural intensification has also received widespread attention thiere et al 2009 almost 35 of wetlands have been lost between 1970 and 2015 worldwide wwf 2018 loss of wetlands has significantly impacted freshwater biodiversity kingsford et al 2016 arntzen et al 2017 and globally 25 of wetland dependent plant and animal species are at risk of extinction ramsar convention on wetlands 2018 draining wetlands for agricultural and urban development has led to degradation of ecosystems in watersheds such as the everglades nas 2021 chesapeake bay steven and lowrance 2011 mississippi river gleason et al 2011 and china s yangtze river an and verhoeven 2019 the payment for environmental services pes concept is increasingly becoming a sought after ecosystem restoration approach yin and zhao 2012 huang et al 2018 ruggiero et al 2019 and is applicable to wetland restoration projects the philosophy of pes programs is that in certain situations providing financial incentive is more effective than implementing a regulatory measure zanella et al 2014 promoted as a market like approach pes programs are usually conceptualized with a sense of simplicity however implementing them is complicated zanella et al 2014 the foundation of pes programs is their voluntary nature such that a seller willingly sells a well defined service to a buyer wünder 2005 although a core principle of the pes theory there are exceptions to the voluntary participation especially when intermediary parties between the seller and buyers are involved vatn 2010 for our study we consider the state public as the buyer and the voluntary nature of the pes programs holds true the willingness to participate provides freedom to the sellers however it also puts them all in one pool making it harder to compare cost efficiency and service provision levels jack and jayachandran 2019 while quantity of service provision is the primary criterion for awarding pes contracts the synergies and trade offs among other associated services and the potential risk of dis services because of interactions among physical and ecological systems receives little to no attention wünscher et al 2008 reasons for this lack of attention mostly stems from the difficulty in quantifying the trade offs and synergies changes in hydrologic patterns are known to impact wetland ecological processes and biodiversity konar et al 2013 although hydration of drained wetlands may lead to enhanced wetland habitat and desirable biodiversity recent studies have also linked alterations in hydrologic conditions and patterns to increases in invasive species stokes et al 2010 catford et al 2011 nielsen et al 2013 the conflict between positive and negative impacts of wetland hydration on biodiversity needs to be evaluated by simultaneous consideration of services and dis services the extent of impacts positive and negative may change from site to site for the same or different levels of hydrologic changes depending on multiple factors including land use and management for example boughton et al 2019 showed that ranch management practices in florida can affect biodiversity responses to hydrological changes therefore the optimum level of hydration that supports native flora and fauna while minimizing invasive species may differ by location the challenge for pes in wetland settings targeting biodiversity is that the ecological interactions are complex and can be difficult to generalize especially as a response to something as complex as changing water storage on landscape that changes water availability including area volume and hydroperiod on wetlands it has been proposed that pes accounting should only consider the final service product in favor of greater traceability of the program impact brauman et al 2007 it is also suggested that instead of considering pes programs purely for their paid service and economic benefits they be designed with consideration of how biodiversity responds to management actions bullock et al 2011 the everglades is a globally important watershed and public interest in hydrological restoration makes it an appropriate ecosystem in which the role of pes can be evaluated the everglades was once and to an extent still is a vast network of wetlands and rivers supporting rich subtropical vegetation and wildlife lemaire and sisto 2012 dramatic alteration of landscape drainage to improve flood management urban water supply and agricultural production has led to the decline of the everglades ecosystem historically the kissimmee river lake okeechobee and everglades constituted the greater everglades ecosystem which accounts for most of the sub tropical south florida area fig 1 pre 1920s the kissimmee river formed a significant proportion of the headwaters of the greater everglades system feeding lake okeechobee fig 1 mcvoy et al 2011 steinman and rosen 2000 in addition to flowing south through sheet flow the lake water also moved slowly through the caloosahatchee river and downstream through other small rivers to coastal estuaries and eventually to the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean mcvoy et al 2011 development of extensive ditch networks to drain the watershed began in the 1880s fig 1 which resulted in fast movement of unnaturally high flows and nutrient loads to the lake rivers estuaries and the southern everglades steinman and rosen 2000 graham et al 2015 water flowing into lake okeechobee from the north fig 1 accounts for 92 of the total inflow to the lake current estimates are that storage of 750 000 acre feet of water is required north of the lake to significantly reduce excessive discharges from the lake to the estuarine systems and the everglades sfwmd 2021a while several state funded projects including reservoirs and aquifer storage recovery asr have been planned or started they are not enough to meet the water storage goals hence there is a great deal of interest in developing pes solutions for the watershed to complement other initiatives in 2005 a coalition of state agencies environmental organizations researchers and private landowners developed and implemented a pes program known as the florida ranchland environmental services program fresp in the northern everglades basin bohlen et al 2009 the idea of fresp was to hold water on private ranchlands by reducing surface flows from them lynch and shabman 2011 the rationale behind fresp was to obtain some of the needed storage by dispersing it throughout the northern everglades basin complementing other water storage systems such as reservoirs and constructed treatment wetlands under fresp ranchers installed discharge control structures commonly known as culverts with riser boards crb and raised the spillage level by adding boards the seller of services was the rancher and the buyer was the state of florida through the south florida water management district sfwmd that is responsible for managing and protecting water resources in the everglades basin the fresp first of its kind pes implemented within the united states was a pilot program that laid the foundation for the basin wide launch of the northern everglades payment for environmental services ne pes program bohlen et al 2009 the ne pes now has 15 sites and provides an estimated 102 512 acre feet of water storage annually sfwmd 2021b under the ne pes the term water retention better describes the storage service since the surface water that is retained eventually leaves the ranch through subsurface flow and evapotranspiration the term water retention has been simplified to a more generic term of water storage for communicating to general public and other stakeholders and is used here onwards increasing the spillage level on ranch lands was expected to alter the hydrological linkages between uplands and wetlands which in turn affects vegetation and wildlife diversity shabman et al 2013 in the case of the ne pes trade offs and synergies exist between storage level and desirable and undesirable biodiversity boughton et al 2019 there is a difference of opinion among researchers regarding biodiversity s status as an ecosystem service haines young and potschin young 2010 mace et al 2012 duncan et al 2015 the disagreement stems from a variety of reasons primary reason being the complexity in biodiversity valuation due to a host of parameters and its trans disciplinary nature mace et al 2012 however we believe that the status of biodiversity as a service should be program specific as suggested by mace et al 2012 biodiversity can be considered as a regulator of ecosystem functions e g carbon sequestration standalone ecosystem service e g restoration of native flora and fauna or a valued product e g aesthetically pleasing view facilitating tourism although biodiversity enhancement was an expected impact of reducing ranch scale drainage which in turn increased the wetland hydration under the payment for water storage program it was recognized as difficult to quantify there was no provision to include biodiversity as a factor either for deciding where to implement a pes contract or how much to pay for it more importantly there was no willing buyer e g conservation stakeholder group such as an ngo or a federal state agency for enhanced biodiversity even if there were willing buyers double dipping would be a legitimate concern double dipping i e selling environmental benefits from a pes program in multiple markets is typically not allowed woodward 2011 given these concerns we decided at a later stage that biodiversity be considered a non economic but valued product of the program and relationships between hydrological and ecological changes be developed to quantify biodiversity response to increase in water storage although biodiversity enhancement is not a benefit for which there is a buyer we argue and demonstrate that these relationships should be the drivers of decisions about where to implement site selection projects and how much to store spillage level furthermore multiple stakeholder preferences play a key role in implementation of pes programs in case of the ne pes the diversity of stakeholders e g agricultural producers local government environmental agencies and ngos in the coalition is significant and their preferences for service valuation is likely to vary this makes the decision making process where biodiversity is also a factor more challenging from a policy standpoint the correlation between water storage and biodiversity enhancement is not necessarily linear which is why selecting sites solely based on amount or unit price of storage may not work for a multi service pes program targeting both water storage and biodiversity enhancement therefore a tool to quantify trade offs between storage and various biodiversity indicators on the basis of user preference is needed our overarching goal was to develop an approach that is a result of the interplay between physical water storage ecological biodiversity agricultural food production and social stakeholder preference components that articulates the synergies and trade offs for all the steps toward this goal included development of models to mathematically quantify the relationships between the said components and a decision support system dss tool to integrate them with stakeholder preference to identify desirable sites among a pool of eligible pes applicants and optimum water storage levels biodiversity enhancement as a result of water storage under the pes scheme is considered a non economic but valued product in this study however if there were willing buyers for it biodiversity could be considered a focal ecosystem service and the mathematical models could be used to quantify the service provisioning our specific objectives are to 1 refine eco hydrological relationships drawn from our earlier work on four ranchlands in the everglades basin by boughton et al 2019 2 develop eco hydrological models for predicting biodiversity response to changes in water storage 3 develop a dss that combines predictions from eco hydrological and hydrologic models with user defined weighting schemes representing their preference for offered ecosystem services 4 use the dss to assist in ranking sites interested in participating in the pes program as well as deciding the level of water storage service that would maximize the desirable and reduce the undesirable biodiversity response and 5 identify the actors and their preferences when selecting pes projects and demonstrate how trade offs can be negotiated given the assimilation of these proclivities in the dss tool 2 methods 2 1 study sites and site selection four ranches ranch 1 through 4 in the everglades basin were selected for ecological measurements to evaluate the effects of changes in ranch scale water storage on biodiversity of wetlands embedded within ranchlands and develop eco hydrologic models for predicting the biodiversity responses fig 1 table 1 site selection was based on participation in the fresp pilot pes program availability of hydrologic data landowners willingness and or representativeness ranch 1 2 and 4 participated in the ne pes program while ranch 3 was the study site for another similar ranchland water storage research project shukla et al 2011 shukla et al 2014 goswami and shukla 2015 wu et al 2016 land use land management wetland biodiversity and hydrology of the four ranches selected for the study represent typical ranchlands within the northern everglades basin each is a representative cow calf ranching operations maintaining a permanent herd of breeding cows to raise calves for transfer to stocker grass and feedlots and eventual market land use at the four ranches comprised of semi native pastures and improved pastures improved pastures receive regular inputs of fertilizers and amendments e g lime and have higher density of ditches and swales to facilitate both drainage as well as irrigation sub irrigation semi native pastures represent a lower intensity grazing operation compared to improved pastures improved pastures also involve establishment of agronomic forage grasses and have higher cattle stocking density as compared to semi native pastures which makes them a more intensive production system with a subtropical climate the average rainfall for the basin is 1362 mm year average minimum temperature of the region is 17 c 62 f and the average maximum temperature is 29 c 84 f the dominant soil type at the four ranches was spodosol sandy soils with nearly level topography shallow water table and poor drainage the outflow locations at all ranches were equipped with crb structures that enabled the changes in the spillage level at the outlet to reduce surface outflow volume and rate and increase the surface and subsurface storage ecological and hydrologic data were collected at 15 wetlands table 1 on the four ranches these wetlands varied in area and hydrologic conditions table 1 selecting different types of ranches as well as wetlands allowed us to develop generic eco hydrological models that are representative of the northern everglades basin the 15 wetlands ranged from 0 24 31 ha in size and were previously drained through intense ditch networks for maximizing pasture area 2 2 selection and categorization of biodiversity and agricultural production indicators biodiversity response indicators were chosen based on their ease of measurement relevant for the scale of measurement expected response to changes in wetland hydrology significance to maintaining ranch operations under extended hydroperiods and significance for other higher trophic level organisms e g mosquito larvae and fish and fish and macroinvertebrates attracting wading birds as well as ability to develop empirical relationships that can be used within the dss specific biodiversity indicators included percent cover of native wetland plants and exotic plants as well as abundance of fish amphibians aquatic macroinvertebrates and mosquitos table 2 the percent cover of planted forages was used as an indicator of the ne pes project s impact on agricultural production the wetland plant indicator included emergent macrophytes e g sagittaria graminea sagittaria lancifolia sagittaria latifolia pontedaria cordata juncus effusus thalia geniculata the exotic plant indicator group included non native plants e g ludwigia peruviana the forage indicator group included all forage species planted or wetland e g panicum hemitomon grasses known to be palatable to cattle the animal responses were grouped into fish amphibians macroinvertebrates and mosquitos a full list of plant and animal species are presented in the appendix table a 1 detailed methods for ecological data collection and analyses are provided in boughton et al 2019 2 3 ecologic and hydrologic data collection for eco hydrological modeling wetlands were sampled multiple times 1 9 median 6 per wet season june october for measuring hydrologic surface water elevation and biodiversity indicators during the wet season for two years 2010 2011 to account for seasonal variation from late fall through the spring months november april the region typically has cooler temperatures receiving only 30 408 mm of the total annual rainfall this results in drought like conditions shallow wetlands dry out and ecological activity slows the summer and early fall months may october are typically warmer with most of the rainfall occurring in this time 70 953 mm resulting in hydrated and ecologically active wetlands june through mid november is hurricane season in the region which can result in flooded conditions the monitoring period included periods of prolonged drought and flooding thus making the eco hydrological models appropriate for variety of weather and hydrologic conditions specific hydrologic variables were either measured or derived from measured data are presented in table 3 2 3 1 topography the digital elevation models dems for ranch 1 and ranch 4 were developed using the topographic data collected during a ground survey using a trimble s6 trimble westminster co usa the lidar data collected by the national center for airborne laser mapping at university of florida were used to develop dems for ranch 2 and 3 guzha and shukla 2012 shukla et al 2011 these dems were used for estimating hydrologic variables e g inundation area and time inundated and calibration and validation of hydrologic models the vertical accuracy of topographic data was 10 20 cm 2 3 2 surface and groundwater levels manual water depth measurements were collected in the wetlands between 2010 and 2012 depth of water in the wetland was measured using a metric ruler at each sampling location at the time of ecologic sampling the sampling locations were randomly selected and were recorded using a trimble geoxt gps trimble westminster co usa maximum wetland depth was determined for each sampling date by comparing all depth measurements collected during a particular day in addition to the event based manual measurements 15 minute groundwater surface water levels were measured using pressure transducers during the 2010 2012 period higher frequency water elevation above mean sea level data were used to calibrate and validate the hydrologic model as well as estimate the hydrologic connectivity between upland and wetland areas for ranches 2 and 3 discussed in section 2 4 below 2 4 wetland inundation volume and hydrologic continuum the hydrologic variables used in the study were chosen based on available literature and discussion between co authors hydrologists and ecologists using the measured wetland water depth and groundwater elevations other hydrological parameters e g days inundated wetland water volume needed for the eco hydrologic models were derived see details in table 3 2 5 development of eco hydrological models development of eco hydrological models is an extension of ranch specific relationships developed by boughton et al 2019 which identified the synergies and trade offs among water storage and biodiversity services the ecologic variables biodiversity indicators in our study were regrouped from the standpoint of using biodiversity for inclusion in the dss for stakeholders designing pes programs and or selecting pes sites and a specific water storage service level spillage level within the crb we developed mathematical functions based on the eco hydrological relationships as they related to the new groupings essential for developing the dss the most informative mathematical models and variables were identified based on akaike s information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2001 the aic identifies the best model from a set of possible models by assessing how well each explains the variation in the data while penalizing for model complexity generalized linear mixed effects abundances were used because wetlands were random effects across the landscape and within ranches meaning the wetlands were considered a sample from a population of wetlands negative binomial gaussian or zero inflated negative binomial distributions were used where applicable potential models included additive and interactive effects though interactions were included only if it was expected that they were important in all sets of models a null model was compared that included an intercept term only e g amphibian 1 and univariate models which contained each independent hydrologic variable only e g only ti only vol only maxdepth etc furthermore because land use history on the ranches differs ranch effects were considered in model development ranch effect variables were boolean one 1 if present and zero 0 if not if these models are applied for a specific ranch with pastures that have been described similarly to those in table 1 then one 1 should be used otherwise the ranch effect should be zero 0 all analyses were conducted in r v 2 15 3 using the libraries glmmadmb fournier et al 2012 and bbmle bolker 2014 for wetland scale analyses of mean counts abundances of animals and mean plant cover to scale from point to wetland scale mean counts of animals and mean plant cover were used and were the average of the animal abundance or plant percent cover for the measurement date respectively once the most informative models were identified from the aic analysis best models were analyzed and estimates i e coefficients and p values were interpreted the p value was used to ensure that the independent variables included in the models were meaningful in predicting the biodiversity responses model diagnostics included plots of residuals vs predicted values and quantile quantile q q plots where q q plots were used to verify data distributions omega values were computed to assess goodness of fit xu 2003 the residual variance of the full model was compared against the residual variance of a fixed intercept only null model for models where omega values could not be computed all plant models the residual variance of the full model was compared to the residual variance of the intercept only null model bolker 2014 the root mean square error for each model was calculated to evaluate the model performance 2 6 hydrologic modeling hydrologic variables e g days connected table 3 needed for predicting biodiversity responses e g fish abundance for different dss applications were estimated using daily predictions e g wetland water depth from a hydrologic model mike she mike 11 there are other models which could be used for the purpose of predicting water levels and flows but we were able to capitalize on two previous mike she mike 11 modeling studies conducted at ranch 2 shukla et al unpublished data and ranch 3 wu 2014 to evaluate the effects of wetland water retention on surface and subsurface flows at wetland and ranch scales ranch 2 monitoring started in 2008 as part of the fresp pilot pes program shukla 2012 ranch 3 monitoring started in 2003 as part of a wetland water retention project by the university of florida shukla et al 2011 shukla et al 2014 mike she is an integrated physically based model refsgaard and storm 1995 jaber and shukla 2012 capable of simulating the surface and subsurface processes including recharge and evapotranspiration it can simulate surface and subsurface water interactions to predict surface and ground water levels and flows to rivers flood plains canals and other inland water bodies jaber and shukla 2012 it is suitable for simulating the highly interactive surface water and ground water system prevailing in the everglades basin with shallow water table conductive sandy soils and highly engineered drainage system of ditches canals and pumps to achieve multiple goals of flood control land drainage and water supply mike she can be coupled with a 1 d river channel hydraulics model mike 11 to simulate flows from drainage networks containing hydraulic structures e g culvert flashboard structures pumps and gates prevalent in the everglades basin this feature of mike 11 is especially useful in accurately representing number of boards in the crb structures installed at the ranch outlet given that mike she mike 11 is a spatially explicit model appropriate cell sizes can be used to represent ponded features e g wetlands ditches of varying area the coupled model enables the quantification water retention storage wetland hydroperiod and other hydrologic signatures table 3 at wetland and ranch scales for their use by the eco hydrological models within the dss the mike she mike 11 models were developed and evaluated using topographic land use weather soil hydraulics channel geometry drainage structures and operation and surface water and ground water level data collected at ranch 2 and 3 prediction statistics for calibration and validation periods reported in shukla et al unpublished data and wu 2014 are briefly discussed here the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were used to evaluate model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a statistic that normalizes the observed and simulated data and calculates the amount of variance in simulated data compared to variance in measured data and shows how well the scatterplot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 values of nse can range from to 1 with 1 being the best possible value although the nse is widely used to assess model performance poor hydrologic models can have a high nse jain and sudheer 2008 therefore other performance indicators should also be considered clark et al 2021 percent bias pbias is especially useful since it can clearly indicate poor model performance gupta et al 1999 the pbias is a measure of how much the simulated data tends to be overestimated negative values or underestimated positive values as compared to the observed data and a value of 0 0 is the best possible value model performance at ranch 2 and 3 were based on the criteria developed by moriasi et al 2015 very good 1 nse 0 75 pbias 5 good 0 75 nse 0 65 5 pbias 10 and satisfactory 0 65 nse 0 50 10 pbias 15 the mike she mike 11 calibration period for ranch 2 was august 1 2008 to may 31 2009 and the validation period was june 1 2009 to may 31 2011 the model performance at ranch 2 was satisfactory per nse 0 59 and very good per pbias 0 71 in simulating ditch water levels shukla et al unpublished data for the validation period model performance was rated very good nse 0 82 pbias 0 35 for ranch 3 model performance was rated very good for both calibration october 1 2008 to october 31 2009 nse 0 90 pbias 0 54 and validation november 1 2009 to may 31 2011 nse 0 88 pbias 0 1 periods wu 2014 the pbias values were much lower than the minimum threshold for very good performance pbias 5 overall the model performed well in predicting the ditch water levels the main driver for the wetland water availability and used for estimating ranch scale storage 2 7 development of decision support system the decision support system dss tool was developed to integrate trade offs among biodiversity services and dis services with water storage services for selecting the pes sites as well as the level of service the dss utilizes hydrological and eco hydrological models developed using data from the pilot pes sites which participated in the fresp and one wetland water retention site fig 2 the dss was designed to help 1 choose where to implement the water storage alternatives i e prioritizing pes proposals based on biodiversity response 2 compare water management alternatives possible at a participating ranch and identify water storage alternative which maximizes the services e g increase in fish population while minimizing the biodiversity disservices e g increase in exotic vegetation cover increase in mosquito abundance and 3 identify the most desirable alternative in a case when the buyer is a coalition of stakeholders with diverse interests e g agricultural production water storage and availability and maintaining minimum maximum freshwater flows to estuaries environmental protection tourism etc by providing dss rankings for negotiations to build a consensus fig 2 an example of multi interest buyer would be the water management districts in florida whose governing boards include members from different counties representing the interests of residents of their respective regions counties and industries driving their local economies the decision support system dss developed for our study was modified from thornton et al 2005 which is a multicriteria decision analytics mcda tool that uses a spreadsheet approach the simpler spreadsheet ms excel approach was adopted to make it easy to use for the buyers sellers and other stakeholders that included ranchers farmers ngos and state agencies we modified this mcda tool by adding biodiversity eco hydrological models hydrologic water storage and other water availability predictions from mike she mike11 and economic implementation cost payment for water storage components we also added the criteria to evaluate the preferences of stakeholders for the pes program the criteria included water retention payment to ranchers sellers cost of implementation wetland plant abundance forage cover exotic plant cover fish abundance mosquito abundance amphibian abundance and macroinvertebrate abundance the stakeholders can assign importance to the criteria through simplified weights of importance table 4 weights can range from 1 to 4 where 1 is least important and 4 is most important the dss uses three techniques for weighting and ranking alternative decisions the weighted average method wam abdelrahman et al 2008 the discrete compromise programming cp method zeleny 1973 and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee brans and vincke 1985 the dss penalizes the alternative which increases the disservices e g mosquito abundance by assigning a negative weight to the specific disservices when calculating a normalized score used by the three weighing techniques these different techniques allow users to quickly assess the potential sensitivity or robustness of alternative ranking techniques given specific decision criteria values the dss framework was built based on two main assumptions 1 the eco hydrological models are applicable to all ranches and hydrologic conditions observed within the basin i e they can simulate the biodiversity response for any water storage number of boards alternative and 2 the hydrologic variables required to predict biodiversity responses are provided by the pes applicants landowners in addition to the water storage so the buyer e g state agency can utilize the dss to rank the proposals fig 2 alternatively the predictions of the biodiversity and storage can be made by the buyer the hydrologic variables can be predicted through a variety of hydrologic models chosen by the ranchers or their consultants irrespective of the method chosen to compile hydrologic parameters some monetary investment will be required from the applicants responding to a call for proposals by the buyers all applicants for the pilot fresp hired an engineering consultant that provided the topographic maps and estimates of storage details on different components of the dss linkages and their use in tradeoff analyses are presented in appendix table b 1 2 8 using decision support system the availability of the mike she mike 11 models for ranch 2 and 3 enabled us to develop a variety of water storage alternatives each modeled alternative represented a specific spillage level implemented in the field by adding boards in the crb structure seven water storage alternatives were considered at ranch 2 and six at ranch 3 a total of 13 alternatives were simulated using mike she mike 11 for demonstrating the use of the dss for selecting pes sites these 13 alternatives were assumed to represent 13 different ranches the alternatives at ranch 2 included crb structure with 0 baseline 1 2 3 4 7 and 8 boards each board was 15 24 cm high the alternatives at ranch 3 included crb structure with 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 boards due to differences in ditch e g depth and width and pasture ground elevation management characteristics the water storage alternatives number of boards at ranches 2 and 3 did not correspond to the same spillage level 2 8 1 dss use for selecting pes sites as described earlier field verified mike she mike 11 models were not available for ranch 1 and 4 to demonstrate how different services and dis services can be combined for decision making for a pes program using the dss we assumed that the 13 water storage alternatives represented 13 pes proposals or sites ranches although the 13 proposals were created by using the varying spillage levels from only two ranches ranch 2 and 3 they are likely to be representative of the hydrology and biodiversity for the ranchlands in the basin the primary reason for the 13 proposals being representative of the basin especially the northern part where most of the additional water storage is needed is its low topographic relief florida is the flattest state in the united states dobson and campbell 2014 with the everglades characterized by an extremely low slope of 3 cm per km https www floridamuseum ufl edu southflorida regions everglades topographic homogeneity has been shown to reduce variability in water availability and biodiversity jobbágy et al 1996 therefore we assume that 13 proposals created using 13 spillage levels modeled at ranch 2 and 3 are likely to be typical of most of the basin 2 8 2 selecting water storage alternative in addition to site selection the dss was also used to rank the plausible water storage alternatives at the two ranches 2 and 3 multiple spillage levels are possible at a site each spillage level referred to as the water storage alternative would lead to a different response in biodiversity indicators due to changes in hydrologic variables used by the eco hydrologic models the dss was used to rank the said alternatives for the selected site rankings were created and analyzed from two buyer perspectives biodiversity response and water storage table 4 seven alternatives were ranked for ranch 2 and six for ranch 3 it is to be expected that uncertainty in hydrologic model predictions will propagate to biodiversity response predictions and subsequently to dss based decision making the ditches at ranch outlets are hydraulically connected to the wetlands therefore the assumption here is that mike she mike 11 model performance and errors in simulating the ditch levels are similar to those for the wetland water levels the derived hydrologic signatures and the predicted biodiversity measures used within the dss to rank the sites and the water management alternatives like all models mike she model s performance is likely to vary by site in some cases errors in predicting hydrologic signatures may be considerably different than the errors in predicting the ditch water levels however for the purposes of the dss these errors were considered acceptable because the primary use of dss is ranking pes proposals and water retention alternatives and not deciding payments for the service 2 8 3 use of dss for multi party buyers typical buyers in pes programs are government agencies and in the case of multiple services such as the one presented here buyers are likely to be a coalition of different government agencies and non governmental organizations we present an example where the dss could be utilized in quantifying trade offs and making an informed decision in a situation where three agencies with varied preferences form a coalition to buy services of water storage and biodiversity enhancements 3 results and discussion 3 1 biodiversity response to water storage significant relationships were observed between specific ecological and hydrological variables for all biodiversity indicators except mosquito abundance table 5 forage increased with time inundated ti quadratically table 5 indicating that there is a threshold ti value at which cover of forage plants peaks this may be because flooding intolerant e g paspalum notatum and flooding tolerant e g panicum hemitomon forage species overlap at intermediate water availability level as ti increases forage also increases an economic benefit for rancher until a peak length of ti is reached after which forage growth starts to decline an economic disadvantage due to flooding stress and a shift to emergent macrophyte species that are poor forage for cattle this suggests that a spillage level that provides maximum forage may not necessarily be the highest spillage level exotic invasive plant cover a dis service was found to have a positive quadratic relationship with storage volume p value 0 001 table 5 indicating that increasing the wetland storage would lead to an increase in the exotic plant cover and a decrease in native plant biodiversity there are many invasive plants adapted to long hydroperiods in the everglades region wetland plant cover was positively corelated with time inundated and growing degree days table 5 this finding is consistent with other studies related to wetland plants foti et al 2012 sonnier et al 2018 there is a maximum wetland depth maxdepth at which macroinvertebrates are most abundant fish abundance decreased with longer delays between flooding periods and with later dates autumn months in the growing season table 5 similar to those observed by gatto and trexler 2019 amphibian frog abundance was shown to decrease with ti table 5 which is consistent with the well known phenomenon of rapid reproduction and tadpole development with initial flooding and the negative impacts of increased wetland connectivity dc table 3 that provides access for fish to prey on tadpoles mosquito abundance decreased with increase in fish abundance likely because fish are predators of mosquitos table 5 invertebrates and vertebrates fish macroinvertebrates amphibians and mosquitos are important food sources for species of higher trophic levels including birds and mammals and an increase in their abundance could sustain these other animals known to be abundant on the ranches swain et al 2013 this benefit was not measured in this study as the scale and number of wetlands studied were insufficient for adequate sampling but it is reasonable to assume this co benefit when biodiversity is included in the water storage pes program models for two biodiversity indicators exotic plant cover and amphibian abundance included ranch effect variables indicating that ranch management affects some of the biodiversity responses the ranches used in the development of the eco hydrological models were identified as either improved pasture semi native pasture or a mixture of the two table 1 with the land use history and addition of fertilizer to the improved pastures the wetlands in improved pastures tend to be more nutrient rich while wetlands in semi native pastures are more oligotrophic boughton et al 2019 all biodiversity indicators responded to changes in hydrology and could be predicted directly using hydrologic variables or indirectly mosquitos using ecological variables fish that were affected by hydrology these models enabled the use of biodiversity in evaluating pes proposals 3 2 decision support system depending on the storage goals for the basin or sub watershed the state s affordability criteria and willingness to pay and a rancher s tolerance of extended flooding in relation to forage production participating ranches can provide varying degrees of water storage eco hydrological models showed that variations in water storage and associated hydrological variables directly impact the biodiversity services from wetlands on the participating ranches table 5 in a review of other pes studies aiming to conserve biodiversity bullock et al 2011 suggested that instead of accounting biodiversity benefits as a service they be considered an inherent response to water management and included in designing the pes programs the dss presented here is based on the same line of thought we recommend biodiversity benefits be used to select spillage levels as well as prioritize pes sites ranches given the limited funds available for the program 3 2 1 selecting the water storage sites one of the founding principles of pes program is voluntary participation institution s paying for the service s have the right to determine the eligibility of the participants given the buyer financed nature of the program the participants sellers can accept or decline to provide the services like any other market like program pes programs also aim for maximizing cost efficiency and site selection has been shown to accomplish the same wünscher et al 2008 enhancement of good biodiversity was a non economic but valued product of the pes program we propose that it be used as a decision making factor in selecting sites for implementation however in future if biodiversity is bought by the state in lieu of financial compensation to the ranchers 1 the eco hydrological models could still be used to quantify the biodiversity services and associated trade offs and 2 the dss could be used to prioritize the participating sites solely on the basis on the level of the biodiversity service the dss was used to rank multiple sites and prioritize them from biodiversity and water storage standpoints biodiversity is one of the most prominent indicators of ecological health of a system and paying for biodiversity services has recently gained momentum herzon et al 2018 for example in the peninsular florida ecoregion state e g florida forever and federal e g everglades headwaters national wildlife refuge programs target land acquisition and easements for the protection of 88 federal and state listed species of greatest conservation need many of which are wetland dependent e g whooping crane everglades snail kite wood stork agricultural expansion is the leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide and therefore the focus needs to be on agricultural practices to maintain a biodiverse environment in theory service buyers only need to pay for what they receive under a pes scheme any additional benefit is simply an outcome of design and implementation in cases such as the payment for water storage program discussed here where the additional benefit is biodiversity a common dilemma faced by scientists and environmental managers alike is the basis for biodiversity services payment are actions enough or should the payments be based on results gibbons et al 2011 the dss takes an in between approach by designating the best possible ecological outcome as the basis for pes fund allocation the dss bundles the biodiversity services with water storage through eco hydrological models and assists in prioritizing the pes proposals based on their impact on biodiversity and importance weights assigned to various biodiversity indicators the weights are decided by the user based on their interest for example if the user is a buyer that is an agency dedicated to native wildlife protection their interests might lie in increased fish and macroinvertebrate abundance and they would assign higher weights to the said biodiversity indicators the dss enables the ranking of pes proposals and allows the environmental managers to design and implement the payment for water storage services program such that the best possible ecological outcomes are an inherent component of the system ranches in the everglades and other landscapes are a combination of uplands and drained wetlands using agricultural lands to store excess on site rain or off site public water would lead to increased wetland hydration enhanced baseflows and reduced peak surface flows to move towards restoring the hydrology of the everglades and the two linked estuaries fig 1 however it does not necessarily guarantee the re establishment of pre existing ecological biodiversity health of the system given the complex interlinked nature of hydrology and ecology and the fact that the basin still has a large network of regional canals and flood control structures essential to avoid flooding of agricultural and urban lands the current business as usual approach to the ne pes site selection is to choose a site that maximizes water storage in the basin making the best approach to rank the pes proposals based solely on the total storage offered by the landowners however such a mechanism defies the hydrological and ecological benefits of the dispersed water management approach thirteen example pes proposals sites were compared using the dss and assigned a priority ranking based on the predicted biodiversity and water storage responses the rankings calculated using the three methods wam cp and promethee were mostly in agreement two of the three methods consistently agreed for all weighting schemes wam consistently agreed with one or both of the remaining two resulting in a more robust decision for selection of sites from a biodiversity perspective desirable biodiversity indicators e g fish and wetland plant cover were assigned the highest possible weight of 4 while the undesirable indicators e g mosquito abundance were assigned the lowest possible weight of 1 table 4 all three weighting techniques utilized by the dss assigned the highest score and best rank 1 to site 11 fig 3 which coincided with a moderate increase in all biodiversity services and minimum dis services given the weighing scheme it is understandable that the option with a moderate increase in all biodiversity services would be chosen for example a site expected to provide maximum fish but minimum amphibian abundance would be ranked lower than the one that would provide a moderate increase in both jessop et al 2015 also showed that all biodiversity services do not maximize at a single level of hydrologic restoration since all desirable and undesirable biodiversity indicators were assigned equal weights of importance there was no opportunity for compensatory trade offs when selecting the most desirable site however buyers and stakeholders could assign different weights if they wished to analyze the trade offs e g increase in fish abundance while losing amphibians and come to a consensus for ranking the sites sites were not always ranked the same from the biodiversity and water storage perspectives fig 3 indicating the need for a dss to evaluate the trade offs and help stakeholders make an informed decision for example site 11 was ranked the best from the biodiversity standpoint but it was ranked only fifth most desirable from the water storage perspective among the 13 example sites fig 3 the mike she mike 11 model results showed that site 8 ranked the best would lead to an 84 reduction in surface flows compared to the baseline followed by site 9 69 which was ranked second most desirable from water storage standpoint if the maximum weight i e 4 is assigned to water storage the ranking simply follows the order of surface outflow reduction values although desirable using biodiversity for ranking is inherently complex since biodiversity is a combination of multiple ecologic variables site 8 provided maximum increase in fish abundance and wetland plant cover however it was ranked second to site 11 which was the most desirable because it provided higher than average increase in all desirable biodiversity indicators and the same level of increase in undesirable indicators as site 8 with all biodiversity indicators being assigned equal weights site 8 was a less favorable choice from the biodiversity standpoint if fish abundance and wetland plant cover were the only indicators chosen to quantify biodiversity response site 8 would have been ranked the best if water storage were the only criteria for awarding pes contracts biodiversity enhancement would not be a guaranteed service essentially buyers may have to settle for a lower amount of targeted service water storage to maximize biodiversity ecosystem service trade offs have been suggested as an inevitable outcome when targeting more than one service through a program swain et al 2013 goldstein et al 2012 although sites were compared assuming equal importance would be given to all biodiversity indicators in a case where there are multi party buyers with different interest preference e g producers state environmental agencies and or ngos urban developers tourism the weights can be assigned accordingly which is another use of the dss discussed in section 3 2 3 3 2 2 selecting the level of service the first use of the dss is to rank pes proposals where the sellers landowner rancher have already quantified the water storage they intend to offer i e their preferred spillage level at the discharge structures however it is possible that there exists a water storage alternative different from that proposed by the seller which the buyer wants because it can result in a better biodiversity response compared to what the seller is offering the dss could also be utilized to achieve the most desirable water storage level from biodiversity standpoint for each eligible participating site if the most desirable water storage level from a biodiversity perspective is different from proposed it would create an opportunity for negotiation a compensatory trade off between financial incentive and water storage eligibility versus the desirability of participants in cases where multiple environmental services are bundled has been discussed banerjee et al 2013 zanella et al 2014 for example banerjee et al 2013 discussed bundling floodplain restoration with additional services like habitat restoration in our case all ranches with varied spillage levels would be eligible to participate in the pes program however the level of biodiversity services provided will be a factor in selecting the proposals the dss would fulfill the need of ranking in order of desirability the available water storage spillage alternatives based on trade offs among water storage and biodiversity provisioning thus providing the buyer a holistic assessment of alternatives essential for decision making after the dss was used to select sites the next step was to select the most desirable water storage service level by ranking a range of water storage spillage alternatives at each site as an example consider that ranch 2 has been selected based on biodiversity response using the dss there are seven different water storage alternatives plausible at ranch 2 0 baseline 1 2 3 4 7 and 8 boards table 6 the biodiversity dss scores after assigning the highest weight 4 to all biodiversity service indicators and the lowest weight 1 to all biodiversity dis service indicators table 4 ranged between 0 700 and 1 379 table 6 we have included two ranks based on whether or not the dis services are considered table 6 the dis services are ignored by most pes programs boughton et al 2019 results showed that there was little difference in the dss rankings when excluding the dis services from the analyses indicating that mosquito abundance and exotic plant cover had limited effect on the score and therefore ranking this was to be expected because mosquito abundance did not correlate with any hydrologic variable therefore any difference in the rankings with and without accounting for dis services were mainly due to eliminating exotic plant cover and changes in other services an example of how dss can facilitate negotiations between buyers and sellers follows assume that the seller landowner is offering alternative 6 7 boards biodiversity focus dss score 0 738 water storage focus dss score 0 508 however alternative 7 8 boards was ranked highest from both biodiversity response and water storage perspectives biodiversity focus dss score 1 379 water storage focus dss score 0 855 the hydrological model predicted a considerable difference in water storage service between alternatives 6 and 7 alternative 7 increased the storage by 70 in contrast to alternative 6 which only provided 17 increase in storage compared to baseline no structure at the ranch outlet the dss also illustrates the financial implications for the buyer and the seller as well as outcomes for the participating ranches in the water storage pes the payments ranged between 98 and 158 per acre ft of water stored https fl audubon org news sfwmd approves eight water storage projects northern everglades the average payment was 134 per acre ft 16 5 ha m which was used in the dss the annual financial incentive for the seller landowner would be 31 higher in the case of alternative 7 8 505 year compared to alternative 6 5 851 year from a 476 ha site in such cases where there is a disagreement between the water storage alternative offered by the seller and the most desirable one from biodiversity or water storage standpoint which the buyer wants a negotiation between the seller and the buyer to come to a mutually agreeable solution will be required one solution can be that the buyer absorbs the transaction costs to implement the pes in lieu of the seller implementing alternative 7 which will result in increased economic losses due to flooding of additional pasture area transaction costs commonly comprise of negotiation monitoring and enforcement costs alston et al 2013 for example if the buyer state could absorb the cost of engineering hydrologic consultants whom the seller hired to provide storage estimates to prepare the pes application to the buyer state then the seller might be more amenable to implementing the desired board height alternative 7 furthermore the cost of data collection and field verification of complex hydrologic models such as mike she mike 11 are high and sharing or absorbing a part or whole of the expense by the state could be beneficial for the seller alternatively the unit price of water storage service could be negotiated based on the level of biodiversity services a site which provides additional biodiversity services may get a higher price for the water storage compared to a site which provides the same water storage but lower biodiversity service given the sandy soils with a hydraulic conductivity of up to 216 cm per hour obreza and collins 2008 and shallow water table environment in south florida the term water retention storage needs to be used with caution wu 2014 shukla et al 2015 a considerable part of surface water retained due to discharge control structures such as crb structures in our study can leave the system through subsurface pathways wu 2014 shukla et al 2015 shukla et al unpublished data therefore increase in spillage level number of boards at the outlet structure does not always translate to increase in water retention on the ranch holding more water on the ranch leads to a change in hydraulic gradient leading to surface water leaving the ranch through subsurface pathways outside of the ranch for example the mike she mike 11 model predicted negligible change in storage when the number of boards was raised from 1 alternative 2 to 4 alternative 5 at ranch 2 the non linear relationship between number of boards and surface storage indicated that increase in board height does not always result in increased storage and was demonstrated when the dss ranked alternative 4 3 boards dss score 0 704 table 6 marginally higher than alternative 5 4 boards dss score 0 702 table 6 when weights were assigned from the perspective of increasing water storage and decreasing implementation cost table 4 results from the dss can be used to facilitate negotiations among buyers and sellers we present another example from ranch 3 table 7 six water storage alternatives boards 1 through 6 were considered for selecting the most desirable storage level alternative 6 6 boards was ranked the highest from the biodiversity response perspective table 7 since it led to maximum fish amphibian and wetland plant abundance the said biodiversity service response came at the cost of the lowest abundance of macroinvertebrates and an increased loss in forage the latter is undesirable for the seller because the rancher has to buy additional cattle feed to compensate for the loss of forage or reduce cattle stocking density these scenarios will require negotiation between the seller landowner rancher and the buyer for example the buyer may agree to absorb the cost of forage loss for the seller by increasing the payment for water storage services alternative 6 was also ranked the highest from the water storage standpoint table 7 in this example a buyer whose interest lies in biodiversity enhancement or a buyer whose interest is only water storage can agree to implement alternative 6 however this may not always occur and in most cases the buyers of environmental services may be a coalition of an array of stakeholders with varied interests thompson and friess 2019 and trade offs are often a necessity in negotiating agreements we explain in the following section the use of the dss in quantifying the trade offs and coming to a consensus about site selection and service provision levels when multiple buyers with different preferences are involved 3 2 3 decision making for multi party buyers environmental governance is a result of convergence of stakeholders from different backgrounds often when acquiring environmental services different constituents of environmental governance collaborate the first step to make such inter organizational collaborations successful is for the stakeholders to reach a consensus on which water storage alternative to buy the dss can help in such situations by incorporating the stakeholder preferences when ranking the available alternatives our dss would provide a choice to all involved stakeholders to prioritize their preferences to put this application into perspective we provide a mock scenario where the buyer is a coalition of three environmental agencies a b and c with focus on water e g water management districts in fl vegetation and wildlife management respectively agency a s objective would be to maximize water storage the expenditure on exotic vegetation management in florida ranges between 97 million and 127 million per year therefore agency b s interest would be to maximize native vegetation while minimizing exotics exotic animal population in the everglades basin is a growing concern sfwmd 2021c it follows that agency c s aim would be to maximize native fauna the three stakeholders would assign different weights to the dss parameters i e the biodiversity indicators water storage payment and cost of implementation depending on their relative importance to them the dss would enable the analyses of synergies and trade offs thereby aiding in reaching a consensus among buying coalition members with different interests which can otherwise be in conflict with each other the onus would ultimately rest with the agencies to decide the acceptable solution but the dss would facilitate the discussion by providing metrics necessary to evaluate each water management alternative 4 conclusion the pes proponents given the complexity in its quantification cautiously regard biodiversity as a standalone ecosystem service this is especially true in our study where biodiversity was an unaccounted consequence of increasing water storage on private ranchlands upland wetland systems subsequently resulting in wetland hydration and changes in desirable and undesirable biodiversity indicators instead of considering biodiversity as a direct service from ranchlands we propose it to be used as a decision making criterion for prioritizing pes sites and identifying optimum level of hydration eco hydrological models were developed to quantify the effects of water storage on biodiversity a dss utilizing the said models with a user specified weighing scheme was developed to analyze the trade offs between water storage and biodiversity indicators for a variety of water storage alternatives contrary to the common belief results showed that increase in wetland hydration level does not necessarily result in desirable biodiversity changes undesirable biodiversity indicators e g exotic plants also increase with enhanced water storage therefore the trade offs between storage and desirable and undesirable biodiversity indicators need to be quantified to make an informed decision most pes programs are managed by layers of governmental and environmentally focused non profit institutions one of the contributions of our study was to develop a dss tool which could be utilized by stakeholders with a spectrum of preferences water flora fauna and evaluate how their interests would be impacted as the proclivities of others in the coalition change above all the dss would provide a platform for all involved parties sellers and buyers alike to negotiate based on field verified model predictions of storage and biodiversity indicators combining hydrology and biodiversity for a pes is challenging because of inherent uncertainties and requires collaboration amongst physical biological and social scientists and other stakeholders the proposed dss is only the first step in defining hydro ecological linkages quantifying how one impacts the other and how multiple services and dis services can be combined for a real world pes program the possibilities to expand the use of the dss are many for example depending on the proximity to critical species habitat new criteria could be added and assigned different weights with an emphasis on rural prosperity another factor that could be added is the socioeconomic equity small ranches e g 500 acres could be given a higher weight to ensure their inclusion among the selected sites other factors could be proximity to critical groundwater recharge zones within the basin given the increased groundwater recharge benefit of water retention and increased carbon sequestration due to wetland hydration furthermore if biodiversity is approved as a standalone ecosystem service with willing buyers the dss could be utilized to select desirable participants based on the existing level of water storage on their ranchlands with simultaneous emphasis on mitigating and adapting to climate change designing future pes programs are likely to become more complex due to the emerging need to consider more services and trade offs although our study considers only a small subset of ecosystem services it does provide a preview of how complex future pes designs are going

3361,hydrological changes can lead to biodiversity responses that are complex and challenging to quantify we present a framework that uses biodiversity as a criterion to address where to buy and how much to buy in a payment for environmental services pes program focused on water storage service in the everglades basin usa the pes program was designed to pay for added water storage on private cattle ranchlands by raising the spillage level in drainage control structures to reduce surface flows we predicted that increased hydration of previously drained wetlands would benefit biodiversity a previously unquantified but desirable co benefit of the original program and that a pes program offering bundled services e g storage and biodiversity can better achieve restoration goals we quantified desirable biodiversity services abundance of native flora and fauna such as cover of wetland and forage plants and abundance of fishes amphibians and macroinvertebrates dis services e g abundance of invasive plants and mosquitos and hydrologic signatures e g wetland water depth inundation area and duration at four ranches to develop eco hydrological relationships models between hydrological changes and biodiversity responses next a hydrologic model mike she mike 11 was used to predict surface and subsurface water levels and flows and resulting wetland hydrologic signatures for 13 water storage alternatives on the ranches which were used as example pes proposals a decision support system dss was developed to integrate i storage predicted by the hydrologic model ii biodiversity responses predicted by eco hydrologic models and iii a user defined preference scheme to assign importance weights to storage biodiversity and implementation cost the dss calculated a cumulative score for ranking pes proposals by considering desirable services and dis services stakeholders can decide on their preferred level of services e g buyer s may settle for less storage if there is a gain in desirable biodiversity the dss can identify trade offs among services helping stakeholders negotiate keywords decision support system payment for environmental services ecological response wetland hydration water management eco hydrological models 1 introduction agricultural lands have traditionally been valued for food fiber and fuel production clément et al 2017 pastor et al 2019 but their role in regulating and sustaining environmental services and enhancing biodiversity has also been receiving increased attention norris 2008 gonthier et al 2014 huntsinger and oviedo 2014 page and bellotti 2015 boughton et al 2019 agricultural lands including ranches often contain wetlands which are considered biodiversity hotspots and a hub of environmental services swain et al 2013 however loss of these wetlands to support agricultural intensification has also received widespread attention thiere et al 2009 almost 35 of wetlands have been lost between 1970 and 2015 worldwide wwf 2018 loss of wetlands has significantly impacted freshwater biodiversity kingsford et al 2016 arntzen et al 2017 and globally 25 of wetland dependent plant and animal species are at risk of extinction ramsar convention on wetlands 2018 draining wetlands for agricultural and urban development has led to degradation of ecosystems in watersheds such as the everglades nas 2021 chesapeake bay steven and lowrance 2011 mississippi river gleason et al 2011 and china s yangtze river an and verhoeven 2019 the payment for environmental services pes concept is increasingly becoming a sought after ecosystem restoration approach yin and zhao 2012 huang et al 2018 ruggiero et al 2019 and is applicable to wetland restoration projects the philosophy of pes programs is that in certain situations providing financial incentive is more effective than implementing a regulatory measure zanella et al 2014 promoted as a market like approach pes programs are usually conceptualized with a sense of simplicity however implementing them is complicated zanella et al 2014 the foundation of pes programs is their voluntary nature such that a seller willingly sells a well defined service to a buyer wünder 2005 although a core principle of the pes theory there are exceptions to the voluntary participation especially when intermediary parties between the seller and buyers are involved vatn 2010 for our study we consider the state public as the buyer and the voluntary nature of the pes programs holds true the willingness to participate provides freedom to the sellers however it also puts them all in one pool making it harder to compare cost efficiency and service provision levels jack and jayachandran 2019 while quantity of service provision is the primary criterion for awarding pes contracts the synergies and trade offs among other associated services and the potential risk of dis services because of interactions among physical and ecological systems receives little to no attention wünscher et al 2008 reasons for this lack of attention mostly stems from the difficulty in quantifying the trade offs and synergies changes in hydrologic patterns are known to impact wetland ecological processes and biodiversity konar et al 2013 although hydration of drained wetlands may lead to enhanced wetland habitat and desirable biodiversity recent studies have also linked alterations in hydrologic conditions and patterns to increases in invasive species stokes et al 2010 catford et al 2011 nielsen et al 2013 the conflict between positive and negative impacts of wetland hydration on biodiversity needs to be evaluated by simultaneous consideration of services and dis services the extent of impacts positive and negative may change from site to site for the same or different levels of hydrologic changes depending on multiple factors including land use and management for example boughton et al 2019 showed that ranch management practices in florida can affect biodiversity responses to hydrological changes therefore the optimum level of hydration that supports native flora and fauna while minimizing invasive species may differ by location the challenge for pes in wetland settings targeting biodiversity is that the ecological interactions are complex and can be difficult to generalize especially as a response to something as complex as changing water storage on landscape that changes water availability including area volume and hydroperiod on wetlands it has been proposed that pes accounting should only consider the final service product in favor of greater traceability of the program impact brauman et al 2007 it is also suggested that instead of considering pes programs purely for their paid service and economic benefits they be designed with consideration of how biodiversity responds to management actions bullock et al 2011 the everglades is a globally important watershed and public interest in hydrological restoration makes it an appropriate ecosystem in which the role of pes can be evaluated the everglades was once and to an extent still is a vast network of wetlands and rivers supporting rich subtropical vegetation and wildlife lemaire and sisto 2012 dramatic alteration of landscape drainage to improve flood management urban water supply and agricultural production has led to the decline of the everglades ecosystem historically the kissimmee river lake okeechobee and everglades constituted the greater everglades ecosystem which accounts for most of the sub tropical south florida area fig 1 pre 1920s the kissimmee river formed a significant proportion of the headwaters of the greater everglades system feeding lake okeechobee fig 1 mcvoy et al 2011 steinman and rosen 2000 in addition to flowing south through sheet flow the lake water also moved slowly through the caloosahatchee river and downstream through other small rivers to coastal estuaries and eventually to the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean mcvoy et al 2011 development of extensive ditch networks to drain the watershed began in the 1880s fig 1 which resulted in fast movement of unnaturally high flows and nutrient loads to the lake rivers estuaries and the southern everglades steinman and rosen 2000 graham et al 2015 water flowing into lake okeechobee from the north fig 1 accounts for 92 of the total inflow to the lake current estimates are that storage of 750 000 acre feet of water is required north of the lake to significantly reduce excessive discharges from the lake to the estuarine systems and the everglades sfwmd 2021a while several state funded projects including reservoirs and aquifer storage recovery asr have been planned or started they are not enough to meet the water storage goals hence there is a great deal of interest in developing pes solutions for the watershed to complement other initiatives in 2005 a coalition of state agencies environmental organizations researchers and private landowners developed and implemented a pes program known as the florida ranchland environmental services program fresp in the northern everglades basin bohlen et al 2009 the idea of fresp was to hold water on private ranchlands by reducing surface flows from them lynch and shabman 2011 the rationale behind fresp was to obtain some of the needed storage by dispersing it throughout the northern everglades basin complementing other water storage systems such as reservoirs and constructed treatment wetlands under fresp ranchers installed discharge control structures commonly known as culverts with riser boards crb and raised the spillage level by adding boards the seller of services was the rancher and the buyer was the state of florida through the south florida water management district sfwmd that is responsible for managing and protecting water resources in the everglades basin the fresp first of its kind pes implemented within the united states was a pilot program that laid the foundation for the basin wide launch of the northern everglades payment for environmental services ne pes program bohlen et al 2009 the ne pes now has 15 sites and provides an estimated 102 512 acre feet of water storage annually sfwmd 2021b under the ne pes the term water retention better describes the storage service since the surface water that is retained eventually leaves the ranch through subsurface flow and evapotranspiration the term water retention has been simplified to a more generic term of water storage for communicating to general public and other stakeholders and is used here onwards increasing the spillage level on ranch lands was expected to alter the hydrological linkages between uplands and wetlands which in turn affects vegetation and wildlife diversity shabman et al 2013 in the case of the ne pes trade offs and synergies exist between storage level and desirable and undesirable biodiversity boughton et al 2019 there is a difference of opinion among researchers regarding biodiversity s status as an ecosystem service haines young and potschin young 2010 mace et al 2012 duncan et al 2015 the disagreement stems from a variety of reasons primary reason being the complexity in biodiversity valuation due to a host of parameters and its trans disciplinary nature mace et al 2012 however we believe that the status of biodiversity as a service should be program specific as suggested by mace et al 2012 biodiversity can be considered as a regulator of ecosystem functions e g carbon sequestration standalone ecosystem service e g restoration of native flora and fauna or a valued product e g aesthetically pleasing view facilitating tourism although biodiversity enhancement was an expected impact of reducing ranch scale drainage which in turn increased the wetland hydration under the payment for water storage program it was recognized as difficult to quantify there was no provision to include biodiversity as a factor either for deciding where to implement a pes contract or how much to pay for it more importantly there was no willing buyer e g conservation stakeholder group such as an ngo or a federal state agency for enhanced biodiversity even if there were willing buyers double dipping would be a legitimate concern double dipping i e selling environmental benefits from a pes program in multiple markets is typically not allowed woodward 2011 given these concerns we decided at a later stage that biodiversity be considered a non economic but valued product of the program and relationships between hydrological and ecological changes be developed to quantify biodiversity response to increase in water storage although biodiversity enhancement is not a benefit for which there is a buyer we argue and demonstrate that these relationships should be the drivers of decisions about where to implement site selection projects and how much to store spillage level furthermore multiple stakeholder preferences play a key role in implementation of pes programs in case of the ne pes the diversity of stakeholders e g agricultural producers local government environmental agencies and ngos in the coalition is significant and their preferences for service valuation is likely to vary this makes the decision making process where biodiversity is also a factor more challenging from a policy standpoint the correlation between water storage and biodiversity enhancement is not necessarily linear which is why selecting sites solely based on amount or unit price of storage may not work for a multi service pes program targeting both water storage and biodiversity enhancement therefore a tool to quantify trade offs between storage and various biodiversity indicators on the basis of user preference is needed our overarching goal was to develop an approach that is a result of the interplay between physical water storage ecological biodiversity agricultural food production and social stakeholder preference components that articulates the synergies and trade offs for all the steps toward this goal included development of models to mathematically quantify the relationships between the said components and a decision support system dss tool to integrate them with stakeholder preference to identify desirable sites among a pool of eligible pes applicants and optimum water storage levels biodiversity enhancement as a result of water storage under the pes scheme is considered a non economic but valued product in this study however if there were willing buyers for it biodiversity could be considered a focal ecosystem service and the mathematical models could be used to quantify the service provisioning our specific objectives are to 1 refine eco hydrological relationships drawn from our earlier work on four ranchlands in the everglades basin by boughton et al 2019 2 develop eco hydrological models for predicting biodiversity response to changes in water storage 3 develop a dss that combines predictions from eco hydrological and hydrologic models with user defined weighting schemes representing their preference for offered ecosystem services 4 use the dss to assist in ranking sites interested in participating in the pes program as well as deciding the level of water storage service that would maximize the desirable and reduce the undesirable biodiversity response and 5 identify the actors and their preferences when selecting pes projects and demonstrate how trade offs can be negotiated given the assimilation of these proclivities in the dss tool 2 methods 2 1 study sites and site selection four ranches ranch 1 through 4 in the everglades basin were selected for ecological measurements to evaluate the effects of changes in ranch scale water storage on biodiversity of wetlands embedded within ranchlands and develop eco hydrologic models for predicting the biodiversity responses fig 1 table 1 site selection was based on participation in the fresp pilot pes program availability of hydrologic data landowners willingness and or representativeness ranch 1 2 and 4 participated in the ne pes program while ranch 3 was the study site for another similar ranchland water storage research project shukla et al 2011 shukla et al 2014 goswami and shukla 2015 wu et al 2016 land use land management wetland biodiversity and hydrology of the four ranches selected for the study represent typical ranchlands within the northern everglades basin each is a representative cow calf ranching operations maintaining a permanent herd of breeding cows to raise calves for transfer to stocker grass and feedlots and eventual market land use at the four ranches comprised of semi native pastures and improved pastures improved pastures receive regular inputs of fertilizers and amendments e g lime and have higher density of ditches and swales to facilitate both drainage as well as irrigation sub irrigation semi native pastures represent a lower intensity grazing operation compared to improved pastures improved pastures also involve establishment of agronomic forage grasses and have higher cattle stocking density as compared to semi native pastures which makes them a more intensive production system with a subtropical climate the average rainfall for the basin is 1362 mm year average minimum temperature of the region is 17 c 62 f and the average maximum temperature is 29 c 84 f the dominant soil type at the four ranches was spodosol sandy soils with nearly level topography shallow water table and poor drainage the outflow locations at all ranches were equipped with crb structures that enabled the changes in the spillage level at the outlet to reduce surface outflow volume and rate and increase the surface and subsurface storage ecological and hydrologic data were collected at 15 wetlands table 1 on the four ranches these wetlands varied in area and hydrologic conditions table 1 selecting different types of ranches as well as wetlands allowed us to develop generic eco hydrological models that are representative of the northern everglades basin the 15 wetlands ranged from 0 24 31 ha in size and were previously drained through intense ditch networks for maximizing pasture area 2 2 selection and categorization of biodiversity and agricultural production indicators biodiversity response indicators were chosen based on their ease of measurement relevant for the scale of measurement expected response to changes in wetland hydrology significance to maintaining ranch operations under extended hydroperiods and significance for other higher trophic level organisms e g mosquito larvae and fish and fish and macroinvertebrates attracting wading birds as well as ability to develop empirical relationships that can be used within the dss specific biodiversity indicators included percent cover of native wetland plants and exotic plants as well as abundance of fish amphibians aquatic macroinvertebrates and mosquitos table 2 the percent cover of planted forages was used as an indicator of the ne pes project s impact on agricultural production the wetland plant indicator included emergent macrophytes e g sagittaria graminea sagittaria lancifolia sagittaria latifolia pontedaria cordata juncus effusus thalia geniculata the exotic plant indicator group included non native plants e g ludwigia peruviana the forage indicator group included all forage species planted or wetland e g panicum hemitomon grasses known to be palatable to cattle the animal responses were grouped into fish amphibians macroinvertebrates and mosquitos a full list of plant and animal species are presented in the appendix table a 1 detailed methods for ecological data collection and analyses are provided in boughton et al 2019 2 3 ecologic and hydrologic data collection for eco hydrological modeling wetlands were sampled multiple times 1 9 median 6 per wet season june october for measuring hydrologic surface water elevation and biodiversity indicators during the wet season for two years 2010 2011 to account for seasonal variation from late fall through the spring months november april the region typically has cooler temperatures receiving only 30 408 mm of the total annual rainfall this results in drought like conditions shallow wetlands dry out and ecological activity slows the summer and early fall months may october are typically warmer with most of the rainfall occurring in this time 70 953 mm resulting in hydrated and ecologically active wetlands june through mid november is hurricane season in the region which can result in flooded conditions the monitoring period included periods of prolonged drought and flooding thus making the eco hydrological models appropriate for variety of weather and hydrologic conditions specific hydrologic variables were either measured or derived from measured data are presented in table 3 2 3 1 topography the digital elevation models dems for ranch 1 and ranch 4 were developed using the topographic data collected during a ground survey using a trimble s6 trimble westminster co usa the lidar data collected by the national center for airborne laser mapping at university of florida were used to develop dems for ranch 2 and 3 guzha and shukla 2012 shukla et al 2011 these dems were used for estimating hydrologic variables e g inundation area and time inundated and calibration and validation of hydrologic models the vertical accuracy of topographic data was 10 20 cm 2 3 2 surface and groundwater levels manual water depth measurements were collected in the wetlands between 2010 and 2012 depth of water in the wetland was measured using a metric ruler at each sampling location at the time of ecologic sampling the sampling locations were randomly selected and were recorded using a trimble geoxt gps trimble westminster co usa maximum wetland depth was determined for each sampling date by comparing all depth measurements collected during a particular day in addition to the event based manual measurements 15 minute groundwater surface water levels were measured using pressure transducers during the 2010 2012 period higher frequency water elevation above mean sea level data were used to calibrate and validate the hydrologic model as well as estimate the hydrologic connectivity between upland and wetland areas for ranches 2 and 3 discussed in section 2 4 below 2 4 wetland inundation volume and hydrologic continuum the hydrologic variables used in the study were chosen based on available literature and discussion between co authors hydrologists and ecologists using the measured wetland water depth and groundwater elevations other hydrological parameters e g days inundated wetland water volume needed for the eco hydrologic models were derived see details in table 3 2 5 development of eco hydrological models development of eco hydrological models is an extension of ranch specific relationships developed by boughton et al 2019 which identified the synergies and trade offs among water storage and biodiversity services the ecologic variables biodiversity indicators in our study were regrouped from the standpoint of using biodiversity for inclusion in the dss for stakeholders designing pes programs and or selecting pes sites and a specific water storage service level spillage level within the crb we developed mathematical functions based on the eco hydrological relationships as they related to the new groupings essential for developing the dss the most informative mathematical models and variables were identified based on akaike s information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2001 the aic identifies the best model from a set of possible models by assessing how well each explains the variation in the data while penalizing for model complexity generalized linear mixed effects abundances were used because wetlands were random effects across the landscape and within ranches meaning the wetlands were considered a sample from a population of wetlands negative binomial gaussian or zero inflated negative binomial distributions were used where applicable potential models included additive and interactive effects though interactions were included only if it was expected that they were important in all sets of models a null model was compared that included an intercept term only e g amphibian 1 and univariate models which contained each independent hydrologic variable only e g only ti only vol only maxdepth etc furthermore because land use history on the ranches differs ranch effects were considered in model development ranch effect variables were boolean one 1 if present and zero 0 if not if these models are applied for a specific ranch with pastures that have been described similarly to those in table 1 then one 1 should be used otherwise the ranch effect should be zero 0 all analyses were conducted in r v 2 15 3 using the libraries glmmadmb fournier et al 2012 and bbmle bolker 2014 for wetland scale analyses of mean counts abundances of animals and mean plant cover to scale from point to wetland scale mean counts of animals and mean plant cover were used and were the average of the animal abundance or plant percent cover for the measurement date respectively once the most informative models were identified from the aic analysis best models were analyzed and estimates i e coefficients and p values were interpreted the p value was used to ensure that the independent variables included in the models were meaningful in predicting the biodiversity responses model diagnostics included plots of residuals vs predicted values and quantile quantile q q plots where q q plots were used to verify data distributions omega values were computed to assess goodness of fit xu 2003 the residual variance of the full model was compared against the residual variance of a fixed intercept only null model for models where omega values could not be computed all plant models the residual variance of the full model was compared to the residual variance of the intercept only null model bolker 2014 the root mean square error for each model was calculated to evaluate the model performance 2 6 hydrologic modeling hydrologic variables e g days connected table 3 needed for predicting biodiversity responses e g fish abundance for different dss applications were estimated using daily predictions e g wetland water depth from a hydrologic model mike she mike 11 there are other models which could be used for the purpose of predicting water levels and flows but we were able to capitalize on two previous mike she mike 11 modeling studies conducted at ranch 2 shukla et al unpublished data and ranch 3 wu 2014 to evaluate the effects of wetland water retention on surface and subsurface flows at wetland and ranch scales ranch 2 monitoring started in 2008 as part of the fresp pilot pes program shukla 2012 ranch 3 monitoring started in 2003 as part of a wetland water retention project by the university of florida shukla et al 2011 shukla et al 2014 mike she is an integrated physically based model refsgaard and storm 1995 jaber and shukla 2012 capable of simulating the surface and subsurface processes including recharge and evapotranspiration it can simulate surface and subsurface water interactions to predict surface and ground water levels and flows to rivers flood plains canals and other inland water bodies jaber and shukla 2012 it is suitable for simulating the highly interactive surface water and ground water system prevailing in the everglades basin with shallow water table conductive sandy soils and highly engineered drainage system of ditches canals and pumps to achieve multiple goals of flood control land drainage and water supply mike she can be coupled with a 1 d river channel hydraulics model mike 11 to simulate flows from drainage networks containing hydraulic structures e g culvert flashboard structures pumps and gates prevalent in the everglades basin this feature of mike 11 is especially useful in accurately representing number of boards in the crb structures installed at the ranch outlet given that mike she mike 11 is a spatially explicit model appropriate cell sizes can be used to represent ponded features e g wetlands ditches of varying area the coupled model enables the quantification water retention storage wetland hydroperiod and other hydrologic signatures table 3 at wetland and ranch scales for their use by the eco hydrological models within the dss the mike she mike 11 models were developed and evaluated using topographic land use weather soil hydraulics channel geometry drainage structures and operation and surface water and ground water level data collected at ranch 2 and 3 prediction statistics for calibration and validation periods reported in shukla et al unpublished data and wu 2014 are briefly discussed here the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were used to evaluate model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a statistic that normalizes the observed and simulated data and calculates the amount of variance in simulated data compared to variance in measured data and shows how well the scatterplot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 values of nse can range from to 1 with 1 being the best possible value although the nse is widely used to assess model performance poor hydrologic models can have a high nse jain and sudheer 2008 therefore other performance indicators should also be considered clark et al 2021 percent bias pbias is especially useful since it can clearly indicate poor model performance gupta et al 1999 the pbias is a measure of how much the simulated data tends to be overestimated negative values or underestimated positive values as compared to the observed data and a value of 0 0 is the best possible value model performance at ranch 2 and 3 were based on the criteria developed by moriasi et al 2015 very good 1 nse 0 75 pbias 5 good 0 75 nse 0 65 5 pbias 10 and satisfactory 0 65 nse 0 50 10 pbias 15 the mike she mike 11 calibration period for ranch 2 was august 1 2008 to may 31 2009 and the validation period was june 1 2009 to may 31 2011 the model performance at ranch 2 was satisfactory per nse 0 59 and very good per pbias 0 71 in simulating ditch water levels shukla et al unpublished data for the validation period model performance was rated very good nse 0 82 pbias 0 35 for ranch 3 model performance was rated very good for both calibration october 1 2008 to october 31 2009 nse 0 90 pbias 0 54 and validation november 1 2009 to may 31 2011 nse 0 88 pbias 0 1 periods wu 2014 the pbias values were much lower than the minimum threshold for very good performance pbias 5 overall the model performed well in predicting the ditch water levels the main driver for the wetland water availability and used for estimating ranch scale storage 2 7 development of decision support system the decision support system dss tool was developed to integrate trade offs among biodiversity services and dis services with water storage services for selecting the pes sites as well as the level of service the dss utilizes hydrological and eco hydrological models developed using data from the pilot pes sites which participated in the fresp and one wetland water retention site fig 2 the dss was designed to help 1 choose where to implement the water storage alternatives i e prioritizing pes proposals based on biodiversity response 2 compare water management alternatives possible at a participating ranch and identify water storage alternative which maximizes the services e g increase in fish population while minimizing the biodiversity disservices e g increase in exotic vegetation cover increase in mosquito abundance and 3 identify the most desirable alternative in a case when the buyer is a coalition of stakeholders with diverse interests e g agricultural production water storage and availability and maintaining minimum maximum freshwater flows to estuaries environmental protection tourism etc by providing dss rankings for negotiations to build a consensus fig 2 an example of multi interest buyer would be the water management districts in florida whose governing boards include members from different counties representing the interests of residents of their respective regions counties and industries driving their local economies the decision support system dss developed for our study was modified from thornton et al 2005 which is a multicriteria decision analytics mcda tool that uses a spreadsheet approach the simpler spreadsheet ms excel approach was adopted to make it easy to use for the buyers sellers and other stakeholders that included ranchers farmers ngos and state agencies we modified this mcda tool by adding biodiversity eco hydrological models hydrologic water storage and other water availability predictions from mike she mike11 and economic implementation cost payment for water storage components we also added the criteria to evaluate the preferences of stakeholders for the pes program the criteria included water retention payment to ranchers sellers cost of implementation wetland plant abundance forage cover exotic plant cover fish abundance mosquito abundance amphibian abundance and macroinvertebrate abundance the stakeholders can assign importance to the criteria through simplified weights of importance table 4 weights can range from 1 to 4 where 1 is least important and 4 is most important the dss uses three techniques for weighting and ranking alternative decisions the weighted average method wam abdelrahman et al 2008 the discrete compromise programming cp method zeleny 1973 and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee brans and vincke 1985 the dss penalizes the alternative which increases the disservices e g mosquito abundance by assigning a negative weight to the specific disservices when calculating a normalized score used by the three weighing techniques these different techniques allow users to quickly assess the potential sensitivity or robustness of alternative ranking techniques given specific decision criteria values the dss framework was built based on two main assumptions 1 the eco hydrological models are applicable to all ranches and hydrologic conditions observed within the basin i e they can simulate the biodiversity response for any water storage number of boards alternative and 2 the hydrologic variables required to predict biodiversity responses are provided by the pes applicants landowners in addition to the water storage so the buyer e g state agency can utilize the dss to rank the proposals fig 2 alternatively the predictions of the biodiversity and storage can be made by the buyer the hydrologic variables can be predicted through a variety of hydrologic models chosen by the ranchers or their consultants irrespective of the method chosen to compile hydrologic parameters some monetary investment will be required from the applicants responding to a call for proposals by the buyers all applicants for the pilot fresp hired an engineering consultant that provided the topographic maps and estimates of storage details on different components of the dss linkages and their use in tradeoff analyses are presented in appendix table b 1 2 8 using decision support system the availability of the mike she mike 11 models for ranch 2 and 3 enabled us to develop a variety of water storage alternatives each modeled alternative represented a specific spillage level implemented in the field by adding boards in the crb structure seven water storage alternatives were considered at ranch 2 and six at ranch 3 a total of 13 alternatives were simulated using mike she mike 11 for demonstrating the use of the dss for selecting pes sites these 13 alternatives were assumed to represent 13 different ranches the alternatives at ranch 2 included crb structure with 0 baseline 1 2 3 4 7 and 8 boards each board was 15 24 cm high the alternatives at ranch 3 included crb structure with 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 boards due to differences in ditch e g depth and width and pasture ground elevation management characteristics the water storage alternatives number of boards at ranches 2 and 3 did not correspond to the same spillage level 2 8 1 dss use for selecting pes sites as described earlier field verified mike she mike 11 models were not available for ranch 1 and 4 to demonstrate how different services and dis services can be combined for decision making for a pes program using the dss we assumed that the 13 water storage alternatives represented 13 pes proposals or sites ranches although the 13 proposals were created by using the varying spillage levels from only two ranches ranch 2 and 3 they are likely to be representative of the hydrology and biodiversity for the ranchlands in the basin the primary reason for the 13 proposals being representative of the basin especially the northern part where most of the additional water storage is needed is its low topographic relief florida is the flattest state in the united states dobson and campbell 2014 with the everglades characterized by an extremely low slope of 3 cm per km https www floridamuseum ufl edu southflorida regions everglades topographic homogeneity has been shown to reduce variability in water availability and biodiversity jobbágy et al 1996 therefore we assume that 13 proposals created using 13 spillage levels modeled at ranch 2 and 3 are likely to be typical of most of the basin 2 8 2 selecting water storage alternative in addition to site selection the dss was also used to rank the plausible water storage alternatives at the two ranches 2 and 3 multiple spillage levels are possible at a site each spillage level referred to as the water storage alternative would lead to a different response in biodiversity indicators due to changes in hydrologic variables used by the eco hydrologic models the dss was used to rank the said alternatives for the selected site rankings were created and analyzed from two buyer perspectives biodiversity response and water storage table 4 seven alternatives were ranked for ranch 2 and six for ranch 3 it is to be expected that uncertainty in hydrologic model predictions will propagate to biodiversity response predictions and subsequently to dss based decision making the ditches at ranch outlets are hydraulically connected to the wetlands therefore the assumption here is that mike she mike 11 model performance and errors in simulating the ditch levels are similar to those for the wetland water levels the derived hydrologic signatures and the predicted biodiversity measures used within the dss to rank the sites and the water management alternatives like all models mike she model s performance is likely to vary by site in some cases errors in predicting hydrologic signatures may be considerably different than the errors in predicting the ditch water levels however for the purposes of the dss these errors were considered acceptable because the primary use of dss is ranking pes proposals and water retention alternatives and not deciding payments for the service 2 8 3 use of dss for multi party buyers typical buyers in pes programs are government agencies and in the case of multiple services such as the one presented here buyers are likely to be a coalition of different government agencies and non governmental organizations we present an example where the dss could be utilized in quantifying trade offs and making an informed decision in a situation where three agencies with varied preferences form a coalition to buy services of water storage and biodiversity enhancements 3 results and discussion 3 1 biodiversity response to water storage significant relationships were observed between specific ecological and hydrological variables for all biodiversity indicators except mosquito abundance table 5 forage increased with time inundated ti quadratically table 5 indicating that there is a threshold ti value at which cover of forage plants peaks this may be because flooding intolerant e g paspalum notatum and flooding tolerant e g panicum hemitomon forage species overlap at intermediate water availability level as ti increases forage also increases an economic benefit for rancher until a peak length of ti is reached after which forage growth starts to decline an economic disadvantage due to flooding stress and a shift to emergent macrophyte species that are poor forage for cattle this suggests that a spillage level that provides maximum forage may not necessarily be the highest spillage level exotic invasive plant cover a dis service was found to have a positive quadratic relationship with storage volume p value 0 001 table 5 indicating that increasing the wetland storage would lead to an increase in the exotic plant cover and a decrease in native plant biodiversity there are many invasive plants adapted to long hydroperiods in the everglades region wetland plant cover was positively corelated with time inundated and growing degree days table 5 this finding is consistent with other studies related to wetland plants foti et al 2012 sonnier et al 2018 there is a maximum wetland depth maxdepth at which macroinvertebrates are most abundant fish abundance decreased with longer delays between flooding periods and with later dates autumn months in the growing season table 5 similar to those observed by gatto and trexler 2019 amphibian frog abundance was shown to decrease with ti table 5 which is consistent with the well known phenomenon of rapid reproduction and tadpole development with initial flooding and the negative impacts of increased wetland connectivity dc table 3 that provides access for fish to prey on tadpoles mosquito abundance decreased with increase in fish abundance likely because fish are predators of mosquitos table 5 invertebrates and vertebrates fish macroinvertebrates amphibians and mosquitos are important food sources for species of higher trophic levels including birds and mammals and an increase in their abundance could sustain these other animals known to be abundant on the ranches swain et al 2013 this benefit was not measured in this study as the scale and number of wetlands studied were insufficient for adequate sampling but it is reasonable to assume this co benefit when biodiversity is included in the water storage pes program models for two biodiversity indicators exotic plant cover and amphibian abundance included ranch effect variables indicating that ranch management affects some of the biodiversity responses the ranches used in the development of the eco hydrological models were identified as either improved pasture semi native pasture or a mixture of the two table 1 with the land use history and addition of fertilizer to the improved pastures the wetlands in improved pastures tend to be more nutrient rich while wetlands in semi native pastures are more oligotrophic boughton et al 2019 all biodiversity indicators responded to changes in hydrology and could be predicted directly using hydrologic variables or indirectly mosquitos using ecological variables fish that were affected by hydrology these models enabled the use of biodiversity in evaluating pes proposals 3 2 decision support system depending on the storage goals for the basin or sub watershed the state s affordability criteria and willingness to pay and a rancher s tolerance of extended flooding in relation to forage production participating ranches can provide varying degrees of water storage eco hydrological models showed that variations in water storage and associated hydrological variables directly impact the biodiversity services from wetlands on the participating ranches table 5 in a review of other pes studies aiming to conserve biodiversity bullock et al 2011 suggested that instead of accounting biodiversity benefits as a service they be considered an inherent response to water management and included in designing the pes programs the dss presented here is based on the same line of thought we recommend biodiversity benefits be used to select spillage levels as well as prioritize pes sites ranches given the limited funds available for the program 3 2 1 selecting the water storage sites one of the founding principles of pes program is voluntary participation institution s paying for the service s have the right to determine the eligibility of the participants given the buyer financed nature of the program the participants sellers can accept or decline to provide the services like any other market like program pes programs also aim for maximizing cost efficiency and site selection has been shown to accomplish the same wünscher et al 2008 enhancement of good biodiversity was a non economic but valued product of the pes program we propose that it be used as a decision making factor in selecting sites for implementation however in future if biodiversity is bought by the state in lieu of financial compensation to the ranchers 1 the eco hydrological models could still be used to quantify the biodiversity services and associated trade offs and 2 the dss could be used to prioritize the participating sites solely on the basis on the level of the biodiversity service the dss was used to rank multiple sites and prioritize them from biodiversity and water storage standpoints biodiversity is one of the most prominent indicators of ecological health of a system and paying for biodiversity services has recently gained momentum herzon et al 2018 for example in the peninsular florida ecoregion state e g florida forever and federal e g everglades headwaters national wildlife refuge programs target land acquisition and easements for the protection of 88 federal and state listed species of greatest conservation need many of which are wetland dependent e g whooping crane everglades snail kite wood stork agricultural expansion is the leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide and therefore the focus needs to be on agricultural practices to maintain a biodiverse environment in theory service buyers only need to pay for what they receive under a pes scheme any additional benefit is simply an outcome of design and implementation in cases such as the payment for water storage program discussed here where the additional benefit is biodiversity a common dilemma faced by scientists and environmental managers alike is the basis for biodiversity services payment are actions enough or should the payments be based on results gibbons et al 2011 the dss takes an in between approach by designating the best possible ecological outcome as the basis for pes fund allocation the dss bundles the biodiversity services with water storage through eco hydrological models and assists in prioritizing the pes proposals based on their impact on biodiversity and importance weights assigned to various biodiversity indicators the weights are decided by the user based on their interest for example if the user is a buyer that is an agency dedicated to native wildlife protection their interests might lie in increased fish and macroinvertebrate abundance and they would assign higher weights to the said biodiversity indicators the dss enables the ranking of pes proposals and allows the environmental managers to design and implement the payment for water storage services program such that the best possible ecological outcomes are an inherent component of the system ranches in the everglades and other landscapes are a combination of uplands and drained wetlands using agricultural lands to store excess on site rain or off site public water would lead to increased wetland hydration enhanced baseflows and reduced peak surface flows to move towards restoring the hydrology of the everglades and the two linked estuaries fig 1 however it does not necessarily guarantee the re establishment of pre existing ecological biodiversity health of the system given the complex interlinked nature of hydrology and ecology and the fact that the basin still has a large network of regional canals and flood control structures essential to avoid flooding of agricultural and urban lands the current business as usual approach to the ne pes site selection is to choose a site that maximizes water storage in the basin making the best approach to rank the pes proposals based solely on the total storage offered by the landowners however such a mechanism defies the hydrological and ecological benefits of the dispersed water management approach thirteen example pes proposals sites were compared using the dss and assigned a priority ranking based on the predicted biodiversity and water storage responses the rankings calculated using the three methods wam cp and promethee were mostly in agreement two of the three methods consistently agreed for all weighting schemes wam consistently agreed with one or both of the remaining two resulting in a more robust decision for selection of sites from a biodiversity perspective desirable biodiversity indicators e g fish and wetland plant cover were assigned the highest possible weight of 4 while the undesirable indicators e g mosquito abundance were assigned the lowest possible weight of 1 table 4 all three weighting techniques utilized by the dss assigned the highest score and best rank 1 to site 11 fig 3 which coincided with a moderate increase in all biodiversity services and minimum dis services given the weighing scheme it is understandable that the option with a moderate increase in all biodiversity services would be chosen for example a site expected to provide maximum fish but minimum amphibian abundance would be ranked lower than the one that would provide a moderate increase in both jessop et al 2015 also showed that all biodiversity services do not maximize at a single level of hydrologic restoration since all desirable and undesirable biodiversity indicators were assigned equal weights of importance there was no opportunity for compensatory trade offs when selecting the most desirable site however buyers and stakeholders could assign different weights if they wished to analyze the trade offs e g increase in fish abundance while losing amphibians and come to a consensus for ranking the sites sites were not always ranked the same from the biodiversity and water storage perspectives fig 3 indicating the need for a dss to evaluate the trade offs and help stakeholders make an informed decision for example site 11 was ranked the best from the biodiversity standpoint but it was ranked only fifth most desirable from the water storage perspective among the 13 example sites fig 3 the mike she mike 11 model results showed that site 8 ranked the best would lead to an 84 reduction in surface flows compared to the baseline followed by site 9 69 which was ranked second most desirable from water storage standpoint if the maximum weight i e 4 is assigned to water storage the ranking simply follows the order of surface outflow reduction values although desirable using biodiversity for ranking is inherently complex since biodiversity is a combination of multiple ecologic variables site 8 provided maximum increase in fish abundance and wetland plant cover however it was ranked second to site 11 which was the most desirable because it provided higher than average increase in all desirable biodiversity indicators and the same level of increase in undesirable indicators as site 8 with all biodiversity indicators being assigned equal weights site 8 was a less favorable choice from the biodiversity standpoint if fish abundance and wetland plant cover were the only indicators chosen to quantify biodiversity response site 8 would have been ranked the best if water storage were the only criteria for awarding pes contracts biodiversity enhancement would not be a guaranteed service essentially buyers may have to settle for a lower amount of targeted service water storage to maximize biodiversity ecosystem service trade offs have been suggested as an inevitable outcome when targeting more than one service through a program swain et al 2013 goldstein et al 2012 although sites were compared assuming equal importance would be given to all biodiversity indicators in a case where there are multi party buyers with different interest preference e g producers state environmental agencies and or ngos urban developers tourism the weights can be assigned accordingly which is another use of the dss discussed in section 3 2 3 3 2 2 selecting the level of service the first use of the dss is to rank pes proposals where the sellers landowner rancher have already quantified the water storage they intend to offer i e their preferred spillage level at the discharge structures however it is possible that there exists a water storage alternative different from that proposed by the seller which the buyer wants because it can result in a better biodiversity response compared to what the seller is offering the dss could also be utilized to achieve the most desirable water storage level from biodiversity standpoint for each eligible participating site if the most desirable water storage level from a biodiversity perspective is different from proposed it would create an opportunity for negotiation a compensatory trade off between financial incentive and water storage eligibility versus the desirability of participants in cases where multiple environmental services are bundled has been discussed banerjee et al 2013 zanella et al 2014 for example banerjee et al 2013 discussed bundling floodplain restoration with additional services like habitat restoration in our case all ranches with varied spillage levels would be eligible to participate in the pes program however the level of biodiversity services provided will be a factor in selecting the proposals the dss would fulfill the need of ranking in order of desirability the available water storage spillage alternatives based on trade offs among water storage and biodiversity provisioning thus providing the buyer a holistic assessment of alternatives essential for decision making after the dss was used to select sites the next step was to select the most desirable water storage service level by ranking a range of water storage spillage alternatives at each site as an example consider that ranch 2 has been selected based on biodiversity response using the dss there are seven different water storage alternatives plausible at ranch 2 0 baseline 1 2 3 4 7 and 8 boards table 6 the biodiversity dss scores after assigning the highest weight 4 to all biodiversity service indicators and the lowest weight 1 to all biodiversity dis service indicators table 4 ranged between 0 700 and 1 379 table 6 we have included two ranks based on whether or not the dis services are considered table 6 the dis services are ignored by most pes programs boughton et al 2019 results showed that there was little difference in the dss rankings when excluding the dis services from the analyses indicating that mosquito abundance and exotic plant cover had limited effect on the score and therefore ranking this was to be expected because mosquito abundance did not correlate with any hydrologic variable therefore any difference in the rankings with and without accounting for dis services were mainly due to eliminating exotic plant cover and changes in other services an example of how dss can facilitate negotiations between buyers and sellers follows assume that the seller landowner is offering alternative 6 7 boards biodiversity focus dss score 0 738 water storage focus dss score 0 508 however alternative 7 8 boards was ranked highest from both biodiversity response and water storage perspectives biodiversity focus dss score 1 379 water storage focus dss score 0 855 the hydrological model predicted a considerable difference in water storage service between alternatives 6 and 7 alternative 7 increased the storage by 70 in contrast to alternative 6 which only provided 17 increase in storage compared to baseline no structure at the ranch outlet the dss also illustrates the financial implications for the buyer and the seller as well as outcomes for the participating ranches in the water storage pes the payments ranged between 98 and 158 per acre ft of water stored https fl audubon org news sfwmd approves eight water storage projects northern everglades the average payment was 134 per acre ft 16 5 ha m which was used in the dss the annual financial incentive for the seller landowner would be 31 higher in the case of alternative 7 8 505 year compared to alternative 6 5 851 year from a 476 ha site in such cases where there is a disagreement between the water storage alternative offered by the seller and the most desirable one from biodiversity or water storage standpoint which the buyer wants a negotiation between the seller and the buyer to come to a mutually agreeable solution will be required one solution can be that the buyer absorbs the transaction costs to implement the pes in lieu of the seller implementing alternative 7 which will result in increased economic losses due to flooding of additional pasture area transaction costs commonly comprise of negotiation monitoring and enforcement costs alston et al 2013 for example if the buyer state could absorb the cost of engineering hydrologic consultants whom the seller hired to provide storage estimates to prepare the pes application to the buyer state then the seller might be more amenable to implementing the desired board height alternative 7 furthermore the cost of data collection and field verification of complex hydrologic models such as mike she mike 11 are high and sharing or absorbing a part or whole of the expense by the state could be beneficial for the seller alternatively the unit price of water storage service could be negotiated based on the level of biodiversity services a site which provides additional biodiversity services may get a higher price for the water storage compared to a site which provides the same water storage but lower biodiversity service given the sandy soils with a hydraulic conductivity of up to 216 cm per hour obreza and collins 2008 and shallow water table environment in south florida the term water retention storage needs to be used with caution wu 2014 shukla et al 2015 a considerable part of surface water retained due to discharge control structures such as crb structures in our study can leave the system through subsurface pathways wu 2014 shukla et al 2015 shukla et al unpublished data therefore increase in spillage level number of boards at the outlet structure does not always translate to increase in water retention on the ranch holding more water on the ranch leads to a change in hydraulic gradient leading to surface water leaving the ranch through subsurface pathways outside of the ranch for example the mike she mike 11 model predicted negligible change in storage when the number of boards was raised from 1 alternative 2 to 4 alternative 5 at ranch 2 the non linear relationship between number of boards and surface storage indicated that increase in board height does not always result in increased storage and was demonstrated when the dss ranked alternative 4 3 boards dss score 0 704 table 6 marginally higher than alternative 5 4 boards dss score 0 702 table 6 when weights were assigned from the perspective of increasing water storage and decreasing implementation cost table 4 results from the dss can be used to facilitate negotiations among buyers and sellers we present another example from ranch 3 table 7 six water storage alternatives boards 1 through 6 were considered for selecting the most desirable storage level alternative 6 6 boards was ranked the highest from the biodiversity response perspective table 7 since it led to maximum fish amphibian and wetland plant abundance the said biodiversity service response came at the cost of the lowest abundance of macroinvertebrates and an increased loss in forage the latter is undesirable for the seller because the rancher has to buy additional cattle feed to compensate for the loss of forage or reduce cattle stocking density these scenarios will require negotiation between the seller landowner rancher and the buyer for example the buyer may agree to absorb the cost of forage loss for the seller by increasing the payment for water storage services alternative 6 was also ranked the highest from the water storage standpoint table 7 in this example a buyer whose interest lies in biodiversity enhancement or a buyer whose interest is only water storage can agree to implement alternative 6 however this may not always occur and in most cases the buyers of environmental services may be a coalition of an array of stakeholders with varied interests thompson and friess 2019 and trade offs are often a necessity in negotiating agreements we explain in the following section the use of the dss in quantifying the trade offs and coming to a consensus about site selection and service provision levels when multiple buyers with different preferences are involved 3 2 3 decision making for multi party buyers environmental governance is a result of convergence of stakeholders from different backgrounds often when acquiring environmental services different constituents of environmental governance collaborate the first step to make such inter organizational collaborations successful is for the stakeholders to reach a consensus on which water storage alternative to buy the dss can help in such situations by incorporating the stakeholder preferences when ranking the available alternatives our dss would provide a choice to all involved stakeholders to prioritize their preferences to put this application into perspective we provide a mock scenario where the buyer is a coalition of three environmental agencies a b and c with focus on water e g water management districts in fl vegetation and wildlife management respectively agency a s objective would be to maximize water storage the expenditure on exotic vegetation management in florida ranges between 97 million and 127 million per year therefore agency b s interest would be to maximize native vegetation while minimizing exotics exotic animal population in the everglades basin is a growing concern sfwmd 2021c it follows that agency c s aim would be to maximize native fauna the three stakeholders would assign different weights to the dss parameters i e the biodiversity indicators water storage payment and cost of implementation depending on their relative importance to them the dss would enable the analyses of synergies and trade offs thereby aiding in reaching a consensus among buying coalition members with different interests which can otherwise be in conflict with each other the onus would ultimately rest with the agencies to decide the acceptable solution but the dss would facilitate the discussion by providing metrics necessary to evaluate each water management alternative 4 conclusion the pes proponents given the complexity in its quantification cautiously regard biodiversity as a standalone ecosystem service this is especially true in our study where biodiversity was an unaccounted consequence of increasing water storage on private ranchlands upland wetland systems subsequently resulting in wetland hydration and changes in desirable and undesirable biodiversity indicators instead of considering biodiversity as a direct service from ranchlands we propose it to be used as a decision making criterion for prioritizing pes sites and identifying optimum level of hydration eco hydrological models were developed to quantify the effects of water storage on biodiversity a dss utilizing the said models with a user specified weighing scheme was developed to analyze the trade offs between water storage and biodiversity indicators for a variety of water storage alternatives contrary to the common belief results showed that increase in wetland hydration level does not necessarily result in desirable biodiversity changes undesirable biodiversity indicators e g exotic plants also increase with enhanced water storage therefore the trade offs between storage and desirable and undesirable biodiversity indicators need to be quantified to make an informed decision most pes programs are managed by layers of governmental and environmentally focused non profit institutions one of the contributions of our study was to develop a dss tool which could be utilized by stakeholders with a spectrum of preferences water flora fauna and evaluate how their interests would be impacted as the proclivities of others in the coalition change above all the dss would provide a platform for all involved parties sellers and buyers alike to negotiate based on field verified model predictions of storage and biodiversity indicators combining hydrology and biodiversity for a pes is challenging because of inherent uncertainties and requires collaboration amongst physical biological and social scientists and other stakeholders the proposed dss is only the first step in defining hydro ecological linkages quantifying how one impacts the other and how multiple services and dis services can be combined for a real world pes program the possibilities to expand the use of the dss are many for example depending on the proximity to critical species habitat new criteria could be added and assigned different weights with an emphasis on rural prosperity another factor that could be added is the socioeconomic equity small ranches e g 500 acres could be given a higher weight to ensure their inclusion among the selected sites other factors could be proximity to critical groundwater recharge zones within the basin given the increased groundwater recharge benefit of water retention and increased carbon sequestration due to wetland hydration furthermore if biodiversity is approved as a standalone ecosystem service with willing buyers the dss could be utilized to select desirable participants based on the existing level of water storage on their ranchlands with simultaneous emphasis on mitigating and adapting to climate change designing future pes programs are likely to become more complex due to the emerging need to consider more services and trade offs although our study considers only a small subset of ecosystem services it does provide a preview of how complex future pes designs are going

3362,the vegetation geographic distribution and pastoralist uses of peatlands in the central andes have been extensively studied over the past 20 years however little information exists to characterize the hydrologic processes that support these groundwater dependent ecosystems or the hydrologic alterations occurring due to human activities or climate changes this lack of information significantly limits our understanding of how the central andean puna one of the world s most threatened ecoregions may be altered by increasing temperature and water extraction for human use in addition these peatlands provide critical pasture for native and domestic livestock and carbon storage but overgrazing is an important modifier of their ecological trajectories we analyzed three groundwater fed fen peatlands with differing hydrologic regimes annual precipitation land use and vegetation composition water table depth was a key factor significantly contributing to differences in soil hydraulic conductivity p 0 05 and vegetation composition p 0 05 saturated hydraulic conductivity k varied from 0 57 m day 1 to 0 03 m day 1 for the horizontal component kh and 0 07 to 0 002 m day 1 for the vertical component kv the principal differences in k were in the seasonally unsaturated upper soil layers at 0 75 cm depth the annual deepening in the water table and distichia muscoides dominance drive the variability in k for these layers those drivers were themselves correlated but can individually modify k increasing the decomposition rate and porosity wt deepening and altering the initial peat structure d muscoides dominance three vegetation communities were identified one in sites with the deepest water tables the lowest hydraulic conductivities and dominance of werneria pygmaea and plantago rigida the second community dominated by bunch grasses in the genus calamagrostis occurred in areas with the most variable water table and medium hydraulic conductivity the third community occurred in the most hydrologically stable areas with the shallowest water table highest hydraulic conductivities and was dominated by distichia muscoides the study peatlands appear to have originated as the third community groundwater supported fens dominated by distichia muscoides cushion and pool communities however modern hydrologic changes caused by human land uses and climate variability have caused a divergence in the vegetation and in the more disturbed sites created higher decomposition rates in the shallow peat layers and differences in soil structure keywords central

in deep soils indicating similar organic matter inputs and peat formation processes in the past 2 is the current vegetation composition correlated with current land uses and water table dynamics 3 do shallow soils in the three study sites have distinct soil k related to their current and recent differences in land use vegetation and hydrological regime 2 methods this research was conducted in

three additional climate stations 1 paucarcocha dam located 5 5 km southeastern to the piticocha peatland with data from 2006 to 2020 2 tanta located 7 3 km south to the piticocha peatland and with data from 1967 to 2020 and 3 qarwaqucha 4 1 km northeast to moyobamba peatland 2 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity field tests modified bail tests were performed to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity k at different depths in 33 of the 78 hydrological stations pvc pipes with a diameter of 3 18 cm were installed to measure horizontal conductivity kh four openings 10 cm long and covering approximately 60 of the pipe circumference in all orientations were cut into the pipe walls 5 cm above the bottom a polymer cone generated with a 3d printer was used to seal the pipe bottom opening holden and burt 2003 an identical pvc pipe but opened only at the bottom was used to measure a mixed k value dominated by the vertical component kv the openings for both piezometers were covered with a geotextile mesh 250 µm pore aperture piezometers were installed in pairs to measure kh and kv with three to six pairs at different depths at each hydrological station depending on wt depth and peat thickness the shallowest pipe at each station was installed at 0 25 m below ground level bgl with k assessed at this depth for stations with a water table within 0 15 m bgl during the rainy season depending on peat thickness modified bail tests were also performed on piezometers installed at 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 and 1 50 m bgl piezometers were purged before each bail test until the same recovery response was obtained for three consecutive withdrawals cardenas and zlotnik 2003 following the last purge a pressure transducer micro diver van essen instruments and a steel rod of known volume were installed in the pipe after 24 h the steel rod was quickly removed to produce an immediate water drop that started the test tests were repeated two or three times for each piezometer all k tests were conducted during the wet season from march april 2017 and december 2017 march 2018 the hydraulic conductivity tests were performed when it had not rained during the previous 48 h to avoid errors due to changes in water availability hanschke and baird 2001 we also discarded all the test results that had a recovery period longer than 24 h and those with recoveries that differ in more than 5 to the original wt supplementary material 1 additionally ten soil samples each 2500 cm2 50 50 cm on each side and 65 cm deep were extracted from different hydrological stations to perform vertical and horizontal falling head darcy s column ksat tests fetter 2001 those samples were extracted from four stations in huachipampa four in moyobamba and two in piticocha during april 2017 after extraction each sample was isolated using wax and transported to the soil hydrology laboratory agricultural engineering department la molina national university in lima 2 3 vegetation sampling vegetation composition was sampled in august 2018 using five plots each 1 m2 around each hydrological station percent canopy cover was visually estimated for each vascular plant species present as well as five categories moss shallow pools deep pools dead cushions and bare mineral soil chytrý and otýpková 2003 plant species nomenclature follows the angiosperm phylogeny group version iv apg iv chase et al 2016 2 4 data analyses hydrological data were analyzed to identify wt seasonality and variability between peatlands the water level measurements for all monitoring wells were used to create an interpolated wt map the horizontal hydraulic gradient was used to describe the principal water flow patterns the flow pattern combined with the vhg measurements were used to identify groundwater recharge and discharge zones in each peatland after correcting for atmospheric pressure the logger measured wt data for hua 12 pit 11 and moy 18 were converted to daily time series and decomposed in their seasonal and random components madsen 2008 mudelsee 2014 finally the data from these stations were compared with precipitation and manual wt measurements in all hydrological stations to identify seasonal patterns a time series analysis was applied to decompose the daily wt series into its temporal components seasonality trend and random the wt random component allowed us to identify water level changes in response to individual precipitation events independent of seasonal or temporal trend changes it is obtained by subtracting seasonality and trend from the measured water table values eq 1 1 wt random wt observed w t seasonality wt trend the random component was used to evaluate whether the wt responded to rain falling directly on the peatland during the dry season or to groundwater discharge for that comparison we used a cross correlation analysis that compared the wt random component at hua 12 pit 11 and moy 18 with precipitation measured at huachipampa paucarcocha

were compared using one way and two way anova and post hoc tukey honestly significant difference hsd tests borcard et al 2018 indicator value analysis indval de cáceres et al 2012 was used to identify indicator species for each plant community previously defined applying a k means cluster analysis a canonical correspondence analysis cca ter braak 1986 was performed to explore the relationships between the plant communities and measured environmental variables including the deepest and shallowest wt wt range average vhg and peat layer thickness we evaluated the significance of the cca based on the total variability explained by the first two axes eigenvalues and using a monte carlo permutation test to assess the consistency of the ordination borcard et al 2018 the influence of each environmental variable on the ordination was evaluated based on the intra set correlation between environmental variables and the cca axes the segregation obtained using this method was compared with the k means partition to explain differences in vegetation composition related to the environmental variables linear mixed models were used to identify the hydrological and vegetation variables most correlated with peat hydraulic conductivity at 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 m bgl these comparisons interpreted groundwater flow patterns governed by k vegetation composition differences and water availability

pattern of wt depth occurred in all three study sites fig 2 the shallowest wt occurred during the wet season averaging 0 09 0 29 and 0 28 m bgl at moyobamba piticocha and huachipampa the deepest wt occurred in the dry season may through november with average depths of 0 46 0 51 and 0 39 m bgl for the three sites logger based wt readings at hua 12 pit 11 and moy 18 had similar patterns with the wt rising during the rainy season and deepening during the dry season at moyobamba where an artificial drainage network occurs wt variance was most significant and dry season wt was deeper even though mean annual precipitation was highest contour maps of the wt and vertical hydraulic gradients fig 3 indicated that ground water entered each peatland in its highest elevation area the wt contours generally followed the ground surface slope with minor variations influenced by topographic rises that increased water levels and the presence of streams or ditches that functioned as hydrologic sinks maps of the vertical hydraulic gradient vhg identified areas of perennial groundwater discharge with distinct seasonality during the wet season the vhg was predominantly positive indicating upward flow due to discharge from surrounding aquifers or neutral fig 3a 3c and 3e these patterns reversed during the dry season fig 3b 3d and 3f indicating that in most cases the flow trended downward recharging the underlying aquifer or more commonly discharging to nearby streams in all sites and seasons vhg was positive near the upper peatland margins where perennial aquifer discharge occurred the analysis of wt data in hua 12 pit 11 and moy 18 shown ach precipitation event during the dry season caused a slow and gradual wt rise lagged by more than 24 h these lag times had statistically significant cross correlations for periods of one to four days after each precipitation event indicating a response related to transit times in the surrounding aquifer system table 2 3 2 hydraulic conductivity the highest kh and kv occurred at 0 25 to 0 75 m soil depth in all sites while the lowest and least variable kh and kv occurred at 1 00 to 1 50 m depth fig 4 the geometric mean of kh at 0

ranged from 0 07 m day 1 at 0 25 m to 0 002 m day 1 at 1 00 m bgl similar to kh the highest variability of kv occurred from 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl while peat at 1 m and deeper was relatively homogenous the difference in kv between 0 25 and 0 75 m bgl ranged from 0 07 m day 1 to 0 009 m day 1 while in the three deepest peat layers kv varied from 0 008 to 0 002 m day 1 also for kv differences between strata were significant p 0 05 and the paired comparisons demonstrated that these differences are caused by the two shallowest layers 0 25 and 0 50 m bgl the anisotropy ratio kv kh varied from 0 057

than the field measurements however laboratory and field tests had the same kv kh ratio 0 10 and a similar relationship between the 0 25 and 0 50 m bgl layers indicating that the field measurements accurately represented depth variability and the ratio between the vertical and horizontal components of k 3 3 vegetation fifty vascular plant species were found in the study plots and three communities characterized by 17 species were identified using k means cluster analysis supplementary material 2 community c1 occurred in heavily grazed parts of piticocha and moyobamba with werneria pygmaea plantago rigida and lachemilla pinnata having the highest canopy cover and distichia muscoides having 20 cover the wt in c1 was more than 0 30 m bgl during the wet season and 0 60 m during the dry season community c2 was dominated by the grasses calamagrostis spicigera and calamagrostis chrysantha and occurred in the lower parts of huachipampa and moyobamba the wt in c2 had the highest variability ranging from 0 04 m in the wet season to 0 68 m bgl in the dry season community c3 occurred in upper huachipampa piticocha and moyobamba in areas with light grazing pressure and was dominated by distichia muscoides the wt was within 0 50 m bgl all year twenty community indicators were identified using the indval procedure c1 had the most indicators with nine species including lachemilla pinnata l diplophyla werneria pygmaea plantago tubulosa and p rigida c2 had seven indicator species including calamagrostis spicigera c chrysantha festuca rigida and carex humahuacaensis occupying seasonally flooded pools c3 had only two indicator species distichia muscoides and oritrophium limnophilum both typical andean peatland species benavides et al 2013 cooper et al 2019 2010 the constrained eigenvalue for cca axis 1 is 83 3 explaining 61 2 of the total variance in the vegetation data set fig 5 cca axis 2 had an eigenvalue of 41 8 explaining 30 7 of the variance both cca1

in this community c2 sites were plotted near the top of the ordination space positively correlated with the shallowest wt in the rainy season and the highest wt range three indicator species for this group festuca rigida feri calamagrostis spicigera casp and calamagrostis chrysantha cach have their centroids located inside the cluster c3 plots are on the left of the ordination space associated with the thickest peat positive or neutral vhg a relatively shallow wt during the dry season and small annual wt range distichia muscoides dimu is the dominant species in c3 and its centroid was

and the interaction of soil depth and community was also significant p 0 01 table 5 paired community comparisons indicated that c3 had higher kh and was significantly different from c1 tukey hsd tests p 0 05 while c2 was intermediate and highly variable differences between communities were driven by higher and more variable kh at 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl than in strata deeper than 1 00 m bgl while kh was similar for all layers statistically significant differences in kv occurred between communities and peat layers two way anova p 0 001 the paired analysis identified soil layers at 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl in c3 as the principal difference between communities tukey hsd kv was higher in c3 than c1 and c2 at 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl but at 1 00 m bgl and deeper was not significantly different we found

k values ground surface cushion and pool microtopography and dominance of distichia muscoides in areas with stable water availability suggest that the three sites had a common origin similar to other peatlands in the peruvian puna skrzypek et al 2011 we recently collected peat cores 3 10 m long from huachipampa piticocha and seven other peatlands in the cañete basin headwaters and preliminary analyses indicate that the peat is relatively homogeneous and composed almost entirely of distichia muscoides remains unpublished data 2021 the three study sites formed in areas where perennial groundwater discharge supported cushion plant communities and peat accumulation filled glacially carved valley bottoms benavides et al 2013 cooper et al 2019 2010 hribljan et al 2015 skrzypek et al 2011 the peatland hydraulic conductivity was highest in the upper soil layers and lower in deeper layers however land use and vegetation cover changes modified these patterns mccarter et al 2020 in nor yauyos cochas significant land use changes have occurred since colonial times including the introduction of nonnative sheep and cattle domic et al 2018 progressive intensification of grazing as the human population increased struelens et al 2017 and ditching in the 20th century dewind 1975 sarmiento et al 2000 this has resulted in significant changes in vegetation composition and structure of the peat bodies particularly at moyabamba and piticocha the three study sites maintained similar hydraulic conductivities in the deeper soils but significant differences now occur in the upper soil layers where modern land uses have modified the vegetation and soil table 7 4 2 hydrology many mountain peatlands worldwide are groundwater fed fens particularly in arid or semiarid regions bao et al 2010 millar et al 2018 o neill et al 2020 wolf and cooper 2015 our study peatlands developed in mountain valley bottoms with underlying glacial till alluvium and lacustrine sediments megard et al 1996 quispesivina and navarro 2003 and surrounding hillslopes covered by glacial moraines talus alluvium and colluvium seasonal precipitation directly recharges the peatland as well as hillslope aquifers that produce perennial groundwater discharge into each peatland supporting high water tables elmes and price 2019 somers and mckenzie 2020 glacier meltwater is often suggested to be the principal water source for andean peatlands dangles et al 2017 polk et al 2017 but the absence of glaciers in the study watersheds indicates the water source for peatlands is precipitation and precipitation recharged groundwater not glaciers a two to three day time lag of the wt response to dry season precipitation events created a smooth water table rise at huachipampa that is indicative of slowly increasing groundwater discharge as its water source ahmad et al 2021 heliotis and dewitt 1987 most peatlands in the central andes have seasonally variable groundwater discharge from surrounding aquifers that maintain a shallow wt during the wet season and deepens during the dry season yet still supports peat accumulation cooper et al 2019 millar et al 2018 reduced annual precipitation could affect aquifer storage producing insufficient groundwater discharge in the dry season that could degrade peatland integrity elmes and price 2019 4 3 water table and vegetation composition the vegetation composition of peatlands is strongly related to gradients of water table depth source water chemistry and other environmental processes cooper et al 2010 domic et al 2021 harris and baird 2019 lemly and cooper 2011 recent changes in climate and human activities also affect the vegetation dieleman et al 2015 kokkonen et al 2019 schimelpfenig et al 2014 the vegetation composition of our study sites is correlated with hydrological regime and comparable to peatland vegetation differences found in other mountain glina et al 2019 millar et al 2018 and non mountain regions breeuwer et al 2009 menberu et al 2016 our three study peatlands had distinctly different water table depths and vegetation composition even though their seasonal precipitation regime landscape positions peat thickness and likely age are similar the small watersheds limit total water delivery conditions where drainage ditches can significantly impact water table depth at moyobamba ditches have increased wt variability and maximum depth the duration and intensity of water table decline particularly during the long dry season is one plausible cause for explaining differences in vegetation composition in areas with shallow and stable water tables distichia muscoides a key species of andean alpine peatlands is dominant with a high capacity to accumulate peat benavides et al 2013 chimner et al 2019 cooper et al 2015 in contrast where seasonally deeper water tables occur the vegetation is dominated by species adapted to drier soil conditions including plantago rigida plantago tubulosa werneria pygmaea calamagrostis spicigera and calamagrostis chrysantha salvador et al 2014 these species have little capacity to form peat because they produce little below ground biomass medrano et al 2012 additionally they are adapted to drier conditions with higher decomposition rates rydin and jeglum 2015 4 4 implications for management under future climates in the central andes the study peatlands are supported by hillslope aquifers and direct precipitation during the rainy season and are highly susceptible to climate change that reduces available water due to their small size location in headwater catchments and lack of connection to larger regional aquifers that could provide more stable water sources kløve et al 2014 this is a concern in the central andes because the long dry season creates a regional water deficit that cannot be fully compensated by wet season precipitation in all years correa et al 2016 giráldez et al 2020 ipcc 2021 2014 hydrological alterations associated with climate changes could trigger future vegetation and peat structure changes combined with intensive human interventions such as drainage and overgrazing these alterations can exacerbate peatland degradation breeuwer et al 2009 cooper et al 2019 menberu et al 2016 these processes could combine to reduce or eliminate the capacity of some peatlands to provide ecosystem services such as carbon capture and sustainable pastures for livestock this new ecosystem state lacking dominance by cushion plants and with high rates of carbon loss may be difficult to restore ahmad et al 2021 chimner et al 2017 harris and baird 2019 holden 2005 schimelpfenig et al 2014 more detailed knowledge of peatland hydrologic processes could help identify early stages of degradation that are essential to propose effective interventions to manage or restore these valuable ecosystems this research is the initiation of a long term analysis of bofedale hydrologic regimes and ecosystem processes in the peruvian puna a longer data record through additional wet and dry periods should produce new and informative conclusions additional rain gauges through the complex mountain region would also help provide a better record of precipitation in watersheds supporting bofedales peat aging and isotopic and macrofossil analyses of peat cores will also help clarify the development of these peatlands additional and larger diameter piezometer networks infiltration analyses and laboratory tests will also aid in further quantifying vhg kv kh porosity specific yield and other important hydrologic and hydraulic indicators 5 conclusion groundwater inflow from adjacent hillslope aquifers was the principal water source for the three study peatlands its variability was reflected in different water table dynamics hydraulic conductivities and vertical hydraulic gradients between sites nevertheless similar k of the deeper peat layers combined with a common distichia muscoides created cushion and pool microtopography suggests a common origin for the three sites even though distichia is dominant today only in areas with the most stable shallow groundwater levels we suggest that these peatlands originated as groundwater fed fens dominated by d muscoides that formed most of the peat and created the landforms that exist today however due to human intervention the hydrological patterns vegetation composition and soils of the three peatlands are now distinct understanding the hydrologic dynamics of central andes peatlands is particularly important given the essential ecosystem services they provide and their potential sensitivity to climate changes reductions in water availability and increased thermal regimes have been occurring in the central andes since the little ice age rabatel et al 2005 and are predicted to continue in the future huerta lavado casimiro 2021 ipcc 2021 the high andes have historically been occupied by humans engaged in pastoralist activities domic et al 2018 yager et al 2019 but ongoing and future changes in peatlands could limit their use for livestock pastures which would significantly reduce the economic opportunities for indigenous communities research on groundwater availability can inform helpful interventions and restoration activities to mitigate past land use impacts and help andean residents adapt to ongoing climate

3362,the vegetation geographic distribution and pastoralist uses of peatlands in the central andes have been extensively studied over the past 20 years however little information exists to characterize the hydrologic processes that support these groundwater dependent ecosystems or the hydrologic alterations occurring due to human activities or climate changes this lack of information significantly limits our understanding of how the central andean puna one of the world s most threatened ecoregions may be altered by increasing temperature and water extraction for human use in addition these peatlands provide critical pasture for native and domestic livestock and carbon storage but overgrazing is an important modifier of their ecological trajectories we analyzed three groundwater fed fen peatlands with differing hydrologic regimes annual precipitation land use and vegetation composition water table depth was a key factor significantly contributing to differences in soil hydraulic conductivity p 0 05 and vegetation composition p 0 05 saturated hydraulic conductivity k varied from 0 57 m day 1 to 0 03 m day 1 for the horizontal component kh and 0 07 to 0 002 m day 1 for the vertical component kv the principal differences in k were in the seasonally unsaturated upper soil layers at 0 75 cm depth the annual deepening in the water table and distichia muscoides dominance drive the variability in k for these layers those drivers were themselves correlated but can individually modify k increasing the decomposition rate and porosity wt deepening and altering the initial peat structure d muscoides dominance three vegetation communities were identified one in sites with the deepest water tables the lowest hydraulic conductivities and dominance of werneria pygmaea and plantago rigida the second community dominated by bunch grasses in the genus calamagrostis occurred in areas with the most variable water table and medium hydraulic conductivity the third community occurred in the most hydrologically stable areas with the shallowest water table highest hydraulic conductivities and was dominated by distichia muscoides the study peatlands appear to have originated as the third community groundwater supported fens dominated by distichia muscoides cushion and pool communities however modern hydrologic changes caused by human land uses and climate variability have caused a divergence in the vegetation and in the more disturbed sites created higher decomposition rates in the shallow peat layers and differences in soil structure keywords central

importance for livestock grazing and agriculture sawyer 2008 more recently interest in conservation and ecosystem services has stimulated the development of maps chimner et al 2019 to quantify carbon stocks because many andean wetlands are peat accumulating planas clarke et al 2020 research in a few areas has attempted to document a hydrologic connection between glaciers streams groundwater and wetlands baraer et al 2012 vuille et al 2018 however there has been little detailed research on the hydrological drivers shaping these wetlands and maintaining their ecological condition cooper et al 2019 2010 understanding the hydrologic processes that support them and the factors that can disturb them is critical for managing and restoring these vital ecosystems millar et al 2018 price et al 2005 research is needed to evaluate the role of land uses on hydrologic processes such as water table depth and dynamics soil hydraulic conductivity rainfall water table dynamics and vegetation composition and its production the puna region extending along the andes from central peru to northern chile and argentina is arid with a long dry season and sparse grassland or desert vegetation in the uplands peatlands regionally termed bofedales cooper et al 2010 squeo et al 2006 are conspicuous landscape elements bofedales provide many critical environmental services including pasture for livestock natural biodiversity and carbon storage benavides et al 2013 like other peatland types bofedales form organic soils when net primary production npp exceeds ecosystem respiration er and net ecosystem productivity nep is positive on a long term basis rydin and jeglum 2015 future increased air temperature and evapotranspiration are predicted to affect peatland carbon dynamics more in tropical than high latitude regions due to the longer warm season gallego sala et al 2018 the rainy season could also be shortened and precipitation events may be more intense with higher runoff and reduced soil infiltration and groundwater recharge westra et al 2014 bofedales in the puna region are groundwater fed fens cooper et al 2019 2010 with vegetation dominated by cushion forming plant

accumulation rates known for any mountain region in the late holocene hribljan et al 2015 alteration of the vegetation composition or its production or groundwater recharge storage flow and water table depth can reduce npp and increase er resulting in an annual net loss of organic matter millar et al 2017 in addition intensive year round livestock grazing can reduce and in many instances kill the dominant cushion plants that are replaced by species more resistant to grazing cooper et al 2015 these changes can modify the peat soil s physical characteristics influencing its structure and functioning as natural systems with the capacity to capture and store carbon and provide pasture cochi machaca et al 2018 schimelpfenig et al 2014 the upper layers of peat soils are composed of partially decomposed plant matter live roots and rhizomes and typically have high porosity and hydraulic conductivity k baird et al 2004 the number and type of pores controlling soil k depend on plant inputs and organic matter accumulation and decomposition rates mccarter et al 2020 a deeper water table created by ditching or climate changes can dry upper soil horizons increasing decomposition rates and reducing the percentage of large pores resulting in altered groundwater flow patterns rezanezhad et al 2016 the high andes have a long history of human land use and management particularly in peatlands used by pastoralist communities domic et al 2018 heavy livestock grazing can modify the vegetation break up peatland soils and compress the peat mccarter et al 2020 this increases soil density reducing porosity and k affecting hydrological functioning price et al 2003 in this paper we identify linkages between land uses vegetation composition hydrologic regime and soil hydraulic properties in three peatlands with different land use histories in the central peruvian andes we focus on the mechanism of land use driven changes in bofedal vegetation and water table changes and the alteration of peat soil hydraulic conductivity we hypothesized that the study peatlands had similar vegetation hydrologic regime landforms and soil before the initiation of intensive livestock grazing and land management practices since the colonization period domic et al 2018 we tested this hypothesis by addressing the following questions 1 do the study sites have similar hydraulic conductivities in deep soils indicating similar organic matter inputs and peat formation processes in the past 2 is the current vegetation composition correlated with current land uses and water table dynamics 3 do shallow soils in the three study sites have distinct soil k related to their current and recent differences in land use vegetation and hydrological regime 2 methods this research was conducted in

and sedimentary rocks of post eocene age the base of the stratigraphic column is typically neoproterozoic rocks including shale and granite quispesivina and navarro 2003 these rocks are overlain by sedimentary shale sandstone conglomerate and volcanic horizons of mississippian and permian ages mostly from continental environments the instability of the earth s crust caused a marine invasion in the mesozoic allowing the accumulation of calcareous sediments during the triassic jurassic that influence local hydrogeochemical processes megard et al 1996 water in the study area is mainly neutral

hillslope glacial moraines that store and transmit groundwater the principal peat forming species is distichia muscoides nees meyen that grows in large clonal cushions plant shoots in the cushions are tightly packed blocking the horizontal flow of water forming pools between cushions and creating complex landforms with pool and cushion microtopography squeo et al 2006 the three study peatlands have

intensity grazing by alpaca vicugna pacos and sheep ovis aries piticocha located 3 5 km south of huachipampa at 4394 m asl is an unmodified peatland with 18 7 ha bordering a downslope lake and is intensively grazed by sheep alpaca and cattle bos primigenius taurus moyobamba is located 15 2 km east of huachipampa on the eastern slopes of the central cordillera at 4662 m asl covering 12 1 ha and

a grid across the study peatlands based on their sizes and average slope each station included one groundwater monitoring well for measure water table depth and a nest of three piezometers for estimating hydraulic head at the installation depth all the study peatlands were previously surveyed using a total station leica flexline ts03 monitoring wells were constructed using 5 08 cm inside diameter pvc pipe slotted every 5 cm wells were installed 1 5 to 2 0 m deep to match the maximum anticipated water table depth after installation each well was developed by bailing the piezometers were unslotted 1 27 cm inside diameter pvc pipe opened only at the bottom they were completed at three depths around the monitoring well using the direct push technique a steel rod was located inside the pipe and both were pushed to the desired depth then the rod was removed and the piezometer purged using a pump cardenas and zlotnik 2003 seventy eight hydrological stations were installed between november 2016 and may 2017 with 29 in huachipampa distanced in average 75 m 16 in piticocha average distance 75 m and 33 in moyobamba average distance 50 m monitoring wells were used to quantify water table depth while piezometers were used to measure the relative vertical hydraulic gradient vhg through the ratio δ h δ l where δh is the change in water level between piezometers and δl is the difference in elevation of the piezometer tips baxter et al 2003 the vhg helped to identify aquifer discharge peatland water sources positive vhg or recharge areas peatland sinks negative vhg fetter 2001 rydin and jeglum 2015 a 7 5 m steel rod was used to estimate peat thickness at each monitoring well by pushing until a change in density indicated clay sand gravel or rock and the basal mineral soil position householder et al 2012 hribljan et al 2015 one monitoring well on each site huachipampa hua 12 piticocha pit 11 and moyobamba moy 18 was instrumented with a pressure transducer hobo u20l hobo computer corporation and the records corrected using barometric loggers baro diver di500 van essen instruments in addition a tipping bucket rain gauge was installed hobo rg3 460 m east of huachipampa all automatic loggers and a climate station in huachipampa were installed in june 2018 and recorded data hourly further information to characterize the climate in the study area was from three additional climate stations 1 paucarcocha dam located 5 5 km southeastern to the piticocha peatland with data from 2006 to 2020 2 tanta located 7 3 km south to the piticocha peatland and with data from 1967 to 2020 and 3 qarwaqucha 4 1 km northeast to moyobamba peatland 2 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity field tests modified bail tests were performed to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity k at different depths in 33 of the 78 hydrological stations pvc pipes with a diameter of 3 18 cm were installed to measure horizontal conductivity kh four openings 10 cm long and covering approximately 60 of the pipe circumference in all orientations were cut into the pipe walls 5 cm above the bottom a polymer cone generated with a 3d printer was used to seal the pipe bottom opening holden and burt 2003 an identical pvc pipe but opened only at the bottom was used to measure a mixed k value dominated by the vertical component kv the openings for both piezometers were covered with a geotextile mesh 250 µm pore aperture piezometers were installed in pairs to measure kh and kv with three to six pairs at different depths at each hydrological station depending on wt depth and peat thickness the shallowest pipe at each station was installed at 0 25 m below ground level bgl with k assessed at this depth for stations with a water table within 0 15 m bgl during the rainy season depending on peat thickness modified bail tests were also performed on piezometers installed at 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 and 1 50 m bgl piezometers were purged before each bail test until the same recovery response was obtained for three consecutive withdrawals cardenas and zlotnik 2003 following the last purge a pressure transducer micro diver van essen instruments and a steel rod of known volume were installed in the pipe after 24 h the steel rod was quickly removed to produce an immediate water drop that started the test tests were repeated two or three times for each piezometer all k tests were conducted during the wet season from march april 2017 and december 2017 march 2018 the hydraulic conductivity tests were performed when it had not rained during the previous 48 h to avoid errors due to changes in water availability hanschke and baird 2001 we also discarded all the test results that had a recovery period longer than 24 h and those with recoveries that differ in more than 5 to the original wt supplementary material 1 additionally ten soil samples each 2500 cm2 50 50 cm on each side and 65 cm deep were extracted from different hydrological stations to perform vertical and horizontal falling head darcy s column ksat tests fetter 2001 those samples were extracted from four stations in huachipampa four in moyobamba and two in piticocha during april 2017 after extraction each sample was isolated using wax and transported to the soil hydrology laboratory agricultural engineering department la molina national university in lima 2 3 vegetation sampling vegetation composition was sampled in august 2018 using five plots each 1 m2 around each hydrological station percent canopy cover was visually estimated for each vascular plant species present as well as five categories moss shallow pools deep pools dead cushions and bare mineral soil chytrý and otýpková 2003 plant species nomenclature follows the angiosperm phylogeny group version iv apg iv chase et al 2016 2 4 data analyses hydrological data were analyzed to identify wt seasonality and variability between peatlands the water level measurements for all monitoring wells were used to create an interpolated wt map the horizontal hydraulic gradient was used to describe the principal water flow patterns the flow pattern combined with the vhg measurements were used to identify groundwater recharge and discharge zones in each peatland after correcting for atmospheric pressure the logger measured wt data for hua 12 pit 11 and moy 18 were converted to daily time series and decomposed in their seasonal and random components madsen 2008 mudelsee 2014 finally the data from these stations were compared with precipitation and manual wt measurements in all hydrological stations to identify seasonal patterns a time series analysis was applied to decompose the daily wt series into its temporal components seasonality trend and random the wt random component allowed us to identify water level changes in response to individual precipitation events independent of seasonal or temporal trend changes it is obtained by subtracting seasonality and trend from the measured water table values eq 1 1 wt random wt observed w t seasonality wt trend the random component was used to evaluate whether the wt responded to rain falling directly on the peatland during the dry season or to groundwater discharge for that comparison we used a cross correlation analysis that compared the wt random component at hua 12 pit 11 and moy 18 with precipitation measured at huachipampa paucarcocha

were compared using one way and two way anova and post hoc tukey honestly significant difference hsd tests borcard et al 2018 indicator value analysis indval de cáceres et al 2012 was used to identify indicator species for each plant community previously defined applying a k means cluster analysis a canonical correspondence analysis cca ter braak 1986 was performed to explore the relationships between the plant communities and measured environmental variables including the deepest and shallowest wt wt range average vhg and peat layer thickness we evaluated the significance of the cca based on the total variability explained by the first two axes eigenvalues and using a monte carlo permutation test to assess the consistency of the ordination borcard et al 2018 the influence of each environmental variable on the ordination was evaluated based on the intra set correlation between environmental variables and the cca axes the segregation obtained using this method was compared with the k means partition to explain differences in vegetation composition related to the environmental variables linear mixed models were used to identify the hydrological and vegetation variables most correlated with peat hydraulic conductivity at 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 m bgl these comparisons interpreted groundwater flow patterns governed by k vegetation composition differences and water availability changes all statistical analyses and figures were developed using r 4 1 0 r core team 2021 and q gis 3 18 3 q gis development team 2020 3 results 3 1 water table and flow patterns a strong seasonal pattern of wt depth occurred in all three study sites fig 2 the shallowest wt occurred during the wet season averaging 0 09 0 29 and 0 28 m bgl at moyobamba piticocha and huachipampa the deepest wt occurred in the dry season may through november with average depths of 0 46 0 51 and 0 39 m bgl for the three sites logger based wt readings at hua 12 pit 11 and moy 18 had similar patterns with the wt rising during the rainy season and deepening during the dry season at moyobamba where an artificial drainage network occurs wt variance was most significant and dry season wt was deeper even though mean annual precipitation was highest contour maps of the wt and vertical hydraulic gradients fig 3 indicated that ground water entered each peatland in its highest elevation area the wt contours generally followed the ground surface slope with minor variations influenced by topographic rises that increased water levels and the presence of streams or ditches that functioned as hydrologic sinks maps of the vertical hydraulic gradient vhg identified areas of perennial groundwater discharge with distinct seasonality during the wet season the vhg was predominantly positive indicating upward flow due to discharge from surrounding aquifers or neutral fig 3a 3c and 3e these patterns reversed during the dry season fig 3b 3d and 3f indicating that in most cases the flow trended downward recharging the underlying aquifer or more commonly discharging to nearby streams in all sites and seasons vhg was positive near the upper peatland margins where perennial aquifer discharge occurred the analysis of wt data in hua 12 pit 11 and moy 18 shown ach precipitation event during the dry season caused a slow and gradual wt rise lagged by more than 24 h these lag times had statistically significant cross correlations for periods of one to four days after each precipitation event indicating a response related to transit times in the surrounding aquifer system table 2 3 2 hydraulic conductivity the highest kh and kv occurred at 0 25 to 0 75 m soil depth in all sites while the lowest and least variable kh and kv occurred at 1 00 to 1 50 m depth fig 4 the geometric mean of kh at 0

comparisons tukey hsd indicated that the differences were in soil layers from 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl p 0 05 while at 1 00 m bgl and deeper no significant differences occurred table 3 the kv geometric mean ranged from 0 07 m day 1 at 0 25 m to 0 002 m day 1 at 1 00 m bgl similar to kh the highest variability of kv occurred from 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl while peat at 1 m and deeper was relatively homogenous the difference in kv between 0 25 and 0 75 m bgl ranged from 0 07 m day 1 to 0 009 m day 1 while in the three deepest peat layers kv varied from 0 008 to 0 002 m day 1 also for kv differences between strata were significant p 0 05 and the paired comparisons demonstrated that these differences are caused by the two shallowest layers 0 25 and 0 50 m bgl the anisotropy ratio kv kh varied from 0 057

than the field measurements however laboratory and field tests had the same kv kh ratio 0 10 and a similar relationship between the 0 25 and 0 50 m bgl layers indicating that the field measurements accurately represented depth variability and the ratio between the vertical and horizontal components of k 3 3 vegetation fifty vascular plant species were found in the study plots and three communities characterized by 17 species were identified using k means cluster analysis supplementary material 2 community c1 occurred in heavily grazed parts of piticocha and moyobamba with werneria pygmaea plantago rigida and lachemilla pinnata having the highest canopy cover and distichia muscoides having 20 cover the wt in c1 was more than 0 30 m bgl during the wet season and 0 60 m during the dry season community c2 was dominated by the grasses calamagrostis spicigera and calamagrostis chrysantha and occurred in the lower parts of huachipampa and moyobamba the wt in c2 had the highest variability ranging from 0 04 m in the wet season to 0 68 m bgl in the dry season community c3 occurred in upper huachipampa piticocha and moyobamba in areas with light grazing pressure and was dominated by distichia muscoides the wt was within 0 50 m bgl all year twenty community indicators were identified using the indval procedure c1 had the most indicators with nine species including lachemilla pinnata l diplophyla werneria pygmaea plantago tubulosa and p rigida c2 had seven indicator species including calamagrostis spicigera c chrysantha festuca rigida and carex humahuacaensis occupying seasonally flooded pools c3 had only two indicator species distichia muscoides and oritrophium limnophilum both typical andean peatland species benavides et al 2013 cooper et al 2019 2010 the constrained eigenvalue for cca axis 1 is 83 3 explaining 61 2 of the total variance in the vegetation data set fig 5 cca axis 2 had an eigenvalue of 41 8 explaining 30 7 of the variance both cca1

in this community c2 sites were plotted near the top of the ordination space positively correlated with the shallowest wt in the rainy season and the highest wt range three indicator species for this group festuca rigida feri calamagrostis spicigera casp and calamagrostis chrysantha cach have their centroids located inside the cluster c3 plots are on the left of the ordination space associated with the thickest peat positive or neutral vhg a relatively shallow wt during the dry season and small annual wt range distichia muscoides dimu is the dominant species in c3 and its centroid was located within this group 3 4 effects of hydrology and vegetation composition on kh and kv significant differences in kh by soil layer were found within and between communities two way anova p 0 001 and the interaction of soil depth and community was also significant p 0 01 table 5 paired community comparisons indicated that c3 had higher kh and was significantly different from c1 tukey hsd tests p 0 05 while c2 was intermediate and highly variable differences between communities were driven by higher and more variable kh at 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl than in strata deeper than 1 00 m bgl while kh was similar for all layers statistically significant differences in kv occurred between communities and peat layers two way anova p 0 001 the paired analysis identified soil layers at 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl in c3 as the principal difference between communities tukey hsd kv was higher in c3 than c1 and c2 at 0 25 to 0 75 m bgl but at 1 00 m bgl and deeper was not significantly different we found

k values ground surface cushion and pool microtopography and dominance of distichia muscoides in areas with stable water availability suggest that the three sites had a common origin similar to other peatlands in the peruvian puna skrzypek et al 2011 we recently collected peat cores 3 10 m long from huachipampa piticocha and seven other peatlands in the cañete basin headwaters and preliminary analyses indicate that the peat is relatively homogeneous and composed almost entirely of distichia muscoides remains unpublished data 2021 the three study sites formed in areas where perennial groundwater discharge supported cushion plant communities and peat accumulation filled glacially carved valley bottoms benavides et al 2013 cooper et al 2019 2010 hribljan et al 2015 skrzypek et al 2011 the peatland hydraulic conductivity was highest in the upper soil layers and lower in deeper layers however land use and vegetation cover changes modified these patterns mccarter et al 2020 in nor yauyos cochas significant land use changes have occurred since colonial times including the introduction of nonnative sheep and cattle domic et al 2018 progressive intensification of grazing as the human population increased struelens et al 2017 and ditching in the 20th century dewind 1975 sarmiento et al 2000 this has resulted in significant changes in vegetation composition and structure of the peat bodies particularly at moyabamba and piticocha the three study sites maintained similar hydraulic conductivities in the deeper soils but significant differences now occur in the upper soil layers where modern land uses have modified the vegetation and soil table 7 4 2 hydrology many mountain peatlands worldwide are groundwater fed fens particularly in arid or semiarid regions bao et al 2010 millar et al 2018 o neill et al 2020 wolf and cooper 2015 our study peatlands developed in mountain valley bottoms with underlying glacial till alluvium and lacustrine sediments megard et al 1996 quispesivina and navarro 2003 and surrounding hillslopes covered by glacial moraines talus alluvium and colluvium seasonal precipitation directly recharges the peatland as well as hillslope aquifers that produce perennial groundwater discharge into each peatland supporting high water tables elmes and price 2019 somers and mckenzie 2020 glacier meltwater is often suggested to be the principal water source for andean peatlands dangles et al 2017 polk et al 2017 but the absence of glaciers in the study watersheds indicates the water source for peatlands is precipitation and precipitation recharged groundwater not glaciers a two to three day time lag of the wt response to dry season precipitation events created a smooth water table rise at huachipampa that is indicative of slowly increasing groundwater discharge as its water source ahmad et al 2021 heliotis and dewitt 1987 most peatlands in the central andes have seasonally variable groundwater discharge from surrounding aquifers that maintain a shallow wt during the wet season and deepens during the dry season yet still supports peat accumulation cooper et al 2019 millar et al 2018 reduced annual precipitation could affect aquifer storage producing insufficient groundwater discharge in the dry season that could degrade peatland integrity elmes and price 2019 4 3 water table and vegetation composition the vegetation composition of peatlands is strongly related to gradients of water table depth source water chemistry and other environmental processes cooper et al 2010 domic et al 2021 harris and baird 2019 lemly and cooper 2011 recent changes in climate and human activities also affect the vegetation dieleman et al 2015 kokkonen et al 2019 schimelpfenig et al 2014 the vegetation composition of our study sites is correlated with hydrological regime and comparable to peatland vegetation differences found in other mountain glina et al 2019 millar et al 2018 and non mountain regions breeuwer et al 2009 menberu et al 2016 our three study peatlands had distinctly different water table depths and vegetation composition even though their seasonal precipitation regime landscape positions peat thickness and likely age are similar the small watersheds limit total water delivery conditions where drainage ditches can significantly impact water table depth at moyobamba ditches have increased wt variability and maximum depth the duration and intensity of water table decline particularly during the long dry season is one plausible cause for explaining differences in vegetation composition in areas with shallow and stable water tables distichia muscoides a key species of andean alpine peatlands is dominant with a high capacity to accumulate peat benavides et al 2013 chimner et al 2019 cooper et al 2015 in contrast where seasonally deeper water tables occur the vegetation is dominated by species adapted to drier soil conditions including plantago rigida plantago tubulosa werneria pygmaea calamagrostis spicigera and calamagrostis chrysantha salvador et al 2014 these species have little capacity to form peat because they produce little below ground biomass medrano et al 2012 additionally they are adapted to drier conditions with higher decomposition rates rydin and jeglum 2015 4 4 implications for management under future climates in the central andes the study peatlands are supported by hillslope aquifers and direct precipitation during the rainy season and are highly susceptible to climate change that reduces available water due to their small size location in headwater catchments and lack of connection to larger regional aquifers that could provide more stable water sources kløve et al 2014 this is a concern in the central andes because the long dry season creates a regional water deficit that cannot be fully compensated by wet season precipitation in all years correa et al 2016 giráldez et al 2020 ipcc 2021 2014 hydrological alterations associated with climate changes could trigger future vegetation and peat structure changes combined with intensive human interventions such as drainage and overgrazing these alterations can exacerbate peatland degradation breeuwer et al 2009 cooper et al 2019 menberu et al 2016 these processes could combine to reduce or eliminate the capacity of some peatlands to provide ecosystem services such as carbon capture and sustainable pastures for livestock this new ecosystem state lacking dominance by cushion plants and with high rates of carbon loss may be difficult to restore ahmad et al 2021 chimner et al 2017 harris and baird 2019 holden 2005 schimelpfenig et al 2014 more detailed knowledge of peatland hydrologic processes could help identify early stages of degradation that are essential to propose effective interventions to manage or restore these valuable ecosystems this research is the initiation of a long term analysis of bofedale hydrologic regimes and ecosystem processes in the peruvian puna a longer data record through additional wet and dry periods should produce new and informative conclusions additional rain gauges through the complex mountain region would also help provide a better record of precipitation in watersheds supporting bofedales peat aging and isotopic and macrofossil analyses of peat cores will also help clarify the development of these peatlands additional and larger diameter piezometer networks infiltration analyses and laboratory tests will also aid in further quantifying vhg kv kh porosity specific yield and other important hydrologic and hydraulic indicators 5 conclusion groundwater inflow from adjacent hillslope aquifers was the principal water source for the three study peatlands its variability was reflected in different water table dynamics hydraulic conductivities and vertical hydraulic gradients between sites nevertheless similar k of the deeper peat layers combined with a common distichia muscoides created cushion and pool microtopography suggests a common origin for the three sites even though distichia is dominant today only in areas with the most stable shallow groundwater levels we suggest that these peatlands originated as groundwater fed fens dominated by d muscoides that formed most of the peat and created the landforms that exist today however due to human intervention the hydrological patterns vegetation composition and soils of the three peatlands are now distinct understanding the hydrologic dynamics of central andes peatlands is particularly important given the essential ecosystem services they provide and their potential sensitivity to climate changes reductions in water availability and increased thermal regimes have been occurring in the central andes since the little ice age rabatel et al 2005 and are predicted to continue in the future huerta lavado casimiro 2021 ipcc 2021 the high andes have historically been occupied by humans engaged in pastoralist activities domic et al 2018 yager et al 2019 but ongoing and future changes in peatlands could limit their use for livestock pastures which would significantly reduce the economic opportunities for indigenous communities research on groundwater availability can inform helpful interventions and restoration activities to mitigate past land use impacts and help andean residents adapt to ongoing climate

3363,the darling river system in australia is under pressure from water extraction and climate change management interventions such as environmental flow releases require understanding of water storage dynamics and the connectivity of floodplains and wetlands such knowledge can be gleaned from the long observational record of the landsat series of satellite sensors and high 5 m resolution digital elevation models derived from airborne light detection and ranging lidar here for the first time we develop and demonstrate an approach to reconstruct 16 day floodplain water dynamics including extent depth and volume for a long landsat time series 1987 to present time series mapping of surface water extent at 5 m resolution was achieved by topographic downscaling of landsat derived surface water data we propose a simple and effective algorithm to restore missing data in the images caused by e g cloud and shadows swath edges and the landsat 7 scan line corrector slc failure thereby increasing the number of useable images five fold the 5 m surface water extent maps clearly delineate the narrow river channel and the boundary of floodplain wetlands they can capture the development peak and retreat of flood events by combining landsat and airborne lidar observations we produced time series of surface water depth mapping at 5 m resolution accounting for the degree of hydraulic surface water connectivity based on these maps we derived 16 day floodplain volume dynamics for 1987 to present the correlation coefficient between upstream river flow records and floodplain volume time series was 0 88 indicating that the estimates were robust the algorithms developed can be used for ongoing very high resolution mapping to assist in managing human water use and

degradation such as the release of environmental flows require a detailed understanding of water volume dynamics and the connectivity of floodplains and wetlands to be effective and accepted by stakeholders inundation extent and water depth are required to estimate floodplain water volume alsdorf et al 2007a due to the hydraulic complexity low gradient sheer size and inaccessibility of the darling river s floodplains it is impractical to use in situ gauging to routinely measure water depth a conventional alternative is to use a one or two dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate floodplain inundation mechanistic modelling uses mass and momentum continuity equations such as the navier stokes and derived saint venant equations to describe water movement in river floodplains dutta et al 2013 following increases in computing capability and data availability regional continental and global hydrodynamic models have been developed to simulate river floodplain dynamics e g de paiva et al 2013 dutta et al 2000 sampson et al 2015 yamazaki et al 2011 however the variable quality of input data levels of model complexity changes in landscape and climate conditions and parameter uncertainties combine to cause considerable uncertainty in flood inundation modelling bates et al 2013 satellite remote sensing provides a demonstrated capacity to routinely monitor water extent and level dynamics across rivers and their floodplains various continental and global scale surface water extent datasets have been produced from satellite observations alsdorf et al 2007b for example modis satellite observations are used in the generation of surface water extent mapping with sampling between 1 and 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 m guerschman et al 2011 ji et al 2018 global inundation maps at higher spatial resolution e g 90 m have been produced by topographic downscaling coarse scale remote sensing data aires et al 2017 fluet chouinard et al 2015 more recently long term archives donchyts et al 2016 mueller et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 hou et al 2019 of monthly surface water mapping from 1984 to 2020 at ca 30 m resolution based on the landsat series of sensors have proved a valuable resource for understanding hydrological dynamics optical sensors such as the landsat and modis imagers have enabled the analysis of temporal changes in the inundation of floodplain wetlands over long periods di vittorio and georgakakos 2018 sakamoto et al 2007 thomas et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 using landsat data heimhuber et al 2017 developed empirical models of inundation dynamics as a function of river discharge rainfall evapotranspiration and soil moisture however optical remote sensing tends to be affected by cloud cover especially during flood events synthetic aperture radar sar has been used to mitigate this issue and generally provide more reliable estimates of inundation extent hess et al 2003 lang et al 2008 martinez and letoan 2007 töyrä and pietroniro 2005 töyrä et al 2001 airborne light detection and ranging lidar data have been used to correct landsat based inundation mapping or to improve the spatial resolution of floodplain products by calculating subpixel inundation percentage huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 wu et al 2019 the application of remote sensing to floodplain dynamics has advanced from measuring water extent to estimating water volume the most common approach to estimate water volume is to use a digital elevation model dem combined with either empirical equations lane and d amico 2010 the filling and spilling procedure jones et al 2018 lhomme et al 2008 the planar method teng et al 2015 or methods using a height above the nearest drainage hand model nobre et al 2011 each of these techniques can lead to overestimation of floodplain inundation volume if they incorrectly include areas that are not inundated or connected at the given flood level several studies estimated water storage in floodplain wetlands using altimetry data in combination with existing inundation data frappart et al 2008 frappart et al 2010 optical remote sensing normandin et al 2018 or sar ahmad et al 2020 frappart et al 2005 yuan et al 2017 however altimetry measures water elevation rather than inundation depth as it does not penetrate the water column to the river bed in addition altimetry measurements are acquired along discrete and widely spaced tracks and so may not measure water elevation in disconnected water bodies moreover the spatial and temporal sampling resolution as well as the historical availability of altimetry measurements remains currently limited high resolution dems typically derived from lidar measurements can help spatially estimate water depth at a given water level however water distribution in a floodplain also depends on its connectivity to the river channel and the connection between water bodies on the floodplain high resolution surface water mapping is required to provide inundation area and surface water connectivity although landsat can measure long term surface water dynamics at a spatial resolution of 30 m this resolution is insufficient to discern the detailed floodplain features apparent in higher resolution dems other challenges with using landsat imagery include the large number of missing data due to clouds and cloud shadows steep topography and terrain shadows and the scan line failure slc in landsat 7 they limit the ability to derive 16 day or even monthly surface water extent time series from landsat some studies produced seasonal annual or multi year averaged surface water mapping to address this e g halabisky et al 2016 huang et al 2014 but none of these studies were designed to provide near real time information for floodplain wetlands we aimed to produce 16 day water extent and depth mapping and water storage time series in floodplain wetlands from 1987 to the present by combining landsat derived surface water mapping with lidar dem to achieve this we produced 5 m spatial resolution surface water mapping from topographic downscaling of landsat derived surface water mapping in contrast to existing 30 m and monthly resolution landsat products e g pekel et al 2016 the spatial and temporal resolution of our product is improved to 5 m and 16 day thus better serving the needs for water management in the highly complex river systems in the murry darling basin we developed a simple and effective automated algorithm to restore missing data in landsat images and produce a continuous surface water extent time series the method can fill gaps due to missing data reliably irrespective of the size shape and number of missing pixels in the image the restored spatial time series can reliably describe the development and retreat of flood events neither dem nor altimetry based approaches to measuring water depth consider hydraulic connectivity between surface water bodies resulting in potentially large uncertainties in estimating water volumes in this study surface water connectivity was estimated at each timestep so spatial water depth could be calculated for individual water bodies in the floodplain all methods developed here are readily automated and suitable to monitor changes in the floodplain wetlands we tested the methodology in a 30 km long river reach of the barwon darling river a semi arid lowland river with extensive floodplain and wetland systems the presence of disconnected on farm water storages and flood harvesting levees and canals along this river reach also highlights the importance of investigating water volume in the floodplain for better water management 2 data and method 2 1 study area the barwon darling river is a semi arid lowland river in the northern part of the murray darling basin mdb in southeast australia fig 1 d the average annual rainfall and runoff over the region are about 328 mm and 6 mm 1895 2006 respectively but are highly variable from year to year csiro 2008 there are nearly 63 000 ha of land that can be irrigated 92 of which is intended for cotton production water resources extraction from surface water and sub surface sources were 230 gl year and 10gl year respectively csiro 2008 the river has a low gradient of 0 05 m km between walgett and brewarrina woodyer et al 1979 it has a catchment area of 650 000 km2 receiving inflows from several tributaries including the macquarie castlereagh namoi gwydir macintyre and condamine balonne rivers the low relief and erratic rainfall have given rise to extensive floodplain and wetland systems with extended low or no flow periods and infrequent large floods thoms and sheldon 2000 water resources development and climate variability have caused several environmental calamities over the past decades such as a major blue green algal bloom in 1991 bowling and baker 1996 a decline in diversity and abundance of native fish gehrke et al 1995 and mass fish deaths in 2019 vertessy et al 2019 we focused on a 30 km stretch of river nearby the town of bourke with a river flow gauging station at both its upstream and downstream end the reach was chosen because of its complexity and importance for water management the streamflow from most of the river s tributaries enter upstream of the township of bourke while there is a net loss of river flows downstream of bourke because high rates of infiltration and evaporation and low inflows from tributaries brennan et al 2002 finally the selected river reach includes multiple ephemeral floodplain wetlands on farm storages and flood harvesting levees and irrigation canals 2 2 data the elevation information system elvis archive developed by geoscience australia provides dem products at various spatial resolutions in this study we used the 1 m lidar dem product fig 1b acquired by the new south wales nsw government spatial services in november 2020 the data have an accuracy of 0 3 m vertically and 0 8 m horizontally to improve the accuracy we resampled the data to 5 m which was still of sufficiently high resolution to show all relevant hydraulic features visible in the original 1 m data whilst reducing computational demand the river network network connectivity network node water body and sub catchment boundaries fig 1c were obtained from the australian hydrological geospatial fabric geofabric the geofabric is a gis based dataset of spatial surface and groundwater characteristics derived from the 9 anudem raster streams product bureau of meteorology 2012a b in situ river discharge measurements up and downstream of the study region red dots in fig 1c were obtained from nsw government website waternsw https realtimedata waternsw com au the water observations from space wofs dataset was developed by geoscience australia and provides 25 m resolution historical surface water observations across the australian continent from 1987 to the present the product is derived from the landsat series of satellites mueller et al 2016 inundation is mapped automatically across the entire continental by a decision tree classifier using spectral reflectance and derived indices with a documented accuracy of 97 mueller et al 2016 the water summary product fig 1a and the 16 day surface water map time series from wofs were used here the water summary product is a single layer that provides data on the recurrence frequency of inundation calculated as the ratio of the number of times water was detected over the total number of clear sky observations in the full time series of each pixel 2 3 method in the following subsections we describe in detail the steps used to produce 16 day floodplain water volume dynamics from 1987 present the workflow is summarized in fig 2 and include 1 defining the river reach boundary based on geofabric subsection 2 3 1 2 producing 5 m spatial resolution surface water mapping by topographic downscaling of landsat derived surface water mapping subsection 2 3 2 3 automatic restoration of missing data in 16 day landsat derived surface water mapping subsection 2 3 3 4 deriving 16 day and 5 m resolution water depth maps based on restored and downscaled landsat derived surface water extent and the lidar dem subsection 2 3 4 5 estimating 16 day time series 1987 present of water volume stored on floodplain wetlands by river reach and comparing floodplain volume dynamics with river flows recorded at upstream gauging station subsection 2 3 4 2 3 1 river reach boundary delineation before reconstructing floodplain water volume dynamics the hydrological boundary of the study region and floodplain wetlands connected to the river system needed to be delineated the network nodes in the geofabric vector layer connect river segments and indicate network connectivity and flow direction river segments from the geofabric in the study region were chosen based on their connectivity to upstream and downstream gauging stations and their corresponding sub catchments were merged river reaches and floodplain wetlands were fully connected within each of these sub catchments in the maximum inundation condition the outer bound of all merged sub catchments is regarded here as the overall river reach catchment boundary fig 1c any tributaries that contribute additional flows other than those from the upstream gauging station were eliminated as we wished to examine the relationship between the upstream flow and water volume stored on the floodplain we also did not consider artificial water bodies because human actions i e pumping mainly determines their volume the boundaries of constructed water storages e g on farm storages are delineated in the geofabric fig 1c we used this data to remove man made water bodies e g on farm storages in the study region finally we disregarded all water bodies that were entirely disconnected from the floodplain even at maximum water level conditions i e surface water summary mapping at recurrence frequency of 0 5 the refined study region is shown in fig 1d 2 3 2 downscaling water extent the next step was to downscale the landsat wofs surface water maps to 5 m resolution using an approach we refer to as topographic downscaling in general the higher the elevation of a pixel the lower the frequency of inundation the central assumption in downscaling landsat water extent mapping using the dem is that there is a negative relationship between elevation and inundation frequency within each region once established at the 25 m scale the relationship can be used to estimate water recurrence frequency in each high resolution 5 m 5 m grid cell based on elevation derived from the dem the principle of the downscaling method is as follows we calculated average dem derived water surface elevation for specific inundation frequency intervals from the wofs summary product given in table 1 if there is a strong negative correlation between elevation and frequency the relationship can be used to downscale surface water extent mapping we then related recurrence frequency to elevation using cumulative distribution function cdf matching specifically a rank based look up table was constructed to relate each elevation value to its corresponding recurrence frequency next for each cell value in the dem the nearest dem values in the look up table was found finally the recurrence frequency was estimated by interpolating the two recurrence frequency values with corresponding ranks in the look up table the results of applying the topographic downscaling are given in fig 3 the figure shows a 500 m 500 m region of the study area with the original 25 m wofs product fig 3b compared with the 5 m resolution inundation frequency summary map for different recurrence frequencies e g fig 3c f assuming the elevation recurrence frequency relationship was robust in individual hydrologic unit we applied the algorithm in each sub catchment fig 1c from the geofabric across the entire river reach 2 3 3 gap filling missing image data in this study 1839 wofs images were used to derive water volume dynamics from 1987 to present only 267 images were identified as having 5 missing data per scene while 621 images had 70 missing data per scene fig s1 however we found that of the 267 clear images not one of them contained a flood event the average fraction of missing data even increased after 2003 due to the landsat 7 slc failure this meant that the process of gap filling missing data was very important to provide a larger number of water observations for our investigation especially during flooding events many images had missing data due to data acquisition swath edges and the landsat 7 slc failure and pixel quality control esp cloud and cloud shadow masking we regarded images with less than 5 missing data as good quality images for the remaining images with between 5 and 70 missing data we replaced the missing data with estimated as follows overlaying the water classification map for a specific date onto the inundation recurrence frequency map enable us to identify the likelihood that pixels with missing values were inundated at that same time for each inundation map for a given date we used all valid pixels and compared its classification i e inundated or not with the recurrence frequency summary map next we identified the recurrence frequency providing the best match between the two maps 1 δ n i 1 j 1 i j c i j s i j k where δn is the difference in the number of pixels ci j the binary water classification value 0 or 1 of each pixel i j in the classified image for the specific date and si j f the binary water classification value 0 or 1 for the pixel in the water summary map at recurrence frequency k the differential evolution method in python scipy optimise differential evolution was used to find the minimum of δn and associated frequency k the 25 m surface water summary mapping at the inferred recurrence frequency k was used to fill the missing data in the original image and 16 day and 25 m restored surface water mapping was produced meanwhile 16 day and 5 m surface water products were also developed by substituting each wofs image with the 5 m surface water summary mapping derived in section 2 3 2 at the corresponding recurrence frequency k finally to assess the accuracy of our gap filling approach we randomly selected 100 good quality wofs images we then removed pixels for ten randomly selected 2 km 2 km squares region overlapping or not in each image mimicking missing data for between 5 and 54 of the total area we applied the gap filling algorithm to estimate the removed data and compared this with the original images we repeated this experiment 100 times with random missing data scenarios and calculated the average error for each image 2 3 4 water depth mapping several studies estimate water depth as the difference between a spatially uniform water surface elevation and the dem jones et al 2018 lane and d amico 2010 lhomme et al 2008 nobre et al 2011 teng et al 2015 regardless of the particular method employed i e the planar method filling and spilling or altimetry this does not consider the gradient of the water surface which can lead to underestimates of water depth upstream and overestimates downstream furthermore the water level can be heterogeneous if parts of the floodplain are unconnected to the main channel or isolated from each other at a given flood level we sought to develop a pragmatic approach to mitigate these issues the 5 m surface water product section 2 3 3 shows the detailed dynamics in surface water connectivity from 1987 to the present which provides information to mitigate the issues discussed before combining the mapping with the dem to produce water depth we segmented the surface water extent based on connectivity for each 16 day and 5 m surface water map next using the dem we calculated the average elevation along the boundary of each segmented flood areas the average elevation served as an estimate of water surface height for the extent of inundated area gridded water depth was subsequently estimated by subtracting elevation from the average elevation at the water s edge water depth mapping across the whole region was produced by merging gridded water depth maps for each segmented surface water water volumes stored on the floodplain were then estimated by summing the product of total gridded water depths and grid area 25 m2 to our knowledge this produced the first 5 m floodplain water depth mapping in the murray darling basin therefore it is not possible to directly validate either individual 5 m water depth maps or the frequency summary map instead we used upstream river flow records to validate the volume dynamics derived from our 5 m water depth maps a strong correlation between river inflows and resulting floodplain volumes can be taken as an indication of robustness in our 5 m water depth maps 3 results 3 1 elevation and water recurrence relationship to validate the assumptions underpinning the topographic downscaling method we examined the relationship between landsat derived recurrence frequency and the dem in each sub catchment of the study region a strong negative correlation between these two suggests that our method is effective and reasonable for each sub catchment of the study area we used the average dem values and the recurrence frequencies at different intervals i e groups labelled a j in table 1 and calculated their correlation as the relationship between water recurrence frequency and elevation cannot be assumed to be linear we calculated spearman s rank correlation the spearman s rank correlations between recurrence frequency intervals table 1 and corresponding average elevation for the 59 sub catchments in the study region are shown in fig 4 among them 53 sub catchments have strong negative correlations 0 7 three sub catchments on the western and eastern boundaries show weaker correlations 0 4 because these catchments were inundated during the most extensive flooding events only thus limiting the number of data points the six sub catchments in the middle of the reach have moderate correlations between 0 8 and 0 4 correlations might be expected to be higher than this but the coarse sub catchment delineation from the geofabric affected the elevation frequency relationship the distribution of water levels at different recurrence frequency intervals before and after the downscaling processing in five catchments is shown in fig 5 the water level range is greater in the original images at frequencies of 5 50 in catchment 1 2 and 5 because of landsat s limited abilities to distinguish narrow river channels from floodplains for the same reason the distribution at frequencies between 1 and 5 is higher in catchment 3 where frequency values distribute unevenly on the boundary between floodplain channels and floodwater in contrast the patterns before and after the downscaling processing are similar for floodwaters in catchment 4 especially below 20 frequency because the inundation area is sufficiently large to be detected in the landsat imagery 3 2 comparison of 5 m water mapping against 25 m product we compared the newly developed 5 m water map against the original wofs 25 m water map and lidar dem first we inspected if the detailed hydrological features in the dem are reflected in the 5 m water depth mapping second we investigated whether the differences between 5 m and 25 m maps could be attributed to the enhanced spatial resolution or caused by errors in the downscaling method third we examined any artefacts caused by merging mapping in individual sub catchments the boundary of the river channel and its tributaries can be seen clearly in the 1 m lidar dem fig 3a and fig 7a these characteristics are pixelated in wofs summary maps due to the coarser 25 m resolution of the underlying data fig 3b and fig 7b after downscaling the derived 5 m inundation frequency map fig 3c and fig 7c shows greater consistency with features in the dem the difference between 25 m and 5 m surface water summary mapping is presented in figs 6 and 7 the recurrence frequency in the river channel significantly increased red colouring in fig 6b and 7d to nearly 80 and the distribution pattern of frequency values is more homogeneous in the 5 m downscaled map fig 6a and fig 7c this is because the original landsat mapping underestimated permanent inundation in the narrow river channel due to the lower spatial resolution the large floodplain in the middle of the study region showed decreasing recurrence frequency blue colouring outwards because of significant elevation differences in the dem fig 7 the shape of this prominent feature is more distinct in the 5 m downscaled map even water in a very narrow artificial canal catchment 8 in fig 7c connected to the floodwaters was detected the connectivity between the floodwater and river channel was also restored in the northern part of catchment 7 despite these advantages there was also an error in the delineation at the border between catchments 6 and 7 most likely because the sub catchment boundary from the geofabric was based on a coarse dem product fig 7d this results in underestimates of inundation over the east side of the river bank in catchment 6 however this artefact will not have had a significant influence as there is no inconsistency in water mapping along the other sub catchment s boundaries 3 3 effectiveness of the image gap filling algorithm gaps in the 16 day wofs imagery were filled in by the simple method proposed in section 2 3 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the gap filling method we conducted a synthetic experiment whereby a random sample of extent maps was artificially degraded by removing a portion of the imagery the method was applied to the imagery and the omission and commission errors we computed with reference to the original results indicated average omission and commission errors of the image gap filling algorithm were small at 1 6 and 1 2 respectively fig 8 among the wofs images from 1987 to present with missing data ranging from 5 to 70 swath edges and the landsat 7 slc failure were two common issues e g fig 9 a and fig 9c while cloud contamination happened relatively less frequently e g fig 9b fig 9 shows four surface water maps with contamination ratios of 55 54 46 and 42 respectively we compared clear parts of the images with the wofs summary mapping and selected inundation maps at recurrence frequencies of 23 43 3 and 3 respectively to best match the individual images these data were then used to estimate the missing data swath edges caused data gaps over half 55 of the study region but the remaining pixels allowed estimation of the missing values fig 9e similar issues can occur due to both cloud cover and swath edges but our method still dealt well with such cases 42 missing data fig 9h even when cloud covered most parts of the river and its floodplains fig 9f provided parts of the inundated area are detected our algorithm can infer the missing data 54 the landsat 7 slc failure led to missing data lines in many images after 2003 but the remaining exposed parts of river reaches and floodplains provided sufficient data to infer these missing values fig 9g 3 4 relationship between river discharge and floodplain volume surface water depth mapping at different recurrence frequencies 40 9 1 and 0 5 is shown in fig 10 the gridded water depth estimates increase as recurrence frequency decreases the average water depth was 1 m in the river channel in typical conditions e g 40 recurrence frequency and increased to almost 11 m during the largest flooding event in 1998 fig 10a and d there is no appreciable increase in water depth on the floodplain during flooding events instead the water spreads outwards further onto the floodplain for example the inundation extent was 60 km2 during the largest flood event in 1998 nearly six times the water extent 11 km2 at a more common frequency of 9 fig 10b and d the 16 day and monthly time series of water volume stored on the floodplain by river reach from 1987 present were calculated based on surface water depth mapping the water volume dynamics strongly correlate with in situ river discharge measured upstream r 0 88 for the 16 day product and r 0 91 for the monthly product fig 11 the water volume and river flow peaks matched very well especially on a monthly timescale our approach captured three flood events of different sizes in three consecutive years 2010 2012 these findings show that the developed 16 day and 5 m water depth maps are sufficiently reliable to be used to reconstruct changes in floodplain water volumes and understand their relationship to flow patterns river flows reached 2609 m3 s on september 28 1998 when floodplain water volume exceeded 80 gl surface water bodies on the western bank were fully connected during this flood river water spread overbank along the entire reach and flowed towards the southwest to replenish floodplain wetlands fig 10d in contrast floodplain wetlands were nearly completely dry during the millennium drought 2001 2009 a further notable feature is the apparent water volume that remains on the floodplain for extended periods after flood peaks in the years before 2001 but much less so after that a comparison with daily in situ river flow measurements confirms that clear wofs images i e 5 missing data largely missed all flood events fig 12 a this means it would not have been possible to use landsat observations to measure flood events in the conventional approach e g by simply ignoring contaminated images or compositing 16 day images into monthly seasonal or annual averages by contrast the restored wofs images document changes in water volume during floods nearly completely during most events e g two flood events in 2011 however our approach still missed the peak value during the second flood event in 2012 because almost the entire image was covered with cloud and hence could not be restored there is a robust correlation r 0 98 between calculated water volume and extent fig 14a described by the linear regression equation 2 v 1 41 a 2 44 where v is water volume gl and a is water extent km2 this implies a typical average water depth across the inundated area of 1 41 m across a large range of inundation extents although fig 14a suggests that the relationship breaks down at the highest flood levels 4 discussion the methodology demonstrated here includes topographic downscaling of water extent sections 2 3 2 3 1 and 3 2 inference of missing data sections 2 3 3 and 3 3 and water depth mapping based on hydraulic connectivity sections 2 3 4 and 3 4 these steps produced historical from 1987 up to very recent water extent and depth mapping at 5 m resolution from an airborne lidar dem and landsat imagery the methods combine to produce a much more temporally dense and spatially detailed history of water extent and volume across a typical river reach in southeastern australia than can be achieved using satellite data alone the derived maps provide information at a spatial resolution and temporal frequency for river managers and water management authorities to better understand floodplain harvesting and the distribution of environmental flows in the murray darling basin dutta et al 2013 the relationship between inundation and water volume is an important parameter determining river flow and its transport capacity in hydrodynamic modelling frappart et al 2005 it can also help reduce large uncertainties in computer models that predict environmental flows and improve our capacity to achieve or maintain ecological targets under climate change lee et al 2015 ostad ali askari et al 2019 woodward and wui 2001 our data can show shifts and trends in water extent depth and volume on the floodplain that can inform ecohydrological investigations such as the relationship between wetlands dynamics and species occupancy richness and diversity halabisky et al 2016 finally the low latency of landsat 8 based water extent mapping available from geoscience australia enables the application of the method in near real time with benefits for operational river forecasting the 5 m surface water mapping provides information about water distribution in floodplain wetlands and surface water connectivity the degree of surface water connectivity plays a critical role in the diversity of fish macro and micro invertebrates and algal assemblages sheldon 2019 the connection between the river channel and floodplain wetlands is also important for maintaining water quality supporting carbon nutrient and sediment cycling allowing biota dispersal and reducing the magnitude and frequency of toxic algal blooms bishop taylor et al 2018a the connection and disconnection during and after overbank flow determine how much water flows into water bodies and floodplain wetlands and how much water replenishes soil moisture to benefit floodplain vegetation compared to the 25 m surface water mapping there are several desirable enhancements in the 5 m water products highlighted in fig 13 firstly the 5 m surface water mapping can delineate the continuous water surface in the main river channel this is often difficult to achieve with the 25 m water mapping as the widths of the river are typically too narrow to be detected at landsat resolution or where water and vegetation are mixed along the riverbank krause et al 2021 although the water summary data indicate where the river flow path lies the distribution of recurrence frequency is heterogeneous along the main channel and the riverbanks cannot be distinguished consistently fig 13 secondly the boundary of inundation especially during flood events was constrained by terrain elevation and the tributaries of the river were shown distinctly in the 5 m water product fig 13 thirdly additional floodplain channels were detected in the 5 m surface water mapping for example inundation in catchment 3 at high recurrence frequency did not connect to the main channel but received water from local rainfall or after a flood event the 25 m water product does not show the narrow floodplain channels downstream fig 13 catchment 3 fourth the dynamics of floodwater on the floodplain can be shown more precisely for example in catchment 4 fig 13 the artificial canal was detected and indicated the existence of flood harvesting infrastructure the 9 dem used to delineate the boundary of sub catchments in the geofabric is substantially coarser than the lidar dem we used and this resulted in errors in boundary delineation those errors in turn may have influenced the elevation frequency relationship used for downscaling in some cases for example the boundary cuts across the main channel in catchment 5 fig 13 and floodwater belonging to catchment 7 was assigned to catchment 6 fig 7 these issues can be resolved if a better quality catchment delineation becomes available in future e g based on the same better quality lidar dem used in our analysis the workflow for topographic downscaling of the wofs product does not consider river gradient the use of the elevation frequency relationship in river water surface with steep slope could cause errors such that the recurrence frequency of river water surface in the 5 m product would become inconsistent our approach was suitable for the low gradient floodplain of the lower barwon darling river region studied here but not necessarily for regions with steeper flow gradients in this study the issue was minimised by processing each sub catchment separately the flow gradient did not vary appreciably at this scale the optical landsat observations provide several decades of historical images at relatively high spatial resolution making them the most popular remote sensing data used for understanding changes on earth zhu et al 2015 however it is difficult to find a good quality image completely free of the influence of clouds and cloud shadows or the landsat 7 slc failure among the already low frequency images the conventional way to address this issue has been to composite 16 day images into seasonal annual or 5 year averages e g yang et al 2020 or remove images with too much missing data e g krause et al 2021 however this removes information and makes it much harder to capture flood events an alternative solution is to gap fill missing data using neighbourhood pixels or adjacent temporal images but this has mainly been used to estimate relatively small areas of missing data caused by slc failure chen et al 2011 higher temporal resolution modis imagery has also been used to infer missing landsat data roy et al 2008 but no modis data are available before 2000 and the 500 m resolution modis data do not provide the same detail as the 30 m landsat images our approach offers a relatively simple and practical method to gap fill missing data in satellite based surface water mapping once parts of the river channel and floodplain have been observed those data can be used as training data to map inundation frequency and used to infer missing data we show that this approach is still applicable in strongly cloud affected images during flood events and for other contamination scenarios caused by swath edges and slc failure among others there is no requirement for auxiliary data and no need for subjective parameters or thresholds it also has the potential to be used for other optical remote sensing data e g modis and sentinel 2 the errors of the gap filling method are largely irrespective of the size shape and number of the missing parts in the image accuracy only depends on the connectivity of surface water within the image if all the surface water is connected the change of recurrence frequency is consistent along the river reach the method works best during the flood events because of higher connectivity among water bodies only a relatively narrow section encompassing the boundary of the inundated area needs to be detected for the missing parts to be filled in accurately errors are relatively greater during low flow conditions if that leads to a loss of surface water connectivity in our study area cloud issues are much less common during low flow conditions which reduces the problem in applications where this becomes an important issue it could be addressed by applying the method developed here to individual disconnected water bodies although not without reducing the available training data to some degree the relationship between river discharge and water volume was slightly different for the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph suggesting mild hysteresis with greater scatter for low flows fig 14 b c and d there is typically more cloud cover during the rising stage and these sometimes lead to large data gaps which made it impossible to determine the lag between maximum river discharge and maximum water volume fig 12b and c nonetheless a lag between water volume and river flow during the falling stage is evident this was especially clear earlier in the period where there were extended periods of water retention in wetlands after flood events e g between 1988 and 1993 fig 12b this is not due to any errors introduced by our algorithm as water extent derived from clear wofs images shows the same dynamics fig 12a more likely this feature is due to the filling of floodplain wetlands during the rising stage which become disconnected and hence do not fully drain once water levels drop the hysteresis appeared to be stronger before 2001 than in the years since which may be due to a change in floodplain hydrology associated with the millennium drought or perhaps due to increased floodplain water harvesting in later years whereby remaining floodplain water is transferred into on farm storages the change in landscape including river morphology variation and new development of water infrastructure over the past 3 5 decades could lead to uncertainties and errors in water depth mapping and water storage dynamics estimation this is because the lidar survey was only carried out in 2020 in this region and as such does not reflect landscape change back to 1987 repeated mapping of ground elevation using airborne lidar would quickly become expensive and time consuming especially over large areas and cannot be done retrospectively furthermore it remained challenging to measure surface water during the flood peak due to dense cloud coverage even though our approach could restore missing data under conditions of partial cloud cover the ka band radar interferometer from the new surface water and ocean topography swot mission could provide promising opportunities to not only mitigate this issue but also to measure both water extent and elevation of the floodplain frasson et al 2019 found that swot would be able to detect over 55 of the global flood events once operational however the landsat record will remain the most valuable data source with both historical legacy and continuity in ongoing observations with the addition of the similar sentinel 2 satellites and landsat 9 launched in 2021 to continue the work of its predecessors masek et al 2020 5 conclusions the algorithms developed in this study can produce historic and ongoing water extent and depth mapping at a spatial resolution of 5 m by merging landsat with an airborne lidar dem based on the water depth mapping 16 day water volumes stored in the floodplain were estimated from 1987 to the present we found a robust negative relationship between water elevation and recurrence frequency at the sub catchment scale these relationships can be used to interpret subpixel information of landsat images from dem data the newly developed higher resolution water extent maps help mitigate the limitations of landsat in detecting narrow river channels and tributaries as well as the precise boundary of floodplain inundation extent these maps also provide accurate data on surface water connectivity at different river levels or discharge which is essential information for water managers to determine the distribution of water use and environmental flows in order to balance water demand for farmers with maintaining healthy floodplain ecosystems landsat images are generally unsuited for detecting flood events because the low temporal resolution is exacerbated by cloud cover during flood periods we developed a simple and effective method to gap fill missing image data irrespective of the size shape and number of the missing parts in the image the method is used to find the recurrence frequency that corresponds to the minimum difference between water time series map and inundation frequency summary map missing values can subsequently be gap filled using the water summary map omission and commission errors of this method were only 1 6 and 1 2 respectively and this procedure increased the number of useable images by a factor of five water depth was estimated by combining the 5 m lidar dem and the water extent map accounting for the degree of hydraulic connectivity among different surface water bodies i e the river channel and floodplain wetlands vs disconnected water bodies the explicit consideration of connectivity proved a critical aspect that has generally been ignored in previous studies the 16 day water volume time series showed a strong correlation r 0 88 with gauged river flows and reflected the peak lags between river flow and water volume after flood events as water retained in floodplain wetlands the algorithms developed here can be applied elsewhere in the murray darling basin and beyond provided a higher resolution dem and derived hydrographic sub catchment maps are available the derived water extent and depth products should provide helpful information for river modellers river managers and water management authorities in their mission to

3363,the darling river system in australia is under pressure from water extraction and climate change management interventions such as environmental flow releases require understanding of water storage dynamics and the connectivity of floodplains and wetlands such knowledge can be gleaned from the long observational record of the landsat series of satellite sensors and high 5 m resolution digital elevation models derived from airborne light detection and ranging lidar here for the first time we develop and demonstrate an approach to reconstruct 16 day floodplain water dynamics including extent depth and volume for a long landsat time series 1987 to present time series mapping of surface water extent at 5 m resolution was achieved by topographic downscaling of landsat derived surface water data we propose a simple and effective algorithm to restore missing data in the images caused by e g cloud and shadows swath edges and the landsat 7 scan line corrector slc failure thereby increasing the number of useable images five fold the 5 m surface water extent maps clearly delineate the narrow river channel and the boundary of floodplain wetlands they can capture the development peak and retreat of flood events by combining landsat and airborne lidar observations we produced time series of surface water depth mapping at 5 m resolution accounting for the degree of hydraulic surface water connectivity based on these maps we derived 16 day floodplain volume dynamics for 1987 to present the correlation coefficient between upstream river flow records and floodplain volume time series was 0 88 indicating that the estimates were robust the algorithms developed can be used for ongoing very high resolution mapping to assist in managing human water use and environmental health in the murray darling basin keywords floodplain lidar landsat water extent water depth water volume 1 introduction floodplain wetlands with intermittently connection to main river channels are a common feature of australia s dryland river systems brennan et al 2002 hou et al 2019 they play essential hydrological and ecological roles maintaining the biodiversity and productivity of the river ecosystem cycling nitrogen carbon and sediment providing stable water supplies replenishing soil moisture and groundwater and improving water quality dutta et al 2013 heimhuber et al 2016 kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2007 the murray darling basin in australia is one of the driest and most dynamic river basins worldwide its floodplain wetlands are under pressure from flow modification and agricultural intensification bishop taylor et al 2018b kingsford 2000 this problem has been exacerbated by predominantly dry conditions since 2001 although interrupted by very high rainfall during 2010 2011 mac nally et al 2014 van dijk et al 2013 recent ecological calamities such as mass fish deaths in the lower darling river in early 2019 highlight the extent to which the health of the darling river has been degraded by river regulation water extraction and changing climate extremes koehn et al 2020 ostad ali askar et al 2018 management interventions to mitigate ecological degradation such as the release of environmental flows require a detailed understanding of water volume dynamics and the connectivity of floodplains and wetlands to be effective and accepted by stakeholders inundation extent and water depth are required to estimate floodplain water volume alsdorf et al 2007a due to the hydraulic complexity low gradient sheer size and inaccessibility of the darling river s floodplains it is impractical to use in situ gauging to routinely measure water depth a conventional alternative is to use a one or two dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate floodplain inundation mechanistic modelling uses mass and momentum continuity equations such as the navier stokes and derived saint venant equations to describe water movement in river floodplains dutta et al 2013 following increases in computing capability and data availability regional continental and global hydrodynamic models have been developed to simulate river floodplain dynamics e g de paiva et al 2013 dutta et al 2000 sampson et al 2015 yamazaki et al 2011 however the variable quality of input data levels of model complexity changes in landscape and climate conditions and parameter uncertainties combine to cause considerable uncertainty in flood inundation modelling bates et al 2013 satellite remote sensing provides a demonstrated capacity to routinely monitor water extent and level dynamics across rivers and their floodplains various continental and global scale surface water extent datasets have been produced from satellite observations alsdorf et al 2007b for example modis satellite observations are used in the generation of surface water extent mapping with sampling between 1 and 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 m guerschman et al 2011 ji et al 2018 global inundation maps at higher spatial resolution e g 90 m have been produced by topographic downscaling coarse scale remote sensing data aires et al 2017 fluet chouinard et al 2015 more recently long term archives donchyts et al 2016 mueller et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 hou et al 2019 of monthly surface water mapping from 1984 to 2020 at ca 30 m resolution based on the landsat series of sensors have proved a valuable resource for understanding hydrological dynamics optical sensors such as the landsat and modis imagers have enabled the analysis of temporal changes in the inundation of floodplain wetlands over long periods di vittorio and georgakakos 2018 sakamoto et al 2007 thomas et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 using landsat data heimhuber et al 2017 developed empirical models of inundation dynamics as a function of river discharge rainfall evapotranspiration and soil moisture however optical remote sensing tends to be affected by cloud cover especially during flood events synthetic aperture radar sar has been used to mitigate this issue and generally provide more reliable estimates of inundation extent hess et al 2003 lang et al 2008 martinez and letoan 2007 töyrä and pietroniro 2005 töyrä et al 2001 airborne light detection and ranging lidar data have been used to correct landsat based inundation mapping or to improve the spatial resolution of floodplain products by calculating subpixel inundation percentage huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 wu et al 2019 the application of remote sensing to floodplain dynamics has advanced from measuring water extent to estimating water volume the most common approach to estimate water volume is to use a digital elevation model dem combined with either empirical equations lane and d amico 2010 the filling and spilling procedure jones et al 2018 lhomme et al 2008 the planar method teng et al 2015 or methods using a height above the nearest drainage hand model nobre et al 2011 each of these techniques can lead to overestimation of floodplain inundation volume if they incorrectly include areas that are not inundated or connected at the given flood level several studies estimated water storage in floodplain wetlands using altimetry data in combination with existing inundation data frappart et al 2008 frappart et al 2010 optical remote sensing normandin et al 2018 or sar ahmad et al 2020 frappart et al 2005 yuan et al 2017 however altimetry measures water elevation rather than inundation depth as it does not penetrate the water column to the river bed in addition altimetry measurements are acquired along discrete and widely spaced tracks and so may not measure water elevation in disconnected water bodies moreover the spatial and temporal sampling resolution as well as the historical availability of altimetry measurements remains currently limited high resolution dems typically derived from lidar measurements can help spatially estimate water depth at a given water level however water distribution in a floodplain also depends on its connectivity to the river channel and the connection between water bodies on the floodplain high resolution surface water mapping is required to provide inundation area and surface water connectivity although landsat can measure long term surface water dynamics at a spatial resolution of 30 m this resolution is insufficient to discern the detailed floodplain features apparent in higher resolution dems other challenges with using landsat imagery include the large number of missing data due to clouds and cloud shadows steep topography and terrain shadows and the scan line failure slc in landsat 7 they limit the ability to derive 16 day or even monthly surface water extent time series from landsat some studies produced seasonal annual or multi year averaged surface water mapping to address this e g halabisky et al 2016 huang et al 2014 but none of these studies were designed to provide near real time information for floodplain wetlands we aimed to produce 16 day water extent and depth mapping and water storage time series in floodplain wetlands from 1987 to the present by combining landsat derived surface water mapping with lidar dem to achieve this we produced 5 m spatial resolution surface water mapping from topographic downscaling of landsat derived surface water mapping in contrast to existing 30 m and monthly resolution landsat products e g pekel et al 2016 the spatial and temporal resolution of our product is improved to 5 m and 16 day thus better serving the needs for water management in the highly complex river systems in the murry darling basin we developed a simple and effective automated algorithm to restore missing data in landsat images and produce a continuous surface water extent time series the method can fill gaps due to missing data reliably irrespective of the size shape and number of missing pixels in the image the restored spatial time series can reliably describe the development and retreat of flood events neither dem nor altimetry based approaches to measuring water depth consider hydraulic connectivity between surface water bodies resulting in potentially large uncertainties in estimating water volumes in this study surface water connectivity was estimated at each timestep so spatial water depth could be calculated for individual water bodies in the floodplain all methods developed here are readily automated and suitable to monitor changes in the floodplain wetlands we tested the methodology in a 30 km long river reach of the barwon darling river a semi arid lowland river with extensive floodplain and wetland systems the presence of disconnected on farm water storages and flood harvesting levees and canals along this river reach also highlights the importance of investigating water volume in the floodplain for better water management 2 data and method 2 1 study area the barwon darling river is a semi arid lowland river in the northern part of the murray darling basin mdb in southeast australia fig 1 d the average annual rainfall and runoff over the region are about 328 mm and 6 mm 1895 2006 respectively but are highly variable from year to year csiro 2008 there are nearly 63 000 ha of land that can be irrigated 92 of which is intended for cotton production water resources extraction from surface water and sub surface sources were 230 gl year and 10gl year respectively csiro 2008 the river has a low gradient of 0 05 m km between walgett and brewarrina woodyer et al 1979 it has a catchment area of 650 000 km2 receiving inflows from several tributaries including the macquarie castlereagh namoi gwydir macintyre and condamine balonne rivers the low relief and erratic rainfall have given rise to extensive floodplain and wetland systems with extended low or no flow periods and infrequent large floods thoms and sheldon 2000 water resources development and climate variability have caused several environmental calamities over the past decades such as a major blue green algal bloom in 1991 bowling and baker 1996 a decline in diversity and abundance of native fish gehrke et al 1995 and mass fish deaths in 2019 vertessy et al 2019 we focused on a 30 km stretch of river nearby the town of bourke with a river flow gauging station at both its upstream and downstream end the reach was chosen because of its complexity and importance for water management the streamflow from most of the river s tributaries enter upstream of the township of bourke while there is a net loss of river flows downstream of bourke because high rates of infiltration and evaporation and low inflows from tributaries brennan et al 2002 finally the selected river reach includes multiple ephemeral floodplain wetlands on farm storages and flood harvesting levees and irrigation canals 2 2 data the elevation information system elvis archive developed by geoscience australia provides dem products at various spatial resolutions in this study we used the 1 m lidar dem product fig 1b acquired by the new south wales nsw government spatial services in november 2020 the data have an accuracy of 0 3 m vertically and 0 8 m horizontally to improve the accuracy we resampled the data to 5 m which was still of sufficiently high resolution to show all relevant hydraulic features visible in the original 1 m data whilst reducing computational demand the river network network connectivity network node water body and sub catchment boundaries fig 1c were obtained from the australian hydrological geospatial fabric geofabric the geofabric is a gis based dataset of spatial surface and groundwater characteristics derived from the 9 anudem raster streams product bureau of meteorology 2012a b in situ river discharge measurements up and downstream of the study region red dots in fig 1c were obtained from nsw government website waternsw https realtimedata waternsw com au the water observations from space wofs dataset was developed by geoscience australia and provides 25 m resolution historical surface water observations across the australian continent from 1987 to the present the product is derived from the landsat series of satellites mueller et al 2016 inundation is mapped automatically across the entire continental by a decision tree classifier using spectral reflectance and derived indices with a documented accuracy of 97 mueller et al 2016 the water summary product fig 1a and the 16 day surface water map time series from wofs were used here the water summary product is a single layer that provides data on the recurrence frequency of inundation calculated as the ratio of the number of times water was detected over the total number of clear sky observations in the full time series of each pixel 2 3 method in the following subsections we describe in detail the steps used to produce 16 day floodplain water volume dynamics from 1987 present the workflow is summarized in fig 2 and include 1 defining the river reach boundary based on geofabric subsection 2 3 1 2 producing 5 m spatial resolution surface water mapping by topographic downscaling of landsat derived surface water mapping subsection 2 3 2 3 automatic restoration of missing data in 16 day landsat derived surface water mapping subsection 2 3 3 4 deriving 16 day and 5 m resolution water depth maps based on restored and downscaled landsat derived surface water extent and the lidar dem subsection 2 3 4 5 estimating 16 day time series 1987 present of water volume stored on floodplain wetlands by river reach and comparing floodplain volume dynamics with river flows recorded at upstream gauging station subsection 2 3 4 2 3 1 river reach boundary delineation before reconstructing floodplain water volume dynamics the hydrological boundary of the study region and floodplain wetlands connected to the river system needed to be delineated the network nodes in the geofabric vector layer connect river segments and indicate network connectivity and flow direction river segments from the geofabric in the study region were chosen based on their connectivity to upstream and downstream gauging stations and their corresponding sub catchments were merged river reaches and floodplain wetlands were fully connected within each of these sub catchments in the maximum inundation condition the outer bound of all merged sub catchments is regarded here as the overall river reach catchment boundary fig 1c any tributaries that contribute additional flows other than those from the upstream gauging station were eliminated as we wished to examine the relationship between the upstream flow and water volume stored on the floodplain we also did not consider artificial water bodies because human actions i e pumping mainly determines their volume the boundaries of constructed water storages e g on farm storages are delineated in the geofabric fig 1c we used this data to remove man made water bodies e g on farm storages in the study region finally we disregarded all water bodies that were entirely disconnected from the floodplain even at maximum water level conditions i e surface water summary mapping at recurrence frequency of 0 5 the refined study region is shown in fig 1d 2 3 2 downscaling water extent the next step was to downscale the landsat wofs surface water maps to 5 m resolution using an approach we refer to as topographic downscaling in general the higher the elevation of a pixel the lower the frequency of inundation the central assumption in downscaling landsat water extent mapping using the dem is that there is a negative relationship between elevation and inundation frequency within each region once established at the 25 m scale the relationship can be used to estimate water recurrence frequency in each high resolution 5 m 5 m grid cell based on elevation derived from the dem the principle of the downscaling method is as follows we calculated average dem derived water surface elevation for specific inundation frequency intervals from the wofs summary product given in table 1 if there is a strong negative correlation between elevation and frequency the relationship can be used to downscale surface water extent mapping we then related recurrence frequency to elevation using cumulative distribution function cdf matching specifically a rank based look up table was constructed to relate each elevation value to its corresponding recurrence frequency next for each cell value in the dem the nearest dem values in the look up table was found finally the recurrence frequency was estimated by interpolating the two recurrence frequency values with corresponding ranks in the look up table the results of applying the topographic downscaling are given in fig 3 the figure shows a 500 m 500 m region of the study area with the original 25 m wofs product fig 3b compared with the 5 m resolution inundation frequency summary map for different recurrence frequencies e g fig 3c f assuming the elevation recurrence frequency relationship was robust in individual hydrologic unit we applied the algorithm in each sub catchment fig 1c from the geofabric across the entire river reach 2 3 3 gap filling missing image data in this study 1839 wofs images were used to derive water volume dynamics from 1987 to present only 267 images were identified as having 5 missing data per scene while 621 images had 70 missing data per scene fig s1 however we found that of the 267 clear images not one of them contained a flood event the average fraction of missing data even increased after 2003 due to the landsat 7 slc failure this meant that the process of gap filling missing data was very important to provide a larger number of water observations for our investigation especially during flooding events many images had missing data due to data acquisition swath edges and the landsat 7 slc failure and pixel quality control esp cloud and cloud shadow masking we regarded images with less than 5 missing data as good quality images for the remaining images with between 5 and 70 missing data we replaced the missing data with estimated as follows overlaying the water classification map for a specific date onto the inundation recurrence frequency map enable us to identify the likelihood that pixels with missing values were inundated at that same time for each inundation map for a given date we used all valid pixels and compared its classification i e inundated or not with the recurrence frequency summary map next we identified the recurrence frequency providing the best match between the two maps 1 δ n i 1 j 1 i j c i j s i j k where δn is the difference in the number of pixels ci j the binary water classification value 0 or 1 of each pixel i j in the classified image for the specific date and si j f the binary water classification value 0 or 1 for the pixel in the water summary map at recurrence frequency k the differential evolution method in python scipy optimise differential evolution was used to find the minimum of δn and associated frequency k the 25 m surface water summary mapping at the inferred recurrence frequency k was used to fill the missing data in the original image and 16 day and 25 m restored surface water mapping was produced meanwhile 16 day and 5 m surface water products were also developed by substituting each wofs image with the 5 m surface water summary mapping derived in section 2 3 2 at the corresponding recurrence frequency k finally to assess the accuracy of our gap filling approach we randomly selected 100 good quality wofs images we then removed pixels for ten randomly selected 2 km 2 km squares region overlapping or not in each image mimicking missing data for between 5 and 54 of the total area we applied the gap filling algorithm to estimate the removed data and compared this with the original images we repeated this experiment 100 times with random missing data scenarios and calculated the average error for each image 2 3 4 water depth mapping several studies estimate water depth as the difference between a spatially uniform water surface elevation and the dem jones et al 2018 lane and d amico 2010 lhomme et al 2008 nobre et al 2011 teng et al 2015 regardless of the particular method employed i e the planar method filling and spilling or altimetry this does not consider the gradient of the water surface which can lead to underestimates of water depth upstream and overestimates downstream furthermore the water level can be heterogeneous if parts of the floodplain are unconnected to the main channel or isolated from each other at a given flood level we sought to develop a pragmatic approach to mitigate these issues the 5 m surface water product section 2 3 3 shows the detailed dynamics in surface water connectivity from 1987 to the present which provides information to mitigate the issues discussed before combining the mapping with the dem to produce water depth we segmented the surface water extent based on connectivity for each 16 day and 5 m surface water map next using the dem we calculated the average elevation along the boundary of each segmented flood areas the average elevation served as an estimate of water surface height for the extent of inundated area gridded water depth was subsequently estimated by subtracting elevation from the average elevation at the water s edge water depth mapping across the whole region was produced by merging gridded water depth maps for each segmented surface water water volumes stored on the floodplain were then estimated by summing the product of total gridded water depths and grid area 25 m2 to our knowledge this produced the first 5 m floodplain water depth mapping in the murray darling basin therefore it is not possible to directly validate either individual 5 m water depth maps or the frequency summary map instead we used upstream river flow records to validate the volume dynamics derived from our 5 m water depth maps a strong correlation between river inflows and resulting floodplain volumes can be taken as an indication of robustness in our 5 m water depth maps 3 results 3 1 elevation and water recurrence relationship to validate the assumptions underpinning the topographic downscaling method we examined the relationship between landsat derived recurrence frequency and the dem in each sub catchment of the study region a strong negative correlation between these two suggests that our method is effective and reasonable for each sub catchment of the study area we used the average dem values and the recurrence frequencies at different intervals i e groups labelled a j in table 1 and calculated their correlation as the relationship between water recurrence frequency and elevation cannot be assumed to be linear we calculated spearman s rank correlation the spearman s rank correlations between recurrence frequency intervals table 1 and corresponding average elevation for the 59 sub catchments in the study region are shown in fig 4 among them 53 sub catchments have strong negative correlations 0 7 three sub catchments on the western and eastern boundaries show weaker correlations 0 4 because these catchments were inundated during the most extensive flooding events only thus limiting the number of data points the six sub catchments in the middle of the reach have moderate correlations between 0 8 and 0 4 correlations might be expected to be higher than this but the coarse sub catchment delineation from the geofabric affected the elevation frequency relationship the distribution of water levels at different recurrence frequency intervals before and after the downscaling processing in five catchments is shown in fig 5 the water level range is greater in the original images at frequencies of 5 50 in catchment 1 2 and 5 because of landsat s limited abilities to distinguish narrow river channels from floodplains for the same reason the distribution at frequencies between 1 and 5 is higher in catchment 3 where frequency values distribute unevenly on the boundary between floodplain channels and floodwater in contrast the patterns before and after the downscaling processing are similar for floodwaters in catchment 4 especially below 20 frequency because the inundation area is sufficiently large to be detected in the landsat imagery 3 2 comparison of 5 m water mapping against 25 m product we compared the newly developed 5 m water map against the original wofs 25 m water map and lidar dem first we inspected if the detailed hydrological features in the dem are reflected in the 5 m water depth mapping second we investigated whether the differences between 5 m and 25 m maps could be attributed to the enhanced spatial resolution or caused by errors in the downscaling method third we examined any artefacts caused by merging mapping in individual sub catchments the boundary of the river channel and its tributaries can be seen clearly in the 1 m lidar dem fig 3a and fig 7a these characteristics are pixelated in wofs summary maps due to the coarser 25 m resolution of the underlying data fig 3b and fig 7b after downscaling the derived 5 m inundation frequency map fig 3c and fig 7c shows greater consistency with features in the dem the difference between 25 m and 5 m surface water summary mapping is presented in figs 6 and 7 the recurrence frequency in the river channel significantly increased red colouring in fig 6b and 7d to nearly 80 and the distribution pattern of frequency values is more homogeneous in the 5 m downscaled map fig 6a and fig 7c this is because the original landsat mapping underestimated permanent inundation in the narrow river channel due to the lower spatial resolution the large floodplain in the middle of the study region showed decreasing recurrence frequency blue colouring outwards because of significant elevation differences in the dem fig 7 the shape of this prominent feature is more distinct in the 5 m downscaled map even water in a very narrow artificial canal catchment 8 in fig 7c connected to the floodwaters was detected the connectivity between the floodwater and river channel was also restored in the northern part of catchment 7 despite these advantages there was also an error in the delineation at the border between catchments 6 and 7 most likely because the sub catchment boundary from the geofabric was based on a coarse dem product fig 7d this results in underestimates of inundation over the east side of the river bank in catchment 6 however this artefact will not have had a significant influence as there is no inconsistency in water mapping along the other sub catchment s boundaries 3 3 effectiveness of the image gap filling algorithm gaps in the 16 day wofs imagery were filled in by the simple method proposed in section 2 3 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the gap filling method we conducted a synthetic experiment whereby a random sample of extent maps was artificially degraded by removing a portion of the imagery the method was applied to the imagery and the omission and commission errors we computed with reference to the original results indicated average omission and commission errors of the image gap filling algorithm were small at 1 6 and 1 2 respectively fig 8 among the wofs images from 1987 to present with missing data ranging from 5 to 70 swath edges and the landsat 7 slc failure were two common issues e g fig 9 a and fig 9c while cloud contamination happened relatively less frequently e g fig 9b fig 9 shows four surface water maps with contamination ratios of 55 54 46 and 42 respectively we compared clear parts of the images with the wofs summary mapping and selected inundation maps at recurrence frequencies of 23 43 3 and 3 respectively to best match the individual images these data were then used to estimate the missing data swath edges caused data gaps over half 55 of the study region but the remaining pixels allowed estimation of the missing values fig 9e similar issues can occur due to both cloud cover and swath edges but our method still dealt well with such cases 42 missing data fig 9h even when cloud covered most parts of the river and its floodplains fig 9f provided parts of the inundated area are detected our algorithm can infer the missing data 54 the landsat 7 slc failure led to missing data lines in many images after 2003 but the remaining exposed parts of river reaches and floodplains provided sufficient data to infer these missing values fig 9g 3 4 relationship between river discharge and floodplain volume surface water depth mapping at different recurrence frequencies 40 9 1 and 0 5 is shown in fig 10 the gridded water depth estimates increase as recurrence frequency decreases the average water depth was 1 m in the river channel in typical conditions e g 40 recurrence frequency and increased to almost 11 m during the largest flooding event in 1998 fig 10a and d there is no appreciable increase in water depth on the floodplain during flooding events instead the water spreads outwards further onto the floodplain for example the inundation extent was 60 km2 during the largest flood event in 1998 nearly six times the water extent 11 km2 at a more common frequency of 9 fig 10b and d the 16 day and monthly time series of water volume stored on the floodplain by river reach from 1987 present were calculated based on surface water depth mapping the water volume dynamics strongly correlate with in situ river discharge measured upstream r 0 88 for the 16 day product and r 0 91 for the monthly product fig 11 the water volume and river flow peaks matched very well especially on a monthly timescale our approach captured three flood events of different sizes in three consecutive years 2010 2012 these findings show that the developed 16 day and 5 m water depth maps are sufficiently reliable to be used to reconstruct changes in floodplain water volumes and understand their relationship to flow patterns river flows reached 2609 m3 s on september 28 1998 when floodplain water volume exceeded 80 gl surface water bodies on the western bank were fully connected during this flood river water spread overbank along the entire reach and flowed towards the southwest to replenish floodplain wetlands fig 10d in contrast floodplain wetlands were nearly completely dry during the millennium drought 2001 2009 a further notable feature is the apparent water volume that remains on the floodplain for extended periods after flood peaks in the years before 2001 but much less so after that a comparison with daily in situ river flow measurements confirms that clear wofs images i e 5 missing data largely missed all flood events fig 12 a this means it would not have been possible to use landsat observations to measure flood events in the conventional approach e g by simply ignoring contaminated images or compositing 16 day images into monthly seasonal or annual averages by contrast the restored wofs images document changes in water volume during floods nearly completely during most events e g two flood events in 2011 however our approach still missed the peak value during the second flood event in 2012 because almost the entire image was covered with cloud and hence could not be restored there is a robust correlation r 0 98 between calculated water volume and extent fig 14a described by the linear regression equation 2 v 1 41 a 2 44 where v is water volume gl and a is water extent km2 this implies a typical average water depth across the inundated area of 1 41 m across a large range of inundation extents although fig 14a suggests that the relationship breaks down at the highest flood levels 4 discussion the methodology demonstrated here includes topographic downscaling of water extent sections 2 3 2 3 1 and 3 2 inference of missing data sections 2 3 3 and 3 3 and water depth mapping based on hydraulic connectivity sections 2 3 4 and 3 4 these steps produced historical from 1987 up to very recent water extent and depth mapping at 5 m resolution from an airborne lidar dem and landsat imagery the methods combine to produce a much more temporally dense and spatially detailed history of water extent and volume across a typical river reach in southeastern australia than can be achieved using satellite data alone the derived maps provide information at a spatial resolution and temporal frequency for river managers and water management authorities to better understand floodplain harvesting and the distribution of environmental flows in the murray darling basin dutta et al 2013 the relationship between inundation and water volume is an important parameter determining river flow and its transport capacity in hydrodynamic modelling frappart et al 2005 it can also help reduce large uncertainties in computer models that predict environmental flows and improve our capacity to achieve or maintain ecological targets under climate change lee et al 2015 ostad ali askari et al 2019 woodward and wui 2001 our data can show shifts and trends in water extent depth and volume on the floodplain that can inform ecohydrological investigations such as the relationship between wetlands dynamics and species occupancy richness and diversity halabisky et al 2016 finally the low latency of landsat 8 based water extent mapping available from geoscience australia enables the application of the method in near real time with benefits for operational river forecasting the 5 m surface water mapping provides information about water distribution in floodplain wetlands and surface water connectivity the degree of surface water connectivity plays a critical role in the diversity of fish macro and micro invertebrates and algal assemblages sheldon 2019 the connection between the river channel and floodplain wetlands is also important for maintaining water quality supporting carbon nutrient and sediment cycling allowing biota dispersal and reducing the magnitude and frequency of toxic algal blooms bishop taylor et al 2018a the connection and disconnection during and after overbank flow determine how much water flows into water bodies and floodplain wetlands and how much water replenishes soil moisture to benefit floodplain vegetation compared to the 25 m surface water mapping there are several desirable enhancements in the 5 m water products highlighted in fig 13 firstly the 5 m surface water mapping can delineate the continuous water surface in the main river channel this is often difficult to achieve with the 25 m water mapping as the widths of the river are typically too narrow to be detected at landsat resolution or where water and vegetation are mixed along the riverbank krause et al 2021 although the water summary data indicate where the river flow path lies the distribution of recurrence frequency is heterogeneous along the main channel and the riverbanks cannot be distinguished consistently fig 13 secondly the boundary of inundation especially during flood events was constrained by terrain elevation and the tributaries of the river were shown distinctly in the 5 m water product fig 13 thirdly additional floodplain channels were detected in the 5 m surface water mapping for example inundation in catchment 3 at high recurrence frequency did not connect to the main channel but received water from local rainfall or after a flood event the 25 m water product does not show the narrow floodplain channels downstream fig 13 catchment 3 fourth the dynamics of floodwater on the floodplain can be shown more precisely for example in catchment 4 fig 13 the artificial canal was detected and indicated the existence of flood harvesting infrastructure the 9 dem used to delineate the boundary of sub catchments in the geofabric is substantially coarser than the lidar dem we used and this resulted in errors in boundary delineation those errors in turn may have influenced the elevation frequency relationship used for downscaling in some cases for example the boundary cuts across the main channel in catchment 5 fig 13 and floodwater belonging to catchment 7 was assigned to catchment 6 fig 7 these issues can be resolved if a better quality catchment delineation becomes available in future e g based on the same better quality lidar dem used in our analysis the workflow for topographic downscaling of the wofs product does not consider river gradient the use of the elevation frequency relationship in river water surface with steep slope could cause errors such that the recurrence frequency of river water surface in the 5 m product would become inconsistent our approach was suitable for the low gradient floodplain of the lower barwon darling river region studied here but not necessarily for regions with steeper flow gradients in this study the issue was minimised by processing each sub catchment separately the flow gradient did not vary appreciably at this scale the optical landsat observations provide several decades of historical images at relatively high spatial resolution making them the most popular remote sensing data used for understanding changes on earth zhu et al 2015 however it is difficult to find a good quality image completely free of the influence of clouds and cloud shadows or the landsat 7 slc failure among the already low frequency images the conventional way to address this issue has been to composite 16 day images into seasonal annual or 5 year averages e g yang et al 2020 or remove images with too much missing data e g krause et al 2021 however this removes information and makes it much harder to capture flood events an alternative solution is to gap fill missing data using neighbourhood pixels or adjacent temporal images but this has mainly been used to estimate relatively small areas of missing data caused by slc failure chen et al 2011 higher temporal resolution modis imagery has also been used to infer missing landsat data roy et al 2008 but no modis data are available before 2000 and the 500 m resolution modis data do not provide the same detail as the 30 m landsat images our approach offers a relatively simple and practical method to gap fill missing data in satellite based surface water mapping once parts of the river channel and floodplain have been observed those data can be used as training data to map inundation frequency and used to infer missing data we show that this approach is still applicable in strongly cloud affected images during flood events and for other contamination scenarios caused by swath edges and slc failure among others there is no requirement for auxiliary data and no need for subjective parameters or thresholds it also has the potential to be used for other optical remote sensing data e g modis and sentinel 2 the errors of the gap filling method are largely irrespective of the size shape and number of the missing parts in the image accuracy only depends on the connectivity of surface water within the image if all the surface water is connected the change of recurrence frequency is consistent along the river reach the method works best during the flood events because of higher connectivity among water bodies only a relatively narrow section encompassing the boundary of the inundated area needs to be detected for the missing parts to be filled in accurately errors are relatively greater during low flow conditions if that leads to a loss of surface water connectivity in our study area cloud issues are much less common during low flow conditions which reduces the problem in applications where this becomes an important issue it could be addressed by applying the method developed here to individual disconnected water bodies although not without reducing the available training data to some degree the relationship between river discharge and water volume was slightly different for the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph suggesting mild hysteresis with greater scatter for low flows fig 14 b c and d there is typically more cloud cover during the rising stage and these sometimes lead to large data gaps which made it impossible to determine the lag between maximum river discharge and maximum water volume fig 12b and c nonetheless a lag between water volume and river flow during the falling stage is evident this was especially clear earlier in the period where there were extended periods of water retention in wetlands after flood events e g between 1988 and 1993 fig 12b this is not due to any errors introduced by our algorithm as water extent derived from clear wofs images shows the same dynamics fig 12a more likely this feature is due to the filling of floodplain wetlands during the rising stage which become disconnected and hence do not fully drain once water levels drop the hysteresis appeared to be stronger before 2001 than in the years since which may be due to a change in floodplain hydrology associated with the millennium drought or perhaps due to increased floodplain water harvesting in later years whereby remaining floodplain water is transferred into on farm storages the change in landscape including river morphology variation and new development of water infrastructure over the past 3 5 decades could lead to uncertainties and errors in water depth mapping and water storage dynamics estimation this is because the lidar survey was only carried out in 2020 in this region and as such does not reflect landscape change back to 1987 repeated mapping of ground elevation using airborne lidar would quickly become expensive and time consuming especially over large areas and cannot be done retrospectively furthermore it remained challenging to measure surface water during the flood peak due to dense cloud coverage even though our approach could restore missing data under conditions of partial cloud cover the ka band radar interferometer from the new surface water and ocean topography swot mission could provide promising opportunities to not only mitigate this issue but also to measure both water extent and elevation of the floodplain frasson et al 2019 found that swot would be able to detect over 55 of the global flood events once operational however the landsat record will remain the most valuable data source with both historical legacy and continuity in ongoing observations with the addition of the similar sentinel 2 satellites and landsat 9 launched in 2021 to continue the work of its predecessors masek et al 2020 5 conclusions the algorithms developed in this study can produce historic and ongoing water extent and depth mapping at a spatial resolution of 5 m by merging landsat with an airborne lidar dem based on the water depth mapping 16 day water volumes stored in the floodplain were estimated from 1987 to the present we found a robust negative relationship between water elevation and recurrence frequency at the sub catchment scale these relationships can be used to interpret subpixel information of landsat images from dem data the newly developed higher resolution water extent maps help mitigate the limitations of landsat in detecting narrow river channels and tributaries as well as the precise boundary of floodplain inundation extent these maps also provide accurate data on surface water connectivity at different river levels or discharge which is essential information for water managers to determine the distribution of water use and environmental flows in order to balance water demand for farmers with maintaining healthy floodplain ecosystems landsat images are generally unsuited for detecting flood events because the low temporal resolution is exacerbated by cloud cover during flood periods we developed a simple and effective method to gap fill missing image data irrespective of the size shape and number of the missing parts in the image the method is used to find the recurrence frequency that corresponds to the minimum difference between water time series map and inundation frequency summary map missing values can subsequently be gap filled using the water summary map omission and commission errors of this method were only 1 6 and 1 2 respectively and this procedure increased the number of useable images by a factor of five water depth was estimated by combining the 5 m lidar dem and the water extent map accounting for the degree of hydraulic connectivity among different surface water bodies i e the river channel and floodplain wetlands vs disconnected water bodies the explicit consideration of connectivity proved a critical aspect that has generally been ignored in previous studies the 16 day water volume time series showed a strong correlation r 0 88 with gauged river flows and reflected the peak lags between river flow and water volume after flood events as water retained in floodplain wetlands the algorithms developed here can be applied elsewhere in the murray darling basin and beyond provided a higher resolution dem and derived hydrographic sub catchment maps are available the derived water extent and depth products should provide helpful information for river modellers river managers and water management authorities in their mission to

3364,salinization of groundwater has endangered e g drinking water supply agricultural cultivation groundwater dependent ecosystems geothermal energy supply thermal and hydrocarbon well production to a rising degree in order to investigate the problem of coupled topography and salinity driven groundwater flow on a basin scale a systematic simulation set has been carried out in a synthetic numerical model detailed sensitivity analysis was completed to reveal the effect of the salinity permeability permeability heterogeneity and anisotropy mechanical dispersivity and water table head on the salt concentration field and the flow pattern it was established that a saline dome with slow inner convection formed beneath the discharge zone in the base model due to the topography driven regional fresh groundwater flow an increase in the salinity or the anisotropy or decrease in the water table variation weakens the role of the forced convection driven by the topography thus facilitating the formation of a saline dense sluggish layer in the deepest zone of the basin in the studied parameter range the variation in permeability and dispersivity affects the shape of the saltwater dome to less degree however the decrease in permeability and or the increase in dispersivity advantage the homogenization of the salt concentration within the saline zone and strengthen the coupling between the saltwater and freshwater zone by growing the relative role of diffusion and transverse dispersion respectively the interaction of the topography driven forced and salinity driven

mixed topohaline convection salinity driven groundwater flow topography driven groundwater flow numerical modelling 1 introduction hydrogeological problems that we have to solve in practical tasks often refer to complex systems but our solutions are necessarily simplified unfortunately it means that we neglect many effects and processes and on the contrary put in the focus what we think is significant to exclude these uncertainties and better understand some physical fluid flow processes and their interactions we started a systematic analysis of superimposed fluid driving forces and their impacts on basin scale flow patterns we have already examined the combination of topography and thermal buoyancy that drive groundwater flow in a theoretical basin to better understand the influencing factors and the consequences of the interaction szijártó et al 2019 the lesson learnt from this systematic theoretical analysis we applied to a real hydrogeological system focusing on these driving forces szijártó et al 2021 in this paper we continue the analysis with the interactions of topography and salinity as driving forces of fluids on basin scale flow systems and demonstrate it for an actual hydrogeological situation without trying to extend the problem to any other driving force the importance and understanding of salt transport processes in groundwater flow systems has developed parallel to the increasing natural resource demands of humankind in coastal environments the rising number and yield of wells producing freshwater entail the subsurface transgression of sea

of haline convection in a homogeneous horizontal infinite porous layer and van dam et al 2009 uncovered the first field documentation of precipitation induced saltwater fingering as a manifestation of natural free convection in a porous medium however the water table elevation varies from place to place thus the topography driven groundwater flow is always present in the upper part of the terrestrial basins tóth 2009 therefore it also acts in these terrestrial environments with elevated dissolved solid content consequently these cases require mathematical models typically numerical models to evaluate the coupled effects of topography and salinity driven groundwater flow the concept of coupled topography and salinity driven groundwater flow has been adopted to explain the high salt content of the submarine groundwater discharge sgd on a local scale konikow et al 2013 and to elucidate the variability and the distance of sgd in a heterogeneous coastal volcanic aquifer near the big island of hawaii usa kreyns et al 2020 duffy and al hassan 1988 revealed the groundwater circulation in a homogeneous medium as a balance between the rainwater recharge in surrounding mountains and the saltwater counter flow beneath the playa in the great basin utah usa the two dimensional homogeneous and isotropic numerical model was recalculated using multicomponent reactive

in a simple geological environment to trace the brine infiltration beneath a saline disposal basin in australia simmons and narayan 1997 zhang et al 2020b presented a sensitivity analysis to study the effect of the salinity the hydraulic conductivity and the dispersivity on the positions of stagnation points and the hierarchy of the groundwater flow system however it seems from the published papers that topography effects are examined on a local scale or for simple basins but they are commonly neglected therefore some of the models remained oversimplified in terms of omittance of variations in topography and water table although numerical models are acknowledged tools to quantify the interaction of topography and salinity driven groundwater flow several questions are still unresolved regarding the sensitivity of these models to the key parameters feeding the governing equations small variations in critical parameters such as relative density differences due to salinity variations of intrinsic permeability anisotropy and mechanical dispersivity or change in water table amplitude may generate great deviations in model outputs as such given the ubiquitously difficult aquifer characterization that renders model parameterization always uncertain high sensitivity to model parameters can create high uncertainty in the decisions to be made about the water management of an aquifer while disentangling the model response to the input parameters is therefore of the uppermost importance this task is in turn severely complicated by the computational burden required to resolve the nonlinear fully coupled density dependent groundwater flow equations the main aim of this paper is to investigate through detailed numerical modelling how the interaction of topography driven forced and salinity driven free convection and the different model parameters influence the salt concentration and groundwater flow pattern at basin scales and thus how the decisions made from the model responses may vary depending on the model sensitivity other fluid driving forces e g temperature difference compaction compression were neglected in order to focus on and highlight the interaction of topography and salinity driven regional groundwater flow and systematically examine the effects of this interaction firstly once the processes and phenomena are comprehensively understood and synthesized other fluid driving processes can also be coupled therefore in the first part of the paper a two dimensional synthetic simulation set is presented where the effect of salinity dissolved solid content permeability depth dependence and anisotropy of permeability dispersivity and water table amplitude is qualified and quantified systematically by monitoring parameters e g the darcy flux and the salt concentration for both the entire basin and the fresh saltwater zones in the second part the mixed topohaline convection simulation is carried out to demonstrate its effect in a real environment along a hydrogeological section in hungary based on mádl szőnyi et al 2019 the fundamental goal is to reveal the evolution of marine origin pore water and to explain the formation of the fresh brackish and saltwater saturated units on a basin scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development the solution of the combined topography and salinity driven groundwater

the salt precipitation from the groundwater the initial condition for the flow was obtained from eqs 1 2 with reference water density fig 1 a and the initial condition for the concentration was calculated from eq 3 without the advection term q 0 which is the solution of the diffuse problem resulting in linear vertical concentration profile fig 1 b the coupled problem eq 1 3 was solved by comsol multiphysics v4 2 a finite element numerical software package zimmermann 2006 the model domain was discretized by triangle elements with a maximum size of 100 m and 8 boundary layer elements were used to minimize the inaccuracy due to the weak resolution of the high gradient zones thus the mesh consisted of 57 159 finite elements for the base model which varied between 56 880 80 023 as the water table amplitude was changed from 0 m to 500 m the pressure and the concentration were discretized within the elements by quadratic and linear polynomials respectively simulations were run until models reached the stationary solution which required typically 1myr ranging from 0 5 to 50myr e g for low permeability high permeability anisotropy or slight water table amplitude initial time steps were increased exponentially to 1000 yr to stabilize the transition effects after that the maximum time step was fixed as 100 yr simulations were run on an intel workstation with 24 cores requiring approx 1 2 days cpu time and 4 gb memory for one model before the synthetic simulation set the coupled model was expansively tested and confirmed in a horizontal and inclined layer and

dispersivity α l and α t and 6 the water level amplitude a the six selected parameters are usually uncertain given the limited characterization and exhibit strong scale dependency for instance the salinity of groundwaters may vary both in time and space in hungary it is typical that the salt concentration increases with depth owing to the deep marine sedimentary environment while salinity is lower in shallow strata complexes due to lacustrine sedimentation and the intense meteoric water infiltration e g varsányi and ó kovács 2009 szocs et al 2013 in general the groundwater salinity can vary from 0 to even 40 including fresh brackish saline and brine waters deming 2002 in this paper the effect of salinity on the water density is parameterized by a factor of β which presents the relative density increase of the water the aquifer permeability or hydraulic conductivity can vary over several orders of magnitude in relatively short spatial scales to the effects of geological heterogeneity sanchez vila et al 2006 pedretti et al 2016 liu et al 2016 one of the most common heterogeneities of permeability is its pressure dependence ehrenberg and nadeau 2005 permeability

hydrogeological bodies cirpka et al 2015 pedretti et al 2014 in siliciclastic sedimentary basins where the sub horizontal aquifer and aquitard layers alternate the effective hydraulic conductivity

water level influences both the flow pattern and the salinity of the groundwater as one of the main driving forces e g tóth 2009 the influence of forming dense saline zone layer on the concentration field and the flow pattern was studied both qualitatively and quantitatively monitoring parameters were defined to characterize the groundwater flow system by the average darcy flux qav concentration cav hydraulic head hav as well as the relative area as af the darcy flux qs qf and the concentration cs cf computed for both the saltwater subscript s and the freshwater subscript f zone the salt and freshwater zones were separated by an arbitrary boundary of the solute content of c 0 5 after the synthetic numerical simulations the topography and salinity driven groundwater flow model was applied along a 2d hydrogeological section in hungary taking into consideration the outcome of the synthetic model runs 3 synthetic model results 3 1 effect of relative density difference as a first step the effect of density increase due to salinity on the concentration field and the flow pattern was studied the results show that the saltwater is swept out from the basin by the topography driven groundwater flow when β 0 i e the water density is independent of the salt content fig 2 a a shrank zone beneath the discharge area can survive the regional freshwater circulation near the stagnation point see e g an et al 2015 even though the saltwater is denser by only 1 an extended saline zone c 0 5 contoured by a black line forms beneath the discharge area in the base model fig 2 b table 1 the concentration distribution within the saline zone is rather diffuse suggesting that there is no intense inner flow as the salt content i e water density due to salinity increases a dense layer evolves right above the model bottom fig 2 d g which consequently reduces the diffuse transport from the base below resulting in an average concentration decrease in the basin fig 3 illustrates how the dense saline zone modifies the regional unidirectional flow pattern when the concentration dependence of the water density is neglected fig 3 a the darcy flux field is equivalent to the solution of the simple darcy flow see fig 1 a when the water density is not neglected fig 3 b d the flow field strongly depends on the presence of the saline zone the most striking influence of the saline zone on the flow pattern is that the topography driven regional flow is suppressed but the magnitude of the darcy flux is not affected by the saline dome on the other hand slow circulation forms within the saltwater domain this sluggish inner convection has opposite vorticity compared to the regional groundwater flow the pattern of the inner convection depends strongly on the saline content as measured by β the higher the salinity contrast with the freshwater the more pronounced the recirculation zone note that β 3 produces an inner convection zone about two times more extended compared to β 1 the model is therefore highly sensitive to limited salinity changes the given problem of topography and salinity driven groundwater flow tends towards a stationary solution which is plotted against the relative density difference β fig 4 as the water density increases see eq 4 from β 0 to 0 2 the domain averaged darcy flux qav is reduced by 43 fig 4 a the domain averaged concentration cav shows a non monotonic character with a maximum at about β 2 3 fig 4 b when a considerable saltwater zone forms beneath the discharge area fig 2 c at a lower value of β the salt content cannot resist the topography driven groundwater flow while at a higher value of β a thin dense salty layer evolves in the deepest part of the basin the domain averaged hydraulic head hav becomes more negative owing to the increasing water density fig 4 c the specific behaviour of the saltwater and freshwater zone separated by the arbitrary isocontour of c 0 5 was also investigated as β increases the relative area of the dense saline zone as the area normed by the total area of the basin shrinks apart from the model of β 0 when the saltwater is swept out from the basin fig 2 a and 4 d on the contrary the relative area of the complementary freshwater zone af also normed by the total area of the basin increases in the same way as as decreases fig 4 e illustrates that the inner convective velocity of the saltwater zone qs is lower up to about two orders of magnitude compared to the velocity of the freshwater zone qf which remains quite constant qf 2 10 8 m s specifically the minimum saltwater velocity of qs 3 10 10 m s was found when β 2 i e at the peak of maximum domain averaged concentration cav this point also corresponds to the lowest average concentration of the dense zone cs 0 65 fig 4 f when an extended saltwater dome with thick transition zone forms beneath the discharge zone fig 2 c 3 2 effect of permeability 3 2 1 permeability in a homogeneous and isotropic medium the role of rock permeability on the salinity was investigated using the base model table 1 while the permeability horizontal and vertical was decreased from k 10 12 m2 to 10 14 m2 fig 5 illustrates that the change in permeability has no drastic influence on the salt concentration field by decreasing the permeability the flow linearly slows down fig 6 a according to eq 2 when the darcy flux is reduced in the freshwater zone the diffusion flux across the boundary of the salt and freshwater zones is retained lower diffusion flux from the saltwater zone results in higher salt content fig 6 b and a more homogeneous concentration field fig 5 a d as the average salt content increases the hydraulic head decreases due to the enhanced water density fig 6 c decreasing the permeability from k 10 13 m2 to 10 14 m2 the diffusion flux becomes commensurable to the order of advection thus the diffusion zone between the salt and freshwater thickens fig 5 d g a thickening diffusion zone appears above the model bottom as well while the change in permeability by two orders of magnitude drives an equal reduction in the average darcy flux the maximum of the diffusion flux reduces by only a factor of 5 specifically from 8 10 11 to 1 4 10 11 m s the permeability reduction influences the darcy flux of the saltwater and freshwater zones in a different manner fig 6 e the flow slows down in both zones but the gradient of the darcy flux curve is higher for the freshwater zone than the saltwater zone i e dqf dk dqs dk consequently the difference in the darcy flux decreases to one order of magnitude the effect of two processes appears both in the concentration and the relative area curves fig 6 d and f the homogenization in the cases of k 10 12 10 13 m2 increases the salt content and the area of the saline zone then the diffusion zone thickening in the cases of k 10 13 10 14 m2 hinders the rate of the area growth and it leads to a slight concentration decrease within the saltwater zone nevertheless the average salt content of the basin shows a slight increase fig 6 b owing to the slowing down regional groundwater flow 3 2 2 permeability heterogeneity owing to the increasing pressure the permeability shows a decrease downwards both in carbonates and sandstones which is frequently approximated by an exponential trend in eq 6 γ represents the factor of the permeability decay that is the ratio of the surface and bottom permeability fig s1 supplementary material illustrates the effect of γ on the concentration field within the interval of γ 1 100 increasing γ has a very similar influence on salinity as decreasing permeability in the previous part when the permeability decreases with depth by a factor of 1 10 fig s1 a d a homogenization occurs in the saltwater zone due to the lower darcy flux in the freshwater zone fig s2 e in supplementary material and the reduced diffusion flux across the boundary of the salt and freshwater zones the only difference between fig 5 and fig s1 is that the homogenization evolves not in the whole saltwater dome but it has a depth dependence γ 1 this process results in a considerable increase in average concentration fig s2 b the area and the concentration of the saltwater zone fig s2 d and f decreasing permeability with depth by 1 2 orders of magnitude γ 10 100 brings forward another phenomenon fig s1 d g the darcy flux decrease with depth is so pronounced that the diffusion approximates the advection in the mass transport thus a diffusion zone forms between the fresh and saltwater zones as well as along the bottom boundary it enhances the salinity in the freshwater zone fig s2 f because of the depth dependent permeability the diffusion zone thins upwards and in the near surface region the intense flow effectively erodes the top of the saltwater dome consequently a slight reduction can be observed in the average concentration fig s2 b the area and the concentration of the saltwater dome fig s2 d and f depth dependent permeability induces a continuous darcy flux and hydraulic head decrease in the whole basin fig s2 a and c however the flow slows down less in the freshwater zone which occupies the shallower zones of the basin fig s2 e 3 2 3 permeability anisotropy the permeability anisotropy coefficient which is the ratio of the horizontal to vertical permeability was varied ranging between ε 1 1000 while the value of the horizontal permeability was fixed kx 10 12 m2 weakening the vertical permeability leads to slower flow which extends the simulation time for models where 2myr was not enough to reach the stationary solution and the variation of the monitoring parameters was very slow a steady state solution was calculated from the end of the time depending solution it was found that the anisotropy strongly modifies the shape of the saltwater zone fig 7 displays the stationary solution of the salt concentration at different permeability anisotropies as the anisotropy increases from ε 1 to 50 fig 7 a d the boundary between the salt and the freshwater zones changes from convex to concave since the groundwater flow becomes constrained to shallower zones growing the anisotropy beyond the value of ε 100 the penetration of the regional groundwater flow decreases and a sluggish layer evolves in the deep part of the basin in the case of ε 1000 this sluggish zone becomes thicker approx 1 5 2 km the concentration in the salt layer shows a diffuse pattern indicating that there is no relevant advective mass transport monitoring parameters point out the dichotomy of the effect of anisotropy as ε increases the average darcy flux decreases with an increasing gradient fig 8 a the change in the morphology of the saltwater dome ε 1 50 is reflected in a slight decrease of the average concentration and the relative area of the saline zone fig 8 b and d within this interval the darcy flux in the saltwater zone is nearly constant at higher anisotropy values ε 50 the topography driven fresh groundwater does not reach the bottom of the basin which facilitates the formation of the deep saline sluggish dense layer above the bottom this thickening layer enhances the average salt content fig 8 b which results in a relevant head decrease fig 8 c the size of the saline zone increases fig 8 d and the darcy flux decreases steeply fig 8 e as a result of the appearance of the diffuse transition across the salt and freshwater boundary the salt content of the freshwater zone grows fig 8 f 3 3 effect of dispersivity longitudinal dispersivity was raised from the value of the base model α l 0 to 100 m fig 9 meanwhile the transverse dispersivity varied together with α l as α t α l 10 even though the longitudinal dispersivity is only α l 1 m the concentration distribution within the saline dome becomes more homogeneous fig 9 b by increasing α l to 10 m the salt content is getting higher owing to 1 the enhanced longitudinal dispersion of inner convection within the saltwater zone and 2 the higher transverse dispersion across the bottom below the saline dome fig 9 a e as the dispersivity was increased further α l 10 100 m the boundary separating the salt and the freshwater zone thickens due to the incremented transverse dispersion in addition a thin salty layer evolves along the bottom of the model beneath the freshwater zone mechanical dispersion facilitates the solute content mixing both within and between the zones and consequently it enhances salt transport the surface sherwood number weatherill et al 2004 increases from 146 to 1410 within the range of α l 0 100 m fig 10 quantifies the above mentioned processes within the interval of α l 0 10 m the saltwater zone enlarges from as 20 to 30 fig 10 d its solute content increases by dispersive mixing fig 10 f and the flow intensifies due to the stronger linkage between the salt dome and the topography driven freshwater zone fig 10 e the broadening salt dome reduces the average darcy flux of the basin flow by approx 10 fig 10 a enhances the average salt content considerably fig 10 b which results in lower hydraulic heads fig 10 c when the longitudinal dispersivity is ranged from α l 10 to 100 m there is no such a significant variation in the monitoring parameters as the transition zone thickens due to the effective transverse dispersion flux between the salt and freshwater zones and along the bottom of the basin the darcy flux difference and the solute content difference between the two zones moderate fig 10 e and f 3 4 effect of water table amplitude the influence of topography driven groundwater flow can be directly stimulated by the water table gradient in the synthetic model the amplitude of the water table was varied between a 0 and 500 m to observe the modification of the saltwater zone in the models where the amplitude was higher than that of the base model a 50 m the regional groundwater flow was intense enough to press the saline dome to the left side fig 11 e g the saline zone shrank toward the stagnation point and its density increased to be able to resist the regional freshwater flow for lower water table amplitudes a 50 m the topography driven flow weakens thus the saline zone tends to pervade the deeper part of the basin to form a dense saline layer fig 11 a c it is worth noting when the amplitude is approx a 10 m the topography driven groundwater flow is weak enough to press the saline dome to the discharge zone but strong enough to advect the brackish water from the model fig 11 b as a result the size of the saline zone is reduced at a 1 m the regional flow is weak which results in a nearly diffuse density based layering fig 11 a stationary numerical solutions show a linear relationship between the average darcy flux and the water table head following darcy s law formulated in eq 2 fig 12 a the more intense the regional flow is the lower the average salt concentration in the basin is noticed fig 12 b and lower salt content causes higher hydraulic heads fig 12 c hydraulic head higher than zero is the consequence of that the area dominated by recharge is enhanced while the area dominated by discharge is reduced at a 50 m the relative area of the zone having h 0 is 50 3 while it is 53 1 at a 500 m as the water table amplitude decreases the average head becomes more negative for the model of a 1 m only 15 1 of the model domain is characterized by a hydraulic head higher than zero decreasing water table amplitude eventuates in that the darcy flux is reduced both in the fresh and the saltwater zone fig 12 e the flow within the saline zone is slower by 1 2 orders of magnitude the darcy flux in the model without water table variation a 0 tends to zero therefore it is not displayed in fig 12 e the size of the saline zone increases by weakening the topography driven flow a and it converges to as af 0 5 at a 0 diffuse solution in fig 12 d however a local extremum appears in the curves near a 10 m where a transition exists in the morphology of the saltwater zone and the saline dome transforms into a deep saline layer the salt content of the freshwater zone is practically zero if a 50 m the regional flow sweeps out the saltwater from the topography dominated groundwater zone fig 12 f since the salt content of the saline zone increases by a a sharp boundary evolves between the two zones in the absence of mechanical dispersion fig 11 g on the contrary reducing a the concentration of the two zones converge to the diffuse solution cs 0 75 and cf 0 25 4 demonstration in a realistic environment a two dimensional section was selected to demonstrate the interaction of topography and salinity driven groundwater flows in a real hydrological environment in hungary the area was extensively investigated by mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 mádl szőnyi et al 2019 and mádlné szőnyi 2020 studying the geological and structural settings hydrostratigraphy examining the hydrocarbon and hydrogeological systems analysing pressure and salinity data from wells etc in detail in addition a two dimensional numerical simulation was carried out taking into the consideration only the effect of topography and the advective heat transport mádl szőnyi et al 2019 therefore in this part only the most relevant information is summarized which is necessary to elucidate the background of the numerical flow and transport simulation and time variation of salinity fig 13 illustrates the location of the section in the nw part of the great hungarian plain crossing the gödöllő hills from sw to ne direction in hungary the section length is 48 5 km the depth of the model varies between 3590 and 3625 m depending on the water table topography the geology of the area was grouped into five hydrostratigraphic units hsu complemented by the original pore fluid content table 3 the karstified triassic carbonate hsu1 the eocene limestone hsu2 the clayey oligocene aquitard hsu3 the siliciclastic miocene aquifer aquitard group hsu4 and the undifferentiated upper miocene pliocene quaternary group hsu5 mádlné szőnyi 2020 in the hydrostratigraphic division hsu1 and hsu5 are considered as the main aquifers and hsu3 represents the main aquitard based on geological and hydrogeological descriptions and evaluation of pumping test data rman and tóth 2011 garamhegyi et al 2020 the hydrostratigraphic section of the study area and the location of faults are originally based on seismic interpretation of mol plc mádlné szőnyi et al 2013 the most significant difference between the present model and the model of mádl szőnyi et al 2019 is that the evolution of the salinity is taken into account here following eq 4 since most hydrostratigraphic units were deposited in a marine environment we simplified the real situation and the initial condition for salt concentration was c 1 in each unit at a relative density difference of β 3 tds of approx 40 000 mg l the boundary conditions for the flow are a linearized surface water table with a maximum elevation of 125 m at x 20 km representing the gödöllő hills fig 14 a along the left and right boundary of the model the head is fixed at 100 m and 90 m respectively showing the flow through character of the model the model is closed from below by a no flow boundary boundary conditions for the salt concentration are c 0 on the surface knowing that the study area is a recharge zone while the bottom boundary is no flux representing the impervious base rock along the side walls c 0 in hsu4 and hsu5 where the freshwater outflow dominates and c 0 1 in hsu1 hsu3 units which have no direct connection to meteoric waters faults are implicated in the model as domains with an average aperture of 10 m and characterized with hydrogeological parameters listed in table 3 additional modifications were made compared to the model of mádl szőnyi et al 2019 mechanical dispersion was introduced due to the coupled topography and salinity driven problem based on the former synthetic model results the value of the longitudinal dispersivity was defined as α l 100 m and the transverse dispersivity was α t 10 m in order to handle the effective molecular diffusion in porous medium deff the bruggeman model was used wu et al 2019 that is deff φ3 2 ddiff using additional thermal well hydraulic data the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of hsu1 and hsu2 was reduced by one order of magnitude also the values of anisotropic coefficients were increased from ε 10 to 100 in units hsu2 hsu5 where the layered siliciclastic sediments effectively retard the vertical groundwater flow e g galsa 1997 rman and tóth 2011 hoque and burgess 2020 the evolution of the salt concentration is presented for four different time steps up to the maximum simulation time of 1myr fig 14 b e only 1kyr is enough for the meteoric water to displace the saltwater in the upper part of hsu5 after 10kyr saltwater is swept out from hsu5 and the upper part of hsu4 dense salty plumes descend from the clayey hsu3 aquitard into the karstified hsu1 at x 3 10 km where the aquitard is the thinnest fig 14 c the faults at x 6 and 34 km where the salt content decrease appears firstly facilitate the hydraulic connection between the aquifers above and below hsu3 after 100kyr hsu4 and hsu5 are fully saturated by freshwater while hsu1 is saturated by brackish water flowing through this domain from sw to ne fig 14 d small scaled salty downwellings are noticeable in hsu2 directly below the oligocene aquitard hsu3 after 1myr a considerable part of the original salt content has already been preserved in the lower part of hsu3 however the salinity of the layer has not been uniform fig 14 e the concentration is higher in the zones which are thicker and are far from the hydraulically conductive faults if the saline water reaches a fault or the boundary of hsu3 by diffusion it will be effectively advected and displaced by fresh brackish groundwater fig 14 f emphasizes that hsu4 and hsu5 are dominated by topography driven meteoric groundwater flow while hsu1 and hsu2 are prevailed by brackish through flow however the upper and lower units are not perfectly separated because the two groundwater types communicate through faults and the thin parts of the hsu3 aquitard finally we note that a hydraulic head maximum 120 125 m can be noticed in the surroundings of the topographic divide gödöllő hills x 20 km fig 14g on the other hand distinctive head minima appear in the lower part of hsu3 correlating with the salt content within these zones even a 100 m head decrease is present compared to the freshwater zone 5 interpretation and discussion 5 1 synthetic scenarios based on the synthetic simulations it was established that a saltwater zone evolves beneath the discharge zone as a result of a dynamic equilibrium between the negative buoyancy force of saltwater and the topography driven fresh groundwater flow the size and shape of the saline zone depend on the studied parameters in general if the effect of salinity becomes dominant the saltwater zone forms a dense salty layer in the deeper part of the basin if the salinity driven buoyancy prevails against the regional flow the salt concentration tends to the diffuse distribution without advective solute content transport this is the case when the relative density contrast β 10 fig 2 d g and the permeability anisotropy ε 100 fig 7 e g are enhanced or the water table amplitude is reduced a 5 m fig 11 a b however if the topography driven groundwater flow becomes dominant the saltwater zone shrinks and it is pressed toward the stagnation point beneath the discharge zone the diffusion from below is not sufficient to maintain an extended saline zone against the regional flow this solution is obtained from the simulations by decreasing the salinity β 1 fig 2 a or by increasing the water table amplitude a 200 m fig 11 g monitoring parameters quantify the effects of studied parameters on darcy flux the salt concentration and the hydraulic head etc computed for the entire basin and or the salt and freshwater zone besides they highlight the modifications in the extent and morphology of the saltwater zone saline zone to layer at ε 100 fig 8 b d or the transition from advection to diffusion dominated mass transport system at a 10 m fig 12 b and d darcy flux values averaged for the different zones indicate that sluggish circulation occurs within the saltwater zone the flow in the saline zone is slower by approx 1 2 orders of magnitude but qs and qf seem not to be independent of each other the diffusion mechanism is supposed to couple these two zones near the zone boundaries the diffusive flux is high due to the large concentration gradient and the salt content in the saline zone decreases resulting in buoyancy force and upward motion being parallel to the regional groundwater flow fig 3 we note that this weak linkage can be overtaken by small scale heterogeneities within the saltwater zone which can lead to more complex inner convection fig s3 in supplementary material in the studied parameter interval the variation of permeability and dispersivity do not cause relevant modifications in the shape of the saline water zone it is worth mentioning that qualitatively the permeability decrease and the dispersivity increase affect the structure of the saline zone in a similar way first the salt content increases by homogenization fig 5 a d and fig 9 a d then it decreases by thickening the transition between the two zones fig 5 e g and fig 9 e h the latter process can be attributed to the increase of the relative effect of diffusion reducing the permeability retains the role of advection and to the amplification of transverse dispersion both phenomena strengthen the coupling between the two zones as it is supported by the fact that the difference between qf and qs decreases from 2 to 1 orders of magnitude fig 6 e and fig 10 e the effect of the permeability decreasing exponentially with depth is very similar to the case of permeability decrease but its influence weakens toward the surface dimensionless numbers facilitate the simultaneous interpretation of the effects of different model parameters on the behavior of the groundwater flow system sherwood number sh describes the ratio of the surface concentration flux and the concentration flux due to purely diffusion it means that the larger the value of sh the stronger the role of advection convection in the solute transport péclet number pe expresses the convective transport i e qav the average darcy flux in simulations compared to diffusion and dispersive solute transport 7 pe q av d d diff α l q av both the diffusive and dispersive fluxes are used in the denominator since both hinder the convection e g simmons and narayan 1997 fig 15 a shows the sherwood number plotted against the péclet number for each synthetic simulation increasing salinity β retains the flow slightly and reduces the surface solute flux by almost one order of magnitude decreasing permeability in the homogeneous k the depth dependent γ and the anisotropic ε models slow down the flow and lessens the surface concentration flux when the effective permeability decreases with depth γ ε where the salt content is higher a reduction in sh is more pronounced although the dispersivity α l decreases pe by enhancing the denominator of 7 sh increases owing to the stronger coupling between the salt and freshwater zones by higher transverse dispersion higher water table amplitude a intensifies the advective transport and raises the surface concentration flux while lower water table amplitude decreases both pe and sh and drives the system toward the thin saline layer and then toward the diffusion state in the most numerical solutions a dense sluggish saline dome forms beneath the discharge zone but decreasing the water table amplitude a or increasing permeability anisotropy ε and salinity β the system transforms into a thin layer or a diffusion regime solid symbols szijártó et al 2019 defined a modified péclet number to separate the effect of thermal buoyancy from the total convective darcy flux in synthetic groundwater flow models driven by mixed thermal convection in this paper we reinterpreted the former definition because 1 advection competes with molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion instead of thermal diffusion and 2 the haline convection retards the flow in the studied models thus the modified péclet number is 8 pe q adv q av d d diff α l q av using the difference between the advective qadv and the total convective qav darcy flux advective darcy flux was calculated for each simulation at β 0 that is the negative buoyancy force of salinity was neglected the relation between the topography driven and the buoyancy driven groundwater flow is elucidated in fig 15 b where pe pe is proportional to the advective darcy flux and pe pe pe shows the ratio of the total convective and advective darcy flux see eq 7 and 8 when the salinity does not influence the flow β 0 the advective qadv and convective flux qav are identical pe pe pe 1 the increase in salinity retains the regional groundwater flow e g the convective darcy flux at a value of β 0 2 is reduced by 43 the decrease of permeability in a homogeneous medium k and the increase in mechanical dispersion α l similarly affect the convective flux see figs 5 and 9 decrease in k and increase in α l considerably reduce the advective transport compared to diffusion and dispersion pe pe respectively but these effects moderate the convective flow relative to the base model by only some percent effective permeability decreasing with depth γ ε slows down the flow and lessens the role of salinity induced buoyancy force as pe pe pe tends to 1 increasing the water table amplitude a strengthens the advective flux and weakens the influence of salinity on the flow on the other hand decreasing water table amplitude accentuates the negative buoyancy force as for instance the convective flux at a 1 m is reduced to 23 zhang et al 2020b noted that the increase of salinity retards the nested groundwater flow intensity analogously to our findings although their hierarchical synthetic models have different boundary conditions qualitatively a similar brine zone with counter rotating inner convection forms beneath playas as an interaction between the freshwater infiltration in the surrounding mountains and the redissolution of evaporites in playas both on regional duffy and al hassan 1988 and on a local scale hamann et al 2015 however in these models the saltwater recharge across the surface destabilizes the system and stimulates the groundwater flow while in our models the salt transport occurs from below which stabilizes the system and hinders the groundwater flow at the same time the dispersive flux through the boundary of the salt and freshwater zones appears in both simulations the transverse dispersion between the two zones enhances the coupling between the flow systems by decoupling the flow from the salt transport as was concluded by wen et al 2018 who investigated the role of dispersion on co2 storage in deep saline aquifers in an examined realistic hydrogeological situation β 2 5 kx 10 12 m2 ε 100 α l 100 m and a 50 m a thin saline layer approx 17 500 35 000 mg l formed due to the high anisotropy coefficient and it occupied the lower 7 6 of the basin lower 380 m the average tds content of the saline layer and the topography driven upper zone was 26 100 mg l and 1 240 mg l respectively the brackish character of the upper zone is explained by the large value of transverse dispersivity α t 10 m which enhanced the salinity flux into the freshwater zone the maximum tds content near the surface approximates only 630 mg l in the leftmost part of the discharge zone however this value reaches 4000 mg l at a depth of 200 m which can seriously deteriorate the quality of the water in case of drinking and irrigation utilization the darcy flux in the upper zone qf 6 8 10 9 m s is higher than that in the saline sluggish layer by a factor of approx 110 the average water density in the saline water layer is 1018 kg m3 resulting in a 50 m hydraulic head decrease in the entire layer 5 2 realistic scenario numerical modelling of the studied hydrogeological section illustrates that the high salt content trapped in the clayey oligocene aquitard hsu3 can survive over 1myr based on samples of hydrocarbon and thermal wells high tds content in the oligocene aquitard 30 000 50 000 mg l and brackish pore water observed in triassic carbonates 1 000 10 000 mg l mádl szőnyi et al 2019 agree with the numerical model results fig 14 e the elevated tds content explains the hydraulic head deficit measured in hsu3 and it is in harmony with the finding that the thicker hsu3 the lower the hydraulic head however higher salt content cannot elucidate the underpressure mádl szőnyi et al 2015 which might be the result of decompaction and insufficient groundwater replenishment due to the uplifting of gödöllő hills which started 3 4myr ago ruszkiczay rüdiger et al 2007 during the last 3 4myr gödöllő hills became a topographic divide which facilitated the significance of a topography driven groundwater flow system since the entire section is a recharge area the upper neogene and quaternary units hsu4 and hsu5 are characterized by low tds based on data evaluation the fractured and confined triassic carbonate is likely to be in connection with unconfined carbonate on the western side of danube river fig 13 c so it is part of the buda thermal karst btk system mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 szijártó et al 2021 however the connection and isolation are tectonically influenced thus it can differ from place to place mádlné szőnyi 2020 brackish pore water in hsu1 and hsu2 can be the consequence of the meteoric water infiltration in the unconfined part of btk the hydraulic connection between the unconfined and confined carbonates and the weak saltwater leakage from hsu3 based on the numerical simulation the linkage between the topography driven fresh groundwater hsu4 and hsu5 and the compositionally mixed brackish karst water hsu1 and hsu2 is plausible through faults and the thinnest parts of the oligocene aquitard hsu3 these simulations like each numerical or conceptual model include simplifications and have limitations which can modify the outcomes 1 one of them is that source sink terms precipitation and dissolution of salts e g vásquez et al 2013 hamann et al 2015 evaporite formation etc are not built into the simulations however the exit of the salt content is allowed through the upper boundary of the synthetic model by diffusion however it is supposed that these local scale processes cannot considerably change the received basin scale flow pattern 2 although equivalent porous media epm approximation can be accepted in the karstified carbonates on basin scale e g long et al 1982 scanlon et al 2003 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 the effect of relevant hydraulically conductive faults was taken into account berre et al 2019 3 for the sake of simplicity the effect of thermal buoyancy was neglected in the simulations which might be another important factor in deep karstified basin scale carbonate systems e g havril et al 2016 szijártó et al 2019 2021 however a recent study showed that in the presence of topography driven groundwater flow advective heat transport exists but free thermal convection might occur only at higher rayleigh numbers szijártó et al 2019 for the purposes of this paper omittance of buoyancy due to temperature differences can be an acceptable assumption the fully coupled solutions topography plus salinity plus temperature indicate a plausible perspective of further simulations nevertheless a preliminary simulation was completed along the hydrogeological section crossing gödöllő hills in order to flash the process of topothermohaline convection where the flow pattern and the salt concentration is controlled by both the water table topography and the buoyancy force due to the temperature and the salinity variation supplementary material as a working hypothesis for further simulations it can be established that owing to the elevated geothermal gradient characterizing the area thermal convection formed in the deep partly confined karstified aquifers hsu1 and hsu2 which intensified the flow strengthened the hydrodynamic connection between the upper hsu4 and hsu5 and lower aquifers and facilitated the saltwater drainage from the clayey oligocene aquitard hsu3 fig s4 in supplementary material 4 in both the synthetic simulations and the case study the upper boundary condition for the flow was a simple cosinusoid or a linear hydraulic head however local variations in the topography and the water table can disturb the flow pattern and the salinity field as well a hierarchically nested groundwater system could induce a more complex distribution of the salt concentration and the temperature zhang et al 2020b an et al 2015 in general higher salinity and surface heat flux are expected in the regional discharge area rather than in local discharge recharge areas the lowest salinity and heat flux are probable in regional recharge zones nonetheless the formation of time dependent thermal buoyancy which strongly depends on the physical and geometrical model parameters szijártó et al 2019 is able to modulate or even overwrite the above mentioned simplified consideration resulting in a complex nested system where the flow the salinity and the heat vary in time and space 6 conclusions interaction of topography and salinity driven groundwater flow was systematically investigated in synthetic two dimensional basin scale numerical models and then in a realistic scenario based on the siliciclastic carbonate basin in hungary it was established in the synthetic analyses that the effect of increasing water density due to salinity and decreasing water table amplitude on the saltwater distribution is similar the first enhances the buoyancy driven free convection while the second reduces the topography driven forced convection thus the numerical solutions trend from a topography dominated regional freshwater system towards a diffusion dominated layered system the increase of permeability anisotropy shows similar progress towards the formation of a dense saline layer in the deeper part of the basin in the studied parameter domain both the decrease of permeability and the increase of dispersivity extinguish the relative role of advection by enhancing the diffusion or dispersion respectively the two phenomena strengthen the coupling between the fresh and saltwater zone based on the synthetic simulation set the coupled topography and salinity driven model was applied along a 2d hydrogeological section in hungary after 100kyr the original marine pore water is outplaced from both the upper siliciclastic aquifers by topography driven meteoric freshwater and the lower karstified carbonates by the brackish groundwater through flow however the marine origin pore water in the middle aquitard can survive over 1myr resulting in a significant head minimum the connection between the upper and lower pervious units are revealed by the presence of conductive faults while the connection between the clayey cover and confined carbonates is represented by dense saline finger like downwellings the current study improves the understanding of the interaction between the topography driven forced and the salinity driven free convection especially in basin scale groundwater flow systems on the one hand the sensitivity analysis of the synthetic models highlights the role of the most important model parameters influencing the coupled flow system on the other hand the phenomenon of mixed convection was investigated and proved along a simplified 2d hydrogeological section in hungary to demonstrate the mixing of fresh brackish and saline water nevertheless the combined topography and salinity driven groundwater flow plays an important role in the atacama salt flat aquifer chile tejeda et al 2003 vásquez et al 2013

a rising degree in order to investigate the problem of coupled topography and salinity driven groundwater flow on a basin scale a systematic simulation set has been carried out in a synthetic numerical model detailed sensitivity analysis was completed to reveal the effect of the salinity permeability permeability heterogeneity and anisotropy mechanical dispersivity and water table head on the salt concentration field and the flow pattern it was established that a saline dome with slow inner convection formed beneath the discharge zone in the base model due to the topography driven regional fresh groundwater flow an increase in the salinity or the anisotropy or decrease in the water table variation weakens the role of the forced convection driven by the topography thus facilitating the formation of a saline dense sluggish layer in the deepest zone of the basin in the studied parameter range the variation in permeability and dispersivity affects the shape of the saltwater dome to less degree however the decrease in permeability and or the increase in dispersivity advantage the homogenization of the salt concentration within the saline zone and strengthen the

mixed topohaline convection salinity driven groundwater flow topography driven groundwater flow numerical modelling 1 introduction hydrogeological problems that we have to solve in practical tasks often refer to complex systems but our solutions are necessarily simplified unfortunately it means that we neglect many effects and processes and on the contrary put in the focus what we think is significant to exclude these uncertainties and better understand some physical fluid flow processes and their interactions we started a systematic analysis of superimposed fluid driving forces and their impacts on basin scale flow patterns we have already examined the combination of topography and thermal buoyancy that drive groundwater flow in a theoretical basin to better understand the influencing factors and the consequences of the interaction szijártó et al 2019 the lesson learnt from this systematic theoretical analysis we applied to a real hydrogeological system focusing on these driving forces szijártó et al 2021 in this paper we continue the analysis with the interactions of topography and salinity as driving forces of fluids on basin scale flow systems and demonstrate

of haline convection in a homogeneous horizontal infinite porous layer and van dam et al 2009 uncovered the first field documentation of precipitation induced saltwater fingering as a manifestation of natural free convection in a porous medium however the water table elevation varies from place to place thus the topography driven groundwater flow is always present in the upper part of the terrestrial basins tóth 2009 therefore it also acts in these terrestrial environments with elevated dissolved solid content consequently these cases require mathematical models typically numerical models to evaluate the coupled effects of topography and salinity driven groundwater flow the concept of coupled topography and salinity driven groundwater flow has been adopted to explain the high

effect of the salinity the hydraulic conductivity and the dispersivity on the positions of stagnation points and the hierarchy of the groundwater flow system however it seems from the published papers that topography effects are examined on a local scale or for simple basins but they are commonly neglected therefore some of the models remained oversimplified in terms of omittance of variations in topography and water table although numerical models are acknowledged tools to quantify the interaction of topography and salinity driven groundwater flow several questions are still unresolved regarding the sensitivity of these models to the key parameters feeding the governing equations small variations in critical parameters such as relative density differences due to salinity variations of intrinsic permeability anisotropy and mechanical dispersivity or change in water table amplitude may generate great deviations in model outputs as such given the ubiquitously difficult aquifer characterization that renders model parameterization always uncertain high sensitivity to model parameters can create high uncertainty in the decisions to be made about the water management of an aquifer while disentangling the model response to the input parameters is therefore of the uppermost importance this task is in turn severely complicated by the computational burden required to resolve the nonlinear fully coupled density dependent groundwater flow equations the main aim of this paper is to investigate through detailed numerical modelling how the interaction of topography driven forced and salinity driven free convection and the different model parameters influence the salt concentration and groundwater flow pattern at basin scales and thus how the decisions made from the model responses may vary depending on the model sensitivity other fluid driving forces e g temperature difference compaction compression were neglected in order to focus on and highlight the interaction of topography and salinity driven regional groundwater flow and systematically examine the effects of this interaction firstly once the processes and phenomena are comprehensively understood and synthesized other fluid driving processes can also be coupled therefore in the first part of the paper a two dimensional synthetic simulation set is presented where the effect of salinity dissolved solid content permeability depth dependence and anisotropy of permeability dispersivity and water table amplitude is qualified and quantified systematically by monitoring parameters

effect in a real environment along a hydrogeological section in hungary based on mádl szőnyi et al 2019 the fundamental goal is to reveal the evolution of marine origin pore water and to explain the formation of the fresh brackish and saltwater saturated units on a basin scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development the solution of the combined topography and salinity driven groundwater

the salt precipitation from the groundwater the initial condition for the flow was obtained from eqs 1 2 with reference water density fig 1 a and the initial condition for the concentration was calculated from eq 3 without the advection term q 0 which is the solution of the diffuse problem resulting in linear vertical concentration profile fig 1 b the coupled problem eq 1 3 was solved by comsol multiphysics v4 2 a finite element numerical software package zimmermann 2006 the model domain was discretized by triangle elements with a maximum size of 100 m and 8 boundary layer elements were used to minimize the inaccuracy due to the weak resolution of the high gradient zones thus the mesh consisted of 57 159 finite elements for the base model which varied between 56 880 80 023 as the water table amplitude was changed from 0 m to 500 m the pressure and the concentration were discretized within the elements by quadratic and linear polynomials respectively simulations were run until models reached the stationary solution which required typically 1myr ranging from 0 5 to 50myr e g for low permeability high permeability anisotropy or slight water table amplitude initial time steps were increased exponentially to 1000 yr to stabilize the transition effects after that the maximum time step was fixed as 100 yr simulations were run on an intel workstation with 24 cores requiring approx 1 2 days cpu time and 4 gb memory for one model before the synthetic simulation set the coupled model was expansively tested and confirmed in a horizontal and inclined layer and

dispersivity α l and α t and 6 the water level amplitude a the six selected parameters are usually uncertain given the limited characterization and exhibit strong scale dependency for instance the salinity of groundwaters may vary both in time and space in hungary it is typical that the salt concentration increases with depth owing to the deep marine sedimentary environment while salinity is lower in shallow strata complexes due to lacustrine sedimentation and the intense meteoric water infiltration e g varsányi and ó kovács 2009 szocs et al 2013 in general the groundwater salinity can vary from 0 to even 40 including fresh brackish saline and brine waters deming 2002 in this paper the effect of salinity on the water density is parameterized by a factor of β which presents the relative density increase of the water the aquifer permeability or hydraulic conductivity can vary over several orders of magnitude in relatively short spatial scales to the effects of geological heterogeneity sanchez vila et al 2006 pedretti et al 2016 liu et al 2016 one of the most common heterogeneities of permeability is its pressure dependence ehrenberg and nadeau 2005 permeability

permeability and z is the vertical coordinate pointing upwards anisotropy also controls the time evolution of flow and transport patterns in aquifers and depends on the nature and connectivity of the hydrogeological bodies cirpka et al 2015 pedretti et al 2014 in siliciclastic sedimentary basins where the sub horizontal aquifer and aquitard layers alternate the effective hydraulic conductivity strongly depends on the flow direction the horizontal permeability in such environments can exceed the vertical permeability by several orders of magnitude e g galsa 1997 hoque and burgess 2020

sediments the longitudinal dispersivity is scale dependent gao et al 2012 and varies within a wide range gelhar et al 1992 schulze makuch 2005 vanderborght and vereecken 2007 the variation of the water level influences both the flow pattern and the salinity of the groundwater as one of the main driving forces e g tóth 2009 the influence of forming dense saline zone layer on the concentration field and the flow pattern was studied both qualitatively and quantitatively monitoring parameters were defined to characterize the groundwater flow system by the average darcy flux qav concentration cav hydraulic head hav as well as the relative area as af the darcy flux qs qf and the concentration cs cf computed for both the saltwater subscript s and the freshwater subscript f zone the salt and freshwater zones were separated by an arbitrary boundary of the solute content of c 0 5 after the synthetic numerical simulations the topography and salinity driven groundwater flow model was applied along a 2d hydrogeological section in hungary taking into consideration the outcome of the synthetic model runs 3 synthetic model results 3 1 effect of relative density difference as a first step the effect of density increase due to salinity on the concentration field and the flow pattern was studied the results show that the saltwater is swept out from the basin by the topography driven groundwater flow when β 0 i e the water density is independent of the salt content fig 2 a a shrank zone beneath the discharge area can survive the regional freshwater circulation near the stagnation point see e g an et al 2015 even though the saltwater is denser by only 1 an extended saline zone c 0 5 contoured by a black line forms beneath the discharge area in the base model fig 2 b table 1 the concentration distribution within the saline zone is rather diffuse suggesting that there is no intense inner flow as the salt content i e water density due to salinity increases a dense layer evolves right above the model bottom fig 2 d g which consequently reduces the diffuse transport from the base below resulting in an average concentration decrease in the basin fig 3 illustrates how the dense saline zone modifies the regional unidirectional flow pattern when the concentration dependence of the water density is neglected fig 3 a the darcy flux field is equivalent to the solution of the simple darcy flow see fig 1 a when the water density is not neglected fig 3 b d the flow field strongly depends on the presence of the saline zone the most striking influence of the saline zone on the flow pattern is that the topography driven regional flow is suppressed but the magnitude of the darcy flux is not affected by the saline dome on the other hand slow circulation forms within the saltwater domain this sluggish inner convection has opposite vorticity compared to the regional groundwater flow the pattern of the inner convection depends strongly on the saline content as measured by β the higher the salinity contrast with the freshwater the more pronounced the recirculation zone note that β 3 produces an inner convection zone about two times more extended compared to β 1 the model is therefore highly sensitive to limited salinity changes the given problem of topography and salinity driven groundwater flow tends towards a stationary solution which is plotted against the relative density difference β fig 4 as the water density increases see eq 4 from β 0 to 0 2 the domain averaged darcy flux qav is reduced by 43 fig 4 a the domain averaged concentration cav shows a non monotonic character with a maximum at about β 2 3 fig 4 b when a considerable saltwater zone forms beneath the discharge area fig 2 c at a lower value of β the salt content cannot resist the topography driven groundwater flow while at a higher value of β a thin dense salty layer evolves in the deepest part of the basin the domain averaged hydraulic head hav becomes more negative owing to the increasing water density fig 4 c the specific behaviour of the saltwater and freshwater zone separated by the arbitrary isocontour of c 0 5 was also investigated as β increases the relative area of the dense saline zone as the area normed by the total area of the basin shrinks apart from the model of β 0 when the saltwater is swept out from the basin fig 2 a and 4 d on the contrary the relative area of the complementary freshwater zone af also normed by the total area of the basin increases in the same way as as decreases fig 4 e illustrates that the inner convective velocity of the saltwater zone qs is lower up to about two orders of magnitude compared to the velocity of the freshwater zone qf which remains quite constant qf 2 10 8 m s specifically the minimum saltwater velocity of qs 3 10 10 m s was found when β 2 i e at the peak of maximum domain averaged concentration cav this point also corresponds to the lowest average concentration of the dense zone cs 0 65 fig 4 f when an extended saltwater dome with thick transition zone forms beneath the discharge zone fig 2 c 3 2 effect of permeability 3 2 1 permeability in a homogeneous and isotropic medium the role of rock permeability on the salinity was investigated using the base model table 1 while the permeability horizontal and vertical was decreased from k 10 12 m2 to 10 14 m2 fig 5 illustrates that the change in permeability has no drastic influence on the salt concentration field by decreasing the permeability the flow linearly slows down fig 6 a according to eq 2 when the darcy flux is reduced in the freshwater zone the diffusion flux across the boundary of the salt and freshwater zones is retained lower diffusion flux from the saltwater zone results in higher salt content fig 6 b and a more homogeneous concentration field fig 5 a d as the average salt content increases the hydraulic head decreases due to the enhanced water density fig 6 c decreasing the permeability from k 10 13 m2 to 10 14 m2 the diffusion flux becomes commensurable to the order of advection thus the diffusion zone between the salt and freshwater thickens fig 5 d g a thickening diffusion zone appears above the model bottom as well while the change in permeability by two orders of magnitude drives an equal reduction in the average darcy flux the maximum of the diffusion flux reduces by only a factor of 5 specifically from 8 10 11 to 1 4 10 11 m s the permeability reduction influences the darcy flux of the saltwater and freshwater zones in a different manner fig 6 e the flow slows down in both zones but the gradient of the darcy flux curve is higher for the freshwater zone than the saltwater zone i e dqf dk dqs dk consequently the difference in the darcy flux decreases to one order of magnitude the effect of two processes appears both in the concentration and the relative area curves fig 6 d and f the homogenization in the cases of k 10 12 10 13 m2 increases the salt content and the area of the saline zone then the diffusion zone thickening in the cases of k 10 13 10 14 m2 hinders the rate of the area growth and it leads to a slight concentration decrease within the saltwater zone nevertheless the average salt content of the basin shows a slight increase fig 6 b owing to the slowing down regional groundwater flow 3 2 2 permeability heterogeneity owing to the increasing pressure the permeability shows a decrease downwards both in carbonates and sandstones which is frequently approximated by an exponential trend in eq 6 γ represents the factor of the permeability decay that is the ratio of the surface and bottom permeability fig s1 supplementary material illustrates the effect of γ on the concentration field within the interval of γ 1 100 increasing γ has a very similar influence on salinity as decreasing permeability in the previous part when the permeability decreases with depth by a factor of 1 10 fig s1 a d a homogenization occurs in the saltwater zone due to the lower darcy flux in the freshwater zone fig s2 e in supplementary material and the reduced diffusion flux across the boundary of the salt and freshwater zones the only difference between fig 5 and fig s1 is that the homogenization evolves not in the whole saltwater dome but it has a depth dependence γ 1 this process results in a considerable increase in average concentration fig s2 b the area and the concentration of the saltwater zone fig s2 d and f decreasing permeability with depth by 1 2 orders of magnitude γ 10 100 brings forward another phenomenon fig s1 d g the darcy flux decrease with depth is so pronounced that the diffusion approximates the advection in the mass transport thus a diffusion zone forms between the fresh and saltwater zones as well as along the bottom boundary it enhances the salinity in the freshwater zone fig s2 f because of the depth dependent permeability the diffusion zone thins upwards and in the near surface region the intense flow effectively erodes the top of the saltwater dome consequently a slight reduction can be observed in the average concentration fig s2 b the area and the concentration of the saltwater dome fig s2 d and f depth dependent permeability induces a continuous darcy flux and hydraulic head decrease in the whole basin fig s2 a and c however the flow slows down less in the freshwater zone which occupies the shallower zones of the basin fig s2 e 3 2 3 permeability anisotropy the permeability anisotropy coefficient which is the ratio of the horizontal to vertical permeability was varied ranging between ε 1 1000 while the value of the horizontal permeability was fixed kx 10 12 m2 weakening the vertical permeability leads to slower flow which extends the simulation time for models where 2myr was not enough to reach the stationary solution and the variation of the monitoring parameters was very slow a steady state solution was calculated from the end of the time depending solution it was found that the anisotropy strongly modifies the shape of the saltwater zone fig 7 displays the stationary solution of the salt concentration at different permeability anisotropies as the anisotropy increases from ε 1 to 50 fig 7 a d the boundary between the salt and the freshwater zones changes from convex to concave since the groundwater flow becomes constrained to shallower zones growing the anisotropy beyond the value of ε 100 the penetration of the regional groundwater flow decreases and a sluggish layer evolves in the deep part of the basin in the case of ε 1000 this sluggish zone becomes thicker approx 1 5 2 km the concentration in the salt layer shows a diffuse pattern indicating that there is no relevant advective mass transport monitoring parameters point out the dichotomy of the effect of anisotropy as ε increases the average darcy flux decreases with an increasing gradient fig 8 a the change in the morphology of the saltwater dome ε 1 50 is reflected in a slight decrease of the average concentration and the relative area of the saline zone fig 8 b and d within this interval the darcy flux in the saltwater zone is nearly constant at higher anisotropy values ε 50 the topography driven fresh groundwater does not reach the bottom of the basin which facilitates the formation of the deep saline sluggish dense layer above the bottom this thickening layer enhances the average salt content fig 8 b which results in a relevant head decrease fig 8 c the size of the saline zone increases fig 8 d and the darcy flux decreases steeply fig 8 e as a result of the appearance of the diffuse transition across the salt and freshwater boundary the salt content of the freshwater zone grows fig 8 f 3 3 effect of dispersivity longitudinal dispersivity was raised from the value of the base model α l 0 to 100 m fig 9 meanwhile the transverse dispersivity varied together with α l as α t α l 10 even though the longitudinal dispersivity is only α l 1 m the concentration distribution within the saline dome becomes more homogeneous fig 9 b by increasing α l to 10 m the salt content is getting higher owing to 1 the enhanced longitudinal dispersion of inner convection within the saltwater zone and 2 the higher transverse dispersion across the bottom below the saline dome fig 9 a e as the dispersivity was increased further α l 10 100 m the boundary separating the salt and the freshwater zone thickens due to the incremented transverse dispersion in addition a thin salty layer evolves along the bottom of the model beneath the freshwater zone mechanical dispersion facilitates the solute content mixing both within and between the zones and consequently it enhances salt transport the surface sherwood number weatherill et al 2004 increases from 146 to 1410 within the range of α l 0 100 m fig 10 quantifies the above mentioned processes within the interval of α l 0 10 m the saltwater zone enlarges from as 20 to 30 fig 10 d its solute content increases by dispersive mixing fig 10 f and the flow intensifies due to the stronger linkage between the salt dome and the topography driven freshwater zone fig 10 e the broadening salt dome reduces the average darcy flux of the basin flow by approx 10 fig 10 a enhances the average salt content considerably fig 10 b which results in lower hydraulic heads fig 10 c when the longitudinal dispersivity is ranged from α l 10 to 100 m there is no such a significant variation in the monitoring parameters as the transition zone thickens due to the effective transverse dispersion flux between the salt and freshwater zones and along the bottom of the basin the darcy flux difference and the solute content difference between the two zones moderate fig 10 e and f 3 4 effect of water table amplitude the influence of topography driven groundwater flow can be directly stimulated by the water table gradient in the synthetic model the amplitude of the water table was varied between a 0 and 500 m to observe the modification of the saltwater zone in the models where the amplitude was higher than that of the base model a 50 m the regional groundwater flow was intense enough to press the saline dome to the left side fig 11 e g the saline zone shrank toward the stagnation point and its density increased to be able to resist the regional freshwater flow for lower water table amplitudes a 50 m the topography driven flow weakens thus the saline zone tends to pervade the deeper part of the basin to form a dense saline layer fig 11 a c it is worth noting when the amplitude is approx a 10 m the topography driven groundwater flow is weak enough to press the saline dome to the discharge zone but strong enough to advect the brackish water from the model fig 11 b as a result the size of the saline zone is reduced at a 1 m the regional flow is weak which results in a nearly diffuse density based layering fig 11 a stationary numerical solutions show a linear relationship between the average darcy flux and the water table head following darcy s law formulated in eq 2 fig 12 a the more intense the regional flow is the lower the average salt concentration in the basin is noticed fig 12 b and lower salt content causes higher hydraulic heads fig 12 c hydraulic head higher than zero is the consequence of that the area dominated by recharge is enhanced while the area dominated by discharge is reduced at a 50 m the relative area of the zone having h 0 is 50 3 while it is 53 1 at a 500 m as the water table amplitude decreases the average head becomes more negative for the model of a 1 m only 15 1 of the model domain is characterized by a hydraulic head higher than zero decreasing water table amplitude eventuates in that the darcy flux is reduced both in the fresh and the saltwater zone fig 12 e the flow within the saline zone is slower by 1 2 orders of magnitude the darcy flux in the model without water table variation a 0 tends to zero therefore it is not displayed in fig 12 e the size of the saline zone increases by weakening the topography driven flow a and it converges to as af 0 5 at a 0 diffuse solution in fig 12 d however a local extremum appears in the curves near a 10 m where a transition exists in the morphology of the saltwater zone and the saline dome transforms into a deep saline layer the salt content of the freshwater zone is practically zero if a 50 m the regional flow sweeps out the saltwater from the topography dominated groundwater zone fig 12 f since the salt content of the saline zone increases by a a sharp boundary evolves between the two zones in the absence of mechanical dispersion fig 11 g on the contrary reducing a the concentration of the two zones converge to the diffuse solution cs 0 75 and cf 0 25 4 demonstration in a realistic environment a two dimensional section was selected to demonstrate the interaction of topography and salinity driven groundwater flows in a real hydrological environment in hungary the area was extensively investigated by mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 mádl szőnyi et al 2019 and mádlné szőnyi 2020 studying the geological and structural settings hydrostratigraphy examining the hydrocarbon and hydrogeological systems analysing pressure and salinity data from wells etc in detail in addition a two dimensional numerical simulation was carried out taking into the consideration only the effect of topography and the advective heat transport mádl szőnyi et al 2019 therefore in this part only the most relevant information is summarized which is necessary to elucidate the background of the numerical flow and transport simulation and time variation of salinity fig 13 illustrates the location of the section in the nw part of the great hungarian plain crossing the gödöllő hills from sw to ne direction in hungary the section length is 48 5 km the depth of the model varies between 3590 and 3625 m depending on the water table topography the geology of the area was grouped into five hydrostratigraphic units hsu complemented by the original pore fluid content table 3 the karstified triassic carbonate hsu1 the eocene limestone hsu2 the clayey oligocene aquitard hsu3 the siliciclastic miocene aquifer aquitard group hsu4 and the undifferentiated upper miocene pliocene quaternary group hsu5 mádlné szőnyi 2020 in the hydrostratigraphic division hsu1 and hsu5 are considered as the main aquifers and hsu3 represents the main aquitard based on geological and hydrogeological descriptions and evaluation of pumping test data rman and tóth 2011 garamhegyi et al 2020 the hydrostratigraphic section of the study area and the location of faults are originally based on seismic interpretation of mol plc mádlné szőnyi et al 2013 the most significant difference between the present model and the model of mádl szőnyi et al 2019 is that the evolution of the salinity is taken into account here following eq 4 since most hydrostratigraphic units were deposited in a marine environment we simplified the real situation and the initial condition for salt concentration was c 1 in each unit at a relative density difference of β 3 tds of approx 40 000 mg l the boundary conditions for the flow are a linearized surface water table with a maximum elevation of 125 m at x 20 km representing the gödöllő hills fig 14 a along the left and right boundary of the model the head is fixed at 100 m and 90 m respectively showing the flow through character of the model the model is closed from below by a no flow boundary boundary conditions for the salt concentration are c 0 on the surface knowing that the study area is a recharge zone while the bottom boundary is no flux representing the impervious base rock along the side walls c 0 in hsu4 and hsu5 where the freshwater outflow dominates and c 0 1 in hsu1 hsu3 units which have no direct connection to meteoric waters faults are implicated in the model as domains with an average aperture of 10 m and characterized with hydrogeological parameters listed in table 3 additional modifications were made compared to the model of mádl szőnyi et al 2019 mechanical dispersion was introduced due to the coupled topography and salinity driven problem based on the former synthetic model results the value of the longitudinal dispersivity was defined as α l 100 m and the transverse dispersivity was α t 10 m in order to handle the effective molecular diffusion in porous medium deff the bruggeman model was used wu et al 2019 that is deff φ3 2 ddiff using additional thermal well hydraulic data the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of hsu1 and hsu2 was reduced by one order of magnitude also the values of anisotropic coefficients were increased from ε 10 to 100 in units hsu2 hsu5 where the layered siliciclastic sediments effectively retard the vertical groundwater flow e g galsa 1997 rman and tóth 2011 hoque and burgess 2020 the evolution of the salt concentration is presented for four different time steps up to the maximum simulation time of 1myr fig 14 b e only 1kyr is enough for the meteoric water to displace the saltwater in the upper part of hsu5 after 10kyr saltwater is swept out from hsu5 and the upper part of hsu4 dense salty plumes descend from the clayey hsu3 aquitard into the karstified hsu1 at x 3 10 km where the aquitard is the thinnest fig 14 c the faults at x 6 and 34 km where the salt content decrease appears firstly facilitate the hydraulic connection between the aquifers above and below hsu3 after 100kyr hsu4 and hsu5 are fully saturated by freshwater while hsu1 is saturated by brackish water flowing through this domain from sw to ne fig 14 d small scaled salty downwellings are noticeable in hsu2 directly below the oligocene aquitard hsu3 after 1myr a considerable part of the original salt content has already been preserved in the lower part of hsu3 however the salinity of the layer has not been uniform fig 14 e the concentration is higher in the zones which are thicker and are far from the hydraulically conductive faults if the saline water reaches a fault or the boundary of hsu3 by diffusion it will be effectively advected and displaced by fresh brackish groundwater fig 14 f emphasizes that hsu4 and hsu5 are dominated by topography driven meteoric groundwater flow while hsu1 and hsu2 are prevailed by brackish through flow however the upper and lower units are not perfectly separated because the two groundwater types communicate through faults and the thin parts of the hsu3 aquitard finally we note that a hydraulic head maximum 120 125 m can be noticed in the surroundings of the topographic divide gödöllő hills x 20 km fig 14g on the other hand distinctive head minima appear in the lower part of hsu3 correlating with the salt content within these zones even a 100 m head decrease is present compared to the freshwater zone 5 interpretation and discussion 5 1 synthetic scenarios based on the synthetic simulations it was established that a saltwater zone evolves beneath the discharge zone as a result of a dynamic equilibrium between the negative buoyancy force of saltwater and the topography driven fresh groundwater flow the size and shape of the saline zone depend on the studied parameters in general if the effect of salinity becomes dominant the saltwater zone forms a dense salty layer in the deeper part of the basin if the salinity driven buoyancy prevails against the regional flow the salt concentration tends to the diffuse distribution without advective solute content transport this is the case when the relative density contrast β 10 fig 2 d g and the permeability anisotropy ε 100 fig 7 e g are enhanced or the water table amplitude is reduced a 5 m fig 11 a b however if the topography driven groundwater flow becomes dominant the saltwater zone shrinks and it is pressed toward the stagnation point beneath the discharge zone the diffusion from below is not sufficient to maintain an extended saline zone against the regional flow this solution is obtained from the simulations by decreasing the salinity β 1 fig 2 a or by increasing the water table amplitude a 200 m fig 11 g monitoring parameters quantify the effects of studied parameters on darcy flux the salt concentration and the hydraulic head etc computed for the entire basin and or the salt and freshwater zone besides they highlight the modifications in the extent and morphology of the saltwater zone saline zone to layer at ε 100 fig 8 b d or the transition from advection to diffusion dominated mass transport system at a 10 m fig 12 b and d darcy flux values averaged for the different zones indicate that sluggish circulation occurs within the saltwater zone the flow in the saline zone is slower by approx 1 2 orders of magnitude but qs and qf seem not to be independent of each other the diffusion mechanism is supposed to couple these two zones near the zone boundaries the diffusive flux is high due to the large concentration gradient and the salt content in the saline zone decreases resulting in buoyancy force and upward motion being parallel to the regional groundwater flow fig 3 we note that this weak linkage can be overtaken by small scale heterogeneities within the saltwater zone which can lead to more complex inner convection fig s3 in supplementary material in the studied parameter interval the variation of permeability and dispersivity do not cause relevant modifications in the shape of the saline water zone it is worth mentioning that qualitatively the permeability decrease and the dispersivity increase affect the structure of the saline zone in a similar way first the salt content increases by homogenization fig 5 a d and fig 9 a d then it decreases by thickening the transition between the two zones fig 5 e g and fig 9 e h the latter process can be attributed to the increase of the relative effect of diffusion reducing the permeability retains the role of advection and to the amplification of transverse dispersion both phenomena strengthen the coupling between the two zones as it is supported by the fact that the difference between qf and qs decreases from 2 to 1 orders of magnitude fig 6 e and fig 10 e the effect of the permeability decreasing exponentially with depth is very similar to the case of permeability decrease but its influence weakens toward the surface dimensionless numbers facilitate the simultaneous interpretation of the effects of different model parameters on the behavior of the groundwater flow system sherwood number sh describes the ratio of the surface concentration flux and the concentration flux due to purely diffusion it means that the larger the value of sh the stronger the role of advection convection in the solute transport péclet number pe expresses the convective transport i e qav the average darcy flux in simulations compared to diffusion and dispersive solute transport 7 pe q av d d diff α l q av both the diffusive and dispersive fluxes are used in the denominator since both hinder the convection e g simmons and narayan 1997 fig 15 a shows the sherwood number plotted against the péclet number for each synthetic simulation increasing salinity β retains the flow slightly and reduces the surface solute flux by almost one order of magnitude decreasing permeability in the homogeneous k the depth dependent γ and the anisotropic ε models slow down the flow and lessens the surface concentration flux when the effective permeability decreases with depth γ ε where the salt content is higher a reduction in sh is more pronounced although the dispersivity α l decreases pe by enhancing the denominator of 7 sh increases owing to the stronger coupling between the salt and freshwater zones by higher transverse dispersion higher water table amplitude a intensifies the advective transport and raises the surface concentration flux while lower water table amplitude decreases both pe and sh and drives the system toward the thin saline layer and then toward the diffusion state in the most numerical solutions a dense sluggish saline dome forms beneath the discharge zone but decreasing the water table amplitude a or increasing permeability anisotropy ε and salinity β the system transforms into a thin layer or a diffusion regime solid symbols szijártó et al 2019 defined a modified péclet number to separate the effect of thermal buoyancy from the total convective darcy flux in synthetic groundwater flow models driven by mixed thermal convection in this paper we reinterpreted the former definition because 1 advection competes with molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion instead of thermal diffusion and 2 the haline convection retards the flow in the studied models thus the modified péclet number is 8 pe q adv q av d d diff α l q av using the difference between the advective qadv and the total convective qav darcy flux advective darcy flux was calculated for each simulation at β 0 that is the negative buoyancy force of salinity was neglected the relation between the topography driven and the buoyancy driven groundwater flow is elucidated in fig 15 b where pe pe is proportional to the advective darcy flux and pe pe pe shows the ratio of the total convective and advective darcy flux see eq 7 and 8 when the salinity does not influence the flow β 0 the advective qadv and convective flux qav are identical pe pe pe 1 the increase in salinity retains the regional groundwater flow e g the convective darcy flux at a value of β 0 2 is reduced by 43 the decrease of permeability in a homogeneous medium k and the increase in mechanical dispersion α l similarly affect the convective flux see figs 5 and 9 decrease in k and increase in α l considerably reduce the advective transport compared to diffusion and dispersion pe pe respectively but these effects moderate the convective flow relative to the base model by only some percent effective permeability decreasing with depth γ ε slows down the flow and lessens the role of salinity induced buoyancy force as pe pe pe tends to 1 increasing the water table amplitude a strengthens the advective flux and weakens the influence of salinity on the flow on the other hand decreasing water table amplitude accentuates the negative buoyancy force as for instance the convective flux at a 1 m is reduced to 23 zhang et al 2020b noted that the increase of salinity retards the nested groundwater flow intensity analogously to our findings although their hierarchical synthetic models have different boundary conditions qualitatively a similar brine zone with counter rotating inner convection forms beneath playas as an interaction between the freshwater infiltration in the surrounding mountains and the redissolution of evaporites in playas both on regional duffy and al hassan 1988 and on a local scale hamann et al 2015 however in these models the saltwater recharge across the surface destabilizes the system and stimulates the groundwater flow while in our models the salt transport occurs from below which stabilizes the system and hinders the groundwater flow at the same time the dispersive flux through the boundary of the salt and freshwater zones appears in both simulations the transverse dispersion between the two zones enhances the coupling between the flow systems by decoupling the flow from the salt transport as was concluded by wen et al 2018 who investigated the role of dispersion on co2 storage in deep saline aquifers in an examined realistic hydrogeological situation β 2 5 kx 10 12 m2 ε 100 α l 100 m and a 50 m a thin saline layer approx 17 500 35 000 mg l formed due to the high anisotropy coefficient and it occupied the lower 7 6 of the basin lower 380 m the average tds content of the saline layer and the topography driven upper zone was 26 100 mg l and 1 240 mg l respectively the brackish character of the upper zone is explained by the large value of transverse dispersivity α t 10 m which enhanced the salinity flux into the freshwater zone the maximum tds content near the surface approximates only 630 mg l in the leftmost part of the discharge zone however this value reaches 4000 mg l at a depth of 200 m which can seriously deteriorate the quality of the water in case of drinking and irrigation utilization the darcy flux in the upper zone qf 6 8 10 9 m s is higher than that in the saline sluggish layer by a factor of approx 110 the average water density in the saline water layer is 1018 kg m3 resulting in a 50 m hydraulic head decrease in the entire layer 5 2 realistic scenario numerical modelling of the studied hydrogeological section illustrates that the high salt content trapped in the clayey oligocene aquitard hsu3 can survive over 1myr based on samples of hydrocarbon and thermal wells high tds content in the oligocene aquitard 30 000 50 000 mg l and brackish pore water observed in triassic carbonates 1 000 10 000 mg l mádl szőnyi et al 2019 agree with the numerical model results fig 14 e the elevated tds content explains the hydraulic head deficit measured in hsu3 and it is in harmony with the finding that the thicker hsu3 the lower the hydraulic head however higher salt content cannot elucidate the underpressure mádl szőnyi et al 2015 which might be the result of decompaction and insufficient groundwater replenishment due to the uplifting of gödöllő hills which started 3 4myr ago ruszkiczay rüdiger et al 2007 during the last 3 4myr gödöllő hills became a topographic divide which facilitated the significance of a topography driven groundwater flow system since the entire section is a recharge area the upper neogene and quaternary units hsu4 and hsu5 are characterized by low tds based on data evaluation the fractured and confined triassic carbonate is likely to be in connection with unconfined carbonate on the western side of danube river fig 13 c so it is part of the buda thermal karst btk system mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 szijártó et al 2021 however the connection and isolation are tectonically influenced thus it can differ from place to place mádlné szőnyi 2020 brackish pore water in hsu1 and hsu2 can be the consequence of the meteoric water infiltration in the unconfined part of btk the hydraulic connection between the unconfined and confined carbonates and the weak saltwater leakage from hsu3 based on the numerical simulation the linkage between the topography driven fresh groundwater hsu4 and hsu5 and the compositionally mixed brackish karst water hsu1 and hsu2 is plausible through faults and the thinnest parts of the oligocene aquitard hsu3 these simulations like each numerical or conceptual model include simplifications and have limitations which can modify the outcomes 1 one of them is that source sink terms precipitation and dissolution of salts e g vásquez et al 2013 hamann et al 2015 evaporite formation etc are not built into the simulations however the exit of the salt content is allowed through the upper boundary of the synthetic model by diffusion however it is supposed that these local scale processes cannot considerably change the received basin scale flow pattern 2 although equivalent porous media epm approximation can be accepted in the karstified carbonates on basin scale e g long et al 1982 scanlon et al 2003 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 the effect of relevant hydraulically conductive faults was taken into account berre et al 2019 3 for the sake of simplicity the effect of thermal buoyancy was neglected in the simulations which might be another important factor in deep karstified basin scale carbonate systems e g havril et al 2016 szijártó et al 2019 2021 however a recent study showed that in the presence of topography driven groundwater flow advective heat transport exists but free thermal convection might occur only at higher rayleigh numbers szijártó et al 2019 for the purposes of this paper omittance of buoyancy due to temperature differences can be an acceptable assumption the fully coupled solutions topography plus salinity plus temperature indicate a plausible perspective of further simulations nevertheless a preliminary simulation was completed along the hydrogeological section crossing gödöllő hills in order to flash the process of topothermohaline convection where the flow pattern and the salt concentration is controlled by both the water table topography and the buoyancy force due to the temperature and the salinity variation supplementary material as a working hypothesis for further simulations it can be established that owing to the elevated geothermal gradient characterizing the area thermal convection formed in the deep partly confined karstified aquifers hsu1 and hsu2 which intensified the flow strengthened the hydrodynamic connection between the upper hsu4 and hsu5 and lower aquifers and facilitated the saltwater drainage from the clayey oligocene aquitard hsu3 fig s4 in supplementary material 4 in both the synthetic simulations and the case study the upper boundary condition for the flow was a simple cosinusoid or a linear hydraulic head however local variations in the topography and the water table can disturb the flow pattern and the salinity field as well a hierarchically nested groundwater system could induce a more complex distribution of the salt concentration and the temperature zhang et al 2020b an et al 2015 in general higher salinity and surface heat flux are expected in the regional discharge area rather than in local discharge recharge areas the lowest salinity and heat flux are probable in regional recharge zones nonetheless the formation of time dependent thermal buoyancy which strongly depends on the physical and geometrical model parameters szijártó et al 2019 is able to modulate or even overwrite the above mentioned simplified consideration resulting in a complex nested system where the flow the salinity and the heat vary in time and space 6 conclusions interaction of topography and salinity driven groundwater flow was systematically investigated in synthetic two dimensional basin scale numerical models and then in a realistic scenario based on the siliciclastic carbonate basin in hungary it was established in the synthetic analyses that the effect of increasing water density due to salinity and decreasing water table amplitude on the saltwater distribution is similar the first enhances the buoyancy driven free convection while the second reduces the topography driven forced convection thus the numerical solutions trend from a topography dominated regional freshwater system towards a diffusion dominated layered system the increase of permeability anisotropy shows similar progress towards the formation of a dense saline layer in the deeper part of the basin in the studied parameter domain both the decrease of permeability and the increase of dispersivity extinguish the relative role of advection by enhancing the diffusion or dispersion respectively the two phenomena strengthen the coupling between the fresh and saltwater zone based on the synthetic simulation set the coupled topography and salinity driven model was applied along a 2d hydrogeological section in hungary after 100kyr the original marine pore water is outplaced from both the upper siliciclastic aquifers by topography driven meteoric freshwater and the lower karstified carbonates by the brackish groundwater through flow however the marine origin pore water in the middle aquitard can survive over 1myr resulting in a significant head minimum the connection between the upper and lower pervious units are revealed by the presence of conductive faults while the connection between the clayey cover and confined carbonates is represented by dense saline finger like downwellings the current study improves the understanding of the interaction between the topography driven forced and the salinity driven free convection especially in basin scale groundwater flow systems on the one hand the sensitivity analysis of the synthetic models highlights the role of the most important model parameters influencing the coupled flow system on the other hand the phenomenon of mixed convection was investigated and proved along a simplified 2d hydrogeological section in hungary to demonstrate the mixing of fresh brackish and saline water nevertheless the combined topography and salinity driven groundwater flow plays an important role in the atacama salt flat aquifer chile tejeda et al 2003 vásquez et al 2013

accumulation in the beach of bon secour national wildlife refuge usa geng and boufadel 2015 etc therefore the results of the study can be used with the necessary adaptations in further terrestrial
