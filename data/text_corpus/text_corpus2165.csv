10825,saline soil and saline groundwater reduce agricultural productivity on drylands we are developing a new aquaponics system to improve food productivity on such lands while effectively utilizing saline groundwater in this study cultivation of swiss chard beta vulgaris l spp cicla cv seiyou shirokuki was carried out using fish wastewater with a high salt concentration 1150 mg l 1 nacl the levels of microelements e g fe mn zn and cu in the fish wastewater were very low so we added microelements at 100 w100 50 w50 25 w25 and 0 w0 of the levels in the standard hydroponics solution to the fish wastewater and investigated the effects on growth of swiss chard at the first harvest yields in all wastewater treatments were as high or higher than in the control at the second harvest yields in w100 w50 and w25 were not significantly different from the control while in w0 the yield was significantly lower and chlorosis was evident at the third harvest the yield in all wastewater treatments was less than in the control and chlorosis symptoms were observed in w25 and w0 since leaf mn and zn concentrations in w25 and w0 had decreased to below the critical values for those microelements mn and zn deficiency might have contributed to the observed chlorosis and yield loss for the cultivation of swiss chard with fish wastewater sufficient yield i e comparable to or better than the control without chlorosis was obtained when microelements were added at 50 of the level of the control solution in addition since sufficient yield was obtained even in w0 at the first harvest it is suggested that longer term cultivation and higher yield could be achieved by applying 50 microelements after the first harvest keywords salinity wastewater yield microelement productivity dryland 1 introduction according to the united nations the world s population is estimated to reach approximately nine billion in the year 2050 pitman and l√§uchli 2002 in order to secure the food consumption needs of this increased population food production urgently needs to be developed and expanded although the technology required for increasing food production has progressed remarkably the production volume per land area has almost plateaued in addition it is reported that the dryland area will increase by 23 by the year 2100 and will account for 56 of the total land area of the earth huang et al 2016 it is believed that 78 of this expansion of dryland will occur in developing countries which could exacerbate rising poverty levels and land degradation in dryland areas huang et al 2016 as a result there is a need for innovative and sustainable food production technologies in drylands that occupy a large land area agriculture in drylands can be problematic as those places often do not have adequate water resources in an effort to increase food production in those conditions farmers often unintentionally use excessive amounts of saline water to irrigate their land and or overly fertilize low fertility soils both of which causes salt accumulation in the soil and results in declining crop yields saysel and barlas 2001 on the other hand drylands are rich in solar radiation which promotes photosynthesis in plants and increases agricultural productivity thus it is possible that drylands can become highly productive for agriculture if water resources are secured and irrigation is carried out properly in the 1960s aquaponics a combined system of aquatic animal production and hydroponic plant growth was introduced as a new food production system to achieve effective water use enduta et al 2011 in aquaponics freshwater fish are cultured in an aquaculture system then the plant is hydroponically cultivated using fish wastewater from that system which contains various nutrients derived from fish feed and manure this removes nutrients from the fish wastewater while simultaneously purifying the water in general aquaponics uses low saline or non saline water so it is possible to cultivate high cash crops hydroponically including glycophytes salt sensitive such as lettuce and herbs those plants however cannot be grown in conditions where the salt concentration of groundwater is high such as drylands therefore we have been aiming to develop a new non circulate aquaculture hydroponics field cultivation type aquaponic system that uses saline groundwater and is thus suitable for dryland conditions in a standard aquaponic system when the salt concentration in the wastewater is increased by sodium na contained in fish feed and manure the yield of hydroponic crops is reduced and a large amount of water must be discarded hambrey consulting 2013 an advantage of aquaculture is that it does not consume water water will be lost only by evaporation in our aquaponics system na and other nutrients from fish wastewater are removed by hydroponically grown plants and that purified water can be used effectively for conventional field farming without wasting it there have been many reports of aquaponics focusing on aquaculture but few studies have focused on the nutrient dynamics of plants goddek et al 2015 the aquaponics technology we aim to develop is diverse such as aquaculture hydroponics and field cultivation in this study we aim to contribute to the development of aquaponics technology in drylands as well as broadening the knowledge on the nutrient dynamics of hydroponic culture especially in aquaponics using saline water the electrical conductivity of groundwater in los planes baja california sur mexico which is categorized as dryland is approximately 3 5 ds m 1 and its sodium na concentration is as high as 690 1150 mg l 1 unpublished results in areas with such high sodium levels it is difficult to cultivate agricultural plants most of which are categorized as glycophytes instead salt tolerant or salt loving plants are often cultivated salt loving plants are those whose growth is promoted by na in the medium yamada et al 2016a 2016b and include swiss chard beta vulgaris l spp cicla cv seiyou shirokuki table beet beta vulgaris l spp vulgaris cv detroit dark red and dwarf glasswort salicornia bigelovii torr these plant species not only utilize na for growth but also absorb and accumulate high concentrations of na in the plant body yamada et al 2016a therefore even high na groundwater could potentially produce high yield in an aquaponic system if salt loving plants are cultivated in this study we elucidated the cultivation conditions for growing swiss chard in our aquaponic system swiss chard is a plant of the amaranthaceae family and is widely produced and consumed throughout the world including in mexico it has been found that sodium can be used for the growth of swiss chard as an alternative to potassium kaburagi et al 2015 yamada et al 2016b therefore a medium that is lacking potassium but is rich in sodium which is provided by fish wastewater with high saline content may be also suitable for the cultivation of swiss chard when fish wastewater is used directly for hydroponics in an aquaponic system the mineral concentrations in the water must be sufficient for plant cultivation fish wastewater contains sufficient n for plant growth which is derived from fish feed and manure our previous studies have confirmed that 280 mg l 1 of no3 n does not inhibit the growth of swiss chard unpublished results on the other hand fish wastewater is often lacking essential microelements for plants graber and junge 2009 roosta and hamidpour 2011 analysis of mineral concentrations in the fish wastewater used in this study revealed the similar pattern the concentration of phosphorous p was 1 2 that of the standard hydroponics nutrient solution zinc zn was 1 5 manganese mn was 1 20 and iron fe was about 1 90 table 1 fe is involved in the formation of chlorophyll which is necessary for light absorption during photosynthesis jeong and guerinot 2009 mn is involved in processes such as photosynthesis protein synthesis and redox reactions to remove oxygen radicals ducic and polle 2005 shao et al 2017 however these microelements are not readily translocated from older leaves to other growing plant parts therefore if the medium is lacking microelements deficiency symptoms appear in photosynthetically active leaves and plant growth is inhibited hell and stephan 2003 in this study we added different concentrations of microelements to saline fish wastewater and investigated the effects on the growth of swiss chard we also evaluated the food safety no3 content of swiss chard leaves grown using fish wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquaculture tilapia oreochromis niloticus was stocked and reared in a 1500 l tank designed as

stickney 2017 goddek et al 2015 in this study groundwater was used for the fish farming and adjusted to 1150 mg l 1 of sodium chloride nacl to make the salt concentration similar to that of the groundwater in baja california mexico feeding was carried out twice a day water was collected every 7 days to analyze no3 n concentration the wastewater was used for hydroponic cultivation when the no3 n concentration reached approximately 250 mg l 1 this research was conducted in a greenhouse at tottori university from march to may 2016 2 2 plant cultivation seeds of swiss chard beta vulgaris l spp cicla cv seiyou shirokuki were sown in vermiculite when the first true leaves appeared seedlings were transplanted and grown hydroponically in 30 l plastic containers 6 plants per container plants were subjected to five different treatments based on either groundwater or fish wastewater table 2 the treatments were control groundwater with standard hydroponics nutrient solution kaburagi et al 2014 w100 fish wastewater with 100 of the control microelement level w50 fish wastewater with 50 of the control microelement level w25 fish wastewater with 25 of the control microelement level and w0 fish wastewater without micronutrient supplementation each treatment comprised four replicates the first harvest was carried out 27 days after transplanting we harvested leaves that were about 20 cm in length market transaction size and left the smaller younger leaves for the next harvest the second harvest was carried out 10 days after the first harvest and the third harvest was 11 days after the second harvest leaves from six plants in each bat were weighed to determine fresh weight fw and then oven dried at 70 c for 48 h the nitrogen concentration in the control solution was 56 mg l 1 which was 1 5 of the wastewater this was renewed weekly so that nitrogen deficiency would not become a growth inhibiting factor throughout the cultivation period the ph of the control solution was adjusted to 5 5 the wastewater treatment solutions were not renewed during the cultivation period and the ph was adjusted to 5 5 only at the transplanting 2 3 chlorophyll at the time of harvesting the chlorophyll content of the largest developed leaves of each individual plant was measured with a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 konica minolta tokyo japan 2 4 determination of inorganic ion

leaves and treatment solutions were determined at the time of each harvest by the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 using a spectrophotometer v 630bio jasco tokyo japan 2 6 statistical

results 3 1 plant growth and total yield leaf fw at the first harvest was significantly higher in all of the wastewater treatments than in the control fig 1 a even at the second harvest fws of w100 w50 and w25 were not significantly different from the control but fw of w0 was significantly lower than for the other treatments at the third harvest the leaf fws in all wastewater treatments was less than 50 of the control value on the other hand the total yield across all three harvests did not differ significantly between the control and wastewater treatments except for w0 which was significantly lower 70 of the control value fig 1b 3 2 chlorophyll in leaves spad value the spad values of the leaves in w100 and w50 were the same as or higher than the control value at all three harvest times fig 2 in w25 the spad value equaled or exceeded the control value until the third harvest when it was significantly lower than that of the control and the plants showed chlorosis symptoms in w0 the spad value was not significantly different from the control at the first harvest however it was significantly lower 70 of the control level at the second harvest and 60 of control at the third harvest both of which exhibited chlorosis 3 3 fe mn zn and cu concentrations in leaves the fe concentration in leaves was not significantly different between treatments at the first and second harvests at the third harvest fe concentration in leaves of w50 w25 and w0 were significantly lower than the control however the fe concentration was constant in all treatments throughout the three harvest times even in the w25 and w0 which exhibited chlorosis fig 3 at all harvest times the mn concentration in leaves from the w50 w25 and w0 decreased as the treatment micronutrient concentration decreased while the w100 maintained constant concentration in w0 the mn concentration in leaves decreased markedly to 1 mg kg 1 dw and the chlorosis symptoms were exhibited by the second harvest the same pattern was observed in w25 at the third harvest as with mn the zn concentration in leaves decreased as the treatment micronutrient concentration decreased the zn concentration in leaves of all wastewater treatments was significantly lower than the control at the third harvest the cu concentration in leaves did not differ markedly among harvests or treatments the cu concentration in leaves remained constant even in w0 where the decrease in growth was significant 3 4 no3 p k ca mg and na concentrations in leaves the no3 concentration in leaves fw basis was not significantly different between treatments at the first or second harvest times at the third harvest no3 was significantly lower in w0 than in w100 or w50 fig 4 the p concentration in leaves from all wastewater treatments was significantly lower than the control at all three harvest times fig 5 however the p concentration in leaves from all wastewater treatments at the second and third harvests significantly decreased to 1 2 and 1 3 of the control levels respectively leaf concentrations of k ca mg and na are not mentioned since the trends were unclear and not significant 4 discussion as a water source for aquaponics fish wastewater contains adequate amounts of no3 n derived from fish feed and manure the fish wastewater used in this study contained 250 mg l 1 of no3 n at the start of hydroponic cultivation which is approximately 6 times the concentration in the standard hydroponics solution table 2 nitrogen is an essential element for plant growth and no3 is readily absorbed as a counterion of cations such as k ca and mg no3 taken up into the plant is synthesized into amino acids and proteins tischner 2000 in this study at the first harvest all wastewater treatments showed growth exceeding that of the control fig 1a likely due to the high levels of no3 n at the third harvest the fw decreased significantly in all wastewater treatments compared to the control while the total yields of w100 w50 and w25 across the three harvest times were not significantly different from the control fig 1b together these results demonstrate that the optimum amount of microelement supplementation in fish wastewater is 50 of the control level which was sufficient to prevent chlorosis and to obtain the same yield as in the control furthermore because yields at the first harvest exceeded the control level even in w0 we speculate that long term cultivation with high yield and good plant color could be achieved by the addition of 50 microelements after the first harvest in general the requirement for fe is very high among all the microelements and it is essential to chlorophyll biosynthesis therefore when fe is deficient chlorosis symptoms occur in young leaves in this study the initial fe concentration in fish wastewater w0 was about 1 90 of that in the control table 2 interestingly however the fe concentration in swiss chard leaves was not significantly different between treatments at any harvest time and was sufficiently maintained even in leaves from w25 and w0 which showed chlorotic symptoms at later harvest times fig 3 this result suggested that swiss chard has either a high efficiency of fe absorption or a low requirement for fe similarly there were no significant differences in cu concentration in leaves between treatments at each harvest date since according to table 2 there were no substantial differences in cu concentration among the treatments on the other hand at each harvest time the mn and zn concentrations in leaves remarkably decreased as treatment micronutrient concentration decreased fig 3 the mn concentration in healthy plant leaves is dozens to hundreds of milligrams per kilogram dry matter and it is reported that deficiency occurs when the leaf mn concentration is 10 20 mg kg 1 or less mengel and kirkby 2001 most mn contained in the chloroplasts is associated with psii anderson et al 1964 ohki 1981 reported that net photosynthesis and chlorophyll content were significantly decreased when mn was deficient also a clear relationship between the intensity of mn deficiency symptoms and mn concentration was found in sugar beet which is in the same family amaranthaceae as swiss chard farley and draycott 1973 in this study in w0 at first harvest and w25 at second harvest the spad value and the leaf fw did not differ from the control when the leaf mn concentration was only about 40 mg kg 1 at the third harvest on the other hand chlorosis symptoms were observed and the leaf fw was greatly reduced in w0 and w25 when the leaf mn concentration was 10 mg kg 1 or less zn plays important roles in plant metabolism such as maintaining the conformation structure of various enzymes barker and pilbeam 2015 other authors suggest a relationship between zn and auxin a plant hormone promoting elongation which might explain the suppression of plant growth observed when zn is deficient salisbury and ross 1992 in general zn deficiency in plant leaves appears at 15 mg kg 1 or less which is considered as the critical value barker and pilbeam 2015 jones 2012 in this study the leaf zn concentration was less than 15 mg kg 1 in w25 and w0 at the third harvest when the decrease in fw was remarkable from these results we conclude that deficiency of mn and zn limited the growth of swiss chard in fish wastewater thus the addition of microelements especially mn and zn is necessary to maintain yield during long term cultivation however confirming the effects of specific microelements mn and zn would require additional experiments e g manipulating each microelement separately p plays an important role as a major constituent of phosphate compounds such as dna and biomembranes and is involved in energy generation enzyme activation and inactivation etc vance et al 2003 an adequate amount of p in plant leaves is generally about 2000 4000 mg kg 1 on a dry matter basis and p deficiency occurs at 1000 2000 mg kg 1 or less mengel and kirkby 2001 the p concentration in the fish wastewater used in this study was about 1 2 that of the control solution table 2 thus the p concentration in the leaves of all wastewater treatments reached the deficiency level at the third harvest fig 5 however with the exception of w0 the p concentration in the leaves of all wastewater treatments was above the deficiency level at the first two harvests and the leaf fw was comparable to the control figs 1a and 5 from these results we considered it is possible to cultivate swiss chard for at least two harvests using fish wastewater without adding p which indicates that fish wastewater can be a valuable source of p nutrition however the p concentration in all wastewater treatment solutions at the third harvest was below the detection limit table 1s and the p concentration in leaves was also at the deficiency level fig 5 in the case of longer term cultivation using fish wastewater addition of p may be necessary due to the depletion of phosphate ore in recent years p fertilizers are becoming increasingly expensive abelson 1999 vance et al 2003 in addition fertilizers generally account for between five to ten percent of the production costs in conventional hydroponic cultivation and the fossil fuels used for fertilizer production may have a negative environmental impact hochmuth and hanlon 2010 therefore reducing both the cost of fertilizer as well as the amount of fertilizer required for crop cultivation using wastewater in aquaponic systems is necessary for the future of sustainable food production the swiss chard leaves was not negatively impacted by the concentrations of k ca and mg in the fish wastewater at each of the harvest times data was not shown and mentioned in the results section as the trends were not significant these nutrients were not additionally applied this suggests that swiss chard is suitable for cultivation not only in saline water but also in less nutrient rich mediums such as fish wastewater the initial no3 n concentration in fish wastewater was about 6 times that of the control solution table 2 when nitrogen absorbed by the plant body becomes excessive the leaves become succulent and dark green in color which can increase disease and pest damage jones 2012 also if excess no3 is taken into the human body it is quickly metabolized to no2 which oxidizes the iron of hemoglobin in the blood and may hinder oxygen transport iarc 2010 in our study the spad values an indicator of leaf color in the wastewater treatments were no more than 15 higher than the control in all of the wastewater treatments except w0 fig 2 in addition the no3 concentration in leaves fw basis was lower than the upper limit 3500 mg kg 1 fw of the regulated value for the spinach which is in the same family amaranthaceae as swiss chard reported by the uk s food standard agency red tractor farm assurance 2016 fig 4 however the no3 concentration was markedly higher at the third harvest time than at either of the first two and some values are approaching the 3500 mg kg 1 fw limit this suggests that longer growth times might need to be monitored for further increases in leaf no3 5 conclusion we found that sufficient yield of swiss chard i e comparable to or better than the control could be obtained by adding 50 of the microelement level of the control solution when utilizing fish wastewater for aquaponics also since sufficient yield of swiss chard was obtained in all treatments at the first harvest even with no addition of microelements it appears that long term cultivation and high yield could be obtained by supplying 50 microelements after the first harvest although the depletion of phosphorus ore has become a problem in recent years the amount of p originally contained in fish wastewater was enough to obtain sufficient yield of swiss chard for at least two harvests however to enable long term cultivation the effectiveness of supplying p as well as microelements especially mn and zn should be examined in the future the no3 concentration in swiss chard leaves was below the regulated value for spinach in the uk even though the concentration of no3 n in fish wastewater was about 6 times that in the control solution declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported by japan science

than 50 of the control value on the other hand the total yield across all three harvests did not differ significantly between the control and wastewater treatments except for w0 which was significantly lower 70 of the control value fig 1b 3 2 chlorophyll in leaves spad value the spad values of the leaves in w100 and w50 were the same as or higher than the control value at all three harvest times fig 2 in w25 the spad value equaled or exceeded the control value until the third harvest when it was significantly lower than that of the control and the plants showed chlorosis symptoms in w0 the spad value was not significantly different from the control at the first harvest however it was significantly lower 70 of the control level at the second harvest and 60 of control at the third harvest both of which exhibited chlorosis 3 3 fe mn zn and cu concentrations in leaves the fe concentration in leaves was not significantly different between treatments at the first and second harvests at the third harvest fe concentration in leaves of w50 w25 and w0 were significantly lower than the control however the fe concentration was constant in all treatments throughout the three harvest times even in the w25 and w0 which exhibited chlorosis fig 3 at all harvest times the mn concentration in leaves from the w50 w25 and w0 decreased as the treatment micronutrient concentration decreased while the w100 maintained constant concentration in w0 the mn concentration in leaves decreased markedly to 1 mg kg 1 dw and the chlorosis symptoms were exhibited by the second harvest the same pattern was observed in w25 at the third harvest as with mn the zn concentration in leaves decreased as the treatment micronutrient concentration decreased the zn concentration in leaves of all wastewater treatments was significantly lower than the control at the third harvest the cu concentration in leaves did not differ markedly among harvests or treatments the cu concentration in leaves remained constant even in w0 where the decrease in growth was significant 3 4 no3 p k ca mg and na concentrations in leaves the no3 concentration in leaves fw basis was not significantly different between treatments at the first or second harvest times at the third harvest no3 was significantly lower in w0 than in w100 or w50 fig 4 the p concentration in leaves from all wastewater treatments was significantly lower than the control at all three harvest times fig 5 however the p concentration in leaves from all wastewater treatments at the second and third harvests significantly decreased to 1 2 and 1 3 of the control levels respectively leaf concentrations of k ca mg and na are not mentioned since the trends were unclear and not significant 4 discussion as a water source for aquaponics fish wastewater contains adequate amounts of no3 n derived from fish feed and manure the fish wastewater used in this study contained 250 mg l 1 of no3 n at the start of hydroponic cultivation which is approximately 6 times the concentration in the standard hydroponics solution table 2 nitrogen is an essential element for plant growth and no3 is readily absorbed as a counterion of cations such as k ca and mg no3 taken up into the plant is synthesized into amino acids and proteins tischner 2000 in this study at the first harvest all wastewater treatments showed growth exceeding that of the control fig 1a likely due to the high levels of no3 n at the third harvest the fw decreased significantly in all wastewater treatments compared to the control while the total yields of w100 w50 and w25 across the three harvest times were not significantly different from the control fig 1b together these results demonstrate that the optimum amount of microelement supplementation in fish wastewater is 50 of the control level which was sufficient to prevent chlorosis and to obtain the same yield as in the control furthermore because yields at the first harvest exceeded the control level even in w0 we speculate that long term cultivation with high yield and good plant color could be achieved by the addition of 50 microelements after the first harvest in general the requirement for fe is very high among all the microelements and it is essential to chlorophyll biosynthesis therefore when fe is deficient chlorosis symptoms occur in young leaves in this study the initial fe concentration in fish wastewater w0 was about 1 90 of that in the control table 2 interestingly however the fe concentration in swiss chard leaves was not significantly different between treatments at any harvest time and was sufficiently maintained even in leaves from w25 and w0 which showed chlorotic symptoms at later harvest times fig 3 this result suggested that swiss chard has either a high efficiency of fe absorption or a low requirement for fe similarly there were no significant differences in cu concentration in leaves between treatments at each harvest date since according to table 2 there were no substantial differences in cu concentration among the treatments on the other hand at each harvest time the mn and zn concentrations in leaves remarkably decreased as treatment micronutrient concentration decreased fig 3 the mn concentration in healthy plant leaves is dozens to hundreds of milligrams per kilogram dry matter and it is reported that deficiency occurs when the leaf mn concentration is 10 20 mg kg 1 or less mengel and kirkby 2001 most mn contained in the chloroplasts is associated with psii anderson et al 1964 ohki 1981 reported that net photosynthesis and chlorophyll content were significantly decreased when mn was deficient also a clear relationship between the intensity of mn deficiency symptoms and mn concentration was found in sugar beet which is in the same family amaranthaceae as swiss chard farley and draycott 1973 in this study in w0 at first harvest and w25 at second harvest the spad value and the leaf fw did not differ from the control when the leaf mn concentration was only about 40 mg kg 1 at the third harvest on the other hand chlorosis symptoms were observed and the leaf fw was greatly reduced in w0 and w25 when the leaf mn concentration was 10 mg kg 1 or less zn plays important roles in plant metabolism such as maintaining the conformation structure of various enzymes barker and pilbeam 2015 other authors suggest a relationship between zn and auxin a plant hormone promoting elongation which might explain the suppression of plant growth observed when zn is deficient salisbury and ross 1992 in general zn deficiency in plant leaves appears at 15 mg kg 1 or less which is considered as the critical value barker and pilbeam 2015 jones 2012 in this study the leaf zn concentration was less than 15 mg kg 1 in w25 and w0 at the third harvest when the decrease in fw was remarkable from these results we conclude that deficiency of mn and zn limited the growth of swiss chard in fish wastewater thus the addition of microelements especially mn and zn is necessary to maintain yield during long term cultivation however confirming the effects of specific microelements mn and zn would require additional experiments e g manipulating each microelement separately p plays an important role as a major constituent of phosphate compounds such as dna and biomembranes and is involved in energy generation enzyme activation and inactivation etc vance et al 2003 an adequate amount of p in plant leaves is generally about 2000 4000 mg kg 1 on a dry matter basis and p deficiency occurs at 1000 2000 mg kg 1 or less mengel and kirkby 2001 the p concentration in the fish wastewater used in this study was about 1 2 that of the control solution table 2 thus the p concentration in the leaves of all wastewater treatments reached the deficiency level at the third harvest fig 5 however with the exception of w0 the p concentration in the leaves of all wastewater treatments was above the deficiency level at the first two harvests and the leaf fw was comparable to the control figs 1a and 5 from these results we considered it is possible to cultivate swiss chard for at least two harvests using fish wastewater without adding p which indicates that fish wastewater can be a valuable source of p nutrition however the p concentration in all wastewater treatment solutions at the third harvest was below the detection limit table 1s and the p concentration in leaves was also at the deficiency level fig 5 in the case of longer term cultivation using fish wastewater addition of p may be necessary due to the depletion of phosphate ore in recent years p fertilizers are becoming increasingly expensive abelson 1999 vance et al 2003 in addition fertilizers generally account for between five to ten percent of the production costs in conventional hydroponic cultivation and the fossil fuels used for fertilizer production may have a negative environmental impact hochmuth and hanlon 2010 therefore reducing both the cost of fertilizer as well as the amount of fertilizer required for crop cultivation using wastewater in aquaponic systems is necessary for the future of sustainable food production the swiss chard leaves was not negatively impacted by the concentrations of k ca and mg in the fish wastewater at each of the harvest times data was not shown and mentioned in the results section as the trends were not significant these nutrients were not additionally applied this suggests that swiss chard is suitable for cultivation not only in saline water but also in less nutrient rich mediums such as fish wastewater the initial no3 n concentration in fish wastewater was about 6 times that of the control solution table 2 when nitrogen absorbed by the plant body becomes excessive the leaves become succulent and dark green in color which can increase disease and pest damage jones 2012 also if excess no3 is taken into the human body it is quickly metabolized to no2 which oxidizes the iron of hemoglobin in the blood and may hinder oxygen transport iarc 2010 in our study the spad values an indicator of leaf color in the wastewater treatments were no more than 15 higher than the control in all of the wastewater treatments except w0 fig 2 in addition the no3 concentration in leaves fw basis was lower than the upper limit 3500 mg kg 1 fw of the regulated value for the spinach which is in the same family amaranthaceae as swiss chard reported by the uk s food standard agency red tractor farm assurance 2016 fig 4 however the no3 concentration was markedly higher at the third harvest time than at either of the first two and some values are approaching the 3500 mg kg 1 fw limit this suggests that longer growth times might need to be monitored for further increases in leaf no3 5 conclusion we found that sufficient yield of swiss chard i e comparable to or better than the control could be obtained by adding 50 of the microelement level of the control solution when utilizing fish wastewater for aquaponics also since sufficient yield of swiss chard was obtained in all treatments at the first harvest even with no addition of microelements it appears that long term cultivation and high yield could be obtained by supplying 50 microelements after the first harvest although the depletion of phosphorus ore has become a problem in recent years the amount of p originally contained in fish wastewater was enough to obtain sufficient yield of swiss chard for at least two harvests however to enable long term cultivation the effectiveness of supplying p as well as microelements especially mn and zn should be examined in the future the no3 concentration in swiss chard leaves was below the regulated value for spinach in the uk even though the concentration of no3 n in fish wastewater was about 6 times that in the control solution declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported by japan science

10826,we report an experimental study of evaporation from a non homogeneous dual porous system consisting of a finer pore size material at the centre surrounded by coarser particles in a glass beaker this configuration can be considered to mimic to a first order the coupling between the plant roots and soil water similar to how roots extract water from the soils here also water moves driven by the capillary pressure gradient from larger to the smaller voids we explore two different configurations a when the small pore sizes span the entire porous column along the gravitational direction and b when they are limited to a thin annular region at the porous medium top surface we measured the mass loss from the system surface temperature using a thermal camera and the ambient conditions we compared the results with two standard systems a a homogeneous porous medium and b a texturally layered configuration of finer particles at the top and coarser at the bottom compared to the homogeneous case the duration of stage 1 high evaporation rate regime of evaporation and thus the characteristic evaporative length increased significantly in the case of root mimics this outcome shows the ability of the root mimics in sustaining the surface water content induced by the strong capillary pressure gradient in such a dual porosity system finally we track the evaporation sites using the fluorescein dye particles method and assess its effect if any on the overall evaporation characteristics keywords evaporation porous media dual porosity root soil coupling 1 introduction the relation between plant roots and soil is important not only from the perspective of agriculture but also as a fundamental understanding of the coupling between the two on the hindsight this coupling is crucial as it governs evapotranspiration which essentially is an inevitable part of the global water cycle in field the movement of water is very complex imagine a portion of soil which is fully saturated all the pores inside are filled with water there are three ways in which water can move out of this region one gravitational forces may drain some water depending on the soil type veihmeyer and hendrickson 1931 israelsen and west 1922 it is believed that within two to three days a soil achieves field capacity richards and weaver 1944 which is defined as the percentage of water present in the usable soil after gravitational drainage two evaporation leads to continuous loss of moisture from the soils such an evaporation phenomenon depends on many factors like particle sizes lehmann et al 2008 yiotis et al 2012 assouline et al 2014 kumar and arakeri 2018a particle or pore size distribution lehmann et al 2008 assouline et al 2014 particle layering assouline et al 2014 huang et al 2013 kumar and arakeri 2018b shokri et al 2010 incident heat load ambient conditions ben neriah et al 2014 and porosity kumar and arakeri 2018a essentially soil evaporation is determined by preferential air invasion and subsequent water transport at all times or et al 2013 three roots or root hairs tiny in size suck out water from the soils thus reducing moisture content in the soils all the three processes together govern the overall dynamics of moisture loss from soils apart from these three ways of water transport other indirect factors like rainfall and erosion are also important note that apart from acting as a source of water soils also act as a support system for the plants the coupling between roots and soil moisture is crucial in understanding the movement of water to and from soils we mimic this coupling using a dual porosity system a lower particle size material at the centre surrounded by larger particles the lower particles mimic the roots while the larger represent soils in this study gravitational drainage has been avoided but its inclusion is straightforward the other important feature of the present study is that the finer particle size material is kept flush with the surrounded porous medium viz both the surfaces are at nearly the same horizontal level this study is therefore a first order understanding of plant root and soil water coupling the real root soil coupling is highly complicated which are extremely difficult to mimic in the laboratory experiments take the complex structural patterns and geometry of the root hairs spreading out of the main root as an example in actual situations roots supply water to various parts of a plant or a tree such as leaves where mass loss transpiration happens through small openings called stomata in the present investigation we do not intend to mimic the entire plant system though stomatal transpiration in its own right is interesting kumar and arakeri 2019a kato et al 2004 2 materials and methods the experiments reported in this study were carried out in a glass beaker 90 mm high and 63 mm inner diameter we mimic the plant roots with two different materials i a long chalk 80 mm long with an average diameter of 1 cm piece and ii a thin porous medium 0 20 0 30 mm diameter glass beads the surrounding soil is a porous medium consisting of 0 70 0 80 mm diameter glass beads the root mimics were placed at the centre of the surrounding porous medium as seen schematically in fig 1 a and b an infrared heater distanced 19 cm away from the porous medium top surface was used to boost the rates of evaporation the mass lost from the system was continuously monitored using a precision weighing scale sartorius gpa5202 connected to a computer the ambient conditions temperature using a t type thermocouple and relative humidity using hih 3000 honeywell sensor were regularly 15 s interval monitored a thermal camera fluke ti400 320 240 pixels placed above the medium measured its top surface temperature the schematic of the experimental set up is seen in fig 1e the container was insulated at the impervious sides to reduce heat leak from the system the incident heat load on the porous media top surface was 1000 w m2 in all the cases this value is obtained after extrapolation of data in a previous study kumar and arakeri 2015 we now give a description of the experiments whose details are seen in table 1 as mentioned earlier we used two different configurations to mimic the root soil water coupling height of the porous column h was 80 mm in both the cases in the first case we used a chalk exp 1 whose pore sizes are several orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding 0 70 0 80 mm diameter glass beads here the chalk was placed at the centre and the larger beads were slowly packed with water in steps kumar 2017 the chalk was in contact with the larger beads throughout its height fig 1a in the second case the height of the finer particles exp 2 used was negligible compared to the porous column height fig 1b the porous media considered here is a 3 d system due to a large number of layers in any direction this also ensures limited boundary effects in both the cases the finer particles are expected to behave as roots since they would suck water from the larger particles we compare the results of the present study with a reference system exp 3 consisting only of the larger 0 70 0 80 mm diameter glass beads particles note that a few studies shahraeeni and or 2010 aminzadeh and or 2014 exist where mass loss from a system as the one in exp 1 was investigated a similar system could be finer particles separated by coarser either vertically or horizontally like in exp 4 see table 1 these systems kumar and arakeri 2018b lehmann and or 2009 too offer preferential movement of water but they cannot be considered as simulating root soil water coupling due to their large surface extents we believe that exp 2 is a relatively new concept which may be closest to simulating the grass type root soil water coupling given the negligible depth of the finer particles compared to the porous column height note that exp 2 is different than exp 4 in two main aspects a surface extent of the finer particle sizes is lesser in exp 2 and b the depth of finer particles in exp 2 is much lower compared to that in exp 4 2 1 geometrical and particle scale features of the chalk chalks come in various sizes and shapes cylindrical being the most common the chalk used in the present study is seen schematically in fig 2 a it is nearly cylindrical with small 0 6 from the axis amount of tapering along the length the chalk diameter at one end was 8 42 0 08 mm at the other end was 10 06 0 06 mm and its length was 79 80 0 12 mm the standard deviation was obtained after the measurements were taken for six chalk samples the dry density of the chalk was 1 14 0 02 g cc the overall porosity of the chalk sample was obtained in a separate experiment the chalk piece was dipped slowly in di water kept in a container along its length the water level 6 mm in the container was kept such that the chalk piece did not submerge completely this was done to avoid any air entrapment during this imbibition process after 2 min the completely wet chalk was carefully removed such that any extra water drained off during this duration the chalk did not lose any significant mass due to dissolution of its particles in water the difference in the mass readings of the wet and dry chalk gave us its porosity ratio of the volumes of water and the chalk which we calculated to be 52 53 0 42 the particle size has a broad range majumdar and william 2009 zhang et al 2015 in a piece of chalk and can vary between 0 20 Œº m to 10 Œº m zhang et al 2015 due to the large variation in the particle sizes the pore size would also have a broad range the sem image fig 2b shows very small particles as well as large plate like particles the scale at the bottom of this image indicates 10 Œº m the image was taken at the central cross sectional surface of the chalk and was captured at 5000x magnification we see here that some particles are 10 Œº m in size at 20000x magnification we were able to identify particle sizes as small as 300 n m the resolution of this sem image was low and hence is not shown here these observations related to the range of particle sizes in a chalk are in line with previous studies zhang et al 2015 3 results first we mention the initial conditions of the four experiments after preparing the saturated mixture some extra 9 g water was added in all the cases this method gives evaporation rate in case of bare water kumar and arakeri 2018a b c d kumar and arakeri 2019a as mentioned previously we measured the mass loss using a weighing scale which we converted kumar 2017 to get the instantaneous rate of evaporation e since we began with some extra water on the top the porous media achieve saturation s 1 upon evaporation after some time the evaporation rate at this instant is e m a x in the case of exp 1 exp 2 exp 3 and exp 4 the value of e m a x was 21 0 20 8 19 4 and 19 8 mm day respectively slight variation in e m a x values are due to different ambient conditions air temperature and relative humidity in the ambient air in these experiments note that when 0 s t 1 we get e e m a x we use this to understand see fig 3 variations of the dimensionless evaporation rate e e m a x with the depth of the average water level at any instant z calculated as the product of 1 s and h i e z h 1 s t the value of z z 0 at which stage 1 ends has been defined kumar and arakeri 2018a b kumar 2017 as an evaporative capillary characteristic length l c a p i e l c a p z 0 h 1 s 0 where s 0 is the value of saturation at the end of stage 1 of evaporation note that saturation values are calculated as the ratio of the values of the remaining mass of water instantaneously and at s 1 fig 3 also shows the well known three stages of evaporation in all the cases the arrows point to the end of stage 1 which was marked using sudden change in 1 e 2 t curves whose variation is shown for exp 1 and exp 2 in the inset following major conclusions drawn from fig 3 are a stage 1 is not a constant rate period crp unlike the isothermal cases lehmann et al 2008 yiotis et al 2012 assouline et al 2014 shokri et al 2010 ben neriah et al 2014 or et al 2013 lehmann and or 2009 similar deviating trends were found previously kumar 2018a kumar and arakeri 2019a kumar 2017 kumar and arakeri 2018c the gradually decreasing rates of evaporation in stage 1 in non isothermal cases were shown kumar 2018a to be due to the shrinking wet patches of water on the porous medium surface b in stage 1 the values of e e m a x in exp 2 are slightly higher compared to the base case exp 3 at any given z however surprisingly evaporation behaviour in stage 1 of exp 1 is very similar to the base case c transitions are delayed in exp 1 and exp 2 compared to the base case d sudden transition in exp 2 unlike being gradual in exp 1 and the base case e results of exp 4 are similar to that of exp 2 which was expected since both the systems are quite similar however there are two significant differences i slightly higher e e m a x values and ii delayed transition in exp 4 compared to exp 2 these differences are due to the variation in the surface extent of the finer sizes used in these cases finer particles cover the entire surface in exp 4 which led to an extended duration of stage 1 f consider the data in exp 1 and exp 3 in stage 2 of evaporation let us say between z 45 and z 54 mm in this range e e m a x values reduced from 0 47 to 0 27 and 0 21 to 0 13 respectively in particular at z 50 mm e e m a x values are 0 32 and 0 17 respectively the lower value of e e m a x in the homogeneous case is due to the fact that the vaporization plane liquid vapour interface is far from the top exposed surface surface water content is zero the dry layers above this interface offers high resistance to the vapours on the contrary in exp 1 even at z 50 mm the root mimic chalk was able to pull water to the top thereby maintaining some surface water content although the surrounding medium was completely dry note that in a homogeneous porous medium in stage 2 of evaporation the vaporization plane keeps receding away from the exposed surface with time and the process of evaporation can be modelled as diffusion brutsaert and chen 1995 or diffusion like phenomenon kumar 2017 we now discuss the evaporation process through flow visualization for this purpose we adopted the fluorescein dye particles method which have been previously kumar and arakeri 2018a b kumar 2017 kumar and arakeri 2018c weiss et al 2018 used too these particles are originally red when they are dry but turn water green in a solution with evaporation water is lost continuously but the fluorescein dye particles remain on a solid surface movement of the water air interface due to drying or evaporation would leave out the dye particles which stick to the solid surfaces this is a continuous phenomenon since the particles are orange the region of solid particles which are orange in color signifies the evaporation sites the region of solid surfaces which are green means dye particles are still present in the solution form this unique colour contrast is advantageous than the commonly used brilliant blue lehmann et al 2008 shokri et al 2010 shokri and or 2013 or coffee keita et al 2013 both the experiments exp 1 and exp 2 were commenced with some extra water on top see fig 4 e after some time we get the condition where s 1 and preferential air invasion and subsequent capillary film formation occurs the smaller voids whether within the surrounding porous media or the root mimic start pulling water from the surrounding media fig 4a exp 2 shows the condition when the root mimic is completely wet green while the surrounding medium is completely dry orange at this instant e e m a x 0 9 s 0 64 and z 29 mm 0 36 80 mm and the system is evaporating in stage 1 in fig 4b exp 1 everything including the chalk piece at the centre appears to be completely dry at this instant z 39 mm e e m a x 0 67 and the system is at the verge of ending see fig 3 stage 1 of evaporation the colour contrast of fluorescein dye particles is useful in marking dry and wet regions other examples of this benefit are seen in fig 4c and d the near bottom portions in both of these images appear green signifying fully wet region while the near top region is nearly fully dry note that the middle regions are white which shows the true colour of the glass beads these regions are generally drained by the capillary films fig 4f shows a very interesting situation this image was captured at the end of the experiment but the chalk is still fully wet green at the right hand side of this image we observe that some dry glass beads are sticking with the chalk this region of the chalk was exposed to the atmosphere in exp 1 here we see continuous deposition of the dye particles on the beads which should also have occurred on the near top regions of the chalk note that the voids in the chalk were quite small and the deposited dye particles after a continuous and prolonged duration of their crystallization can easily block them the duration of l c a p hence can be affected by the presence of the dye particles surface water content and the movement of the liquid vapour menisci can also be seen using thermal images kumar and arakeri 2018a b kumar and arakeri 2019a here for simplicity we show the images for the two root mimic experiments when the stage 1 of evaporation is about to end fig 5 a and b shows the respective thermal images for exp 1 and exp 2 cases in both the cases the root mimics are much colder 80c than the surrounding porous medium the temperature colour scale and the respective details of the experiments are seen in the legends the lower temperatures of the root mimics clearly indicate that they are evaporating at high rates while the high temperatures of the surrounding media indicate their dryness some of the heat from the hotter dry region gets conducted laterally kumar and arakeri 2019a aminzadeh and or 2014 also beneath the top surface and within the media and reaches the lower temperature regions and thus helps in sustaining high evaporation rates another common feature in these images is the similar way in which temperature decreases from the hottest container walls to the centre of the root mimic finally we discuss the question till what extent or not at all the fluorescein dye particles would have affected the evaporation characteristics the concept of using the tracer particles lie in their use only in sparse amount it is known keita et al 2013 nachshon et al 2011a b that a large amount of tracer particles like brilliant blue fluorescein dye or salt lead to pore blockage during evaporation from a porous media crystallization of the solid particles in such systems is an active area of research the blockage of pores at least near the exposed surface affect the surface water content significantly and hence the duration of stage 1 is short i e transition arrives earlier for this purpose a separate experiment was conducted this experiment was similar to that of exp 1 but here fluorescein dye particles were not used the experiment was repeated twice for consistency in the measurements fig 6 shows the variations of e e m a x vs z for the two cases following major conclusions can be drawn a surprisingly no significant change in the point of transition or the end of stage 1 of evaporation was observed b in the stage 1 of evaporation e e m a x values are slightly higher when fluorescein dye particles were not used in the stage 2 of evaporation e e m a x values are marginally higher when fluorescein dye particles were not used we can now say that the point of transition in the configuration used in the case of exp 1 is a unique feature of such a system and the dye particles if used only as tracers had no effect slight variations and not significant in the rates of evaporation in these experiments could be due to the partial blockage of pores in the experiment where the dye was used in fact finding the critical amount of dye which would affect the point of transition can be studied in future however this is not the theme of the present investigation 4 discussion the most important conclusion is the enhancement in l c a p values see fig 3 compared to the base case note that l c a p for 0 70 0 80 mm diameter glass beads exp 3 is 30 mm roughly the length l c a p represents the average depth of the water level till which a porous medium sustains stage 1 with chalk at the centre exp 1 l c a p increases by 10 mm and with a thin layer of finer glass beads exp 2 it increases by 15 mm these increased values are significant with finer particles completely covering the coarser ones l c a p increased further to 60 mm the real enhancement in l c a p values for exp 4 is 20 mm since we must remove the thickness 10 mm see table 1 of the finer particles we see that exp 1 and exp 2 may mimic the root soil water coupling next we discuss the reason for the enhancement in l c a p values observed experimentally fig 7 shows simple cartoons for different cases showing liquid motion within the porous media and the liquid vapour menisci at two different instants when the region near the top is relatively i wet and ii dry these cartoons are only a guide and may not represent the exact scenario note that the initial condition in all the cases is the same viz the system is fully saturated s 1 consider a homogeneous system consisting only of larger particles as seen in figure 7a just after the full saturation let s say s 0 95 a dominant capillary film forms due to preferential pore air from the atmosphere invasion lehmann et al 2008 the fluid flow is governed by the total including capillary pressure gradient and initially the relatively larger pores are invaded by air these capillary films connect the water below in the porous media to the pinned liquid on the surface with time these films shrink while the bulk liquid level keeps moving away from the top surface at the critical point the end of stage 1 the top surface loses its water content and the bulk liquid level is at l c a p distance away from the top surface films may still form within the medium but they do not reach the exposed boundary as seen in figure 7e in the presence of the finer particles whether exp 1 or exp 2 additional capillary films shokri et al 2010 lehmann and or 2009 form since the coarser particles now supply some water to the finer particle locations here we have two different types of capillary films i forming within the coarser particles ii connecting bulk liquid to the root mimics at near full saturation this scenario is seen in figure 7b and c consider the instant when evaporation from the homogeneous particles is about to enter the transition regime figure 7e at this instant films in the coarser particles do not reach the top exposed surface but the root mimics are still able to suck water figure 7f and g from the surrounding coarser particles this additional suction extended the duration of stage 1 and l c a p values in exp 1 since the chalk piece spanned the entire porous column enhancement in l c a p value was supposed to be larger than in exp 2 in fact we observed the exact opposite which we believe is due to the deposited orange fluorescein particles blocking the pores in the chalk near the surface this is discussed soon even in the case of real roots the liquid transport figure 7d and h and the movement of the liquid vapour menisci are expected to remain similar to the ones observed here theoretically the accurate prediction of enhancement in l c a p values are not straightforward as the liquid path is quite complicated during the entire evaporation process one must consider possible pathways for liquid flow from largest to larger and eventually to the smaller and the smallest pores at a given instant for example voids formed by 0 80 mm diameter glass beads are the largest these voids will supply water to the voids formed by all the three particle sizes 0 70 0 30 and 0 20 mm diameter at the same time voids between 0 70 mm diameter particles will supply water to the two smaller 0 30 and 0 20 mm diameter voids finally we must also consider water movement from voids of 0 30 mm diameter particles to voids of the smallest 0 20 mm diameter particles following lehmann et al 2008 we calculated values of l c a p for the two homogeneous systems consisting of 0 70 0 80 and 0 20 0 30 mm diameter glass beads to be 13 and 102 mm respectively when these balls are mixed in a vertical contrast the theoretical lehmann and or 2009 value of l c is 319 mm using theory for the horizontal contrast assouline et al 2014 shokri et al 2010 we calculated l c to be 16 mm for the exp 4 l c a p is 60 mm see fig 3 which lies between the theoretical values of vertical 319 mm and horizontal contrasts 16 mm with the limited surface extent and thinner depth l c a p in exp 2 46 mm lies between the theoretical value in case of horizontal contrast 16 mm and l c a p in exp 4 60 mm this trend seems to be true intuitively also we see that the simple models were not able to predict the enhancement in l c a p values correctly and the offset is quite large too the theoretical model in a porous medium with contrast needs to be revisited for the correct adjustments note that in addition to this complexity the effect of incident heat load on mass transfer aspects of a homogeneous porous medium has recently kumar and arakeri 2019b been studied more recently dual porosity and dual permeability systems have been modelled using proper orthogonal decomposition approach wang et al 2017 2018a wang et al 2018b this relatively new method to handle the compressible gas flow in a porous network has been shown to be computationally much faster and highly accurate 5 conclusions experimental investigations of evaporation from unique double porosity systems were conducted and the observations were compared with a homogeneous and a horizontally layered system the goal was to understand the plant root soil water coupling in the absence of gravitational drainage the roots were mimicked using two materials a porous chalk with very low particle sizes spanning the entire porous column and b a thin near surface layer of finer 0 20 0 30 mm diameter glass beads coarser surrounding glass beads with 0 70 0 80 mm diameter were used to mimic soils the systems were heated from above using infrared radiation to increase the rates of evaporation which occurred only from the open top surfaces as rest of the surfaces were impervious three diagnostics were used simultaneously measurement of mass measurement of the evaporating surface temperature captured by an ir camera and colour based detection of wet dry regions or surfaces using the fluorescein dye particles method relative to the homogeneous case we found a substantial increase in the l c a p values the increment was argued to be due to additional suction applied by the root mimics on the larger particles when they are hydraulically connected we expected the chalk piece at the centre to have greater l c a p compared to the other root mimic but it in fact is lesser this experiment was also conducted and repeated twice for consistency where the dye particles were not used the deposited fluorescein dye particles partially blocked the pores in chalk but had nearly no effect on the overall evaporation characteristics the dye particles used in small amount acted as tracers and helped in tracking the evaporating and draining zones based on a unique colour contrast finally the surface water content was indirectly indicated by the thermal images the surface temperature and the evaporation rate of any region in a thermal image follow an inverse relation to satisfy the surface energy balance as far as evaporation rates in the stage 2 are concerned the homogeneous system had the least value for the same system but with root mimics especially the deep roots like the chalk in exp1 the rates of evaporation are higher this happened because the root mimics helped in sustaining the hydraulic connections and hence some surface water content was maintained although water level in the surrounding medium was very far from the exposed surface this shows the ability of root mimics in redistributing the moisture within a porous system not only in stage 1 resulting in high l c a p of evaporation but also in stage 2 resulting in slightly higher rates of evaporation compared to a homogeneous porous medium the present investigation can be further extended to the case where the surrounding medium will not be allowed to evaporate it would be interesting to compare the l c a p values in these cases they are expected to be higher than the values obtained here additionally an artificial plant with leaf type surfaces can be added to the present system to complete the plant root soil water coupling in reality this coupling is highly complicated not only due to the extent and networking of roots but also due to gravitation drainage however such a simplistic approach in the present study did mimic up to some extent the root soil coupling in determining the overall water distribution a possible extension of this study could be to include a real plant root in a homogeneous or heterogeneous porous medium and observe the interactions as well as the plant root water uptake declaration of

10826,we report an experimental study of evaporation from a non homogeneous dual porous system consisting of a finer pore size material at the centre surrounded by coarser particles in a glass beaker this configuration can be considered to mimic to a first order the coupling between the plant roots and soil water similar to how roots extract water from the soils here also water moves driven by the capillary pressure gradient from larger to the smaller voids we explore two different configurations a when the small pore sizes span the entire porous column along the gravitational direction and b when they are limited to a thin annular region at the porous medium top surface we measured the mass loss from the system surface temperature using a thermal camera and the ambient conditions we compared the results with two standard systems a a homogeneous porous medium and b a texturally layered configuration of finer particles at the top and coarser at the bottom compared to the homogeneous case the duration of stage 1 high evaporation rate regime of evaporation and thus the characteristic evaporative length increased significantly in the case of root mimics this outcome shows the ability of the root mimics in sustaining the surface water content induced by the strong capillary pressure gradient in such a dual porosity system finally we track the evaporation sites using the fluorescein dye particles method and assess its effect if any on the overall evaporation characteristics keywords evaporation porous media dual porosity root soil coupling 1 introduction the relation between plant roots and soil is important not only from the perspective of agriculture but also as a fundamental understanding of the coupling between the two on the hindsight this coupling is crucial as it governs evapotranspiration which essentially is an inevitable part of the global water cycle in field the movement of water is very complex imagine a portion of soil which is fully saturated all the pores inside are filled with water there are three ways in which water can move out of this region one gravitational forces may drain some water depending on the soil type veihmeyer and hendrickson 1931 israelsen and west 1922 it is believed that within two to three days a soil achieves field capacity richards and weaver 1944 which is defined as the percentage of water present in the usable soil after gravitational drainage two evaporation leads to continuous loss of moisture from the soils such an evaporation phenomenon depends on many factors like particle sizes lehmann et al 2008 yiotis et al 2012 assouline et al 2014 kumar and arakeri 2018a particle or pore size distribution lehmann et al 2008 assouline et al 2014 particle layering assouline et al 2014 huang et al 2013 kumar and arakeri 2018b shokri et al 2010 incident heat load ambient conditions ben neriah et al 2014 and porosity kumar and arakeri 2018a essentially soil evaporation is determined by preferential air invasion and subsequent water transport at all times or et al 2013 three roots or root hairs tiny in size suck out water from the soils thus reducing moisture content in the soils all the three processes together govern the overall dynamics of moisture loss from soils apart from these three ways of water transport other indirect factors like rainfall and erosion are also important note that apart from acting as a source of water soils also act as a support system for the plants the coupling between roots and soil moisture is crucial in understanding the movement of water to and from soils we mimic this coupling using a dual porosity system a lower particle size material at the centre surrounded by larger particles the lower particles mimic the roots while the larger represent soils in this study gravitational drainage has been avoided but its inclusion is straightforward the other important feature of the present study is that the finer particle size material is kept flush with the surrounded porous medium viz both the surfaces are at nearly the same horizontal level this study is therefore a first order understanding of plant root and soil water coupling the real root soil coupling is highly complicated which are extremely difficult to mimic in the laboratory experiments take the complex structural patterns and geometry of the root hairs spreading out of the main root as an example in actual situations roots supply water to various parts of a plant or a tree such as leaves where mass loss transpiration happens through small openings called stomata in the present investigation we do not intend to mimic the entire plant system though stomatal transpiration in its own right is interesting kumar and arakeri 2019a kato et al 2004 2 materials and methods the experiments reported in this study were carried out in a glass beaker 90 mm high and 63 mm inner diameter we mimic the plant roots with two different materials i a long chalk 80 mm long with an average diameter of 1 cm piece and ii a thin porous medium 0 20 0 30 mm diameter glass beads the surrounding soil is a porous medium consisting of 0 70 0 80 mm diameter glass beads the root mimics were placed at the centre of the surrounding porous medium as seen schematically in fig 1 a and b an infrared heater distanced 19 cm away from the porous medium top surface was used to boost the rates of evaporation the mass lost from the system was continuously monitored using a precision weighing scale sartorius gpa5202 connected to a computer the ambient conditions temperature using a t type thermocouple and relative humidity using hih 3000 honeywell sensor were regularly 15 s interval monitored a thermal camera fluke ti400 320 240 pixels placed above the medium measured its top surface temperature the schematic of the experimental set up is seen in fig 1e the container was insulated at the impervious sides to reduce heat leak from the system the incident heat load on the porous media top surface was 1000 w m2 in all the cases this value is obtained after extrapolation of data in a previous study kumar and arakeri 2015 we now give a description of the experiments whose details are seen in table 1 as mentioned earlier we used two different configurations to mimic the root soil water coupling height of the porous column h was 80 mm in both the cases in the first case we used a chalk exp 1 whose pore sizes are several orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding 0 70 0 80 mm diameter glass beads here the chalk was placed at the centre and the larger beads were slowly packed with water in steps kumar 2017 the chalk was in contact with the larger beads throughout its height fig 1a in the second case the height of the finer particles exp 2 used was negligible compared to the porous column height fig 1b the porous media considered here is a 3 d system due to a large number of layers in any direction this also ensures limited boundary effects in both the cases the finer particles are expected to behave as roots since they would suck water from the larger particles we compare the results of the present study with a reference system exp 3 consisting only of the larger 0 70 0 80 mm diameter glass beads particles note that a few studies shahraeeni and or 2010 aminzadeh and or 2014 exist where mass loss from a system as the one in exp 1 was investigated a similar system could be finer particles separated by coarser either vertically or horizontally like in exp 4 see table 1 these systems kumar and arakeri 2018b lehmann and or 2009 too offer preferential movement of water but they cannot be considered as simulating root soil water coupling due to their large surface extents we believe that exp 2 is a relatively new concept which may be closest to simulating the grass type root soil water coupling given the negligible depth of the finer particles compared to the porous column height note that exp 2 is different than exp 4 in two main aspects a surface extent of the finer particle sizes is lesser in exp 2 and b the depth of finer particles in exp 2 is much lower compared to that in exp 4 2 1 geometrical and particle scale features of the chalk chalks come in various sizes and shapes cylindrical being the most common the chalk used in the present study is seen schematically in fig 2 a it is nearly cylindrical with small 0 6 from the axis amount of tapering along the length the chalk diameter at one end was 8 42 0 08 mm at the other end was 10 06 0 06 mm and its length was 79 80 0 12 mm the standard deviation was obtained after the measurements were taken for six chalk samples the dry density of the chalk was 1 14 0 02 g cc the overall porosity of the chalk sample was obtained in a separate experiment the chalk piece was dipped slowly in di water kept in a container along its length the water level 6 mm in the container was kept such that the chalk piece did not submerge completely this was done to avoid any air entrapment during this imbibition process after 2 min the completely wet chalk was carefully removed such that any extra water drained off during this duration the chalk did not lose any significant mass due to dissolution of its particles in water the difference in the mass readings of the wet and dry chalk gave us its porosity ratio of the volumes of water and the chalk which we calculated to be 52 53 0 42 the particle size has a broad range majumdar and william 2009 zhang et al 2015 in a piece of chalk and can vary between 0 20 Œº m to 10 Œº m zhang et al 2015 due to the large variation in the particle sizes the pore size would also have a broad range the sem image fig 2b shows very small particles as well as large plate like particles the scale at the bottom of this image indicates 10 Œº m the image was taken at the central cross sectional surface of the chalk and was captured at 5000x magnification we see here that some particles are 10 Œº m in size at 20000x magnification we were able to identify particle sizes as small as 300 n m the resolution of this sem image was low and hence is not shown here these observations related to the range of particle sizes in a chalk are in line with previous studies zhang et al 2015 3 results first we mention the initial conditions of the four experiments after preparing the saturated mixture some extra 9 g water was added in all the cases this method gives evaporation rate in case of bare water kumar and arakeri 2018a b c d kumar and arakeri 2019a as mentioned previously we measured the mass loss using a weighing scale which we converted kumar 2017 to get the instantaneous rate of evaporation e since we began with some extra water on the top the porous media achieve saturation s 1 upon evaporation after some time the evaporation rate at this instant is e m a x in the case of exp 1 exp 2 exp 3 and exp 4 the value of e m a x was 21 0 20 8 19 4 and 19 8 mm day respectively slight variation in e m a x values are due to different ambient conditions air temperature and relative humidity in the ambient air in these experiments note that when 0 s t 1 we get e e m a x we use this to understand see fig 3 variations of the dimensionless evaporation rate e e m a x with the depth of the average water level at any instant z calculated as the product of 1 s and h i e z h 1 s t the value of z z 0 at which stage 1 ends has been defined kumar and arakeri 2018a b kumar 2017 as an evaporative capillary characteristic length l c a p i e l c a p z 0 h 1 s 0 where s 0 is the value of saturation at the end of stage 1 of evaporation note that saturation values are calculated as the ratio of the values of the remaining mass of water instantaneously and at s 1 fig 3 also shows the well known three stages of evaporation in all the cases the arrows point to the end of stage 1 which was marked using sudden change in 1 e 2 t curves whose variation is shown for exp 1 and exp 2 in the inset following major conclusions drawn from fig 3 are a stage 1 is not a constant rate period crp unlike the isothermal cases lehmann et al 2008 yiotis et al 2012 assouline et al 2014 shokri et al 2010 ben neriah et al 2014 or et al 2013 lehmann and or 2009 similar deviating trends were found previously kumar 2018a kumar and arakeri 2019a kumar 2017 kumar and arakeri 2018c the gradually decreasing rates of evaporation in stage 1 in non isothermal cases were shown kumar 2018a to be due to the shrinking wet patches of water on the porous medium surface b in stage 1 the values of e e m a x in exp 2 are slightly higher compared to the base case exp 3 at any given z however surprisingly evaporation behaviour in stage 1 of exp 1 is very similar to the base case c transitions are delayed in exp 1 and exp 2 compared to the base case d sudden transition in exp 2 unlike being gradual in exp 1 and the base case e results of exp 4 are similar to that of exp 2 which was expected since both the systems are quite similar however there are two significant differences i slightly higher e e m a x values and ii delayed transition in exp 4 compared to exp 2 these differences are due to the variation in the surface extent of the finer sizes used in these cases finer particles cover the entire surface in exp 4 which led to an extended duration of stage 1 f consider the data in exp 1 and exp 3 in stage 2 of evaporation let us say between z 45 and z 54 mm in this range e e m a x values reduced from 0 47 to 0 27 and 0 21 to 0 13 respectively in particular at z 50 mm e e m a x values are 0 32 and 0 17 respectively the lower value of e e m a x in the homogeneous case is due to the fact that the vaporization plane liquid vapour interface is far from the top exposed surface surface water content is zero the dry layers above this interface offers high resistance to the vapours on the contrary in exp 1 even at z 50 mm the root mimic chalk was able to pull water to the top thereby maintaining some surface water content although the surrounding medium was completely dry note that in a homogeneous porous medium in stage 2 of evaporation the vaporization plane keeps receding away from the exposed surface with time and the process of evaporation can be modelled as diffusion brutsaert and chen 1995 or diffusion like phenomenon kumar 2017 we now discuss the evaporation process through flow visualization for this purpose we adopted the fluorescein dye particles method which have been previously kumar and arakeri 2018a b kumar 2017 kumar and arakeri 2018c weiss et al 2018 used too these particles are originally red when they are dry but turn water green in a solution with evaporation water is lost continuously but the fluorescein dye particles remain on a solid surface movement of the water air interface due to drying or evaporation would leave out the dye particles which stick to the solid surfaces this is a continuous phenomenon since the particles are orange the region of solid particles which are orange in color signifies the evaporation sites the region of solid surfaces which are green means dye particles are still present in the solution form this unique colour contrast is advantageous than the commonly used brilliant blue lehmann et al 2008 shokri et al 2010 shokri and or 2013 or coffee keita et al 2013 both the experiments exp 1 and exp 2 were commenced with some extra water on top see fig 4 e after some time we get the condition where s 1 and preferential air invasion and subsequent capillary film formation occurs the smaller voids whether within the surrounding porous media or the root mimic start pulling water from the surrounding media fig 4a exp 2 shows the condition when the root mimic is completely wet green while the surrounding medium is completely dry orange at this instant e e m a x 0 9 s 0 64 and z 29 mm 0 36 80 mm and the system is evaporating in stage 1 in fig 4b exp 1 everything including the chalk piece at the centre appears to be completely dry at this instant z 39 mm e e m a x 0 67 and the system is at the verge of ending see fig 3 stage 1 of evaporation the colour contrast of fluorescein dye particles is useful in marking dry and wet regions other examples of this benefit are seen in fig 4c and d the near bottom portions in both of these images appear green signifying fully wet region while the near top region is nearly fully dry note that the middle regions are white which shows the true colour of the glass beads these regions are generally drained by the capillary films fig 4f shows a very interesting situation this image was captured at the end of the experiment but the chalk is still fully wet green at the right hand side of this image we observe that some dry glass beads are sticking with the chalk this region of the chalk was exposed to the atmosphere in exp 1 here we see continuous deposition of the dye particles on the beads which should also have occurred on the near top regions of the chalk note that the voids in the chalk were quite small and the deposited dye particles after a continuous and prolonged duration of their crystallization can easily block them the duration of l c a p hence can be affected by the presence of the dye particles surface water content and the movement of the liquid vapour menisci can also be seen using thermal images kumar and arakeri 2018a b kumar and arakeri 2019a here for simplicity we show the images for the two root mimic experiments when the stage 1 of evaporation is about to end fig 5 a and b shows the respective thermal images for exp 1 and exp 2 cases in both the cases the root mimics are much colder 80c than the surrounding porous medium the temperature colour scale and the respective details of the experiments are seen in the legends the lower temperatures of the root mimics clearly indicate that they are evaporating at high rates while the high temperatures of the surrounding media indicate their dryness some of the heat from the hotter dry region gets conducted laterally kumar and arakeri 2019a aminzadeh and or 2014 also beneath the top surface and within the media and reaches the lower temperature regions and thus helps in sustaining high evaporation rates another common feature in these images is the similar way in which temperature decreases from the hottest container walls to the centre of the root mimic finally we discuss the question till what extent or not at all the fluorescein dye particles would have affected the evaporation characteristics the concept of using the tracer particles lie in their use only in sparse amount it is known keita et al 2013 nachshon et al 2011a b that a large amount of tracer particles like brilliant blue fluorescein dye or salt lead to pore blockage during evaporation from a porous media crystallization of the solid particles in such systems is an active area of research the blockage of pores at least near the exposed surface affect the surface water content significantly and hence the duration of stage 1 is short i e transition arrives earlier for this purpose a separate experiment was conducted this experiment was similar to that of exp 1 but here fluorescein dye particles were not used the experiment was repeated twice for consistency in the measurements fig 6 shows the variations of e e m a x vs z for the two cases following major conclusions can be drawn a surprisingly no significant change in the point of transition or the end of stage 1 of evaporation was observed b in the stage 1 of evaporation e e m a x values are slightly higher when fluorescein dye particles were not used in the stage 2 of evaporation e e m a x values are marginally higher when fluorescein dye particles were not used we can now say that the point of transition in the configuration used in the case of exp 1 is a unique feature of such a system and the dye particles if used only as tracers had no effect slight variations and not significant in the rates of evaporation in these experiments could be due to the partial blockage of pores in the experiment where the dye was used in fact finding the critical amount of dye which would affect the point of transition can be studied in future however this is not the theme of the present investigation 4 discussion the most important conclusion is the enhancement in l c a p values see fig 3 compared to the base case note that l c a p for 0 70 0 80 mm diameter glass beads exp 3 is 30 mm roughly the length l c a p represents the average depth of the water level till which a porous medium sustains stage 1 with chalk at the centre exp 1 l c a p increases by 10 mm and with a thin layer of finer glass beads exp 2 it increases by 15 mm these increased values are significant with finer particles completely covering the coarser ones l c a p increased further to 60 mm the real enhancement in l c a p values for exp 4 is 20 mm since we must remove the thickness 10 mm see table 1 of the finer particles we see that exp 1 and exp 2 may mimic the root soil water coupling next we discuss the reason for the enhancement in l c a p values observed experimentally fig 7 shows simple cartoons for different cases showing liquid motion within the porous media and the liquid vapour menisci at two different instants when the region near the top is relatively i wet and ii dry these cartoons are only a guide and may not represent the exact scenario note that the initial condition in all the cases is the same viz the system is fully saturated s 1 consider a homogeneous system consisting only of larger particles as seen in figure 7a just after the full saturation let s say s 0 95 a dominant capillary film forms due to preferential pore air from the atmosphere invasion lehmann et al 2008 the fluid flow is governed by the total including capillary pressure gradient and initially the relatively larger pores are invaded by air these capillary films connect the water below in the porous media to the pinned liquid on the surface with time these films shrink while the bulk liquid level keeps moving away from the top surface at the critical point the end of stage 1 the top surface loses its water content and the bulk liquid level is at l c a p distance away from the top surface films may still form within the medium but they do not reach the exposed boundary as seen in figure 7e in the presence of the finer particles whether exp 1 or exp 2 additional capillary films shokri et al 2010 lehmann and or 2009 form since the coarser particles now supply some water to the finer particle locations here we have two different types of capillary films i forming within the coarser particles ii connecting bulk liquid to the root mimics at near full saturation this scenario is seen in figure 7b and c consider the instant when evaporation from the homogeneous particles is about to enter the transition regime figure 7e at this instant films in the coarser particles do not reach the top exposed surface but the root mimics are still able to suck water figure 7f and g from the surrounding coarser particles this additional suction extended the duration of stage 1 and l c a p values in exp 1 since the chalk piece spanned the entire porous column enhancement in l c a p value was supposed to be larger than in exp 2 in fact we observed the exact opposite which we believe is due to the deposited orange fluorescein particles blocking the pores in the chalk near the surface this is discussed soon even in the case of real roots the liquid transport figure 7d and h and the movement of the liquid vapour menisci are expected to remain similar to the ones observed here theoretically the accurate prediction of enhancement in l c a p values are not straightforward as the liquid path is quite complicated during the entire evaporation process one must consider possible pathways for liquid flow from largest to larger and eventually to the smaller and the smallest pores at a given instant for example voids formed by 0 80 mm diameter glass beads are the largest these voids will supply water to the voids formed by all the three particle sizes 0 70 0 30 and 0 20 mm diameter at the same time voids between 0 70 mm diameter particles will supply water to the two smaller 0 30 and 0 20 mm diameter voids finally we must also consider water movement from voids of 0 30 mm diameter particles to voids of the smallest 0 20 mm diameter particles following lehmann et al 2008 we calculated values of l c a p for the two homogeneous systems consisting of 0 70 0 80 and 0 20 0 30 mm diameter glass beads to be 13 and 102 mm respectively when these balls are mixed in a vertical contrast the theoretical lehmann and or 2009 value of l c is 319 mm using theory for the horizontal contrast assouline et al 2014 shokri et al 2010 we calculated l c to be 16 mm for the exp 4 l c a p is 60 mm see fig 3 which lies between the theoretical values of vertical 319 mm and horizontal contrasts 16 mm with the limited surface extent and thinner depth l c a p in exp 2 46 mm lies between the theoretical value in case of horizontal contrast 16 mm and l c a p in exp 4 60 mm this trend seems to be true intuitively also we see that the simple models were not able to predict the enhancement in l c a p values correctly and the offset is quite large too the theoretical model in a porous medium with contrast needs to be revisited for the correct adjustments note that in addition to this complexity the effect of incident heat load on mass transfer aspects of a homogeneous porous medium has recently kumar and arakeri 2019b been studied more recently dual porosity and dual permeability systems have been modelled using proper orthogonal decomposition approach wang et al 2017 2018a wang et al 2018b this relatively new method to handle the compressible gas flow in a porous network has been shown to be computationally much faster and highly accurate 5 conclusions experimental investigations of evaporation from unique double porosity systems were conducted and the observations were compared with a homogeneous and a horizontally layered system the goal was to understand the plant root soil water coupling in the absence of gravitational drainage the roots were mimicked using two materials a porous chalk with very low particle sizes spanning the entire porous column and b a thin near surface layer of finer 0 20 0 30 mm diameter glass beads coarser surrounding glass beads with 0 70 0 80 mm diameter were used to mimic soils the systems were heated from above using infrared radiation to increase the rates of evaporation which occurred only from the open top surfaces as rest of the surfaces were impervious three diagnostics were used simultaneously measurement of mass measurement of the evaporating surface temperature captured by an ir camera and colour based detection of wet dry regions or surfaces using the fluorescein dye particles method relative to the homogeneous case we found a substantial increase in the l c a p values the increment was argued to be due to additional suction applied by the root mimics on the larger particles when they are hydraulically connected we expected the chalk piece at the centre to have greater l c a p compared to the other root mimic but it in fact is lesser this experiment was also conducted and repeated twice for consistency where the dye particles were not used the deposited fluorescein dye particles partially blocked the pores in chalk but had nearly no effect on the overall evaporation characteristics the dye particles used in small amount acted as tracers and helped in tracking the evaporating and draining zones based on a unique colour contrast finally the surface water content was indirectly indicated by the thermal images the surface temperature and the evaporation rate of any region in a thermal image follow an inverse relation to satisfy the surface energy balance as far as evaporation rates in the stage 2 are concerned the homogeneous system had the least value for the same system but with root mimics especially the deep roots like the chalk in exp1 the rates of evaporation are higher this happened because the root mimics helped in sustaining the hydraulic connections and hence some surface water content was maintained although water level in the surrounding medium was very far from the exposed surface this shows the ability of root mimics in redistributing the moisture within a porous system not only in stage 1 resulting in high l c a p of evaporation but also in stage 2 resulting in slightly higher rates of evaporation compared to a homogeneous porous medium the present investigation can be further extended to the case where the surrounding medium will not be allowed to evaporate it would be interesting to compare the l c a p values in these cases they are expected to be higher than the values obtained here additionally an artificial plant with leaf type surfaces can be added to the present system to complete the plant root soil water coupling in reality this coupling is highly complicated not only due to the extent and networking of roots but also due to gravitation drainage however such a simplistic approach in the present study did mimic up to some extent the root soil coupling in determining the overall water distribution a possible extension of this study could be to include a real plant root in a homogeneous or heterogeneous porous medium and observe the interactions as well as the plant root water uptake declaration of

problematic and global climate change and long term traditional rotary tillage have negative effects on the soil surface layer subsoiling has been an effective measure to improve soil surface layer structure and increase yield in the present study field experiments were conducted to compare the effects of subsoiling and rotary tillage in winter wheat and summer maize double cropping systems subsoiling treatments at a depth of 40 cm s40 and 35 cm s35 and rotary tillage at a depth of 15 cm r15 before winter wheat planting were used and the effects of tillage methods on soil stable infiltration rate soil water consumption evapotranspiration grain yield and crop water productivity cwp in summer maize growing seasons were determined the results showed that subsoiling significantly improved soil infiltration rate water consumption in the subsoiling treatments increased significantly and especially promoted the crops to utilize soil water at depths below 60 cm in the soil profile as a result compared with r15 kernel numbers per row and 1000 grain weight in s35 were significantly increased therefore both grain yield and cwp were significantly improved our results indicate that

an important grain production region and a large proportion of the sown area consists of summer maize however there is an increasingly prominent discrepancy between supply and demand the implementation of water resource allocations for agricultural production in the region increases tensions leng et al 2015 global climate change leads to increased occurrence of extreme droughts and many crops including summer maize are facing problems with stagnant or decreasing yields ren et al 2018b in recent years the development of water saving agricultural production methods has attracted much attention conservation tillage strategies e g no tillage low tillage and subsoiling have been developed that are more beneficial in terms of regulating soil water transport and consumption than rotary tillage methods resulting in increased yield qin et al 2008 bogunovic et al 2018 implementing conservation tillage is important to achieve efficient water use and sustainable development of agriculture the main cropping system on the ncp consists of wheat maize continuous cropping in this cropping system different tillage methods are usually applied before winter wheat planting and the traditional method involves rotary tillage farming depth about 15 cm guan et al 2014 showed that short term rotary tillage can improve soil moisture content and crop yield however long term rotary tillage will lead to the formation of the bottom layer of the plough which is often obstructed by the crop root system moreira 2016 yu et al 2016 long term single rotary tillage and the movement of agricultural machinery aggravate the surface structure of the soil and the average surface depth becomes shallow 16 5 cm zhang and li 2010 as a result the ability of water and fertilizer conservation decrease significantly which has an adverse effect on the growth of summer maize optimizing farming methods can improve the surface layer structure and increase crop yield currently the main problem on the ncp concerns the formation of a reasonable tillage layer to form a solid bottom using perennial rotary tillage subsoiling is an effective measure to break the plow sole previous studies have shown that subsoiling under stable soil conditions can alleviate the effects of drought stress on crops improve soil production potential and increase yield by about 20 schneider et al 2017 more specifically studies have shown that subsoiling can improve soil properties nutrient use efficiency and crop water productivity cwp and promote crop growth and development compared with conventional tillage methods subsoiling at a depth of 35 40 cm can effectively increase water infiltration by removing the resistance from the solid bottom layer kaur and arora 2019 varsa et al 1997 bogunovic et

increase the connectivity of soil pores especially that of large soil pores meanwhile studies have shown that subsoiling increases nutrient accumulation and soil water content which serves to both reduce drought stress and provide a more favorable soil environment for root system growth and yield increase cai et al 2014 zhai et al 2017 furthermore yu et al 2016 and sun et al 2017 showed that subsoiling promoted the growth of crop roots which utilized the nutrients and water in the deeper soil layers increasing the nutrient use efficiency and cwp most previous studies selected the appropriate depth for subsoiling according to the conditions of the site under investigation e g soil type cultivation mode and rainfall this depth was usually from 30 to 50 cm cai et al 2014 jabro et al 2016 sun et al 2018 previous studies have mostly focused on depths of 30 40 cm mu et al 2016 shao et al 2016 however to our knowledge there has been no research on the suitable subsoiling depth on the ncp as the depth of cultivation increases so does the cost of production which is not conducive to environmental protection and the increase of farmers output and income therefore two subsoiling treatments at 40 cm and 35 cm were set in the present study and the traditional rotary tillage method was used as the control we measured the dynamic changes in soil moisture crop water consumption and cwp to find the optimal depth for subsoiling in this area we hypothesized that subsoiling could increase water infiltration rate and soil water content and thus increase grain yield and cwp compared with rotary tillage therefore in this experiment our goal was to determine the following 1 soil infiltration rate after subsoiling treatments on continuous rotary tillage test plots 2 water use of summer maize under different topsoil structure conditions and 3 which of the two depths tested 40 cm or 35 cm performs better in terms of grain yield and cwp for subsoiling answering the above

treatments was significantly higher than that in r15 by 89 1 and 58 1 in 2018 the soil stable infiltration rate in s40 and s35 was significantly higher than that in r15 by 89 9 and 63 3 respectively fig 2 the soil stable infiltration rate in 2018 was higher than that in 2017 the soil stable infiltration rate in r15 s40 and s35 in 2018 was higher than in 2017 by 3 6 4 0 and 7 0 respectively 3 2 soil water consumption in maize seasons fig 3 shows the soil water consumption through 0 130 cm of the soil profile in the 2017 and 2018 summer maize growing seasons in both growing seasons the change in soil water consumption in the 0 50 cm soil layer was similar with no significant difference being found among treatments with the deepening of soil layer the soil water consumption in maize seasons when treated with subsoiling significantly increased at 50 90 cm and 90 130 cm in the following order s40 s35 r15 these results indicate that subsoiling treatment increases the soil water consumption in maize seasons in the deeper soil layers this means that crops can utilize deep soil water for their growth and development 3 3 grain yield and yield compositions table 3 shows grain yield and yield compositions in the 2017 and 2018 summer maize growing seasons during the two year experiment the experimental results showed that the subsoiling treatment improved kernel number per row 1000 grain weight and grain yield of summer maize however the treatment had no significant effect on row numbers per spike in both growing seasons the highest kernel numbers per row was obtained in the s35 treatment followed by that under s40 treatment and the lowest was found in the r15 treatment the 1000 grain weight for s35 was significantly higher than that of r15 by 4 2 in 2017 and the 1000 grain weight for s35 and s40 was significantly higher than that of r15 by 2 6 and 2 8 in 2018 respectively in 2017 grain yield in s35 increased by 13 1 and 3 0 compared with r15 and s40 respectively in 2018 gain yield in s35 increased by 8 3 and 3 7 compared with r15 and s40 respectively however owing to precipitation grain yield in r15 s40 and s35 was lower in 2018 than in 2017 by 1 1 6 0 and 5 3 respectively 3 4 et and crop water productivity table 4 shows et and cwp in 2017 and 2018 summer maize growing seasons there was no significant difference in soil water consumption between r15 and s35 in these growing seasons however soil water consumption in s40 was significantly higher than that in r15 in the first and second growing seasons the two year experiment showed that subsoiling treatment significantly increased et in the following order s40 s35 in both growing seasons cwp was significantly higher in s35 than that in s40 and r15 in 2017 cwp in s35 was significantly higher than in r15 and s40 by 10 2 and 9 1 respectively in 2018 cwp in s35 was significantly higher than in r15 and s40 by 7 5 and 7 5 respectively in addition cwp in r15 s40 and s35 was much lower in 2018 than that in 2017 by 1 9 2 3 and 4 2 respectively 4 discussion many previous studies have shown that subsoiling improved the physical properties of continuous no tillage or rotary tillage soils and increased the yield of food crops putte et al 2012 cai et al 2014 in the present study subsoiling at depths of 35 cm and 40 cm were tested compared with rotary tillage the subsoiling treatments promoted the absorption and use of water from the deeper soil layers during summer maize growth in this experiment the results showed that the s35 treatment had the best performance with a balanced relationship between water consumption and grain yield as a result the highest cwp was observed under this treatment there is a plow sole in the tillage layer which hinders the infiltration of water drought stress caused by a lack of soil water has a major limiting effect on crop growth it has been reported that different tillage methods have significant effects on soil water status crop growth and the regulation of the soil crop system mosaddeghi et al 2009 ren et al 2018a compared with rotary tillage subsoiling broke down the plow sole and made the surface soil more porous so that the root system could grow earlier and extend into the deeper soil layers which was beneficial for summer maize cwp yan et al 2017 previous studies have shown that the distribution of soil water infiltration was related to the distribution pattern of the maize fiber root system and that the connectivity between macropores plays a key role in soil water migration wu et al 2009 thus while subsoiling created preferred paths for the flow of water the preferred flow created by fibrous roots also guided and facilitated water infiltration into deeper soil layers jiang et al 2018 in this experiment the soil stable infiltration rate in s40 and s35 was significantly higher than that in r15 which created an effective water transport channel for timely rainfall infiltration even to the deeper soil layers wang et al 2012 and bogunovic et al 2018 showed that subsoiling treatment enhanced the capacity of soil water and increased maize yield in our experiment the stable infiltration rate under the subsoiling treatment was higher than that under the rotary tillage treatment which allowed the water to infiltrate the deep soil below 60 cm and increased the water utilization in the later stage of summer maize growth tillage methods significantly changed the topsoil environment and greatly affected maize yield tao et al 2015 under more adequate water conditions subsoiling delayed summer maize leaf senescence and maintained a higher leaf area index and photosynthetic rate laying a solid physiological foundation for the final yield increase sun et al 2017 in terms of water consumption the results of this experiment showed that the evapotranspiration of subsoiling treatment was significantly higher than that of rotary tillage treatment subsoiling machinery works effectively to break the plow sole and better tillage layer structure is beneficial to the downward growth of summer maize root systems yu et al 2016 showed that subsoiling at 38 cm significantly increased water consumption in our study the results were similar more soil water was consumed under the subsoiling treatments compared with that under the rotary tillage especially soil water below 50 cm hsiao 2000 indicated that maize root system under the condition of drought response mechanism water transport is a process of absorption root in the soil played a vital role in the extraction of moisture root systems absorb the deep soil water after hydraulic promotion functions and balances the water levels in the plants providing resistance to drought stress cai et al 1993 at the same time another important reason for the significant increase in water consumption in the subsoiling treatment is that this treatment can improve the photosynthetic performance and transpiration rate of summer maize xu et al 2017 as we all know summer maize transpiration plays a leading role in farmland evapotranspiration which increases soil water consumption in general the evapotranspiration of the subsoiling treatment was significantly higher than that of the rotary tillage treatment on this physical basis it is possible for crop growth to increase and to achieve increased yield and ultimately improve cwp tian et al 2016 pointed out that the conditions of their study area were under the influence of many factors such as rainfall and farming methods and the changes in yield and cwp were similar to our results in our experiment summer maize grain yield in 2018 showed a different degree of decrease compared with that in 2017 the main reason may be related to heavy rainfall which was concentrated during the flowering stage resulting in decreased quality of pollination and spike numbers shao et al 2016 gao et al 2018 in view of the deterioration of soil structure caused by continuous rotary tillage on the ncp subsoiling at 35 cm and 40 cm could provide improvements by increasing soil stable infiltration rate water consumption and grain yield in our experiment the subsoiling treatment s35 balanced the relationship between water content and grain yield and reached the highest cwp therefore the results suggest that subsoiling at 35 cm before winter wheat once every two years should be taken as the preferred tillage method for promoting increased crop yields on the ncp this experiment mainly studied soil water dynamics and crop water consumption characteristics but the response of photosynthesis and fluorescence of summer maize to subsoiling at different depths remains unclear at the same time the study of soil infiltration mechanisms is also of great significance 5 conclusions subsoiling significantly improved soil stable infiltration rate summer maize water consumption and grain yield subsoiling s35 balanced the relationship between soil water content and grain yield and achieved the highest cwp therefore our results suggest that 35 cm can be used as a reasonable subsoiling depth to improve summer maize grain yield and cwp on the ncp acknowledgements this work was financially

problematic and global climate change and long term traditional rotary tillage have negative effects on the soil surface layer subsoiling has been an effective measure to improve soil surface layer structure and increase yield in the present study field experiments were conducted to compare the effects of subsoiling and rotary tillage in winter wheat and summer maize double cropping systems subsoiling treatments at a depth of 40 cm s40 and 35 cm s35 and rotary tillage at a depth of 15 cm r15 before winter wheat planting were used and the effects of tillage methods on soil stable infiltration rate soil water consumption evapotranspiration grain yield and crop water productivity cwp in summer maize growing seasons were determined the results showed that subsoiling significantly improved soil infiltration rate water consumption in the subsoiling treatments increased significantly and especially promoted the crops to utilize soil water at depths below 60 cm in the soil profile as a result compared with r15 kernel numbers per row and 1000 grain weight in s35 were significantly increased therefore both grain yield and cwp were significantly improved our results indicate that the s35 treatment is a reasonable subsoiling measure on the north china plain which can increase both summer maize grain yield and cwp in double cropping systems keywords subsoiling soil stable

compositions in the 2017 and 2018 summer maize growing seasons during the two year experiment the experimental results showed that the subsoiling treatment improved kernel number per row 1000 grain weight and grain yield of summer maize however the treatment had no significant effect on row numbers per spike in both growing seasons the highest kernel numbers per row was obtained in the s35 treatment followed by that under s40 treatment and the lowest was found in the r15 treatment the 1000 grain weight for s35 was significantly higher than that of r15 by 4 2 in 2017 and the 1000 grain weight for s35 and s40 was significantly higher than that of r15 by 2 6 and 2 8 in 2018 respectively in 2017 grain yield in s35 increased by 13 1 and 3 0 compared with r15 and s40 respectively in 2018 gain yield in s35 increased by 8 3 and 3 7 compared with r15 and s40 respectively however owing to precipitation grain yield in r15 s40 and s35 was lower in 2018 than in 2017 by 1 1 6 0 and 5 3 respectively 3 4 et and crop water productivity table 4 shows et and cwp in 2017 and 2018 summer maize growing seasons there was no significant difference in soil water consumption between r15 and s35 in these growing seasons however soil water consumption in s40 was significantly higher than that in r15 in the first and second growing seasons the two year experiment showed that subsoiling treatment significantly increased et in the following order s40 s35 in both growing seasons cwp was significantly higher in s35 than that in s40 and r15 in 2017 cwp in s35 was significantly higher than in r15 and s40 by 10 2 and 9 1 respectively in 2018 cwp in s35 was significantly higher than in r15 and s40 by 7 5 and 7 5 respectively in addition cwp in r15 s40 and s35 was much lower in 2018 than that in 2017 by 1 9 2 3 and 4 2 respectively 4 discussion many previous studies have shown that subsoiling improved the physical properties of continuous no tillage or rotary tillage soils and increased the yield of food crops putte et al 2012 cai et al 2014 in the present study subsoiling at depths of 35 cm and 40 cm were tested compared with rotary tillage the subsoiling treatments promoted the absorption and use of water from the deeper soil layers during summer maize growth in this experiment the results showed that the s35 treatment had the best performance with a balanced relationship between water consumption and grain yield as a result the highest cwp was observed under this treatment there is a plow sole in the tillage layer which hinders the infiltration of water drought stress caused by a lack of soil water has a major limiting effect on crop growth it has been reported that different tillage methods have significant effects on soil water status crop growth and the regulation of the soil crop system mosaddeghi et al 2009 ren et al 2018a compared with rotary tillage subsoiling broke down the plow sole and made the surface soil more porous so that the root system could grow earlier and extend into the deeper soil layers which was beneficial for summer maize cwp yan et al 2017 previous studies have shown that the distribution of soil water infiltration was related to the distribution pattern of the maize fiber root system and that the connectivity between macropores plays a key role in soil water migration wu et al 2009 thus while subsoiling created preferred paths for the flow of water the preferred flow created by fibrous roots also guided and facilitated water infiltration into deeper soil layers jiang et al 2018 in this experiment the soil stable infiltration rate in s40 and s35 was significantly higher than that in r15 which created an effective water transport channel for timely rainfall infiltration even to the deeper soil layers wang et al 2012 and bogunovic et al 2018 showed that subsoiling treatment enhanced the capacity of soil water and increased maize yield in our experiment the stable infiltration rate under the subsoiling treatment was higher than that under the rotary tillage treatment which allowed the water to infiltrate the deep soil below 60 cm and increased the water utilization in the later stage of summer maize growth tillage methods significantly changed the topsoil environment and greatly affected maize yield tao et al 2015 under more adequate water conditions subsoiling delayed summer maize leaf senescence and maintained a higher leaf area index and photosynthetic rate laying a solid physiological foundation for the final yield increase sun et al 2017 in terms of water consumption the results of this experiment showed that the evapotranspiration of subsoiling treatment was significantly higher than that of rotary tillage treatment subsoiling machinery works effectively to break the plow sole and better tillage layer structure is beneficial to the downward growth of summer maize root systems yu et al 2016 showed that subsoiling at 38 cm significantly increased water consumption in our study the results were similar more soil water was consumed under the subsoiling treatments compared with that under the rotary tillage especially soil water below 50 cm hsiao 2000 indicated that maize root system under the condition of drought response mechanism water transport is a process of absorption root in the soil played a vital role in the extraction of moisture root systems absorb the deep soil water after hydraulic promotion functions and balances the water levels in the plants providing resistance to drought stress cai et al 1993 at the same time another important reason for the significant increase in water consumption in the subsoiling treatment is that this treatment can improve the photosynthetic performance and transpiration rate of summer maize xu et al 2017 as we all know summer maize transpiration plays a leading role in farmland evapotranspiration which increases soil water consumption in general the evapotranspiration of the subsoiling treatment was significantly higher than that of the rotary tillage treatment on this physical basis it is possible for crop growth to increase and to achieve increased yield and ultimately improve cwp tian et al 2016 pointed out that the conditions of their study area were under the influence of many factors such as rainfall and farming methods and the changes in yield and cwp were similar to our results in our experiment summer maize grain yield in 2018 showed a different degree of decrease compared with that in 2017 the main reason may be related to heavy rainfall which was concentrated during the flowering stage resulting in decreased quality of pollination and spike numbers shao et al 2016 gao et al 2018 in view of the deterioration of soil structure caused by continuous rotary tillage on the ncp subsoiling at 35 cm and 40 cm could provide improvements by increasing soil stable infiltration rate water consumption and grain yield in our experiment the subsoiling treatment s35 balanced the relationship between water content and grain yield and reached the highest cwp therefore the results suggest that subsoiling at 35 cm before winter wheat once every two years should be taken as the preferred tillage method for promoting increased crop yields on the ncp this experiment mainly studied soil water dynamics and crop water consumption characteristics but the response of photosynthesis and fluorescence of summer maize to subsoiling at different depths remains unclear at the same time the study of soil infiltration mechanisms is also of great significance 5 conclusions subsoiling significantly improved soil stable infiltration rate summer maize water consumption and grain yield subsoiling s35 balanced the relationship between soil water content and grain yield and achieved the highest cwp therefore our results suggest that 35 cm can be used as a reasonable subsoiling depth to improve summer maize grain yield and cwp on the ncp acknowledgements this work was financially

10828,effects on the soil water and foxtail millet yield of different fertilizer rates coupled with the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system rfrhs are unclear which could guide improvements to productivity in dryland farming we conducted field experiments using rfrhs and traditional flat planting tfp at four different fertilizer rates i no fertilizer ck ii low l n 90 p2o5 60 kg ha 1 iii medium m n 180 p2o5 120 kg ha 1 and iv high h n 270 p2o5 180 kg ha 1 rfrhs significantly improved the topsoil water content by 4 7 8 5 in 0 40 cm layer and topsoil temperature by 0 4 0 7 c which stimulated stable seedling establishment and accelerated millet growth fertilization significantly enhanced water absorption in 0 140 cm profile prolonged the growth period of millet and significantly increased dry matter accumulation finally under rfrhs the grain yield and water use efficiency wue of foxtail millet increased by 6 2 and 6 7 respectively compared with tfp and they tended to increase more as fertilizer rate increases indicating a positive interaction between water and nutrients however under rfrhs the m fertilizer rate obtained a higher yield average 6748 6 kg ha 1 wue average 18 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 compared with ck and l rates and made a greater contribution to the grain yield average 32 1 but no further significant increases were observed with the h fertilizer rate where rfrfs showed a tendency to decrease grain yield compared to tfp in wet years therefore rfrhs with fertilizer application at a rate of n 180 p2o5 120 kg ha 1 may be suitable for high efficiency farming management to improve the yield and wue for foxtail millet in this semiarid region keywords plastic mulching fertilization water use soil temperature yield contribution 1 introduction china is one of the largest agricultural countries throughout the world with approximately 140 million ha of agricultural land and more than half 52 5 is employed for dryland farming including the arid and semiarid areas of the northwestern loess plateau liu et al 2015 water scarcity and nutrient deficiencies are the two main limiting factors that constrain stabilized agricultural productivity and potential crop yields in dryland farming systems li et al 2009a 2009b precipitation is the major source of water for crop production in these regions but limited and erratic precipitation threatens crop productivity and sustainability where it often results in lower grain yields and even the total failure of crops moreover inadequate soil moisture reduces the nutrient uptake efficiency and it is another major cause of low crop yields li et al 2009a 2009b zaongo et al 1997 therefore it is important to maximize the soil water storage sws and efficiently utilize the limited rain to facilitate higher crop productivity in semiarid regions gan et al 2013 wen et al 2012 in dryland farming systems the use of efficient precipitation exploitation technology is critically important for improving the effective utilization of water and the uptake of nutrients li et al 2016 nagaz et al 2009 seghatoleslami et al 2008 several strategies have been developed for rain harvesting in semiarid agro ecosystems where they can capture and utilize rain for irrigation directing water to the plant root zone and for household use gan et al 2013 one of the most innovative strategies is a combination of the ridge furrow system with plastic mulch film rfrhs in the field as a highly effective strategy li et al 2000 rfrhs is a rainfall harvesting system with two components comprising ridges rainfall harvesting zone and furrows planting zone the ridges in the field alternate with the corresponding furrows the crops are planted in the furrows whereas the ridges are covered with plastic film and they are kept free of planting for harvesting rainwater li et al 2000 ren et al 2016 previous studies have shown that this system can enhance the soil moisture levels by reducing the rate of soil evaporation while the rainwater is collecting by runoff from the ridges into the furrows thereby leading to deep soil water infiltration and reduced water loss which increases the yields of cereal crops especially in semiarid areas gan et al 2013 in addition to water availability nutrients are essential for promoting crop growth and productivity in rainfed agriculture however the increases in crop yields are not due only to the nutrients themselves because their interactions with soil moisture ensure the availability and translocation of nutrients li et al 2009a 2009b optimal supplies of water and nutrients can improve the canopy growth and photosynthetic efficiency and thus the crop yield teixeira et al 2014 this is because adequate water can improve the availability of soil nutrients especially nitrogen thereby increasing the absorption and utilization of soil nutrients and the availability of adequate nutrients can effectively increase the amount of soil water accessible to crops by promoting root growth thus these two soil properties are the most important environmental factors that affect the crop assimilation process by increasing stomatal conductance and the photosynthetic activity in semiarid regions hou et al 2015 li et al 2009a 2009b previous studies have also demonstrated the effect of the strong interaction between the available soil water and fertilizer on crop yields li et al 2009a 2009b zaongo et al 1997 when the soil water supply is limited crop production remains at a low level and exhibits little response to nitrogen fertilizer at any rate whereas crop production improves greatly when sufficient soil water is provided and the linear regression slope between the yield and amount of water increases with the nitrogen application rate smika et al 1965 reasonable nutrient management is essential for enhancing crop productivity and maintaining the ecological balance at present it is generally recognized that after the amount of fertilizer applied exceeds a threshold the yield will no longer increase significantly and many adverse environmental problems may occur such as n accumulating in the soil which can degrade the quality of ground and surface water resources as well as leading to eutrophication and affecting non potable water supplies barton and colmer 2006 chen et al 2014 the strategic optimization of nutrients and the water supply are highly significant for maintaining a high water use efficiency wue and sustainable crop yields in semiarid areas therefore the effects of combining rfrhs with the optimum application of fertilizer in semiarid regions are of great interest previous studies mainly investigated the implementation of rfrhs alone to facilitate efficient water use by conserving precipitation water via adjustments to the ridge furrow ratio and the use of different mulching materials such as plastic film straw gravel and grass cover gan et al 2013 li et al 2013 ren et al 2016 wang et al 2015 however the enhancement of dryland farming and increasing the grain yield also requires optimizing the application of fertilizer and its interaction with the availability of water few studies have focused on the effects of rfrhs combined with different n p2o5 fertilizer application rates on the grain yield and wue of foxtail millet and the yield contribution analysis therefore the objectives of the present study were as follows 1 to investigate the effects of rfrhs combined with different n p2o5 fertilizer rates on soil water and temperature and millet growth 2 to assess the contribution of different factor rfrhs fertilizer interaction between rfrhs and fertilizer to the yield in millet and 3 to identify an optimized adaptive agronomic management strategy for millet yield and synergistic utilization of water and nutrients in the semiarid region studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted for 2 years during 2013 and 2014 at the dryland farming experimental station of northwest a f university located in chengyang town pengyang county ningxia hui autonomous region 35 52 n 106 46 e 1695 m above sea level in northwestern china the climatic conditions at the experimental site were typical for the loess plateau region with hilly topography where they were characterized as semiarid with a warm temperate climate the average annual temperature was 6 1 c with an average rainfall of 410 mm over the last 40 years the amounts of rainfall during the foxtail millet growing period were 533 5 mm in 2013 wet year and 294 6 mm in 2014 drought year as shown in fig 1 the soil was classified as loess orthic entisols fao 2002 the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil are shown in table 1 the site was used to produce spring maize prior to the experiment irrigation was not provided during the experiment 2 2 experimental design and procedure the experimental study was conducted using a randomized complete block design where each treatment had three replicates in both years and each plot covered an area of 32 4 m2 6 0 5 4 m the field experiments tested two planting patterns comprising i rfrhs and ii the traditional flat planting pattern tfp fig 2 with four different fertilizer rates i control ck no fertilizer ii low l n 90 60 p2o5 kg ha 1 iii medium m n 180 p2o5 120 kg ha 1 and high h n 270 p2o5 180 kg ha 1 thereby comprising a total of eight treatment combinations rh rm rl and rck are four treatment combinations with rfrhs and four different amounts of fertilizer th tm tl and tck are four treatment combinations with tfp and four different amounts of fertilizer ten days before sowing das alternative ridges and furrows were constructed for rfrhs where the ridges were covered by polythene plastic film with a thickness of 0 008 mm fig 2 at the junction of ridges and furrows a small groove 5 cm deep was dug where the edge of the film was placed and then covered with soil to fix the film the chemical fertilizers comprised urea n 46 0 and diammonium phosphate n 18 0 p2o5 46 0 were manually applied to the plots furrows under the rfrhs and throughout the whole plot under tfp then the fertilizer is evenly distributed in 0 20 cm soil by tillage to minimize the impact of the treatments each plot was separated by a border with a width of 60 cm the foxtail millet cv zhangzagu 3 seeds were sown at a rate of 22 5 kg ha 1 on april 20 2013 and april 30 2014 at the 4th leaf stage a planting density of 333 000 plants ha 1 was maintained during both years and this was controlled by strict row spacing and plant spacing which were 30 60 cm and 7 5 cm in rfrhs respectively and 30 cm and 10 0 cm in tfp respectively fig 2 the foxtail millet was harvested on september 14 2013 and september 25 2014 no irrigation was provided throughout the growing season and manual weeding was undertaken if needed 2 3 sampling and calculations 2 3 1 soil water the soil gravimetric water content swc was determined periodically at a soil depth of 0 200 cm with intervals of 20 cm 0 20 cm with intervals of 10 cm in the sowing 0 das seedling about 30 das jointing about 60 das heading about 90 das filling about 120 das and maturity stages about 150 das for millet during 2013 and 2014 from each plot three random core samples were collected using a hand held soil ferric auger and the values were averaged for the rfrhs treatments the samples were collected from the middles of the ridges and furrows and the sides of the furrows for the tfp treatments soil cores were sampled between two rows the soil samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h sws mm was calculated using the following equation s w s s w c œÅ b s d where swc is the soil gravimetric water content œÅ b g cm 3 is the soil bulk density and sd mm is the soil depth rainfall was the only water source for crop growth during each growing season the plots were surrounded by ridges to prevent the runoff of rainfall water therefore the water consumption amount wc mm was calculated as li et al 2013 w c Œ¥ s w s p where Œ¥sws mm is the difference in sws between the beginning and the end of the period and p mm is the amount of precipitation during the period 2 3 2 soil temperature the soil temperature oc was measured in the seedling jointing heading and filling stages for millet by adjusting a set of mercury geothermometers hongxing thermal instrument china between two rows the edge row and the middle row for rfrhs for each treatment at soil depths of 5 15 and 25 cm the soil temperature was determined at 08 00 h 10 00 h 12 00 h 14 00 h 16 00 h 18 00 h and 20 00 h each day during the daytime every measurement was the mean of three daily readings 2 3 3 plant dry matter accumulation plant dry matter accumulation g plant 1 was determined in the seedling jointing heading filling and maturity stages for millet where three plants were randomly selected in each plot and cut at ground level the sampled plants were oven dried initially at 105 c for 30 min followed by 75 c for 24 h 2 3 4 grain yield biomass yield and harvest index hi at physiological maturity three quadrats were harvested to determine the yield from each plot where an area of 3 6 m2 was manually harvested in each quadrat and the grain yield and plant biomass were determined at a moisture content of 14 hi was determined as the ratio of the grain yield relative to the biomass yield 2 3 5 water use efficiency wue wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following equations li et al 2013 w u e g y w c where gy kg ha 1 is the grain yield and wc mm is the amount of water consumed during the whole millet growing season 2 3 6 contributions of different factors to the grain yield we studied the quantitative effects of four factors comprising the initial soil substrates rfrhs fertilizer treatment levels l m and h levels and the interaction between rfrhs and fertilizer on the grain yield where the tck treatment was the baseline the contributions of these four factors to the foxtail millet grain yield were calculated according to ma et al 2009 and zhang et al 2003 as follows c o n t r i b u t i o n o f b a s e l i n e c 0 t c k g

each sampling event were analyzed separately duncan s test was used to detect differences among means for treatments at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water there were obvious differences in soil moisture among the treatments table 2 fig 3 compared with tfp rfrhs significantly increased the swc in the 0 40 cm soil layer by averages of 8 5 in 2013 wet year and 4 7 in 2014 drought year the swc in the 40 140 cm layer tended to be more variable under rfrhs compared with tfp during the growing seasons in both years the swc increased by an average of 5 0 in 2013 but due to the lower amount of rainfall in 2014 rfrhs did not have a consistent effect during the millet growing season and the swc even declined by 6 6 in the heading stage in addition we found that rfrhs had minimal effects on swc in the 140 200 cm soil profile fertilizer significantly increased the absorption of soil water by millet where there was a gradual decrease in soil water as the fertilizer application rate increased especially from the jointing to maturity stages table 2 and fig 3 the increased application of fertilizer amount enhanced the absorption of water in the 0 140 cm layer especially in the wet year 2013 and it was enhanced in the 40 140 cm layer during the drought year 2014 3 2 soil temperature as shown in fig 4 the soil temperature was increased by rfrhs but no significant differences were observed among the fertilizer treatments on average rfrhs increased the soil temperature by 0 4 0 4 0 5 and 0 7 c in the seedling jointing heading and filling stages respectively across the two growing seasons compared with tfp 3 3 millet growth and development process compared with tfp rfrhs shortened the growth period of millet by 3 4 days fig 5 meanwhile rfrhs resulted in earlier millet growth by 1 days to emergency 2 days to seedling 4 days to jointing 4 days to heading and 4 days to filling respectively across the two growing seasons in contrast fertilization extended the growth period of millet by 1 2 days among all treatments th treatment had the longest growth period average 142 days and rck had the shortest growth period average 137 days in addition it was found that rfrhs shortened the vegetative growth duration by 4 5 days but extended the reproductive growth duration by 0 2 days 3 4 dry matter accumulation the dynamic accumulation of dry matter improved significantly under rfrhs and fertilizer application during both growing seasons as shown in fig 6 the effects of the planting patterns on the maximum dry matter accumulation in the two years did not differ significantly however the accumulation of dry matter by foxtail millet was much faster in the rfrhs treatments than tfp at the same fertilizer application rate from the sowing to heading stages under fertilization the maximum and rate of dry matter accumulation increased gradually with the amount of fertilizer where the greatest dry biomass was achieved with the h level but it did not differ significantly from that with the m level in the drought year of 2014 3 5 yield as shown in table 3 both the planting patterns and fertilizer levels significantly affected the yield and water use by millet where the effects differed between years in 2013 no significant difference was observed between the two planting patterns except for a 5 4 increase with the h level table 4 but there was a significant increase of 3 9 12 0 from the n 0 270 kg ha 1 p2o5 0 180 kg ha 1 application rate under rfrhs compared with tfp in 2014 in addition the yield generally tended to increase with the amount of fertilizer ranging from 3584 3 to 7075 9 kg ha 1 in 2013 and from 5231 2 to 7394 5 kg ha 1 in 2014 and the increase was significant when the fertilizer rate exceeded m level in 2013 but not in 2014 thereby leading to significantly different dose response relationships for the grain yield and fertilizer application rate with different cropping patterns fig 7 the response appeared to be more positive the grain yield increased more rapidly under rfrhs than tfp as the amount of fertilizer increased in both years under tfp the maximum grain yields were obtained by n application at 295 and 261 kg ha 1 in 2013 and 2014 respectively and the corresponding grain yields were 6729 and 7146 kg ha 1 however higher grain yields were achieved under rfrhs with the application of 573 and 214 kg n with yields of 8421 and 7482 kg ha 1 respectively thus rfrhs strongly enhanced the effects of the fertilizer to increase the crop grain yield which indicated a strong interaction between water and nutrients in addition rfrhs significantly increased the hi for millet compared with tfp in both years compared with tfp rhrfs increased input costs in millet production with an average range of 420 yuan ha 1 table 4 however due to the more powerful effect of grain yield the economic benefit of millet was more consistent with the trend of grain yield in 2013 rfrhs only showed an increase in economic benefit at the h high fertilizer level compared with tfp with a range of 1861 yuan ha 1 and a decrease at the ck l level of 935 2666 yuan ha 1 in 2014 rfrhs showed general higher economic benefits than tfp at the four fertilization levels and the ranges at h m l and ck fertilizer levels were 1320 1377 4138 and 1828 yuan ha 1 respectively 3 6 water consumption wc and water use efficiency wue the wc amount was strongly influenced by rainfall and the treatments both years table 5 and fig 8 overall rfrhs significantly reduced the wc in the wet year and there was a similar level in the wc in the dry year compared with tfp table 5 furthermore compared with tfp rfrhs reduced the water consumption from the seeding to heading stage wcsh in the wet year 2013 but it increased in the drought year 2014 fig 8 fertilization significantly increased the wc in both years under the two planting patterns thereby indicating the positive effect of fertilizer application on water uptake the wue increased significantly with the amount of fertilizer and the highest wue was achieved by the rfrhs h and m treatments in 2013 and 2014 respectively table 5 moreover the rfrhs tended to increase the wue more with the fertilizer rate compared tfp which was similar to the relationship between the grain yield and fertilizer application rate fig 9 the highest wue values using tfp were obtained with 276 and 199 kg ha 1 n application i e 12 6 in 2013 and 22 8 in 2014 respectively however under rfrhs the highest wue values were 29 4 and 25 2 with 418 and 199 kg ha 1 n application respectively 3 7 analysis of the contributions of different factors rfrhs cr fertilizer cf and interaction between planting and fertilizer crf to the foxtail millet grain yield under rfrhs the analysis of the contributions of different factors table 6 showed that planting combined with fertilizer greatly increased the foxtail millet grain yield at a rate of 25 1 45 7 three factors were responsible for this increase —ñ the rfrhs planting factor cr —ñ—ñ the fertilizer factor cf and —ñ—ñ—ñ the interaction between planting and fertilizer crf we found that cf made the highest contribution among these three factors where the contribution from fertilizer increased significantly as the amount of fertilizer increased in both years but no further increase occurred after exceeding the m fertilizer level which achieved increases of 2433 7 and 1807 3 kg ha 1 and rates of 39 4 and 24 7 in 2013 and 2014 with the m treatment under rfrhs respectively however the planting factor had variable effects on the grain yield with a negative effect 3 5 5 1 in 2013 and a positive effect 5 6 5 9 in 2014 compared with tfp in contrast to the fertilizer factor as the amount of fertilizer increased under rfrhs crf also increased and the highest value was achieved with the h level in 2013 but the l level in 2014 3 8 correlation analysis based on the yield water consumption wc and water use efficiency wue for foxtail millet correlation analysis showed that millet grain yield was significantly and positively related to the total wc during the growing season especially during the growth period from the sowing to heading stages wcsh table 7 rfrhs ensured that the water supply was adequate during the early growth stages for foxtail millet the availability of an adequate and enhanced water supply contributed to greater biomass accumulation but it also increased the wue and grain yield wue was significantly and positive correlated with the yield and strongly correlated with the wcsh but it was not significantly related to the total wc these findings suggest that the key factors responsible for obtaining a high yield and wue in foxtail millet are the water supply and distribution during the growth stage rather than increasing the total wc during the whole growth period 4 discussion 4 1 soil water previous studies have demonstrated that plastic film mulching is better for utilizing light and heavy rain by efficiently harvesting rainwater from the ridges thereby improving the availability of water to plants compared with no mulching gan et al 2013 similarly in the present study rfrhs maintained higher sws levels compared with tfp in both experimental years 2013 2014 especially in the 0 140 cm soil layer fig 3 in particular the increase in sws was more prominent in the early growth stages during both years but the sws declined dramatically subsequently especially in the heading stage during 2014 which was the drought year this may have been related to the more vigorous crop growth under rfrhs than tfp zhang et al 2019a consequently the additional retained moisture used during vigorous plant growth resulted in similar or equal sws levels under rfrhs and tfp and in the later stages the soil moisture could be less under rfrhs than tfp previous studies also identified this phenomenon and suggested that it is a highly effective water conditioning strategy where the mulched crop can absorb deep water to avoid drought stress jia et al 2018 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b in the present study soil moisture decreased significantly as the amount of fertilizer increased which we attributed to higher evapotranspiration due to improved plant growth when treated with higher amounts of fertilizer compared with no fertilizer as reported by liu et al 2014 fertilization can significantly increase transpiration by plants but it has little effect on soil evaporation as reported by liu et al 2014 4 2 soil temperature compared with tfp rfrhs increased the soil temperature in the 5 25 cm previous studies also reported that mulching increases the soil temperature and promotes early seed germination and stand establishment dong et al 2009 mo et al 2017 plastic film mulching is recognized as an effective strategy for accelerating crop growth and development due to the improved soil thermal conditions especially in the early growth stages duan et al 2003 gan et al 2013 ren et al 2010 in the current study rfrhs significantly accelerated the growth of crops significantly shortened the growth period of millet especially the duration of nutrient growth under rfrhs however millet reproductive growth duration instead of shortening but extended by 0 2 days in crops such as maize the prolonged reproductive growth duration induced by mulching has been shown to be an efficient resource utilization strategy during which the crop can receive more solar energy resources and gain sufficient time to transfer dry matter and nutrients from the vegetative organs to the grain zhang et al 2019a these findings can provide references for crop breeding and model simulation in the current study in addition to rfrhs increasing the level of fertilization also realized the extension of reproductive growth duration of millet 4 3 yield and wue in the present study we found that the millet grain yield was generally significantly higher under rfrhs compared with tfp except in 2013 with high rainfall however we found that the millet grain yield in the 2013 season was lower under rfrhs than tfp at the ck l and m fertilizer levels which may be explained by the following two reasons first the effect of rfrhs on increasing the crop yield will be weakened gradually as the amount of rainfall increases and excessive soil moisture may have adverse effects such as respiratory inhibition in the crop roots ren et al 2010 in this study the amount of rainfall was 533 5 mm during the millet growth period in 2013 which was equivalent to 176 of the multi year average especially in july when excessive precipitation 267 3 mm i e 3 6 times the multi year average inhibited flowering and pollination thereby potentially resulting in the failure of grain filling according to our field observations with more rainfall the water requirement of millet probably can be met for tfp thus making rfrhs unnecessary second in this study in order to maintain the same population between the two planting patterns the planting intervals were 7 5 cm and 10 0 cm under rfrhs and tfp respectively thus intensive planting especially for the middle rows in the rfrhs planting furrows due to the reduced spacing with rfrhs may have led to increased group competition wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2019b according to our field observations the growth of millet in the middle rows of the planting furrows was weaker under rfrhs compared with tfp which may be another important reason for the weak effect of rfrhs on the yield increases compared with tfp in the current study we found that irrespective of the planting patterns increasing the fertilizer rate from l to h significantly increased the grain yield and hi during both growing seasons for foxtail millet in both years the h fertilizer treatment not significantly different from m gave the highest average grain yield under rfrhs and it was higher than that with ck this yield increase was attributed to the strong growth and development of individual plants under rfrhs which efficiently exploited the deeper soil water gao et al 2014 jia et al 2018 in addition the water availability with rfrhs tended to increase more as the fertilizer rate increased compared with tfp this improvement with rfrhs enhanced the ability of the fertilizer to increase the grain yield for crops li et al 2009a 2009b reported that abundant soil water can promote ammonia nitrogen nitrification and mass flow as well as the diffusion of nutrients and improve the effectiveness of nutrients especially nitrogen thereby affecting the absorption of nutrients by crops and the leaf assimilation capacity to ultimately affect the accumulation of dry matter and the crop yield however increasing the amount of fertilizer above the m level did not have any significant effect in a normal rainfall year such as 2014 thereby indicating that the crop productivity will not continue to increase when the chemical nutrient inputs exceed a threshold value li et al 2009a 2009b rfrhs increased the wue in both growing seasons especially in the plots treated with the m level of fertilizer as demonstrated by the higher millet grain yield physiologically the high wue with mulching was mainly due to reduced soil evaporation and enhanced plant transpiration li et al 2015 thereby producing a highly efficient evapotranspiration structure with increases in the photosynthetic rate and dry matter accumulation albrizio et al 2010 fereres and soriano 2007 hou et al 2015 in the current study it was found that the enhanced performance of rfrhs was closely related to the optimal utilization of water resources the wcsh in rfrhs was significantly lower compared with tfp in the wet year 2013 but higher in the drought year 2014 this was mainly because rfrhs had opposite effects on the yield under different water conditions which can be used to assess the likely effects of rfrhs on productivity and its applicability when the amount of water is limited mulched crops exhibit faster canopy growth with greater transpiration which may eventually offset the improvements to swc provided by mulching especially during the water demand sensitive period i e vegetative growth this mechanism allows plastic film mulching to improve the efficient utilization of water to improve crop yields and the wue when water is limited however this not always the case when water is abundant because the growth of crops is not limited by water so the ability of plastic film mulching to increase the yield would be significantly lower and the crop yields may even be reduced compared with no mulching as shown by ren et al 2010 in addition our results indicate that increasing the fertilization rate had a strong positive impact on the wue mainly because the rate of increase in the crop yield obtained by fertilization was much higher than that of the water consumed li et al 2015 similarly the wue exhibited a threshold effect in terms of the response to the fertilization level because changing the fertilizer amount from m to h did not significantly increase the wue thus the overuse of fertilizer did not improve the grain yield further and the wue could not be enhanced beyond the threshold level a similar trend was found in the analysis of economic benefits although rfrhs and fertilization increased input costs they still showed a trend of increasing economic benefits but because of the threshold effect m drought years and h wet years were generally the best 4 4 contributions of water and nutrients to the yield under rfrhs and their interaction we found that cultivation management including planting and fertilization contributed to foxtail millet yield formation to a great extent 25 1 45 7 but it was interesting that fertilizer made the highest contribution among the three factors comprising planting fertilizer and their interaction therefore n p2o5 chemical fertilizer may be a rapid and efficient stimulatory treatment and it could even be more efficient than rfrhs in some semiarid areas such as the study region however the capacity of the method was clearly limited as shown by the unimodal curve when the fertilizer amount increased with no further significant increase in the contribution to the grain yield above the m fertilizer level the effects on the grain yield increases due to rfrhs were variable in our study where they were determined significantly by the amount of rainfall in addition we found that the h fertilizer level tended to have a positive effect on the yield with more rainfall but the l fertilizer level with less rainfall thus the main limiting factor was water with less rainfall but nutrients with sufficient rainfall where there was a strong positive effect with a relatively low amount of fertilizer in the drought year but with a relatively high amount in the wet year rufat et al 2011 wang et al 1999 5 conclusion in the present study the higher water content and temperature regulation with rfrhs stimulated stable seedling establishment and vigorous crop growth fertilization increased the absorption of water by millet and thus the wue and grain yield increased significantly with the amount of fertilizer however the effect of fertilizer was more obvious under rfrhs compared with tfp thereby indicating a positive interaction between water and fertilization therefore we recommend rfrhs as a suitable pattern for optimizing water use with fertilizer application at n 180 p2o5 120 kg ha 1 as a promising strategy for improving the yield and wue in foxtail millet in semiarid regions in a year with more rainfall a higher fertilizer rate n 270 p2o5 180 kg ha 1 can increase the yield and wue more research is needed to clarify the appropriate rainfall range for rfrhs when planting foxtail millet in dryland farming areas declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by the high technology research and development program

10828,effects on the soil water and foxtail millet yield of different fertilizer rates coupled with the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system rfrhs are unclear which could guide improvements to productivity in dryland farming we conducted field experiments using rfrhs and traditional flat planting tfp at four different fertilizer rates i no fertilizer ck ii low l n 90 p2o5 60 kg ha 1 iii medium m n 180 p2o5 120 kg ha 1 and iv high h n 270 p2o5 180 kg ha 1 rfrhs significantly improved the topsoil water content by 4 7 8 5 in 0 40 cm layer and topsoil temperature by 0 4 0 7 c which stimulated stable seedling establishment and accelerated millet growth fertilization significantly enhanced water absorption in 0 140 cm profile prolonged the growth period of millet and significantly increased dry matter accumulation finally under rfrhs the grain yield and water use efficiency wue of foxtail millet increased by 6 2 and 6 7 respectively compared with tfp and they tended to increase more as fertilizer rate increases indicating a positive interaction between water and nutrients however under rfrhs the m fertilizer rate obtained a higher yield average 6748 6 kg ha 1 wue average 18 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 compared with ck and l rates and made a greater contribution to the grain yield average 32 1 but no further significant increases were observed with the h fertilizer rate where rfrfs showed a tendency to decrease grain yield compared to tfp in wet years therefore rfrhs with fertilizer application at a rate of n 180 p2o5 120 kg ha 1 may be suitable for high efficiency farming management to improve the yield and wue for foxtail millet in this semiarid region keywords plastic mulching fertilization water use soil temperature yield contribution 1 introduction china is one of the largest agricultural countries throughout the world with approximately 140 million ha of agricultural land and more than half 52 5 is employed for dryland farming including the arid and semiarid areas of the northwestern loess plateau liu et al 2015 water scarcity and nutrient deficiencies are the two main limiting factors that constrain stabilized agricultural productivity and potential crop yields in dryland farming systems li et al 2009a 2009b precipitation is the major source of water for crop production in these regions but limited and erratic precipitation threatens crop productivity and sustainability where it often results in lower grain yields and even the total failure of crops moreover inadequate soil moisture reduces the nutrient uptake efficiency and it is another major cause of low crop yields li et al 2009a 2009b zaongo et al 1997 therefore it is important to maximize the soil water storage sws and efficiently utilize the limited rain to facilitate higher crop productivity in semiarid regions gan et al 2013 wen et al 2012 in dryland farming systems the use of efficient precipitation exploitation technology is critically important for improving the effective utilization of water and the uptake of nutrients li et al 2016 nagaz et al 2009 seghatoleslami et al 2008 several strategies have been developed for rain harvesting in semiarid agro ecosystems where they can capture and utilize rain for irrigation directing water to the plant root zone and for household use gan et al 2013 one of the most innovative strategies is a combination of the ridge furrow system with plastic mulch film rfrhs in the field as a highly effective strategy li et al 2000 rfrhs is a rainfall harvesting system with two components comprising ridges rainfall harvesting zone and furrows planting zone the ridges in the field alternate with the corresponding furrows the crops are planted in the furrows whereas the ridges are covered with plastic film and they are kept free of planting for harvesting rainwater li et al 2000 ren et al 2016 previous studies have shown that this system can enhance the soil moisture levels by reducing the rate of soil evaporation while the rainwater is collecting by runoff from the ridges into the furrows thereby leading to deep soil water infiltration and reduced water loss which increases the yields of cereal crops especially in semiarid areas gan et al 2013 in addition to water availability nutrients are essential for promoting crop growth and productivity in rainfed agriculture however the increases in crop yields are not due only to the nutrients themselves because their interactions with soil moisture ensure the availability and translocation of nutrients li et al 2009a 2009b optimal supplies of water and nutrients can improve the canopy growth and photosynthetic efficiency and thus the crop yield teixeira et al 2014 this is because adequate water can improve the availability of soil nutrients especially nitrogen thereby increasing the absorption and utilization of soil nutrients and the availability of adequate nutrients can effectively increase the amount of soil water accessible to crops by promoting root growth thus these two soil properties are the most important environmental factors that affect the crop assimilation process by increasing stomatal conductance and the photosynthetic activity in semiarid regions hou et al 2015 li et al 2009a 2009b previous studies have also demonstrated the effect of the strong interaction between the available soil water and fertilizer on crop yields li et al 2009a 2009b zaongo et al 1997 when the soil water supply is limited crop production remains at a low level and exhibits little response to nitrogen fertilizer at any rate whereas crop production improves greatly when sufficient soil water is provided and the linear regression slope between the yield and amount of water increases with the nitrogen application rate smika et al 1965 reasonable nutrient management is essential for enhancing crop productivity and maintaining the ecological balance at present it is generally recognized that after the amount of fertilizer applied exceeds a threshold the yield will no longer increase significantly and many adverse environmental problems may occur such as n accumulating in the soil which can degrade the quality of ground and surface water resources as well as leading to eutrophication and affecting non potable water supplies barton and colmer 2006 chen et al 2014 the strategic optimization of nutrients and the water supply are highly significant for maintaining a high water use efficiency wue and sustainable crop yields in semiarid areas therefore the effects of combining rfrhs with the optimum application of fertilizer in semiarid regions are of great interest previous studies mainly investigated the implementation of rfrhs alone to facilitate efficient water use by conserving precipitation water via adjustments to the ridge furrow ratio and the use of different mulching materials such as plastic film straw gravel and grass cover gan et al 2013 li et al 2013 ren et al 2016 wang et al 2015 however the enhancement of dryland farming and increasing the grain yield also requires optimizing the application of fertilizer and its interaction with the availability of water few studies have focused on the effects of rfrhs combined with different n p2o5 fertilizer application rates on the grain yield and wue of foxtail millet and the yield contribution analysis therefore the objectives of the present study were as follows 1 to investigate the effects of rfrhs combined with different n p2o5 fertilizer rates on soil water and temperature and millet growth 2 to assess the contribution of different factor rfrhs fertilizer interaction between rfrhs and fertilizer to the yield in millet and 3 to identify an optimized adaptive agronomic management strategy for millet yield and synergistic utilization of water and nutrients in the semiarid region studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted for 2 years during 2013 and 2014 at the dryland farming experimental station of northwest a f university located in chengyang town pengyang county ningxia hui autonomous region 35 52 n 106 46 e 1695 m above sea level in northwestern china the climatic conditions at the experimental site were typical for the loess plateau region with hilly topography where they were characterized as semiarid with a warm temperate climate the average annual temperature was 6 1 c with an average rainfall of 410 mm over the last 40 years the amounts of rainfall during the foxtail millet growing period were 533 5 mm in 2013 wet year and 294 6 mm in 2014 drought year as shown in fig 1 the soil was classified as loess orthic entisols fao 2002 the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil are shown in table 1 the site was used to produce spring maize prior to the experiment irrigation was not provided during the experiment 2 2 experimental design and procedure the experimental study was conducted using a randomized complete block design where each treatment had three replicates in both years and each plot covered an area of 32 4 m2 6 0 5 4 m the field experiments tested two planting patterns comprising i rfrhs and ii the traditional flat planting pattern tfp fig 2 with four different fertilizer rates i control ck no fertilizer ii low l n 90 60 p2o5 kg ha 1 iii medium m n 180 p2o5 120 kg ha 1 and high h n 270 p2o5 180 kg ha 1 thereby comprising a total of eight treatment combinations rh rm rl and rck are four treatment combinations with rfrhs and four different amounts of fertilizer th tm tl and tck are four treatment combinations with tfp and four different amounts of fertilizer ten days before sowing das alternative ridges and furrows were constructed for rfrhs where the ridges were covered by polythene plastic film with a thickness of 0 008 mm fig 2 at the junction of ridges and furrows a small groove 5 cm deep was dug where the edge of the film was placed and then covered with soil to fix the film the chemical fertilizers comprised urea n 46 0 and diammonium phosphate n 18 0 p2o5 46 0 were manually applied to the plots furrows under the rfrhs and throughout the whole plot under tfp then the fertilizer is evenly distributed in 0 20 cm soil by tillage to minimize the impact of the treatments each plot was separated by a border with a width of 60 cm the foxtail millet cv zhangzagu 3 seeds were sown at a rate of 22 5 kg ha 1 on april 20 2013 and april 30 2014 at the 4th leaf stage a planting density of 333 000 plants ha 1 was maintained during both years and this was controlled by strict row spacing and plant spacing which were 30 60 cm and 7 5 cm in rfrhs respectively and 30 cm and 10 0 cm in tfp respectively fig 2 the foxtail millet was harvested on september 14 2013 and september 25 2014 no irrigation was provided throughout the growing season and manual weeding was undertaken if needed 2 3 sampling and calculations 2 3 1 soil water the soil gravimetric water content swc was determined periodically at a soil depth of 0 200 cm with intervals of 20 cm 0 20 cm with intervals of 10 cm in the sowing 0 das seedling about 30 das jointing about 60 das heading about 90 das filling about 120 das and maturity stages about 150 das for millet during 2013 and 2014 from each plot three random core samples were collected using a hand held soil ferric auger and the values were averaged for the rfrhs treatments the samples were collected from the middles of the ridges and furrows and the sides of the furrows for the tfp treatments soil cores were sampled between two rows the soil samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h sws mm was calculated using the following equation s w s s w c œÅ b s d where swc is the soil gravimetric water content œÅ b g cm 3 is the soil bulk density and sd mm is the soil depth rainfall was the only water source for crop growth during each growing season the plots were surrounded by ridges to prevent the runoff of rainfall water therefore the water consumption amount wc mm was calculated as li et al 2013 w c Œ¥ s w s p where Œ¥sws mm is the difference in sws between the beginning and the end of the period and p mm is the amount of precipitation during the period 2 3 2 soil temperature the soil temperature oc was measured in the seedling jointing heading and filling stages for millet by adjusting a set of mercury geothermometers hongxing thermal instrument china between two rows the edge row and the middle row for rfrhs for each treatment at soil depths of 5 15 and 25 cm the soil temperature was determined at 08 00 h 10 00 h 12 00 h 14 00 h 16 00 h 18 00 h and 20 00 h each day during the daytime every measurement was the mean of three daily readings 2 3 3 plant dry matter accumulation plant dry matter accumulation g plant 1 was determined in the seedling jointing heading filling and maturity stages for millet where three plants were randomly selected in each plot and cut at ground level the sampled plants were oven dried initially at 105 c for 30 min followed by 75 c for 24 h 2 3 4 grain yield biomass yield and harvest index hi at physiological maturity three quadrats were harvested to determine the yield from each plot where an area of 3 6 m2 was manually harvested in each quadrat and the grain yield and plant biomass were determined at a moisture content of 14 hi was determined as the ratio of the grain yield relative to the biomass yield 2 3 5 water use efficiency wue wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following equations li et al 2013 w u e g y w c where gy kg ha 1 is the grain yield and wc mm is the amount of water consumed during the whole millet growing season 2 3 6 contributions of different factors to the grain yield we studied the quantitative effects of four factors comprising the initial soil substrates rfrhs fertilizer treatment levels l m and h levels and the interaction between rfrhs and fertilizer on the grain yield where the tck treatment was the baseline the contributions of these four factors to the foxtail millet grain yield were calculated according to ma et al 2009 and zhang et al 2003 as follows c o n t r i b u t i o n o f b a s e l i n e c 0 t c k g

each sampling event were analyzed separately duncan s test was used to detect differences among means for treatments at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water there were obvious differences in soil moisture among the treatments table 2 fig 3 compared with tfp rfrhs significantly increased the swc in the 0 40 cm soil layer by averages of 8 5 in 2013 wet year and 4 7 in 2014 drought year the swc in the 40 140 cm layer tended to be more variable under rfrhs compared with tfp during the growing seasons in both years the swc increased by an average of 5 0 in 2013 but due to the lower amount of rainfall in 2014 rfrhs did not have a consistent effect during the millet growing season and the swc even declined by 6 6 in the heading stage in addition we found that rfrhs had minimal effects on swc in the 140 200 cm soil profile fertilizer significantly increased the absorption of soil water by millet where there was a gradual decrease in soil water as the fertilizer application rate increased especially from the jointing to maturity stages table 2 and fig 3 the increased application of fertilizer amount enhanced the absorption of water in the 0 140 cm layer especially in the wet year 2013 and it was enhanced in the 40 140 cm layer during the drought year 2014 3 2 soil temperature as shown in fig 4 the soil temperature was increased by rfrhs but no significant differences were observed among the fertilizer treatments on average rfrhs increased the soil temperature by 0 4 0 4 0 5 and 0 7 c in the seedling jointing heading and filling stages respectively across the two growing seasons compared with tfp 3 3 millet growth and development process compared with tfp rfrhs shortened the growth period of millet by 3 4 days fig 5 meanwhile rfrhs resulted in earlier millet growth by 1 days to emergency 2 days to seedling 4 days to jointing 4 days to heading and 4 days to filling respectively across the two growing seasons in contrast fertilization extended the growth period of millet by 1 2 days among all treatments th treatment had the longest growth period average 142 days and rck had the shortest growth period average 137 days in addition it was found that rfrhs shortened the vegetative growth duration by 4 5 days but extended the reproductive growth duration by 0 2 days 3 4 dry matter accumulation the dynamic accumulation of dry matter improved significantly under rfrhs and fertilizer application during both growing seasons as shown in fig 6 the effects of the planting patterns on the maximum dry matter accumulation in the two years did not differ significantly however the accumulation of dry matter by foxtail millet was much faster in the rfrhs treatments than tfp at the same fertilizer application rate from the sowing to heading stages under fertilization the maximum and rate of dry matter accumulation increased gradually with the amount of fertilizer where the greatest dry biomass was achieved with the h level but it did not differ significantly from that with the m level in the drought year of 2014 3 5 yield as shown in table 3 both the planting patterns and fertilizer levels significantly affected the yield and water use by millet where the effects differed between years in 2013 no significant difference was observed between the two planting patterns except for a 5 4 increase with the h level table 4 but there was a significant increase of 3 9 12 0 from the n 0 270 kg ha 1 p2o5 0 180 kg ha 1 application rate under rfrhs compared with tfp in 2014 in addition the yield generally tended to increase with the amount of fertilizer ranging from 3584 3 to 7075 9 kg ha 1 in 2013 and from 5231 2 to 7394 5 kg ha 1 in 2014 and the increase was significant when the fertilizer rate exceeded m level in 2013 but not in 2014 thereby leading to significantly different dose response relationships for the grain yield and fertilizer application rate with different cropping patterns fig 7 the response appeared to be more positive the grain yield increased more rapidly under rfrhs than tfp as the amount of fertilizer increased in both years under tfp the maximum grain yields were obtained by n application at 295 and 261 kg ha 1 in 2013 and 2014 respectively and the corresponding grain yields were 6729 and 7146 kg ha 1 however higher grain yields were achieved under rfrhs with the application of 573 and 214 kg n with yields of 8421 and 7482 kg ha 1 respectively thus rfrhs strongly enhanced the effects of the fertilizer to increase the crop grain yield which indicated a strong interaction between water and nutrients in addition rfrhs significantly increased the hi for millet compared with tfp in both years compared with tfp rhrfs increased input costs in millet production with an average range of 420 yuan ha 1 table 4 however due to the more powerful effect of grain yield the economic benefit of millet was more consistent with the trend of grain yield in 2013 rfrhs only showed an increase in economic benefit at the h high fertilizer level compared with tfp with a range of 1861 yuan ha 1 and a decrease at the ck l level of 935 2666 yuan ha 1 in 2014 rfrhs showed general higher economic benefits than tfp at the four fertilization levels and the ranges at h m l and ck fertilizer levels were 1320 1377 4138 and 1828 yuan ha 1 respectively 3 6 water consumption wc and water use efficiency wue the wc amount was strongly influenced by rainfall and the treatments both years table 5 and fig 8 overall rfrhs significantly reduced the wc in the wet year and there was a similar level in the wc in the dry year compared with tfp table 5 furthermore compared with tfp rfrhs reduced the water consumption from the seeding to heading stage wcsh in the wet year 2013 but it increased in the drought year 2014 fig 8 fertilization significantly increased the wc in both years under the two planting patterns thereby indicating the positive effect of fertilizer application on water uptake the wue increased significantly with the amount of fertilizer and the highest wue was achieved by the rfrhs h and m treatments in 2013 and 2014 respectively table 5 moreover the rfrhs tended to increase the wue more with the fertilizer rate compared tfp which was similar to the relationship between the grain yield and fertilizer application rate fig 9 the highest wue values using tfp were obtained with 276 and 199 kg ha 1 n application i e 12 6 in 2013 and 22 8 in 2014 respectively however under rfrhs the highest wue values were 29 4 and 25 2 with 418 and 199 kg ha 1 n application respectively 3 7 analysis of the contributions of different factors rfrhs cr fertilizer cf and interaction between planting and fertilizer crf to the foxtail millet grain yield under rfrhs the analysis of the contributions of different factors table 6 showed that planting combined with fertilizer greatly increased the foxtail millet grain yield at a rate of 25 1 45 7 three factors were responsible for this increase —ñ the rfrhs planting factor cr —ñ—ñ the fertilizer factor cf and —ñ—ñ—ñ the interaction between planting and fertilizer crf we found that cf made the highest contribution among these three factors where the contribution from fertilizer increased significantly as the amount of fertilizer increased in both years but no further increase occurred after exceeding the m fertilizer level which achieved increases of 2433 7 and 1807 3 kg ha 1 and rates of 39 4 and 24 7 in 2013 and 2014 with the m treatment under rfrhs respectively however the planting factor had variable effects on the grain yield with a negative effect 3 5 5 1 in 2013 and a positive effect 5 6 5 9 in 2014 compared with tfp in contrast to the fertilizer factor as the amount of fertilizer increased under rfrhs crf also increased and the highest value was achieved with the h level in 2013 but the l level in 2014 3 8 correlation analysis based on the yield water consumption wc and water use efficiency wue for foxtail millet correlation analysis showed that millet grain yield was significantly and positively related to the total wc during the growing season especially during the growth period from the sowing to heading stages wcsh table 7 rfrhs ensured that the water supply was adequate during the early growth stages for foxtail millet the availability of an adequate and enhanced water supply contributed to greater biomass accumulation but it also increased the wue and grain yield wue was significantly and positive correlated with the yield and strongly correlated with the wcsh but it was not significantly related to the total wc these findings suggest that the key factors responsible for obtaining a high yield and wue in foxtail millet are the water supply and distribution during the growth stage rather than increasing the total wc during the whole growth period 4 discussion 4 1 soil water previous studies have demonstrated that plastic film mulching is better for utilizing light and heavy rain by efficiently harvesting rainwater from the ridges thereby improving the availability of water to plants compared with no mulching gan et al 2013 similarly in the present study rfrhs maintained higher sws levels compared with tfp in both experimental years 2013 2014 especially in the 0 140 cm soil layer fig 3 in particular the increase in sws was more prominent in the early growth stages during both years but the sws declined dramatically subsequently especially in the heading stage during 2014 which was the drought year this may have been related to the more vigorous crop growth under rfrhs than tfp zhang et al 2019a consequently the additional retained moisture used during vigorous plant growth resulted in similar or equal sws levels under rfrhs and tfp and in the later stages the soil moisture could be less under rfrhs than tfp previous studies also identified this phenomenon and suggested that it is a highly effective water conditioning strategy where the mulched crop can absorb deep water to avoid drought stress jia et al 2018 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b in the present study soil moisture decreased significantly as the amount of fertilizer increased which we attributed to higher evapotranspiration due to improved plant growth when treated with higher amounts of fertilizer compared with no fertilizer as reported by liu et al 2014 fertilization can significantly increase transpiration by plants but it has little effect on soil evaporation as reported by liu et al 2014 4 2 soil temperature compared with tfp rfrhs increased the soil temperature in the 5 25 cm previous studies also reported that mulching increases the soil temperature and promotes early seed germination and stand establishment dong et al 2009 mo et al 2017 plastic film mulching is recognized as an effective strategy for accelerating crop growth and development due to the improved soil thermal conditions especially in the early growth stages duan et al 2003 gan et al 2013 ren et al 2010 in the current study rfrhs significantly accelerated the growth of crops significantly shortened the growth period of millet especially the duration of nutrient growth under rfrhs however millet reproductive growth duration instead of shortening but extended by 0 2 days in crops such as maize the prolonged reproductive growth duration induced by mulching has been shown to be an efficient resource utilization strategy during which the crop can receive more solar energy resources and gain sufficient time to transfer dry matter and nutrients from the vegetative organs to the grain zhang et al 2019a these findings can provide references for crop breeding and model simulation in the current study in addition to rfrhs increasing the level of fertilization also realized the extension of reproductive growth duration of millet 4 3 yield and wue in the present study we found that the millet grain yield was generally significantly higher under rfrhs compared with tfp except in 2013 with high rainfall however we found that the millet grain yield in the 2013 season was lower under rfrhs than tfp at the ck l and m fertilizer levels which may be explained by the following two reasons first the effect of rfrhs on increasing the crop yield will be weakened gradually as the amount of rainfall increases and excessive soil moisture may have adverse effects such as respiratory inhibition in the crop roots ren et al 2010 in this study the amount of rainfall was 533 5 mm during the millet growth period in 2013 which was equivalent to 176 of the multi year average especially in july when excessive precipitation 267 3 mm i e 3 6 times the multi year average inhibited flowering and pollination thereby potentially resulting in the failure of grain filling according to our field observations with more rainfall the water requirement of millet probably can be met for tfp thus making rfrhs unnecessary second in this study in order to maintain the same population between the two planting patterns the planting intervals were 7 5 cm and 10 0 cm under rfrhs and tfp respectively thus intensive planting especially for the middle rows in the rfrhs planting furrows due to the reduced spacing with rfrhs may have led to increased group competition wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2019b according to our field observations the growth of millet in the middle rows of the planting furrows was weaker under rfrhs compared with tfp which may be another important reason for the weak effect of rfrhs on the yield increases compared with tfp in the current study we found that irrespective of the planting patterns increasing the fertilizer rate from l to h significantly increased the grain yield and hi during both growing seasons for foxtail millet in both years the h fertilizer treatment not significantly different from m gave the highest average grain yield under rfrhs and it was higher than that with ck this yield increase was attributed to the strong growth and development of individual plants under rfrhs which efficiently exploited the deeper soil water gao et al 2014 jia et al 2018 in addition the water availability with rfrhs tended to increase more as the fertilizer rate increased compared with tfp this improvement with rfrhs enhanced the ability of the fertilizer to increase the grain yield for crops li et al 2009a 2009b reported that abundant soil water can promote ammonia nitrogen nitrification and mass flow as well as the diffusion of nutrients and improve the effectiveness of nutrients especially nitrogen thereby affecting the absorption of nutrients by crops and the leaf assimilation capacity to ultimately affect the accumulation of dry matter and the crop yield however increasing the amount of fertilizer above the m level did not have any significant effect in a normal rainfall year such as 2014 thereby indicating that the crop productivity will not continue to increase when the chemical nutrient inputs exceed a threshold value li et al 2009a 2009b rfrhs increased the wue in both growing seasons especially in the plots treated with the m level of fertilizer as demonstrated by the higher millet grain yield physiologically the high wue with mulching was mainly due to reduced soil evaporation and enhanced plant transpiration li et al 2015 thereby producing a highly efficient evapotranspiration structure with increases in the photosynthetic rate and dry matter accumulation albrizio et al 2010 fereres and soriano 2007 hou et al 2015 in the current study it was found that the enhanced performance of rfrhs was closely related to the optimal utilization of water resources the wcsh in rfrhs was significantly lower compared with tfp in the wet year 2013 but higher in the drought year 2014 this was mainly because rfrhs had opposite effects on the yield under different water conditions which can be used to assess the likely effects of rfrhs on productivity and its applicability when the amount of water is limited mulched crops exhibit faster canopy growth with greater transpiration which may eventually offset the improvements to swc provided by mulching especially during the water demand sensitive period i e vegetative growth this mechanism allows plastic film mulching to improve the efficient utilization of water to improve crop yields and the wue when water is limited however this not always the case when water is abundant because the growth of crops is not limited by water so the ability of plastic film mulching to increase the yield would be significantly lower and the crop yields may even be reduced compared with no mulching as shown by ren et al 2010 in addition our results indicate that increasing the fertilization rate had a strong positive impact on the wue mainly because the rate of increase in the crop yield obtained by fertilization was much higher than that of the water consumed li et al 2015 similarly the wue exhibited a threshold effect in terms of the response to the fertilization level because changing the fertilizer amount from m to h did not significantly increase the wue thus the overuse of fertilizer did not improve the grain yield further and the wue could not be enhanced beyond the threshold level a similar trend was found in the analysis of economic benefits although rfrhs and fertilization increased input costs they still showed a trend of increasing economic benefits but because of the threshold effect m drought years and h wet years were generally the best 4 4 contributions of water and nutrients to the yield under rfrhs and their interaction we found that cultivation management including planting and fertilization contributed to foxtail millet yield formation to a great extent 25 1 45 7 but it was interesting that fertilizer made the highest contribution among the three factors comprising planting fertilizer and their interaction therefore n p2o5 chemical fertilizer may be a rapid and efficient stimulatory treatment and it could even be more efficient than rfrhs in some semiarid areas such as the study region however the capacity of the method was clearly limited as shown by the unimodal curve when the fertilizer amount increased with no further significant increase in the contribution to the grain yield above the m fertilizer level the effects on the grain yield increases due to rfrhs were variable in our study where they were determined significantly by the amount of rainfall in addition we found that the h fertilizer level tended to have a positive effect on the yield with more rainfall but the l fertilizer level with less rainfall thus the main limiting factor was water with less rainfall but nutrients with sufficient rainfall where there was a strong positive effect with a relatively low amount of fertilizer in the drought year but with a relatively high amount in the wet year rufat et al 2011 wang et al 1999 5 conclusion in the present study the higher water content and temperature regulation with rfrhs stimulated stable seedling establishment and vigorous crop growth fertilization increased the absorption of water by millet and thus the wue and grain yield increased significantly with the amount of fertilizer however the effect of fertilizer was more obvious under rfrhs compared with tfp thereby indicating a positive interaction between water and fertilization therefore we recommend rfrhs as a suitable pattern for optimizing water use with fertilizer application at n 180 p2o5 120 kg ha 1 as a promising strategy for improving the yield and wue in foxtail millet in semiarid regions in a year with more rainfall a higher fertilizer rate n 270 p2o5 180 kg ha 1 can increase the yield and wue more research is needed to clarify the appropriate rainfall range for rfrhs when planting foxtail millet in dryland farming areas declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by the high technology research and development program

nor dryland conditions though these are common crop water management practices in northwest kansas kisekka and aguilar 2016 others full irrigation is likely to increase et as compared to deficit irrigation but current structure of baitsss provided critical information about crop water requirements based on vegetation indices and growth stages irrigation was simulated for all pixels based on irrigation rules that maintained a management allowable depletion mad fraction of available soil water storage capacity we assumed irrigation was applied to the surface layer and infiltrated into the root zone to mimic the behavior of sprinkler irrigation which is common in this region lilienfeld and asmild 2007 we assumed rooting depth as 1000 mm and a mad fraction of 0 5 based on kansched clark et al 2000 guidelines for all crops and growth stages inside the study area the adopted mad value partially delays irrigation developing a framework of deficit irrigation the current study doesn t differentiate mad and rooting zone for each field and crop as well as albedo because such information is not readily available for all fields the rooting depth and mad may vary among the crops growth stages and may influence the timing of irrigation however final et is less likely to be affected in full irrigated treatment dhungel et al 2019b the maximum application of irrigation water was limited to 40 mm in a single event as adapted previously by eheart and tornil 1999 if the deficit in soil moisture is not fulfilled by 40 mm and soil moisture is still below Œ∏t the rest will be applied in the next time step even in fully irrigated lands the irrigation rules actually used by farmers are likely to differ from those assumed here 2 3 study area and data the study area was located in

irrigation amount was applied during this period of time we recognize that applications could occur prior to planting or after harvest within the calendar year other crops were also present in the agricultural landscape with differing onsets and durations of the growing seasons calculating the seasonal et of other crops would require information about their respective growing seasons which likely differ from that expected for irrigated corn production farm reported data revealed that corn soybean wheat grain sorghum sunflower barley oats and combinations of these crops e g under split

with arbitrary index values and used to extract simulated mean et values from baitsss output presented in section 3 3 the wrmu were consistent with the boundary of the center pivot sprinkler systems water distribution within these water right units are not explicitly known though in some cases split pivot management can be inferred from landsat imagery 2 4 satellite soil and surface climate data landsat 7 l7 and 8 l8 path 31 and row 33 images were utilized to provide the information required to calculate vegetative indices table 1 inference of daily canopy formation was provided by linear

irrigating around june 15th as per the field the maximum daily precipitation was 55 mm in the year 2014 table 2 shows the annual mean and cumulative values of these variables the standard deviation sd and skew provide a measure of the yearly variability of these variables the sd and skew were in general similar indicating the consistency of these variables among the years table 2 the skew of qa ta lai ndvi and Œ∏sur showed negative signs indicating infrequent periods with smaller values typically at the start of grown season compared to the maturity table 2 fig 4 a detailed discussion of baitsss was presented previously for a fully irrigated corn field at a lysimeter site near bushland tx evett et al 2016 for the year 2016 dhungel et al 2019b 2019a this study adopts a similar set up and assumptions to the bushland study using gridded nldas and landsat based vegetation indices we hypothesized the behavior and capability of the model should be comparable to that at bushland within a similar environment further it is expected the variations in vegetation indices should help account for differences between this study that has several different crops and the bushland study with only corn bushland results dhungel et al 2019b 2019a with corn indicated that baitsss was able to estimate seasonal cumulative et relatively accurately with 4 positive bias and daily and hourly rmse of 0 85 mm and 0 10 mm r2 0 9 for both daily and hourly the comparison of baitsss with the lysimeter with sorghum also indicated high accuracy with daily rmse 0 80 r2 0 87 at bushland tx working manuscript however when gridded data nldas weather data and landsat based vegetation indices were used the accuracy was reduced i e bias of seasonal cumulative et increased up to 13 positive and rmse increased in both daily and hourly scale with 1 64 mm d 1 and 0 14 mm h 1 r2 0 74 daily and 0 81 hourly respectively for corn the study concluded that increase in the positive bias in et modeling from gridded data was due to larger uz rs warmer ta and smaller actual vapor pressure ea dhungel et al 2019b furthermore smaller lai from remote sensing contributed to a negative bias in et modeling and vice versa fig 6 a and 6c show the simulated seasonal cumulative et simulated irr and p of the corn and fig 6d and 6f of soybean the largest et was observed in 2015 857 mm fig 6d and the smallest occurred in 2016 746 mm fig 6a table 2 the largest p was 481 mm 2014 fig 6e coincided with the smallest irr of 280 mm 2014 fig 6f the large vegetation indices during the early and mid season in 2015 likely contributed to the larger seasonal cumulative et of that year the p in 2015 was least among years 259 mm fig 6e corresponding with largest simulated irr for that year 560 mm fig 6f in practice irrigation applications typically ended prior to crop maturity around the first week of september typically for corn as observed in bushland tx dhungel et al 2019b however the irrigation sub model in baitsss didn t implement these local practices and irrigation was applied throughout the simulation period possibly leading to overestimations relative to actual applications 3 2 landscape cumulative et analysis cumulative et as simulated over the agricultural landscape is compared with farm reported irr and crops for the 2013 2017 growing seasons seasonal cumulative et simulated values are shown for twp 9s 41 w figs 7 a e and sd 6 fig 7f j these maps of cumulative et illustrate spatial differences in the expected seasonal water use of well watered crops at the landscape scale simulation et values ranged from 220 to 980 mm despite the assumption of full irrigations i e mad fraction of 0 5 with similar environmental conditions variations in et within a given year were primarily controlled by variations in vegetation indices weather conditions likely contributed to variability in simulated et among years operationally in the baitsss algorithm increased ndvi is linked to increasing lai non linear and canopy fraction fc linear the jarvis function for canopy resistance rsc results in a smaller rsc and increased t with increasing lai the fc parameter indicates the relative contribution of ess and t to et with small fc increasing the contribution of the ess components a maximum lai value of 6 m2 m 2 corresponded to a maximum ndvi value of 0 90 in this study not shown the minimum values of et appear to represent non cropped areas where small ndvi should correspond with small fc small lai large rsc and large contribution of ess to et under these conditions et would primarily be influenced by p as irrigation would not be triggered by depletion of water retained in the root zone soil layer other factors affecting spatial variation in et could include undetected cloud cover and inconsistency in interpolated landsat 7 stripes fig 8 shows a magnified section of the sampled wrmu where the distribution of irrigation water is not known we suggested two of many possible spatial distribution patterns as interpretations figs 8 are consistent with six center pivot sprinkler systems representing wrmu cumulative et for the lower left and lower center wrmu fig 8a exhibit limited within field variation consistent with uniform water distribution in contrast et for the remaining units appears to display a bi model distribution split approximately halfway through the wrmu klocke et al 2006 described the split pivot strategy for optimizing the use of a limited water supply e g with a portion of the field receiving full irrigation and the remainder receiving limited or no irrigation simulated mean et values in these wrmu tended to range between 600 mm 800 mm to understand these variabilities we sampled vegetation indices lai and ndvi for the year 2013 results indicated that some crops are late planted upper left two center pivots fig 8a which may be one of the factors affecting final et within wrmu section 3 3 presents the overall statistics within the wrmu based on the limited field observation data 3 3 within water right evaluation in this section within wrmu cumulative water et p and irr at sd 6 and twp 9s 41 w are presented a detailed analysis was conducted of sd 6 because of larger sample size and the overall results were representative of twp 9s 41 w 3 3 1 sd 6 lema reported crop distributions indicated that 75 of the wrmu was planted to a single crop corn 58 soybean 9 grain sorghum 3 wheat 3 sunflower 2 when averaged over the five year period the remaining 25 of wrmu area was planted to two crops corn soybean 15 corn grain sorghum 5 corn wheat 4 chi square analysis indicated that in 2017 the distribution of crops among wrmu in 2017 was different from the five year average with fewer fields containing multiple crops 82 of wrmu being planted to a single crop corn 66 soybean 16 grain sorghum 1 and only 18 planted to two crops corn soybean 12 corn wheat 4 corn grain sorghum 3 in 2017 the final year of the five year lema farmers knew their remaining water allocations based on reported use in the prior four years this may have affected the shift in crop allocations analysis of variance indicated that reported applied irrigation amounts differed among years and crops with some interacting effects for corn greatest irrigation occurred in 2013 and 2014 and the least in 2017 reported irrigation volume applied to corn exceeded that reported for other crops with exceptions of equivalent amounts for soybean in 2015 2016 and 2017 corn soybean in 2014 corn grain sorghum in 2015 and corn wheat in 2014 and 2015 during the 2013 2017 growing seasons reported irrigation volume applied to corn in the sd 6 lema 210 305 mm was consistently less than simulated irr values of 350 529 mm table 3 this difference could indicate a positive bias in simulated irrigation requirements applied irrigation for well watered corn at the bushland tx lysimeter site with drip was 491 mm and the measured p was 225 mm for the total in season water supply of 716 mm dhungel et al 2019a these values are consistent with the 671 775 mm of in season water supply simulated during the 2013 2017 growing seasons for sd 6 lema conditions an alternative explanation for the discrepancy between simulated and reported irr for the sd 6 lema is that many farmers are practicing deficit irrigation deficit irrigation management is when the supply of water is less than the crop et requirements fereres and soriano 2006 under this management regime available soil water is expected to be depleted to levels that may result in crop stress possibly leading to yield reductions blum 1996 gibson and paulsen 1999 rudnick et al 2019 summarized and discussed the deficit irrigation management of maize in the us high plains aquifer region it is possible that application of deficit irrigation management complicates the comparison of reported irr app with simulated irr sim the et simulated from baitsss assumes well watered conditions i e 0 5 mad the reduced et may be the results of the gmd4 policy of water restriction where the first five year period was recently completed 2013 2017 the seasonal et for fully irrigated corn sub surface drip distribution system at the bushland tx lysimeter site 2016 was 697 mm dhungel et al 2019a it is likely that this et would increase with sprinkler irrigation due to greater evaporation from wet soil surfaces for comparison the simulated et for irrigated corn in sh6 lema ranged from 716 to 803 mm with values being consistent with the field measurements reported from bushland tx payero et al 2008 reported similar seasonal et 655 mm for corn in west central nebraska based on 2005 2006 data further comparisons with a range of crops that are grown in this region can or may improve the confidence in these simulation results fig 9 a shows the simulated et was equivalent to or exceeded in season water supply the reported irr application plus p for all reported corn in sd 6 if et is representative of well watered condition then the difference between et and reported irr and p could indicate soil water depletion and or supply limited et as expected under deficit irrigation management with the exception of 2015 simulated irr was consistent in regard to reported irr although consistently greater in quantity 102 mm average of 2013 2014 2016 and 2017 fig 9a table 3 this discrepancy could be accounted for by net soil water depletion in the order of 100 mm a realistic quantity for these soils lamm et al 2017 a negative bias in gridded precipitation could also contribute to the difference between simulated et and reported irr and p a recent report from whittemore et al 2018 indicated that the true water conservation for four years 2013 2016 of lema operation adjusted for climate was in the range of 26 28 a proportion that exceeded the targeted 20 another report from american association for the advancement of science citing gmd4 official indicates a 39 reduction in groundwater use over the course of the lema kansas farmers minimize water use as the southern great plains become more arid 2019 this supports the evidence that in season water supply was less than simulated et for the fully irrigated assumption indicating possible deficit irrigation furthermore various other factors such as model capability and limitations propagation of bias from input gridded data dhungel et al 2019b uncertainty in applied irrigation acreage split pivots and other unknown field conditions may have influenced the final et fig 9c and d show the trend of cumulative mean et and seasonal mean lai and ndvi as expected both show the linear relationship with the increase with et with an increase in vegetation indices 3 3 2 township 9s 41w fig 9b shows a similar plot of et vs irrigation application plus p for twp 9s 41 w results showed a similar trend with the majority of et above 1 1 with some exceptions the mean cumulative et was between 500 mm 800 mm for evaluated years 3 4 water management in localized conditions earlier sections discussed of full irrigation treatment and corresponding et simulation this section briefly discusses the framework of full irrigation treatment and possible options of deficit irrigation in baitsss fig 10 shows f4 function eq 5 associated with Œ∏root in the jarvis equation for the sampled pixel discussed in section 3 1 1 100 38 22 w 39 21 38 n for year 2013 with relatively low moisture related stress f4 was relatively large 0 85 fig 10 throughout the simulation without reducing transpiration when energy was available as a reminder jarvis functions vary from 0 to 1 with infinite to minimum assigned resistance respectively in the instance of deficit irrigation the soil moisture falls below threshold and eventually generating moisture related stress the f4 becomes smaller which will increase rsc and ultimately reduce et physically this would delay irrigation timing and frequency however extent timing and duration of these types of stress may be difficult to measure and validate also how these kinds of stress would affect the final et and crop production is another key question and suitable for future research 3 5 potential economic and policy implications of the baitsss results majority of remote sensing based instantaneous et models lack irrigation scheduling soil moisture and precipitation components in surface energy balance hourly scale soil water balance with irrigation scheduling make baitsss a comprehensive and robust algorithm for examining water management issues in the agricultural landscape as such we content that this simulation approach constitutes a next generation set of tools with application to irrigation management it has global application subject to supporting databases if the information from the baitsss model were available for use on a broad scale it could have important economic and policy implications for irrigated crop producers regional water resource managers and natural resource policy makers 3 5 1 irrigated crop producers for irrigated crop producers in areas where availability to irrigation water is regulated the potential to provide field level crop production information from baitsss could provide valuable information on in growing season crop water use and possibly water use efficiency if this information were to be made available for individual irrigated fields periodically throughout the growing season i e weekly bi weekly or monthly it could help farmers make more effective irrigation management decisions particularly under tight scarce or limited crop soil moisture conditions for either full or split center pivot irrigation systems these pictures or graphic images of estimated crop water usage could provide guidance for efficiently irrigating particular parts of fields that are most stressed in terms of soil moisture as opposed to other parts of irrigated fields that may have adequate soil moisture supplies information from baitsss could be especially valuable in making decisions to end of season irrigation management related to on crop water needs essentially in any irrigated fields that must manage irrigation water supplies that are limited either because of declining water availability or water management conservation regulations this tool could provide irrigated crop producers with valuable irrigation water management decision making information if it were available periodically in a timely manner at critically important stages of crop development the baitsss tool could provide guidance for farmers with adjacent irrigation systems who may have the ability to divide water supplies among these fields based on differing soil moisture needs also a multiple year record of past water use efficiency and effectiveness on a particular field may help irrigators make economically profitable decisions about full versus partial center pivot circle coverage of particular crops 3 5 2 regional water resource managers and water management policy makers regional water resource managers and water management policy makers could also benefit from the information provided by baitsss as the program s output provides information on water use efficiency and irrigation management practices on the one hand baitsss information could be used constructively to help design and encourage efficient irrigation water management practices and procedures that are economically effective in promoting profitable crop production practices in both the short and long term however a concern to farmers maybe the possible use of baitsss as a regulatory tool by these same public entities to verify compliance to existing water policies farmers in nw kansas should not have such concerns because they are already required to report their groundwater use the use of baitsss as an alternative to reporting groundwater use may actual save farmers time from recording and reporting groundwater use to avoid potential disagreements over the use of baitsss data among individual irrigated crop producers water resource managers and policy makers these groups will need to work together to develop policies for its permissible use it is possible that in season basis baitsss results could be provided on a fee basis to individual irrigated crop producers by either private enterprise or public entities end of year summaries of crop water use information could also be made available to crop producers and regulatory authorities for management monitoring and policy purposes finally at issue regarding field level crop water usage information with baitsss is how accurately it describes the effectiveness of irrigated crop water management practices if acceptably accurate baitsss crop water use information can provide both farmers and regional water managers with valuable irrigation water management information in summary baitsss may improve farmers ability to efficiently and profitably manage their irrigated acres and baitsss may also help water managers have a better understanding of effective irrigation water management plans policies and procedures the ultimate goal in development of baitsss is to have a user interface that gives the user the ability to select the 30 meter pixels that represents their land displaying an accurate estimate of et and any other outputs from baitsss model from the most recent hour and day as well as cumulative et near real time so that all the stakeholders can plan accordingly as a caution regarding the future availability of baitsss individual crop producers may question whether regulatory authorities would be motivated to eventually use information from baitsss for a closer more informed regulatory oversight and control of their field level irrigation management practices 4 conclusion our effort to understand the implications of the simulated landscape et in an agriculturally dominated groundwater region of kansas produced opportunities as well as challenges a large database of water diversion and metered consumption data provided an excellent opportunity evaluate model simulations to real life groundwater uses the hourly landscape et simulation in a time series at 30 m spatial resolution from baitsss was computationally challenging and data intensive results indicated that the upper limit of seasonal et at wrmus for multiple years approximated the applied irrigation plus precipitation thus indicating the overall competence of baitsss the lack of systematic documentation of ground truth data for various localized conditions affected the final interpretation of the results it is not feasible to have ground truth data in each field so our critical understanding and interpretation of these results are inevitable the overestimation of simulated irrigation can be reduced by ceasing irrigation simulation during the senescence period overall results indicated that the restriction policy may have played positive impact to minimize crop water use the policies for implementing water reduction in an agricultural landscape is generally hindered by the lack of efficient and reliable tools in landscape scale but we show that remote sensing based landscape et models are generally used to successfully provide these tools we believe a more accurate and detailed model like baitsss would open opportunities and dialogue among the farmers producers regional water resource managers and water management policy makers to solve one of the critical water issues of the western united states and around the world acknowledgments

schedule irrigation and acquire water right information for effective water management and increased productivity in semi arid and arid environments overall objective was to utilize the automated biophysical surface energy balance model baitsss backward averaged iterative two source surface temperature and energy balance solution to understand critical agricultural water management issues baitsss served as an advanced digital landscape crop water tracker and irrigation scheduler to simulate hourly landscape evapotranspiration et at 30 m spatial resolution north american land data assimilation system nldas weather data and landsat based vegetation indices were inputs of baitsss to simulate surface energy balance components along with irrigation irr two agricultural dominated groundwater regions of northwest kansas usa within a section of the ogallala aquifer were studied during a five year period 2013 2017 we compared model simulated irrigation to reported within water right management units wrmu the sum of reported irrigation and precipitation p representing in season water supply was also compared to model simulated et as an indicator of well watered et the model was able to simulate reasonably et values and irrigation quantities and to differentiate various spatial distribution patterns of crops within wrmu however unknown water management within wrmu constrained explicit inference of actual et and irrigation amounts the model appears suitable for quantifying the upper bound of in season water supply irrigation plus p expected for well watered crops in the u s central high plains a wrmu exhibiting significantly different in season water supply than the simulated et may present opportunities to modify irrigation rates or to gain inference

instantaneous et models were constructed through atmospheric interaction processing but lack water balance and irrigation components in the energy balance algorithm other limiting factors include time

2019a b 2016 is a two source energy balance and two layer soil water balance biophysical et algorithm driven by weather variables and remote sensing based canopy formation baitsss is different from widely used remote sensing based instantaneous et models such as metric and sebal allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 that utilize extreme pixel concepts that is hot and cold pixel to compute landscape et baitsss iteratively solves energy and soil water balance along with irrigation at a 30 m spatial resolution in an hourly step providing comprehensive and detailed surface energy balance

nor dryland conditions though these are common crop water management practices in northwest kansas kisekka and aguilar 2016 others full irrigation is likely to increase et as compared to deficit irrigation but current structure of baitsss provided critical information about crop water requirements based on vegetation indices and growth stages irrigation was simulated for all pixels based on irrigation rules that maintained a management allowable depletion mad fraction of available soil water storage capacity we assumed irrigation was applied to the surface layer and infiltrated into the root zone to mimic the behavior of sprinkler irrigation which is common in this region lilienfeld and asmild 2007 we assumed rooting depth as 1000 mm and a mad fraction of 0 5 based on kansched clark et al 2000 guidelines for all crops and growth stages inside the study area the adopted mad value partially delays irrigation developing a framework of deficit irrigation the current study doesn t differentiate mad and rooting zone for each field and crop as well as albedo because such information is not readily available for all fields the rooting depth and mad may vary among the crops growth stages and may influence the timing of irrigation however final et is less likely to be affected in full irrigated treatment dhungel et al 2019b the maximum application of irrigation water was limited to 40 mm in a single event as adapted previously by eheart and tornil 1999 if the deficit in soil moisture is not fulfilled by 40 mm and soil moisture is still below Œ∏t the rest will be applied in the next time step even in fully irrigated lands the irrigation rules actually used by farmers are likely to differ from those assumed here 2 3 study area and data the study area was located in

doy 130 and september 15 doy 258 for 2013 to 2017 which represents the typical irrigated corn growing season the major focus of this study in this case in season assumes that the reported annual irrigation amount was applied during this period of time we recognize that applications could occur prior to planting or after harvest within the calendar year other crops were also present in the agricultural landscape with differing onsets and durations of the growing seasons calculating the seasonal et of other crops would require information about their respective growing seasons which likely differ from that expected for irrigated corn production farm reported data revealed that corn soybean wheat grain sorghum sunflower barley oats and combinations of these crops e g under split pivot management were grown under irrigation during the simulation period in the study area 2 3 1 water right information water right parcels were identified by the water information management and analysis system wimas kansas department of agriculture and kansas geological survey 2013 http hercules kgs ku edu geohydro wimas index cfm n d water right here defined as reported applied water within the specified boundaries for legal purpose for instance within a center pivot inspection of landsat imagery revealed 152 parcels sd 6 and 13 parcels twp s 41 w which had clearly identified boundaries as indicated by ndvi values farm reported records associated with the water right parcels identified in sd 6 and twp 9s 41 w fig 3 are considered to be representative of the region the farm reported irrigation application was computed by dividing the reported total acre feet of water diverted from groundwater pumpage quantity by the reported area associated with the wrmu these wrmu were annotated with arbitrary index values and used to extract simulated mean et values from baitsss output presented in section 3 3 the wrmu were consistent with the boundary of the center pivot sprinkler systems water distribution within these water right units are not explicitly known though in some cases split pivot management can be inferred from landsat imagery 2 4 satellite soil and surface climate data landsat 7 l7 and 8 l8 path 31 and row 33 images were utilized to provide the information required to calculate vegetative indices table 1 inference of daily canopy formation was provided by linear interpolation between successive landsat images the quality of the seasonal canopy formation and vegetation indices was influenced by the availability of images due to factors including cloud cover and failure of the scan line corrector slc component of landsat 7 chen et al 2011 stripes of missing values in landsat 7 imagery were filled by interpolation kramber et al 2011 before proceeding with surface energy balance calculations the number of landsat 7 scenes was minimized to avoid missing values weather data hourly 12 5 km spatial resolution were taken from nldas https hydro1 gesdisc

application area were utilized for conducting statistical analysis we didn t assess the accuracy of these reported crop and application area in this study however the kansas department of agriculture division of water resources dwr and kansas geological survey kgs is responsible of developing wimas database when no crop was specified for a given year the wrmu water right management unit was not included in subsequent analysis the frequency of a given crop type was calculated as the number of wrmu reported with the given crop type divided by the total number of wrmu with complete information for the given year significant differences in crop distributions among wrmu relative to the five year 2013 2017 mean distribution were tested using the chi square statistic sas 9 4 proc frequency systematic effects of crop year and interactions were evaluated by analysis of variance sas v 9 4 sas institute cary nc confidence bands 95 were calculated for each year with respect to annual mean values of applied irrigation irr app simulated irrigation irr sim gridded precipitation p and simulated et for the wrmu reported as cropped to corn mean values of these parameters reported for wrmu planted to other crops were considered significantly different from that of corn when the mean values occurred outside the confidence bands constructed for corn significance levels for all statistical parameters were tested at the 5 probability level we evaluated simulated irr irr sim compared with reported applied irr irr app as well as simulated et and applied irr plus p assuming simplified seasonal water balance as adopted by malek et al 1992 3 results and discussion 3 1 representative daily flux temporal information for single representative pixel in sd 6 100 38 22 w 39 21 38 n is

pixel during the simulation period the thick black is the mean of these variables the mean or cumulative value standard deviation sd among hourly values and skew of these variables were calculated from all hourly values for a simulation run of a given year table 2 3 1 1 input variables fig 4a to 4f show the seven day moving average of weather variables and linearly interpolated daily vegetation

the maximum ndvi was 0 85 fig 4e and maximum lai was 5 m2 m 2 fig 4f at maturity dhungel et al 2019b indicated that estimated vegetation indices from remote sensing data and the adopted equation in baitsss may be biased when compared to ground based measured data farm reported data indicated that the field containing the sampled pixel was cropped to corn 2013 2016 and 2017 and soybean 2014 and 2015 the seasonal changes in lai for pixel when cropped to corn were consistent with lai measured for corn at bushland tx in 2016 dhungel et al 2019a gao et al 2017 discussed the characteristics of ndvi of corn and soybean from landsat data for the year 2011 in dallas county iowa where the maximum ndvi of both crops was 0 85 in this study the analysis of crop et is based on the vegetation indices derived from landsat imagery any differences between the actual and simulated representation of crop canopy are expected to propagate to the final calculation of et dhungel et al 2019b 3 1 2 major output variables this study focuses attention on water balance components therefore energy balance flux components simulated surface temperatures and resistances which are analyzed in dhungel et al 2019a are not presented seasonal changes in cumulative daily values of t ess et irr p and mean daily values of soil moisture at the root zone Œ∏root 100 1000 mm and surface Œ∏sur 100 mm layers for the sampled pixel are shown in fig 5 3 1 2 1 corn and soybean as mentioned earlier the field containing the sampled pixel was cropped to either corn or soybean during the 5 year study period we didn t conduct separate analyses for each individual crop as there were minor variations in vegetation indices among years however we separated figures based on crop fig 5a f showed the results for corn and fig 5g l for soybean the partitioned et showed a large variation in ess due to the differences in quantity and frequency of p during partially canopy closure fig 5b f and fig 5h l the simulated Œ∏root remained smaller than Œ∏fc at the start of the simulation fig 5c 5i later in the simulation Œ∏root decreased to values near the threshold moisture content i e 0 17 m3 m 3 that would prompt a simulated irrigation event the amount and frequency of p and simulated irr 40 mm per application fig 5f and l were not sufficient to increase Œ∏root to near Œ∏fc values the Œ∏sur remained large under conditions of full canopy cover fig 5d and j because of multiple p and irrigation events the daily maximum et of 12 4 mm occurred on doy 200 in the year 2016 fig 5e the mean maximum et generally ranged between 8 and 10 mm fig 5e and k for both crops under the irrigation decision rule the first in season simulated irrigation event occurred around doy 170 mid june in the year 2015 fig 5l on average start irrigating around june 15th as per the field the maximum daily precipitation was 55 mm in the year 2014 table 2 shows the annual mean and cumulative values of these variables the standard deviation sd and skew provide a measure of the yearly variability of these variables the sd and skew were in general similar indicating the consistency of these variables among the years table 2 the skew of qa ta lai ndvi and Œ∏sur showed negative signs indicating infrequent periods with smaller values typically at the start of grown season compared to the maturity table 2 fig 4 a detailed discussion of baitsss was presented previously for a fully irrigated corn field at a lysimeter site near bushland tx evett et al 2016 for the year 2016 dhungel et al 2019b 2019a this study adopts a similar set up and assumptions to the bushland study using gridded nldas and landsat based vegetation indices we hypothesized the behavior and capability of the model should be comparable to that at bushland within a similar environment further it is expected the variations in vegetation indices should help account for differences between this study that has several different crops and the bushland study with only corn bushland results dhungel et al 2019b 2019a with corn indicated that baitsss was able to estimate seasonal cumulative et relatively accurately with 4 positive bias and daily and hourly rmse of 0 85 mm and 0 10 mm r2 0 9 for both daily and hourly the comparison of baitsss with the lysimeter with sorghum also indicated high accuracy with daily rmse 0 80 r2 0 87 at bushland tx working manuscript however when gridded data nldas weather data and landsat based vegetation indices were used the accuracy was reduced i e bias of seasonal cumulative et increased up to 13 positive and rmse increased in both daily and hourly scale with 1 64 mm d 1 and 0 14 mm h 1 r2 0 74 daily and 0 81 hourly respectively for corn the study concluded that increase in the positive bias in et modeling from gridded data was due to larger uz rs warmer ta and smaller actual vapor pressure ea dhungel et al 2019b furthermore smaller lai from remote sensing contributed to a negative bias in et modeling and vice versa fig 6 a and 6c show the simulated seasonal cumulative et simulated irr and p of the corn and fig 6d and 6f of soybean the largest et was observed in 2015 857 mm fig 6d and the smallest occurred in 2016 746 mm fig 6a table 2 the largest p was 481 mm 2014 fig 6e coincided with the smallest irr of 280 mm 2014 fig 6f the large vegetation indices during the early and mid season in 2015 likely contributed to the larger seasonal cumulative et of that year the p in 2015 was least among years 259 mm fig 6e corresponding with largest simulated irr for that year 560 mm fig 6f in practice irrigation applications typically ended prior to crop maturity around the first week of september typically for corn as observed in bushland tx dhungel et al 2019b however the irrigation sub model in baitsss didn t implement these local practices and irrigation was applied throughout the simulation period possibly leading to overestimations relative to actual applications 3 2 landscape cumulative et analysis cumulative et as simulated over the agricultural landscape is compared with farm reported irr and crops for the 2013 2017 growing seasons seasonal cumulative et simulated values are shown for twp 9s 41 w figs 7 a e and sd 6 fig 7f j these maps of cumulative et illustrate spatial differences in the expected seasonal water use of well watered crops at the landscape scale simulation et values ranged from 220 to 980 mm despite the assumption of full irrigations i e mad fraction of 0 5 with similar environmental conditions variations in et within a given year were primarily controlled by variations in vegetation indices weather conditions likely contributed to variability in simulated et among years operationally in the baitsss algorithm increased ndvi is linked to increasing lai non linear and canopy fraction fc linear the jarvis function for canopy resistance rsc results in a smaller rsc and increased t with increasing lai the fc parameter indicates the relative contribution of ess and t to et with small fc increasing the contribution of the ess components a maximum lai value of 6 m2 m 2 corresponded to a maximum ndvi value of 0 90 in this study not shown the minimum values of et appear to represent non cropped areas where small ndvi should correspond with small fc small lai large rsc and large contribution of ess to et under these conditions et would primarily be influenced by p as irrigation would not be triggered by depletion of water retained in the root zone soil layer other factors affecting spatial variation in et could include undetected cloud cover and inconsistency in interpolated landsat 7 stripes fig 8 shows a magnified section of the sampled wrmu where the distribution of irrigation water is not known we suggested two of many possible spatial distribution patterns as interpretations figs 8 are consistent with six center pivot sprinkler systems representing wrmu cumulative et for the lower left and lower center wrmu fig 8a exhibit limited within field variation consistent with uniform water distribution in contrast et for the remaining units appears to display a bi model distribution split approximately halfway through the wrmu klocke et al 2006 described the split pivot strategy for optimizing the use of a limited water supply e g with a portion of the field receiving full irrigation and the remainder receiving limited or no irrigation simulated mean et values in these wrmu tended to range between 600 mm 800 mm to understand these variabilities we sampled vegetation indices lai and ndvi for the year 2013 results indicated that some crops are late planted upper left two center pivots fig 8a which may be one of the factors affecting final et within wrmu section 3 3 presents the overall statistics within the wrmu based on the limited field observation data 3 3 within water right evaluation in this section within wrmu cumulative water et p and irr at sd 6 and twp 9s 41 w are presented a detailed analysis was conducted of sd 6 because of larger sample size and the overall results were representative of twp 9s 41 w 3 3 1 sd 6 lema reported crop distributions indicated that 75 of the wrmu was planted to a single crop corn 58 soybean 9 grain sorghum 3 wheat 3 sunflower 2 when averaged over the five year period the remaining 25 of wrmu area was planted to two crops corn soybean 15 corn grain sorghum 5 corn wheat 4 chi square analysis indicated that in 2017 the distribution of crops among wrmu in 2017 was different from the five year average with fewer fields containing multiple crops 82 of wrmu being planted to a single crop corn 66 soybean 16 grain sorghum 1 and only 18 planted to two crops corn soybean 12 corn wheat 4 corn grain sorghum 3 in 2017 the final year of the five year lema farmers knew their remaining water allocations based on reported use in the prior four years this may have affected the shift in crop allocations analysis of variance indicated that reported applied irrigation amounts differed among years and crops with some interacting effects for corn greatest irrigation occurred in 2013 and 2014 and the least in 2017 reported irrigation volume applied to corn exceeded that reported for other crops with exceptions of equivalent amounts for soybean in 2015 2016 and 2017 corn soybean in 2014 corn grain sorghum in 2015 and corn wheat in 2014 and 2015 during the 2013 2017 growing seasons reported irrigation volume applied to corn in the sd 6 lema 210 305 mm was consistently less than simulated irr values of 350 529 mm table 3 this difference could indicate a positive bias in simulated irrigation requirements applied irrigation for well watered corn at the bushland tx lysimeter site with drip was 491 mm and the measured p was 225 mm for the total in season water supply of 716 mm dhungel et al 2019a these values are consistent with the 671 775 mm of in season water supply simulated during the 2013 2017 growing seasons for sd 6 lema conditions an alternative explanation for the discrepancy between simulated and reported irr for the sd 6 lema is that many farmers are practicing deficit irrigation deficit irrigation management is when the supply of water is less than the crop et requirements fereres and soriano 2006 under this management regime available soil water is expected to be depleted to levels that may result in crop stress possibly leading to yield reductions blum 1996 gibson and paulsen 1999 rudnick et al 2019 summarized and discussed the deficit irrigation management of maize in the us high plains aquifer region it is possible that application of deficit irrigation management complicates the comparison of reported irr app with simulated irr sim the et simulated from baitsss assumes well watered conditions i e 0 5 mad the reduced et may be the results of the gmd4 policy of water restriction where the first five year period was recently completed 2013 2017 the seasonal et for fully irrigated corn sub surface drip distribution system at the bushland tx lysimeter site 2016 was 697 mm dhungel et al 2019a it is likely that this et would increase with sprinkler irrigation due to greater evaporation from wet soil surfaces for comparison the simulated et for irrigated corn in sh6 lema ranged from 716 to 803 mm with values being consistent with the field measurements reported from bushland tx payero et al 2008 reported similar seasonal et 655 mm for corn in west central nebraska based on 2005 2006 data further comparisons with a range of crops that are grown in this region can or may improve the confidence in these simulation results fig 9 a shows the simulated et was equivalent to or exceeded in season water supply the reported irr application plus p for all reported corn in sd 6 if et is representative of well watered condition then the difference between et and reported irr and p could indicate soil water depletion and or supply limited et as expected under deficit irrigation management with the exception of 2015 simulated irr was consistent in regard to reported irr although consistently greater in quantity 102 mm average of 2013 2014 2016 and 2017 fig 9a table 3 this discrepancy could be accounted for by net soil water depletion in the order of 100 mm a realistic quantity for these soils lamm et al 2017 a negative bias in gridded precipitation could also contribute to the difference between simulated et and reported irr and p a recent report from whittemore et al 2018 indicated that the true water conservation for four years 2013 2016 of lema operation adjusted for climate was in the range of 26 28 a proportion that exceeded the targeted 20 another report from american association for the advancement of science citing gmd4 official indicates a 39 reduction in groundwater use over the course of the lema kansas farmers minimize water use as the southern great plains become more arid 2019 this supports the evidence that in season water supply was less than simulated et for the fully irrigated assumption indicating possible deficit irrigation furthermore various other factors such as model capability and limitations propagation of bias from input gridded data dhungel et al 2019b uncertainty in applied irrigation acreage split pivots and other unknown field conditions may have influenced the final et fig 9c and d show the trend of cumulative mean et and seasonal mean lai and ndvi as expected both show the linear relationship with the increase with et with an increase in vegetation indices 3 3 2 township 9s 41w fig 9b shows a similar plot of et vs irrigation application plus p for twp 9s 41 w results showed a similar trend with the majority of et above 1 1 with some exceptions the mean cumulative et was between 500 mm 800 mm for evaluated years 3 4 water management in localized conditions earlier sections discussed of full irrigation treatment and corresponding et simulation this section briefly discusses the framework of full irrigation treatment and possible options of deficit irrigation in baitsss fig 10 shows f4 function eq 5 associated with Œ∏root in the jarvis equation for the sampled pixel discussed in section 3 1 1 100 38 22 w 39 21 38 n for year 2013 with relatively low moisture related stress f4 was relatively large 0 85 fig 10 throughout the simulation without reducing transpiration when energy was available as a reminder jarvis functions vary from 0 to 1 with infinite to minimum assigned resistance respectively in the instance of deficit irrigation the soil moisture falls below threshold and eventually generating moisture related stress the f4 becomes smaller which will increase rsc and ultimately reduce et physically this would delay irrigation timing and frequency however extent timing and duration of these types of stress may be difficult to measure and validate also how these kinds of stress would affect the final et and crop production is another key question and suitable for future research 3 5 potential economic and policy implications of the baitsss results majority of remote sensing based instantaneous et models lack irrigation scheduling soil moisture and precipitation components in surface energy balance hourly scale soil water balance with irrigation scheduling make baitsss a comprehensive and robust algorithm for examining water management issues in the agricultural landscape as such we content that this simulation approach constitutes a next generation set of tools with application to irrigation management it has global application subject to supporting databases if the information from the baitsss model were available for use on a broad scale it could have important economic and policy implications for irrigated crop producers regional water resource managers and natural resource policy makers 3 5 1 irrigated crop producers for irrigated crop producers in areas where availability to irrigation water is regulated the potential to provide field level crop production information from baitsss could provide valuable information on in growing season crop water use and possibly water use efficiency if this information were to be made available for individual irrigated fields periodically throughout the growing season i e weekly bi weekly or monthly it could help farmers make more effective irrigation management decisions particularly under tight scarce or limited crop soil moisture conditions for either full or split center pivot irrigation systems these pictures or graphic images of estimated crop water usage could provide guidance for efficiently irrigating particular parts of fields that are most stressed in terms of soil moisture as opposed to other parts of irrigated fields that may have adequate soil moisture supplies information from baitsss could be especially valuable in making decisions to end of season irrigation management related to on crop water needs essentially in any irrigated fields that must manage irrigation water supplies that are limited either because of declining water availability or water management conservation regulations this tool could provide irrigated crop producers with valuable irrigation water management decision making information if it were available periodically in a timely manner at critically important stages of crop development the baitsss tool could provide guidance for farmers with adjacent irrigation systems who may have the ability to divide water supplies among these fields based on differing soil moisture needs also a multiple year record of past water use efficiency and effectiveness on a particular field may help irrigators make economically profitable decisions about full versus partial center pivot circle coverage of particular crops 3 5 2 regional water resource managers and water management policy makers regional water resource managers and water management policy makers could also benefit from the information provided by baitsss as the program s output provides information on water use efficiency and irrigation management practices on the one hand baitsss information could be used constructively to help design and encourage efficient irrigation water management practices and procedures that are economically effective in promoting profitable crop production practices in both the short and long term however a concern to farmers maybe the possible use of baitsss as a regulatory tool by these same public entities to verify compliance to existing water policies farmers in nw kansas should not have such concerns because they are already required to report their groundwater use the use of baitsss as an alternative to reporting groundwater use may actual save farmers time from recording and reporting groundwater use to avoid potential disagreements over the use of baitsss data among individual irrigated crop producers water resource managers and policy makers these groups will need to work together to develop policies for its permissible use it is possible that in season basis baitsss results could be provided on a fee basis to individual irrigated crop producers by either private enterprise or public entities end of year summaries of crop water use information could also be made available to crop producers and regulatory authorities for management monitoring and policy purposes finally at issue regarding field level crop water usage information with baitsss is how accurately it describes the effectiveness of irrigated crop water management practices if acceptably accurate baitsss crop water use information can provide both farmers and regional water managers with valuable irrigation water management information in summary baitsss may improve farmers ability to efficiently and profitably manage their irrigated acres and baitsss may also help water managers have a better understanding of effective irrigation water management plans policies and procedures the ultimate goal in development of baitsss is to have a user interface that gives the user the ability to select the 30 meter pixels that represents their land displaying an accurate estimate of et and any other outputs from baitsss model from the most recent hour and day as well as cumulative et near real time so that all the stakeholders can plan accordingly as a caution regarding the future availability of baitsss individual crop producers may question whether regulatory authorities would be motivated to eventually use information from baitsss for a closer more informed regulatory oversight and control of their field level irrigation management practices 4 conclusion our effort to understand the implications of the simulated landscape et in an agriculturally dominated groundwater region of kansas produced opportunities as well as challenges a large database of water diversion and metered consumption data provided an excellent opportunity evaluate model simulations to real life groundwater uses the hourly landscape et simulation in a time series at 30 m spatial resolution from baitsss was computationally challenging and data intensive results indicated that the upper limit of seasonal et at wrmus for multiple years approximated the applied irrigation plus precipitation thus indicating the overall competence of baitsss the lack of systematic documentation of ground truth data for various localized conditions affected the final interpretation of the results it is not feasible to have ground truth data in each field so our critical understanding and interpretation of these results are inevitable the overestimation of simulated irrigation can be reduced by ceasing irrigation simulation during the senescence period overall results indicated that the restriction policy may have played positive impact to minimize crop water use the policies for implementing water reduction in an agricultural landscape is generally hindered by the lack of efficient and reliable tools in landscape scale but we show that remote sensing based landscape et models are generally used to successfully provide these tools we believe a more accurate and detailed model like baitsss would open opportunities and dialogue among the farmers producers regional water resource managers and water management policy makers to solve one of the critical water issues of the western united states and around the world acknowledgments
