23680,this paper concerns experimental measurements of the interaction of a taut moored floating body representing a point absorbing wave energy converter in survivability mode with extreme waves the extreme waves are modelled in four ways newwave theory is first used to generate focused wave groups of varying steepness steepness is shown to have negligible effect on peak mooring loads but causes significant differences in the resulting motion the newwave group is then constrained into both regular and irregular background wave trains so that the floating body has a load history caused by previous waves when interacting with the focused wave group it is shown that an independent focused wave group is insufficient to properly model the extreme response of the floating body however differences between the target and measured constrained time series due to non linear wave wave interaction limited the potential benefits of this approach finally the results from these tests are compared with measurements taken using irregular waves without any deterministic focused wave groups present this comparison found cases where the floats response was greater than during any of the constrained newwave tests indicating that the assumption made that newwave will generate the largest response was incorrect in this case keywords newwave constrained newwave wave impact survivability moorings floating bodies 1 introduction floating wave energy converters must be designed to withstand the largest waves experienced during storms of magnitude equal to their design condition this forms part of a wave energy device s survivability criterion part of the dual requirements of any marine energy device the ability to extract energy in small to moderate seas while surviving more extreme conditions barstow et al 2008 p 52 achieving an understanding of the response to these extreme waves is important large degrees of uncertainty in the expected loads often lead to the use of conservative assumptions which can negatively influence the commercial viability of a device o neill et al 2006 most floating offshore wave energy converters are being designed to deploy in arrays spacing between individual devices within an array depends on many factors including maximising power generation provision of maintenance access and achieving an acceptable collision risk for this last point it is important to be able to also predict the maximum expected displacement of devices during extreme events both experimental and numerical techniques are used to model a device s response to extreme waves in both cases a deterministic focused wave group based on newwave theory is often used to generate a time series of an extreme wave newwave theory as described by tromans et al 1991 models the statistically most probable surface elevation shape associated with the occurrence of an extreme wave crest with a specified exceedance probability pinna and cassidy 2004 newwave theory has the advantage that it generates an extreme event within a relatively short time series when compared to relying on randomly occurring extreme events in an irregular time series of the sea state in question the short time series means in a correctly designed experiment that all important wave structure interactions occur before any significant influence from wave reflections from basin walls occur the wave group generated by newwave theory propagates into calm water this and again the relatively short time series involved means that newwave focused wave groups are well suited for proving validation data for computationally expensive computational fluid dynamic cfd models these advantages of using newwave focused wave groups to measure extreme wave interactions have led to the approach being used in a wide number of applications in the offshore environment extreme wave impacts on fixed cylinders relevant to a wide range of structures have been assessed both experimental and numerically using newwave theory walker and eatock taylor 2005 ransley et al 2013 zang et al 2010 while stallard et al 2009a measured the forces on a vertical cylinder moving through a stationary fluid with a motion devised from newwave theory rozario et al 1993 successfully compared the loads predicted by newwave on a north sea oil platform with simulations of random seas westphalen et al 2014 conducted volume of fluid and sph cfd simulations of newwave wave groups interacting with the manchester bobber wave energy device comparing results to those from 70th scale experimental measurements stallard et al 2009b weller et al 2013 more recently newwave theory has been used to investigate the impact of extreme waves in the coastal environment borthwick et al 2006 measured wave kinematics of newwaves impacting on a 1 20 beach plane while whittaker et al 2017 measured wave runup of a plane beach focused wave groups such as those generated by newwave theory are used to represent the design load case for fixed structures stallard et al 2009b their use as design cases for dynamic structures and devices is questionable however when dynamic response to waves is expected the response to a specific extreme wave will depend not only on the load induced by the wave but the load history caused by the previous wave train pinna and cassidy 2004 this dependency is not investigated when testing with a single focused wave group the device or structure in question has a stationary initial state and only interacts with the deterministic wave crests and troughs that made up the initial part of the focused wave group before interacting with the extreme central crest constraining or embedding the newwave within a random background sea state is an approach which allows the effect that a device or structures load history has on that device or structures response to a deterministic extreme event to be investigated introduced by taylor et al 1997 a constrained newwave cnw consists of a newwave group which is constrained into an irregular background sea state with the same characteristic spectrum such that the resulting time series is statistically indistinguishable from a randomly occurring wave train the impact of the device s load history variation and the resulting distribution of the responses to the extreme wave can then be investigated by conducting multiple simulations or experiments with the focused wave group constrained into different random background time series various numerical studies have concluded that using the cnw technique is a viable alternative to conducting simulations with random irregular wave time series for example cassidy 1999 and cassidy et al 2001 demonstrated the use of cnw to determine the short term extreme response statistics of a jack up structure using 5 newwaves each constrained into 200 random backgrounds their results were found to be comparable to those found from 100 3 h simulations of random seas pinna and cassidy 2004 conducted similar simulations on a fixed monopod platform using 100 cnw cases while enderami et al 2010 modelled the extreme response of a jacket offshore platform using 200 cnw both with abaqus both compared results with simulations of 3 h long irregular sea states and found that the maximum response were of a similar magnitude bennett et al 2012 report what they believed to be the first experimental use of cnw they compared the use of an independent newwave cnw and an optimised sea state to model the rigid body motions of a travelling ship in abnormal waves where the optimised sea state requires an iterative adjustment of the phases in a random sea state so that a target extreme wave occurs the three different approaches to generating abnormal sea conditions were tested for three jonswap sea states with increasing significant wave height discrepancies between the target and generated wave were reported for the cnw which was considered to be potentially due to the combination of two wave spectra göteman et al 2015 constrained newwave into regular waves when measuring the wave load on a point absorbing wave energy device the focused wave was constrained into different phase locations within regular waves with four different periods resulting in 32 cases in total a correlation between wave height and measured mooring force is reported this paper presents a systematic study into the experimental use of independent newwave and cnw in the investigation of a moored floating body s response to an extreme wave results from four sets of experiments are reported and compared in the first series the interaction of the moored floating body with an independent newwave focused wave group was measured along with the interaction with three other focused groups of increasing steepness in the second series 24 constrained newwave cases were tested within two regular background waves in the third series the newwave was constrained into 180 unique irregular wave backgrounds the final experimental series consisted of two 3 h long irregular wave time series without any newwave group present a single sea state representing a 100 year return period at wave hub a wave energy test site of the north cornwall coast uk was used throughout the differences between the maximum mooring loads and surge measured during the four set of experiments are specific to the float geometry mooring arrangement and wave conditions tested here however by comparing the results from the four different sets of experiments conclusions are drawn and recommendations made about the application of independent and constrained newwave to the experimental determination of the extreme response of a moored floating body 2 experimental methodology the floating body tested was the same as used in hann et al 2015 but with an altered mooring arrangement fig 1 it is a 0 5 m diameter floating body consisting of a hemisphere and 0 25 m high cylinder with a dry mass of 43 2 kg and made from steel with a concrete ballast the floats centre of mass was about the central axis of the float 0 319 m from the top of the cylinder moments of inertia were ixx iyy 1 61 kg m2 and izz 1 25 kg m2 a single taut mooring was used consisting of 1 38 m of 3 mm diameter dyneema rope spring constant k 35 n mm in series with a 12 5 mm diameter linear spring k 0 066 n mm which provided the mooring s extension the initial and maximum rated length of the spring was 0 63 m and 1 145 m respectively in still water the spring was extended by 0 31 m end stops consisting of 4 dyneema ropes around the spring were installed to prevent the spring from being overextended throughout these experiments the spring was never extended to its maximum length and as such these end stops were never reached mooring loads were measured using a 500n load cell 40 mm high 44 mm diameter attached in line with the mooring to the tank floor via a 74 mm long 22 mm diameter universal joint fig 1 three 0 02 m shackles connected the spring to the load cell the spring to the mooring line and the mooring line to the float mooring loads are reported as the difference between the dynamic mooring load and the moorings static equilibrium load i e the additional load an optical tracking system was used to record the motion of the model in 6 degrees of freedom about a global coordinate system the reported motions are of the centre of mass of the model the averaged measured residual in the optical tracking system was 1 15 mm decay tests conducted on the moored float identified the system to have resonance frequencies of 0 93 hz in heave 0 75 hz in pitch and 0 07 hz in surge although the floating body and mooring are not representative of a specific full scale wave energy device the experiments are considered to be conducted at 50th scale based on the scaling of the wave conditions section 3 1 measurements were conducted in a 35 m 15 5 m ocean basin at plymouth university s coast laboratory the variable floor depth was set at 2 8 m the facility has 24 2 0 m deep hinged wave paddles across one side of the tank wave reflections are reduced using a parabolic beach and the wave paddle s active absorption the model was moored in its resting position along the centre line of the basin 18 8 m from the front of the wave paddles a series of 9 resistance type wave gauges were positioned along a line 1 46 m away from the tanks centre line the location of these gauges relative to wave paddles and the model are given in table 1 wave gauge 6 was positioned so that it was approximately aligned with the front face of the model all waves generated in this sequence of measurements were long crested and normally incident it is assumed that the waves impacting the model are identical to those recorded 1 46 m to the side of the model two further wave gauges were positioned on the tank s centre line in line with wave gauge 2 and 3 to confirm this assumption 3 newwave generation 3 1 independent newwave the first series of tests measured the response of the floating body to four independent focused wave groups the first was a newwave group generated using a pierson moskowitz pm spectrum with a peak period and wave height based on 50th scale hindcast data halcrow 2006 p 19 for a 100 year return period storm at wave hub a wave energy test facility off the north cornwall coast in the south west of the uk t z 1 99 s h s 0 288 m the theoretical amplitude of the central crest of the newwave a was set to be the largest expected amplitude in n waves as given by 1 a 2 m o ln n where m o is the zeroth moment of the spectrum hunt raby et al 2011 based on hunt raby et al 2011 n was set to 1000 representing the approximate number of waves expected in a 3 h sea state resulting in a target crest amplitude of 0 267 m for the second third and fourth focused wave groups this target crest amplitude was maintained while the peak period of the spectrum used to generate the newwave was progressively increased to increase the crest steepness ka the peak frequency multiplication factor of each of the wave groups tested are given in table 2 the theoretical focus location of each wave group is wave gauge 6 the approximate location of the front of the model when stationary fernández et al 2014 discuss various reasons why focused waves do not generally come to focus at the theoretical focus location and time as defined by linear theory this includes non linear wave wave interactions within the wave packet as investigated by baldock et al 1996 creating components that do not satisfy the linear dispersion relation as used by baldock et al 1996 and ning et al 2009 a trial and error process was used to adjust the theoretical focus location of the wave group to achieve focus at the required location 0 05 m the wave group was judged to be in focus when the surface elevation time history was symmetrical i e the troughs on either side of the main crest had the same magnitude fig 2 plots the difference between the adjusted theoretical focus location and the target actual focus location against the theoretical crest steepness an approximate linear relationship can be observed indicating the increasing influence of non linear effects as wave steepness increases 3 2 constrained newwave the cnw approach potentially provides a means to investigate the effect that a device s load history as generated by previous waves has on the response of the float to a specific extreme wave the newwave previously tested as an individual focused wave s1 was constrained into 24 regular wave and 180 irregular wave time series the methodology used to generate the cnw time sequence was based on that used by cassidy 1999 and bennett et al 2012 fig 3 presents an example of this embedding procedure for one of the irregular cases showing the initial random wave sequence the initial independent newwave and the resulting cnw the 24 regular cnw cases were generated by constraining the newwave into 12 different phase locations within the time histories of two regular waves with frequencies of f1 0 38 hz and f2 0 53 hz both had a wave height of 0 204 m this wave height is equal to h s 2 where h s is the significant wave of the 1 100 year wave from which the newwave was generated mccabe and aggidis 2009 blanco et al 2015 varying the phase location at which the newwave was constrained into the 2 regular waves systematically alters the floating body s motion at the point the focused wave interacts with the model the phase location was varied from 150 to 180 in 30 intervals fig 4 shows the newwave constrained so the central crest occurs at a phase of 0 90 and 180 within the regular wave each of the 180 different irregular background sea states into which the newwave was constrained were 120 s long the newwave s were constrained such that the main crest occurred at 60 s the background sea states were formed by generating two 3 h long irregular wave time series and splitting each of these into 90 120 s sections the two 3 h long time series were generated using a pierson moskowitz spectrum and the same tz and hs values as used to generate the newwave each of the 180 constrained newwave time series were used as an input into the basin s wave generation software with the theoretical focus location set to be the location of the front face of the model in its static location unlike with the four individual focused wave groups it was not practical to use a trial and error approach to adjust the theoretical focus location of the 24 regular and 180 irregular constrained cases to achieve an improved focus 4 error assessment 4 1 repeatability the repeatability of the wave generation was assessed by repeating 1 of the 180 irregular constrained cases six times fig 5 shows the measured wave at wg6 of these 6 repeats around the cnw the average rmse between the 1st wave and the following 5 repeats wave excluding the first 20 s of the time series was 0 012 m indicating a good level of repeatability in wave generation a similar level of repeatability was observed in the mooring loads with an average rmse value between the first measurement and the following 5 repeats of 0 79 n compare to an average peak load of 18 42 n 4 2 mooring extension and load comparison the extension of the mooring has been calculated by translating the optical tracking system measurements to the model s mooring attachment point plots of this measured mooring extension against the measured mooring load for all 180 irregular cnw cases generated an average gradient of the line of best fit of 0 065 n mm this was consistent with the measured spring constant of the mooring spring the average coefficient of determination r 2 for these lines of best fit was 0 981 the same measurements are presented in fig 6 for the peak loads and mooring extensions generated by the embedded wave in the 180 irregular cnw experiments the line of best fit s gradient is also 0 065 n mm with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 966 although this fit is less good it still suggests that the spring remained linear and within its elastic regime during when the model was hit by the cnw 5 independent focused wave results fig 7 shows the measured time history of the 4 independent focused wave groups the measured main crest amplitude is presented in table 2 the crest amplitude progressively increases as steepness increases with the percentage difference between measured and target amplitude increasing from 2 2 to 19 1 the wave troughs immediately preceding and following the main crest are assuming linear wave theory also expected to have the same elevation across the four wave groups fig 7 shows that as wave steepness increased the measured group troughs were actually progressively less deep than the target waves this observed behaviour of the main crest and troughs is in agreement with that investigated by ning et al 2009 who concluded that this is due to non linear wave wave interactions particularly 3rd order table 2 also presented the measured wave steepness the same 4 wave groups were tested in hann et al 2015 where wave number k was calculated from the peak frequency of the measured wave group assuming linear wave theory here wave number k is calculated based again on the assumption of linear wave theory but with a wave period taken to be twice the difference between the central wave crest and the preceding wave trough 2 δ t this was done to allow direct comparison with the steepness of constrained newwaves measured in later test series fig 8 presents the mooring loads measured during the individual focused wave tests mooring load has been normalised with respect to the static mooring load overall peak load increased with wave steepness however this load increase was only 1 3 between s1 and s4 compared to a 16 5 increase in crest elevation and a 74 9 increase in wave steepness there was also no appreciable difference in the peak load generated by s2 and s3 with the generated loads lying between that generated by s1 and s4 this trend matches that observed in hann et al 2015 where snatch loading generated when a taut mooring with reduced capacity compared to the one used in these tests reached its end stop was only observed to increase by 4 7 as steepness increased between the same four wave groups the difference in the mooring load peak subsequent to the largest peak at around 2 6 s increases to 8 8 between s1 and s4 this increase was monotonic in nature with the load progressively increasing with wave steepness the corresponding motions of the float are presented in fig 9 no relationship was observed between focused wave group steepness and the peak in heave generated by the central wave crest with the largest peak generated by s2 and the smallest by s4 however larger differences and monotonic increases with respect to wave group steepness are observed in surge and pitch a 10 4 increase between s1 and s4 is observed in the peak in surge directly caused by the central wave crest of the focused wave increasing to a 172 difference in the following peak the magnitude of pitch for the first peak that followed interaction with the central wave crest demonstrated a 111 increase between s1 and s4 these results indicate that the steepness of the focused wave crest does not significantly affect the mooring load directly generated by this crest however the deviation in the float s surge and pitch response with changing wave steepness would result in an increased deviation in the mooring load measured between the 4 cases if there was to be an identical second wave later in the time series this indicates the need to consider the effect of previous waves when modelling the effect of an extreme wave as even small changes in the previous wave history could result in the float being in a significantly different location and motion state when the extreme wave arrives 6 regular constrained newwave results theoretically the cnw should have the same crest amplitude regardless of the background sea state it is embedded into fig 4 however this approach is based on linear theory and does not take into account higher order wave wave interactions that occur as waves propagate from the paddles to the focus location fig 10 shows how the measured central crest amplitude changes relative to the phase location in the regular wave at which it is constrained a clear relationship between the phase position and the generated crest amplitude can be observed as can be observed in fig 4 the trough preceding the central crest of the cnw changes slightly in both magnitude and time depending on the phase position in the regular wave into which it is constrained this affects the steepness of the cnw fig 11 shows how both the target and measured central crest steepness changes with phase position the difference between the target and measured steepness changes with both the embedded phase position and the frequency of the background regular wave tests were conducted with regular cnw as a means to systematically alter the position and motion of the model at the time where it interacted with the newwave group however the observed differences between the target and measured central crest amplitude and steepness make it difficult to separate these effects from those of changing the models position and motion on its response to the newwave group fig 12 presents how the peak mooring load generated by the regular cnw changes with the phase location in fig 13 the same load is compared to the measured amplitude of the central crest of the cnw a strong correlation can be observed between amplitude and load for f2 however a much weaker correlation is observed for f1 the r2 value of a line of best fit is 0 54 for f1 as compared to 0 87 for f2 this suggests that either the previous motions generated by regular wave f1 have a greater influence than for f2 on the load generated by the cnw or that the larger range over which the cnw amplitude varies in f1 has resulted in a non linear relation between amplitude and load fig 13 provides evidence that the former is true with different phase locations that have approximately the same amplitude generating differing loads without testing with other regular wave frequencies it is not possible to conclude whether the f1 background had a larger influence than f2 due to differences in the regular wave steepness or due to its relation to the model s resonance frequencies there is a less obvious correlation between the steepness of the cnw and the load fig 14 which is in agreement with the very small effect of crest steepness observed in the first experimental series fig 15 plots the change in maximum surge with phase position unlike with peak mooring load for the majority of phase locations the maximum surge generated by the cnw was less than that generated by the individual newwave there is also a strong dependence on the background regular wave frequency with the maximum surge generated in the f2 cases covering a larger range comparing fig 15 with fig 10 it can be observed that there is a correlation between the cnw amplitude and the peak surge for f2 although not for f1 fitting a line of best fit to amplitude against maximum surge data results in an r2 value of 0 89 for f2 compared to 0 17 for f1 this is consistent with the peak load results 7 irregular constrained newwave results the quality of wave generation was assessed for each of the 180 irregular constrained newwave by calculating the root mean square error rmse between the signal from wave gauge 6 wg6 with the target time series tts r m s e 1 n i 1 n w g 6 i t t s i 2 where n is the number of samples measured the average rmse was 0 028 m with a standard deviation of 0 003 m when compared to the h s of the underlying random sea state 0 288 m this indicates a relatively good reproduction of the input time signal as with the regular cases the main crest of the cnw is reproduced less well than the underlying irregular sea state in fig 16 the distribution of the measured embedded crest amplitudes are presented normalised with respect to the newwave theoretical crest amplitude the distribution of crest amplitudes is approximately normal with a standard deviation of 0 155 and a mean of 0 969 of the target crest amplitude in 97 of the 180 cases measured crest amplitude was within 10 of the target theoretical amplitude a similar comparison of the wave steepness of the embedded focused wave crest with the steepness of the theoretical independent newwave is shown in fig 17 the mean of this distribution is 1 25 with a standard deviation of 0 42 this distribution has a positive skew of 0 995 unlike crest amplitude the focused wave constraining process does not conserve the steepness of the focussed wave groups central crest the distribution of the target wave steepness had a mean of 1 08 standard deviation of 0 330 and a positive skew of 0 958 it can be observed that on average the embedded focused wave was steeper than the initial target 7 1 mooring load distribution the distribution of the peak mooring loads resulting from the 180 irregular cnw are presented in fig 18 loads have been normalised with respect to the peak load produced by the individual newwave the distribution has a mean of 1 11 standard deviation of 0 14 and a skew of 0 22 comparing fig 18 to the distribution of crest amplitude fig 16 and crest steepness fig 17 it cannot be concluded that the observed distribution in mooring load is due to the distribution of the cnw properties in figs 19 and 20 the measured loads are plotted against the normalised crest amplitudes and crest steepnesses respectively the lack of strong correlation in both figures suggest that the variation in properties of the generated cnw are not the only causes of the distribution in loads this suggests that the influence of the previous wave field is a significant factor demonstrating the necessity to consider the influence of this when investigating the interaction between an extreme wave and a moored floating body the distribution of the measured maximum surge generated by the cnw is plotted in fig 21 as with the other properties this is approximately normal with a mean of 1 12 of the surge generated by the individual nw a standard deviation of 0 33 and a skew of 0 076 this larger standard deviation as compared to the distributions in crest amplitudes and mooring loads is considered to be an indication that the horizontal excursion of the model is less well predicted by an individual focused wave than the maximum mooring load it also again emphasises the need to include the influence of the previous wave field when predicting response to an extreme wave 8 irregular wave results a comparison of the results from the two irregular wave experiments with the irregular cnw results identified four cases where the peak mooring load exceeded the largest measured in the cnw cases these were 1 47 1 52 1 53 and 1 60 times the load measured using the individual newwave where the largest load measured during the irregular cnw case was 1 465 the sections of the irregular wave time history that generated these four largest loads are presented in fig 22 and are compared with the measured independent newwave the time series have been shifted so that the wave crests that generated the large loads occur at t 0 the properties of these four waves have a wide range with crest amplitude ranging from 0 781 to 1 09 of the target amplitude of the nw and a crest steepness ranging from 1 01 to 2 08 times the steepness of the nw this further demonstrates the dependence of the mooring load on the previously generated model motions the variation between the irregular and cnw cases was less for the measured surge than it was for the mooring loads the largest measured value of surge was 2 31 times the maximum surge generated by the individual newwave for the irregular case and 2 23 times from the irregular cnw cases 9 conclusions results are reported from four series of experiments designed to measure the response of a taut moored floating body representing a point absorbing wave energy converter to an extreme wave tests with individual focused waves based on newwave theory demonstrated that the steepness of the main crest of the focused wave had negligible effect on the response of the floating body however the floats motion once the central crest has passed the model showed significant differences resulting from the differences in steepness this demonstrates the non linear response of the model with initially very small changes induced by changes in wave steepness resulting in significantly increased changes in motion once the wave has passed this is significant when trying to develop methods to predict dynamic model responses to extreme waves as it indicates that even small changes in previous wave conditions could have a significant effect on the position and motion of a model when interacting with the extreme wave to explore the effect of a device s load history as generated by the preceding wave field on its response to an extreme wave a newwave constrained into a series of regular and irregular waves were used in both cases differences between the target and generated constrained time series have limited the potential benefit of this approach bennett et al 2012 report a similar finding when generating constrained newwave experimentally it is potentially feasible that an iterative approach could be used to adjust the wave generator input signal to improve the agreement between the target and generated constrained newwave however this would be too time consuming when conducting enough irregular constrained newwave experiments to draw meaningful conclusions from the results the impact of this approach on the background sea state is also unknown regardless of the differences between the target and generated time series it is still concluded from the cnw experiments that the use of an independent focused wave is insufficient to properly model the response of a moored floating body such as wave energy converter to an extreme wave instead the body s load history must also be modelled comparisons between the irregular and regular cnw cases indicate that it is also insufficient to model this load history using regular waves although the use of regular waves allows for a more systematic study potentially reducing the number of test cases result here found significantly higher mooring loads and surge levels from the comparable irregular cnw cases the regular cnw results did demonstrate a dependence on the frequency of the background wave so it is possible that other frequencies would have generated loads and surges more comparable to the irregular cases however this seems unlikely considering the range of responses seen for the two frequencies tested here ideally the background wave properties associated with the largest responses to the irregular cnw could be identified and used to limit the number of cnw tests that need to be conducted attempts to do this were inconclusive however as results from the individual focused waves showed even small changes in a specific wave can result in significant difference later on any conclusion that could have been drawn would likely have been device geometry and mooring specific as well therefore making the use of such an approach limited finally results from the two 3 h long irregular wave runs found 4 times where generated mooring loads were larger than any measured in the cnw cases with the cnw approach the assumption is made that the newwave will generate the largest response with only the changes in the previous sea state being significant it can be concluded from the irregular wave cases that this is not necessarily the case and that for a particular sea state the traditional experimental approach of generating a random time series may be the better method of finding the maximum expected load and surge as this assumption is avoided the random nature of this approach however also requires multiple cases of the full length sea state to be run as opposed to the shorter time series involved with the cnw approach to gain greater certainty in what the largest expected responses are this is prohibitively expensive to do experimentally and indicates that numerical approaches validated by representative experimental results might be a better approach acknowledgements this research was conducted as part of eprsc

23680,this paper concerns experimental measurements of the interaction of a taut moored floating body representing a point absorbing wave energy converter in survivability mode with extreme waves the extreme waves are modelled in four ways newwave theory is first used to generate focused wave groups of varying steepness steepness is shown to have negligible effect on peak mooring loads but causes significant differences in the resulting motion the newwave group is then constrained into both regular and irregular background wave trains so that the floating body has a load history caused by previous waves when interacting with the focused wave group it is shown that an independent focused wave group is insufficient to properly model the extreme response of the floating body however differences between the target and measured constrained time series due to non linear wave wave interaction limited the potential benefits of this approach finally the results from these tests are compared with measurements taken using irregular waves without any deterministic focused wave groups present this comparison found cases where the floats response was greater than during any of the constrained newwave tests indicating that the assumption made that newwave will generate the largest response was incorrect in this case keywords newwave constrained newwave wave impact survivability moorings floating bodies 1 introduction floating wave energy converters must be designed to withstand the largest waves experienced during storms of magnitude equal to their design condition this forms part of a wave energy device s survivability criterion part of the dual requirements of any marine energy device the ability to extract energy in small to moderate seas while surviving more extreme conditions barstow et al 2008 p 52 achieving an understanding of the response to these extreme waves is important large degrees of uncertainty in the expected loads often lead to the use of conservative assumptions which can negatively influence the commercial viability of a device o neill et al 2006 most floating offshore wave energy converters are being designed to deploy in arrays spacing between individual devices within an array depends on many factors including maximising power generation provision of maintenance access and achieving an acceptable collision risk for this last point it is important to be able to also predict the maximum expected displacement of devices during extreme events both experimental and numerical techniques are used to model a device s response to extreme waves in both cases a deterministic focused wave group based on newwave theory is often used to generate a time series of an extreme wave newwave theory as described by tromans et al 1991 models the statistically most probable surface elevation shape associated with the occurrence of an extreme wave crest with a specified exceedance probability pinna and cassidy 2004 newwave theory has the advantage that it generates an extreme event within a relatively short time series when compared to relying on randomly occurring extreme events in an irregular time series of the sea state in question the short time series means in a correctly designed experiment that all important wave structure interactions occur before any significant influence from wave reflections from basin walls occur the wave group generated by newwave theory propagates into calm water this and again the relatively short time series involved means that newwave focused wave groups are well suited for proving validation data for computationally expensive computational fluid dynamic cfd models these advantages of using newwave focused wave groups to measure extreme wave interactions have led to the approach being used in a wide number of applications in the offshore environment extreme wave impacts on fixed cylinders relevant to a wide range of structures have been assessed both experimental and

fluid with a motion devised from newwave theory rozario et al 1993 successfully compared the loads predicted by newwave on a north sea oil platform with simulations of random seas westphalen et al 2014 conducted volume of fluid and sph cfd simulations of newwave wave groups interacting with the manchester bobber wave energy device comparing results to those from 70th scale experimental measurements stallard et al 2009b weller et al 2013 more recently newwave theory has been used to investigate the impact of extreme waves in the coastal environment borthwick et al 2006 measured wave kinematics of newwaves impacting on a 1 20 beach plane while whittaker et al 2017 measured wave runup of a plane beach focused wave groups such as those generated by newwave theory are used to represent the design load case for fixed structures stallard et al 2009b their use as design cases for dynamic structures and devices is questionable however when dynamic response to waves is expected the response to a specific extreme wave will depend not only on the load induced by the wave but the load history caused by the previous wave train pinna and cassidy 2004 this dependency is not investigated when testing with a single focused wave group the device or structure in question has a stationary initial state and only interacts with the deterministic wave crests and troughs that made up the initial part of the focused wave group before interacting with the extreme central crest constraining or embedding the newwave within a random background sea state is an approach which allows the effect that a device or structures load history has on that device or structures response to a deterministic extreme event to be investigated introduced by taylor et al 1997 a constrained newwave cnw consists of a newwave group which is constrained into an irregular background sea state with the same characteristic spectrum such that the resulting time series is statistically indistinguishable from a randomly occurring wave train the impact of the device s load history variation and the resulting distribution of the responses to the extreme wave can then be investigated by conducting multiple simulations or experiments with the focused wave group constrained into different random background time series various numerical studies have concluded that using the cnw technique is a viable alternative to conducting simulations with random irregular wave time series for example cassidy 1999 and cassidy et al 2001 demonstrated the use of cnw to determine the short term extreme response statistics of a jack up structure using 5 newwaves each constrained into 200 random backgrounds their results were found to be comparable to those found from 100 3 h simulations of random seas pinna and cassidy 2004 conducted similar simulations on a fixed monopod platform using 100 cnw cases while enderami et al 2010 modelled the extreme response of a jacket offshore platform using 200 cnw both with abaqus both compared results with simulations of 3 h long irregular sea states and found that the maximum response were of a similar magnitude bennett et al 2012 report what they believed to be the first experimental use of cnw they compared the use of an independent newwave cnw and an optimised sea state to model the rigid body motions of a travelling ship in abnormal waves where the optimised sea state requires an iterative adjustment of the phases in a random sea state so that a target extreme wave occurs the three different approaches to generating abnormal sea conditions were tested for three jonswap sea states with increasing significant wave height discrepancies between the target and generated wave were reported for the cnw which was considered to be potentially due to the combination of two wave spectra göteman et al 2015 constrained newwave into regular waves when measuring the wave load on a point absorbing wave energy device the focused wave was constrained into different phase locations within regular waves with four different periods resulting in 32 cases in total a correlation between wave height and measured mooring force is reported this paper presents a systematic study into the experimental use of independent newwave and cnw in the investigation of a moored floating body s response to an extreme wave results from four sets of experiments are reported and compared in the first series the interaction of the moored floating body with an independent newwave focused wave group was measured along with the interaction with three other focused groups of increasing steepness in the second series 24 constrained newwave cases were tested within two regular background waves in the third series the newwave was constrained into 180 unique irregular wave backgrounds the final experimental series consisted of two 3 h long irregular wave time series without any newwave group present a single sea state representing a 100 year return period at wave hub a wave energy test site of the north cornwall coast uk was used throughout the differences between the maximum mooring loads and surge measured during the four set of experiments are specific to the float geometry mooring arrangement and wave conditions tested here however by comparing the results from the four different sets of experiments conclusions are drawn and recommendations made about the application of independent and constrained newwave to the experimental determination of the extreme response of a moored floating body 2 experimental methodology the floating body tested was the same as used in hann et al 2015 but with an altered mooring arrangement fig 1 it is a 0 5 m diameter floating body consisting of a hemisphere and 0 25 m high cylinder with a dry mass of 43 2 kg and made from steel with a concrete ballast the floats centre of mass was about the central axis of the float 0 319 m from the top of the cylinder moments of inertia were ixx iyy 1 61 kg m2 and izz 1 25 kg m2 a single taut mooring was used consisting of 1 38 m of 3 mm diameter dyneema rope spring constant k 35 n mm in series with a 12 5 mm diameter linear spring k 0 066 n mm which provided the mooring s extension the initial and maximum rated length of the spring was 0 63 m and 1 145 m respectively in still water the spring was extended by 0 31 m end stops consisting of 4 dyneema ropes around the spring were installed to prevent the spring from being overextended throughout these experiments the spring was never extended to its maximum length and as such these end stops were never reached mooring loads were measured using a 500n load cell 40 mm high 44 mm diameter attached in line with the mooring to the tank floor via a 74 mm long 22 mm diameter universal joint fig 1 three 0 02 m shackles connected the spring to the load cell the spring to the mooring line and the mooring line to the float mooring loads are reported as the difference between the dynamic mooring load and the moorings static equilibrium load i e the additional load an optical tracking system was used to record the motion of the model in 6 degrees of freedom about a global coordinate system the reported motions are of the centre of mass of the model the averaged measured residual in the optical tracking system was 1 15 mm decay tests conducted on the moored float identified the system to have resonance frequencies of 0 93 hz in heave 0 75 hz in pitch and 0 07 hz in surge although the floating body and mooring are not representative of a specific full scale wave energy device the experiments are considered to be conducted at 50th scale based on the scaling of the wave conditions section 3 1 measurements were conducted in a 35 m 15 5 m ocean basin at plymouth university s coast laboratory the variable floor depth was set at 2 8 m the facility has 24 2 0 m deep hinged wave paddles across one side of the tank wave reflections are reduced using a parabolic beach and the wave paddle s active absorption the model was moored in its resting position along the centre line of the basin 18 8 m from the front of the wave paddles a series of 9 resistance type wave gauges were positioned along a line 1 46 m away from the tanks centre line the location of these gauges relative to wave paddles and the model are given in table 1 wave gauge 6 was positioned so that it was approximately aligned with the front face of the model all waves generated in this sequence of measurements were long crested and normally incident it is assumed that the waves impacting the model are identical to those recorded 1 46 m to the side of the model two further wave gauges were positioned on the tank s centre line in line with wave gauge 2 and 3 to confirm this assumption 3 newwave generation 3 1 independent newwave the first series of tests measured the response of the floating body to four independent focused wave groups the first was a newwave group generated using a pierson moskowitz pm spectrum with a peak period and wave height based on 50th scale hindcast data halcrow 2006 p 19 for a 100 year return period storm at wave hub a wave energy test facility off the north cornwall coast in the south west of the uk t z 1 99 s h s 0 288 m the theoretical amplitude of the central crest of the newwave a was set to be the largest expected amplitude in n waves as given by 1 a 2 m o ln n where m o is the zeroth moment of the spectrum hunt raby et al 2011 based on hunt raby et al 2011 n was set to 1000 representing the approximate number of waves expected in a 3 h sea state resulting in a target crest amplitude of 0 267 m for the second third and fourth focused wave groups this target crest amplitude was maintained while the peak period of the spectrum used to generate the newwave was progressively increased to increase the crest steepness ka the peak frequency multiplication factor of each of the wave groups tested are given in table 2 the theoretical focus location of each wave group is wave gauge 6 the approximate location of the front of the model when stationary fernández et al 2014 discuss various reasons why focused waves do not generally come to focus at the theoretical focus location and time as defined by linear theory this includes non linear wave wave interactions within the wave packet as investigated by baldock et al 1996 creating components that do not satisfy the linear dispersion relation as used by baldock et al 1996 and ning et al 2009 a trial and error process was used to adjust the theoretical focus location of the wave group to achieve focus at the required location 0 05 m the wave group was judged to be in focus when the surface elevation time history was symmetrical i e the troughs on either side of the main crest had the same magnitude fig 2 plots the difference between the adjusted theoretical focus location and the target actual focus location against the theoretical crest steepness an approximate linear relationship can be observed indicating the increasing influence of non linear effects as wave steepness increases 3 2 constrained newwave the cnw approach potentially provides a means to investigate the effect that a device s load history as generated by previous waves has on the response of the float to a specific extreme wave the newwave previously tested as an individual focused wave s1 was constrained into 24 regular wave and 180 irregular wave time series the methodology used to generate the cnw time sequence was based on that used by cassidy 1999 and bennett et al 2012 fig 3 presents an example of this embedding procedure for one of the irregular cases showing the initial random wave sequence the initial independent newwave and the resulting cnw the 24 regular cnw cases were generated by constraining the newwave into 12 different phase locations within the time histories of two regular waves with frequencies of f1 0 38 hz and f2 0 53 hz both had a wave height of 0 204 m this wave height is equal to h s 2 where h s is the significant wave of the 1 100 year wave from which the newwave was generated mccabe and aggidis 2009 blanco et al 2015 varying the phase location at which the newwave was constrained into the 2 regular waves systematically alters the floating body s motion at the point the focused wave interacts with the model the phase location was varied from 150 to 180 in 30 intervals fig 4 shows the newwave constrained so the central crest occurs at a phase of 0 90 and 180 within the regular wave each of the 180 different irregular background sea states into which the newwave was constrained were 120 s long the newwave s were constrained such that the main crest occurred at 60 s the background sea states were formed by generating two 3 h long irregular wave time series and splitting each of these into 90 120 s sections the two 3 h long time series were generated using a pierson moskowitz spectrum and the same tz and hs values as used to generate the newwave each of the 180 constrained newwave time series were used as an input into the basin s wave generation software with the theoretical focus location set to be the location of the front face of the model in its static location unlike with the four individual focused wave groups it was not practical to use a trial and error approach to adjust the theoretical focus location of the 24 regular and 180 irregular constrained cases to achieve an improved focus 4 error assessment 4 1 repeatability the repeatability of the wave generation was assessed by repeating 1 of the 180 irregular constrained cases six times fig 5 shows the measured wave at wg6 of these 6 repeats around the cnw the average rmse between the 1st wave and the following 5 repeats wave excluding the first 20 s of the time series was 0 012 m indicating a good level of repeatability in wave generation a similar level of repeatability was observed in the mooring loads with an average rmse value between the first measurement and the following 5 repeats of 0 79 n compare to an average peak load of 18 42 n 4 2 mooring extension and load comparison the extension of the mooring has been calculated by translating the optical tracking system measurements to the model s mooring attachment point plots of this measured mooring extension against the measured mooring load for all 180 irregular cnw cases generated an average gradient of the line of best fit of 0 065 n mm this was consistent with the measured spring constant of the mooring spring the average coefficient of determination r 2 for these lines of best fit was 0 981 the same measurements are presented in fig 6 for the peak loads and mooring extensions generated by the embedded wave in the 180 irregular cnw experiments the line of best fit s gradient is also 0 065 n mm with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 966 although this fit is less good it still suggests that the spring remained linear and within its elastic regime during when the model was hit by the cnw 5 independent focused wave results fig 7 shows the measured time history of the 4 independent focused wave groups the measured main crest amplitude is presented in table 2 the crest amplitude progressively increases as steepness increases with the percentage difference between measured and target amplitude increasing from 2 2 to 19 1 the wave troughs immediately preceding and following the main crest are assuming linear wave theory also expected to have the same elevation across the four wave groups fig 7 shows that as wave steepness increased the measured group troughs were actually progressively less deep than the target waves this observed behaviour of the main crest and troughs is in agreement with that investigated by ning et al 2009 who concluded that this is due to non linear wave wave interactions particularly 3rd order table 2 also presented the measured wave steepness the same 4 wave groups were tested in hann et al 2015 where wave number k was calculated from the peak frequency of the measured wave group assuming linear wave theory here wave number k is calculated based again on the assumption of linear wave theory but with a wave period taken to be twice the difference between the central wave crest and the preceding wave trough 2 δ t this was done to allow direct comparison with the steepness of constrained newwaves measured in later test series fig 8 presents the mooring loads measured during the individual focused wave tests mooring load has been normalised with respect to the static mooring load overall peak load increased with wave steepness however this load increase was only 1 3 between s1 and s4 compared to a 16 5 increase in crest elevation and a 74 9 increase in wave steepness there was also no appreciable difference in the peak load generated by s2 and s3 with the generated loads lying between that generated by s1 and s4 this trend matches that observed in hann et al 2015 where snatch loading generated when a taut mooring with reduced capacity compared to the one used in these tests reached its end stop was only observed to increase by 4 7 as steepness increased between the same four wave groups the difference in the mooring load peak subsequent to the largest peak at around 2 6 s increases to 8 8 between s1 and s4 this increase was monotonic in nature with the load progressively increasing with wave steepness the corresponding motions of the float are presented in fig 9 no relationship was observed between focused wave group steepness and the peak in heave generated by the central wave crest with the largest peak generated by s2 and the smallest by s4 however larger differences and monotonic increases with respect to wave group steepness are observed in surge and pitch a 10 4 increase between s1 and s4 is observed in the peak in surge directly caused by the central wave crest of the focused wave increasing to a 172 difference in the following peak the magnitude of pitch for the first peak that followed interaction with the central wave crest demonstrated a 111 increase between s1 and s4 these results indicate that the steepness of the focused wave crest does not significantly affect the mooring load directly generated by this crest however the deviation in the float s surge and pitch response with changing wave steepness would result in an increased deviation in the mooring load measured between the 4 cases if there was to be an identical second wave later in the time series this indicates the need to consider the effect of previous waves when modelling the effect of an extreme wave as even small changes in the previous wave history could result in the float being in a significantly different location and motion state when the extreme wave arrives 6 regular constrained newwave results theoretically the cnw should have the same crest amplitude regardless of the background sea state it is embedded into fig 4 however this approach is based on linear theory and does not take into account higher order wave wave interactions that occur as waves propagate from the paddles to the focus location fig 10 shows how the measured central crest amplitude changes relative to the phase location in the regular wave at which it is constrained a clear relationship between the phase position and the generated crest amplitude can be observed as can be observed in fig 4 the trough preceding the central crest of the cnw changes slightly in both magnitude and time depending on the phase position in the regular wave into which it is constrained this affects the steepness of the cnw fig 11 shows how both the target and measured central crest steepness changes with phase position the difference between the target and measured steepness changes with both the embedded phase position and the frequency of the background regular wave tests were conducted with regular cnw as a means to systematically alter the position and motion of the model at the time where it interacted with the newwave group however the observed differences between the target and measured central crest amplitude and steepness make it difficult to separate these effects from those of changing the models position and motion on its response to the newwave group fig 12 presents how the peak mooring load generated by the regular cnw changes with the phase location in fig 13 the same load is compared to the measured amplitude of the central crest of the cnw a strong correlation can be observed between amplitude and load for f2 however a much weaker correlation is observed for f1 the r2 value of a line of best fit is 0 54 for f1 as compared to 0 87 for f2 this suggests that either the previous motions generated by regular wave f1 have a greater influence than for f2 on the load generated by the cnw or that the larger range over which the cnw amplitude varies in f1 has resulted in a non linear relation between amplitude and load fig 13 provides evidence that the former is true with different phase locations that have approximately the same amplitude generating differing loads without testing with other regular wave frequencies it is not possible to conclude whether the f1 background had a larger influence than f2 due to differences in the regular wave steepness or due to its relation to the model s resonance frequencies there is a less obvious correlation between the steepness of the cnw and the load fig 14 which is in agreement with the very small effect of crest steepness observed in the first experimental series fig 15 plots the change in maximum surge with phase position unlike with peak mooring load for the majority of phase locations the maximum surge generated by the cnw was less than that generated by the individual newwave there is also a strong dependence on the background regular wave frequency with the maximum surge generated in the f2 cases covering a larger range comparing fig 15 with fig 10 it can be observed that there is a correlation between the cnw amplitude and the peak surge for f2 although not for f1 fitting a line of best fit to amplitude against maximum surge data results in an r2 value of 0 89 for f2 compared to 0 17 for f1 this is consistent with the peak load results 7 irregular constrained newwave results the quality of wave generation was assessed for each of the 180 irregular constrained newwave by calculating the root mean square error rmse between the signal from wave gauge 6 wg6 with the target time series tts r m s e 1 n i 1 n w g 6 i t t s i 2 where n is the number of samples measured the average rmse was 0 028 m with a standard deviation of 0 003 m when compared to the h s of the underlying random sea state 0 288 m this indicates a relatively good reproduction of the input time signal as with the regular cases the main crest of the cnw is reproduced less well than the underlying irregular sea state in fig 16 the distribution of the measured embedded crest amplitudes are presented normalised with respect to the newwave theoretical crest amplitude the distribution of crest amplitudes is approximately normal with a standard deviation of 0 155 and a mean of 0 969 of the target crest amplitude in 97 of the 180 cases measured crest amplitude was within 10 of the target theoretical amplitude a similar comparison of the wave steepness of the embedded focused wave crest with the steepness of the theoretical independent newwave is shown in fig 17 the mean of this distribution is 1 25 with a standard deviation of 0 42 this distribution has a positive skew of 0 995 unlike crest amplitude the focused wave constraining process does not conserve the steepness of the focussed wave groups central crest the distribution of the target wave steepness had a mean of 1 08 standard deviation of 0 330 and a positive skew of 0 958 it can be observed that on average the embedded focused wave was steeper than the initial target 7 1 mooring load distribution the distribution of the peak mooring loads resulting from the 180 irregular cnw are presented in fig 18 loads have been normalised with respect to the peak load produced by the individual newwave the distribution has a mean of 1 11 standard deviation of 0 14 and a skew of 0 22 comparing fig 18 to the distribution of crest amplitude fig 16 and crest steepness fig 17 it cannot be concluded that the observed distribution in mooring load is due to the distribution of the cnw properties in figs 19 and 20 the measured loads are plotted against the normalised crest amplitudes and crest steepnesses respectively the lack of strong correlation in both figures suggest that the variation in properties of the generated cnw are not the only causes of the distribution in loads this suggests that the influence of the previous wave field is a significant factor demonstrating the necessity to consider the influence of this when investigating the interaction between an extreme wave and a moored floating body the distribution of the measured maximum surge generated by the cnw is plotted in fig 21 as with the other properties this is approximately normal with a mean of 1 12 of the surge generated by the individual nw a standard deviation of 0 33 and a skew of 0 076 this larger standard deviation as compared to the distributions in crest amplitudes and mooring loads is considered to be an indication that the horizontal excursion of the model is less well predicted by an individual focused wave than the maximum mooring load it also again emphasises the need to include the influence of the previous wave field when predicting response to an extreme wave 8 irregular wave results a comparison of the results from the two irregular wave experiments with the irregular cnw results identified four cases where the peak mooring load exceeded the largest measured in the cnw cases these were 1 47 1 52 1 53 and 1 60 times the load measured using the individual newwave where the largest load measured during the irregular cnw case was 1 465 the sections of the irregular wave time history that generated these four largest loads are presented in fig 22 and are compared with the measured independent newwave the time series have been shifted so that the wave crests that generated the large loads occur at t 0 the properties of these four waves have a wide range with crest amplitude ranging from 0 781 to 1 09 of the target amplitude of the nw and a crest steepness ranging from 1 01 to 2 08 times the steepness of the nw this further demonstrates the dependence of the mooring load on the previously generated model motions the variation between the irregular and cnw cases was less for the measured surge than it was for the mooring loads the largest measured value of surge was 2 31 times the maximum surge generated by the individual newwave for the irregular case and 2 23 times from the irregular cnw cases 9 conclusions results are reported from four series of experiments designed to measure the response of a taut moored floating body representing a point absorbing wave energy converter to an extreme wave tests with individual focused waves based on newwave theory demonstrated that the steepness of the main crest of the focused wave had negligible effect on the response of the floating body however the floats motion once the central crest has passed the model showed significant differences resulting from the differences in steepness this demonstrates the non linear response of the model with initially very small changes induced by changes in wave steepness resulting in significantly increased changes in motion once the wave has passed this is significant when trying to develop methods to predict dynamic model responses to extreme waves as it indicates that even small changes in previous wave conditions could have a significant effect on the position and motion of a model when interacting with the extreme wave to explore the effect of a device s load history as generated by the preceding wave field on its response to an extreme wave a newwave constrained into a series of regular and irregular waves were used in both cases differences between the target and generated constrained time series have limited the potential benefit of this approach bennett et al 2012 report a similar finding when generating constrained newwave experimentally it is potentially feasible that an iterative approach could be used to adjust the wave generator input signal to improve the agreement between the target and generated constrained newwave however this would be too time consuming when conducting enough irregular constrained newwave experiments to draw meaningful conclusions from the results the impact of this approach on the background sea state is also unknown regardless of the differences between the target and generated time series it is still concluded from the cnw experiments that the use of an independent focused wave is insufficient to properly model the response of a moored floating body such as wave energy converter to an extreme wave instead the body s load history must also be modelled comparisons between the irregular and regular cnw cases indicate that it is also insufficient to model this load history using regular waves although the use of regular waves allows for a more systematic study potentially reducing the number of test cases result here found significantly higher mooring loads and surge levels from the comparable irregular cnw cases the regular cnw results did demonstrate a dependence on the frequency of the background wave so it is possible that other frequencies would have generated loads and surges more comparable to the irregular cases however this seems unlikely considering the range of responses seen for the two frequencies tested here ideally the background wave properties associated with the largest responses to the irregular cnw could be identified and used to limit the number of cnw tests that need to be conducted attempts to do this were inconclusive however as results from the individual focused waves showed even small changes in a specific wave can result in significant difference later on any conclusion that could have been drawn would likely have been device geometry and mooring specific as well therefore making the use of such an approach limited finally results from the two 3 h long irregular wave runs found 4 times where generated mooring loads were larger than any measured in the cnw cases with the cnw approach the assumption is made that the newwave will generate the largest response with only the changes in the previous sea state being significant it can be concluded from the irregular wave cases that this is not necessarily the case and that for a particular sea state the traditional experimental approach of generating a random time series may be the better method of finding the maximum expected load and surge as this assumption is avoided the random nature of this approach however also requires multiple cases of the full length sea state to be run as opposed to the shorter time series involved with the cnw approach to gain greater certainty in what the largest expected responses are this is prohibitively expensive to do experimentally and indicates that numerical approaches validated by representative experimental results might be a better approach acknowledgements this research was conducted as part of eprsc

results obtained here can provide some guidance in connection with manufacturing procedures at the initial design stage of the msfp keywords metallic strip flexible pipe reliability analysis monte carlo simulation form partial safety factors 1 introduction metallic strip flexible pipes msfp represent a novel category of composite pipes similar to classic flexible pipes they are composed of an inner pe layer an outer pe sheath and helical metallic layers the difference from other flexible pipes is that the metallic layers in msfp are of a simple type they do not contain the complicated interlocked carcass layer the pressure armour layer and the tension armor layers which are the essential constituents in flexible pipelines api rp 17b 2008 instead the msfp only consist of helically wound steel strips this simplified configuration makes msfp much more cost effective due to the convenient manufacturing process its typical cross section and manufacturing process are shown in fig 1 compared with the widely applied reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtp msfp do not only possess the good properties of rtp but they can also contribute a lot to improve on bottom stability properties because of their relatively heavier weight therefore for shallow water applications where the operating requirements are not so demanding msfp may represent a first choice of pipe concept although msfp are designed primarily for shallow water applications its collapse capacity with respect to external overpressure is still a great challenge due to the lack of a carcass layer during operation msfp might face a number of uncertainties that also represent a challenge this implies that application of design safety factors which are adequate in order to ensure a sufficient reliability level is of key importance hence the reliability level of msfp when subjected to external pressure needs to be quantified and kept at a high enough level appropriate design safety factors should be prescribed in order to reach this target safety level but also in order to avoid unnecessary conservatism during the last decades comprehend amount of research has been performed within the area of pipeline reliability analysis babu and srivastava 2010 addressed the reliability associated with buried flexible pipe soil systems tee et al 2013 investigated the reliability level associated with underground flexible pipes extensive analyses relating to reliability of pipelines with corrosion defects can also be found in the existing literature ahammed and melchers 1996 teixeira et al 2008 leira et al 2016 larin et al 2016 as for reliability based safety factors to be applied for pipeline design boyer et al 1997 undertook the calibration of design safety factors for a composite pipe in order to illustrate the different steps of the procedure leira et al 2005a 2005b proposed a structural reliability based approach for fatigue analysis of flexible pipes and established the relationship between the fatigue safety factors and the inherent failure probability based on the above method dos santos loureiro filho et al 2012 performed a calibration of safety factors to be applied for fatigue analysis of flexible riser tension armours avrithi and ayyub 2010 described the development of design equations according to the load and resistance factor design lrfd method for loads that cause primary stress for different levels of piping operation and illustrated the partial safety factors for different values of the target reliability index in the same year machida et al 2010 illustrated the evaluation of partial safety factors for parameters related to flaw evaluation of pipes and proposed the important matter which should be paid attention to in the setup of the safety factors used in flaw evaluation fairchild et al 2016 described the use of the previous full scale tests data to develop a safety factor for strain based engineering critical assessment of pipelines likewise in combination with experimental data schillo et al 2017 suggested a reliability based calibration method of safety factors for the unstiffened composite cylinder shell relying on extensive measurements regarding the statistical characteristics of the geometrical and material properties of 11 previously tested composite cylinders as msfp is a relatively new type of pipe concept its mechanical behavior is still not fully understood not to mention the inherent reliability level during operation according to the best knowledge of the authors there are hardly any publications dealing with calibration of safety factors for msfp as the collapse pressure is of primary concern for the ultimate capacity of pipelines in operation the safety factors associated with design to withstand external pressure are calibrated in the present paper a simplified mathematical model for calculating the collapse pressure of msfp can be obtained from recent work performed by bai et al 2016a for the classic analytical model associated with elastic buckling of a ring or a cylinder the calculation is straightforward however the plastic behavior of the pe material has a significant impact on the collapse pressure the nonlinearity of the pe material which is taken into account in bai s 2016a capacity model improves the accuracy of the results but also introduces some challenges in relation to the reliability based safety factor analysis the purpose of this paper is to propose a calibration process for msfp by using a combination of monte carlo simulation and form the method was referenced and extended from the reliability analysis of rtp in ref bai et al 2017 sensitivity analyses are conducted with respect to the key parameters which influence the values of the safety factors the design safety factor for msfp is recommended at the end of the paper the factor is to be seen in light of the design safety factor of 1 5 zhu 1993 which is widely applied for conventional pure metallic structures pipes 2 calibration process for safety factors uncertainties are always involved when conducting strength evaluation and structural analysis before starting the calibration the basic variables corresponding to the design parameters should be determined and the uncertainties related to the prediction of resistance and load effect should be taken into account as the msfp is composed of many layers the basic variables are too many to calculate the associated probability exactly when using full integration or general reliability methods the accuracy and feasibility of the well known first and second order reliability method form sorm in estimating the results can be rather dubious in the present case in addition an iterative method is required in order to calculate the resistance of the msfp this makes it very demanding to apply form sorm techniques directly here the monte carlo method can be regarded as a good approach in order to estimate the statistical properties of the resistance term first groups of random sample values of the basic variables related to the resistance of the msfp can be generated according to their respectively stochastic models by introducing all those generated variables and uncertainty factors into the resistance model a corresponding array of the collapse pressure can be obtained through the statistical analysis the distribution type and the corresponding parameters of the resistance term can be obtained with the statistical models of the resistance and load random variables r and s being known it is easy to calculate the failure probability p f and the corresponding reliability index β 1 p f p r o b r s 2 β φ 1 p f where φ 1 is the inverse of the standard normal distribution function as the limit state function has a simple form with statistical models established through the above simulation steps the well known methods mentioned above can now be used to calculated the reliability such as form sorm importance sampling etc among these methods form is particularly popular as it is easy to understand and efficient to apply furthermore it can provide relatively accurate result the reliability index in form is obtained by calculating the shortest distance from the origin point to the limit state surface in the standard normal space and the corresponding point in the limit state surface is referred to as the design point this point is also crucial in order to calculate the partial safety factors the partial safety factors used in the load and resistance partial safety factor design lrfd equation are expressed as 3 r γ r γ s s where γ r and γ s are the partial safety factors for resistance and load respectively in order to reach the given target reliability index β t arg the mean value of the resistance force μ r can be adjusted while both r s coefficient of variation δ r and s s distribution parameters μ s δ s are kept unchanged after reaching the target reliability level the final coordinates of the design point are obtained i e r and s the partial safety factors can then be calculated through the following equations 4 γ r r k r 5 γ s s s k where r k and s k are the specified characteristic values of the resistance and load effect respectively the subscript k represents the given probability of exceedance that is aimed at the characteristic value can be obtained from the particular fractiles of the relevant density functions usually upper and lower fractiles are applied in this paper a lower fractile for the resistance where k equals 0 025 is employed while for the load effect an upper fractile that k equals 0 975 is selected in order to ensure a safe design it should also be mentioned that the characteristic value r k changes with the adjustment of μ r during the calibration process by multiplying the two partial safety factors the design safety factor k can then be obtained as follows 6 k γ r γ s a flow chart which represents the calculation process for the safety factors is illustrated in fig 2 3 calibration for msfp under external pressure 3 1 mechanical model the collapse pressure of msfp when subjected to external pressure can be obtained from the formula given by bai et al 2016a as 7 p c r i 1 n i p c r s t e e l i j 1 n j p c r p e j where i and j are the layer number for steel reinforcement layers and pe tubes n i and n j are their respective number of layers as it is reasonable to regard the steel strips as pure elastic in the buckling analysis bai et al 2016a the contribution from the steel strip layers can be expressed as 8 p c r s t e e l i φ n e s t e i b h 3 4 l p r i 3 where n is the number of strips in the layer l p is the pitch e ste i is the elastic modulus of the steel material b and h are the width and thickness of the steel strip φ is a factor that depends on the lay angle and the moment of inertia for the section r i is the mean radius of the ith layer for the pe layers the tangent modulus method can be applied in order to calculate their contributions 9 p c r p e j 3 e j t f i j f r j f 3 where the script f refers to the fth increment step e j t is the tangent modulus of the jth layer i j is the equivalent moment of inertia and r j is the updated mean radius of the tube the method for calculation of the pe tube s capacity is illustrated in detail in ref bai et al 2015 the general idea can be summarized as follows the assumed radial deformation is applied to the outside surface of the tube step by step when the deformation is given at each step the radial strain of the tube can be calculated and the radial stress can then be obtained from the given stress strain relationship of the pe material the tangent modulus the current layer thickness and its mean radius can then be updated the compressive pressure i e the assumed external pressure is obtained by accumulating the stress in the radial direction by substituting the updated tangent modulus and physical dimensions at each step into eq 9 the plastic buckling pressure under the assumed deformation is calculated if the calculated plastic buckling pressure corresponding to the assumed deformation is equal to the compressive pressure this pressure is registered as the ultimate strength for the tube a diagram which illustrates the calculation process is shown in fig 3 by summing the contributions from all the separate layers the collapse pressure of the msfp is obtained the pipe s performance function g on bearing the collapse pressure can be written as 10 g r s where r represents the resistance capacity of the pipe p cr and s refers to the external pressure that the pipe is subjected to 3 2 stochastic model the stochastic models for basic random variables associated with the resistance term are shown in table 1 the structure and geometry of the msfp studied in the present paper are the same as those in ref bai et al 2016a the distribution types of the geometrical and material properties of the pipe are determined according to the recommendations of dnv 1992 the subscript i and o of r in table 1 represents inner and outer radius values respectively the first subscript represents the pe layer s location while the second one represents the reference diameter for instance r ii indicates the inner radius of the inner pe tube while r io is the outer radius of the inner pe tube α is the winding angle of the steel strips and μ p e is the poisson s ratio of the pe material in order to take the pe material s plasticity and parameter uncertainty into account its properties can be modeled with nonlinear material parameters the stress strain relationship can be expressed as follows gibson et al 2000 11 σ e 0 κ 1 e κ ε where σ and ε are the stress and strain κ is a constant which can be determined from a given experimental curve the tangent modulus derived from eq 11 can be expressed as 12 e t e 0 e κ ε the stress strain curve of the pe material is in accordance with the one given in ref bai et al 2016a the experimental data and the fitted curve are shown in fig 4 the parameter κ in eq 11 determines the trend of the curve for simplicity the pe material s uncertainty can be modeled by regarding κ as a normally distributed variable the mean value of κ is set to be 46 from the fitted curve and its coefficient of variation cov is selected as 0 05 which can give a reasonable variation range for the resulting material curves the collapse pressure calculated based on eq 7 is usually used as a lower limit value for the msfp the initial ovality of the pipe is not taken into account in this mechanical model but contributes significantly to the model uncertainty the distribution parameters of the model uncertainty can hence be selected according to the effect of the uncertainty associated with the initial ovality of the pipe based on the limited amount of measured data for the initial ovality of the msfp in ref bai et al 2016b its schematic density function can be drawn with a mean value which is found to be around 0 5 through comparison between variation of fem calculation results experiments and the ovality model the mean value for the model uncertainty variable is selected as 1 05 and its corresponding cov is chosen as 0 1 its distribution function is still represented by a normal model by using monte carlo simulation and substituting all the sample values of the basic variables into the mechanical model of the resistance a series of random sample values for collapse pressure is obtained the probability distribution function pdf of the resistance pressure can be acquired by using curve fitting as shown in fig 5 the statistical properties of the resistance variable obtained from the above stochastic models are listed in table 2 according to ref dnv 1992 a log normal distribution can be used for the load variable the mean value can be determined based on the relevant water depth which is about 100 m in the present study the distribution parameters for the load effect are shown in table 3 3 3 analysis and discussion of the results the safety factors are closely related to the target reliablity index β t arg and their relationships are shown in fig 6 from this graph it can be seen that γ r increases with the increase of β t arg while the value of γ s is almost unchanged this is due to the fact that when increasing the target reliability the mean value of the random variable r has to increase as well as its corresponding characteristic value however the design point value calculated in this process does not change that much resulting in an obvious increase of γ r it can also be noticed that the increasing trend of k and γ r in this case exhibit a parabolic appearance and the growth rate is particularly high when β t arg is large generally speaking the larger β t arg is the greater the design safety factor k see fig 6 will be which implies a smaller value of the failure probability for the pipe the relationship between the design safety factor k and the reliability of the pipe which is defined as 1 0 minus the failure probability is shown in fig 7 as the innermost pe layer gives the highest contribution to the collapse pressure in present pipe the effect of the variation of its inner radius on the design safety factor is investigated further although the initial ovality of the msfp does not play that a significant role with respect to the ultimate strength as it does for pure metallic pipes it still has a relatively dominating effect as compared to other factors thus the effect of changing the cov of the two above mentioned basic variables are investigated when a target reliability index is given the design safety factor k would most likely increase with the covs of the basic variables related to the resistance term in this part β t arg is selected as 4 0 to study the effect the actual coefficient of variation for the ultimate strength of the msfp would need to be controlled during the manufacturing process itself therefore the analysis is mainly focused on the cov of the resistance i e δ r where values below 0 25 are considered as the occurrence of a δ r higher than 0 25 is hardly possible in reality the relationship between δ r and the covs for the model uncertainty i e δ mod and for the inner radius i e δ i i are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it is seen that the inner radius uncertainty has the highest influence on δ r variation of the inner radius does not only have an effect on the mean radius of the inner tube but also on its thickness which are the two key aspects that determine the collapse capacity of the tube the relationship between the design safety factor k and the cov for both the model uncertainty and the inner radius are shown in fig 9 a and b not unexpectedly the design safety factor k increases with the increase of δ mod and δ i i and the curve shows an exponential format if k is kept as constant while the cov of the related uncertainty increases the changing trend of the reliability index β can also be helpful in estimating the effect it can be seen from fig 9 a and b that with a constant k value β decreases with the increase of δ mod δ i i it is of interest to study the combined effect of those two factors δ mod and δ i i so the variation of k with different joint covs for both the two variables is illustrated in fig 10 as shown in the mesh plot the design safety factor k increases with δ mod and δ i i taking a close look on the graph it is observed that an interesting phenomenon occurs the design safety factor k almost pops up abruptly for the highest values of the coefficients of variation this further shows that when δ mod and δ i i are both relatively large the increasing speed of the design safety factor k grows dramatically every subsequent small increment for either δ mod or δ i i will result in several times enlargement of k meanwhile the design safety factor k is closely related to the production cost of the pipe in order to lower costs the coefficient of variation for the uncertainties especially for the inner radius uncertainty of the pipe should be controlled strictly during the manufacturing process 4 effects of different distribution types as the distribution types of the resistance and load effect might also have some impact on the calculated results the three mostly applied distribution types are selected in order to study this sensitivity the subtitles of the distribution types in this part are abbreviated where n represents the normal distribution while ln represents the log normal model the first abbreviation in the subtitles refers to the resistance distribution while the second one refers to the load effect distribution 4 1 n n distributions when the normally distributed parameters for resistance and load effect are known it is easy to calculate the reliablity index 13 β μ r μ s μ r δ r 2 μ s δ s 2 with the target reliablity index β t arg given which can be regarded as a known quantity in eq 13 μ r can be solved out from this quadratic equation however there are two roots of this equation and the selection of the value should be paid special attention to generally μ r should be larger than that of μ s in our case the mean value for the resistance is selected as 14 μ r μ s 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 1 β t arg 2 δ s 2 1 1 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 the design point of the resistance can be calculated as 15 r μ r β t arg 2 μ r 2 δ r 2 μ r μ s and the characteristic value for the normally distributed resistance is expressed as 16 r k μ r 1 k r δ r where k r is the parameter that determines the particular fractiles of the random variable in the present case 1 96 is selected in order to guarantee that at least 97 5 of the population is expected to fall above or below this fractile by substituting eqs 15 and 16 into eq 4 the partial safety factor for the resistance can be obtained as 17 γ r 1 k r δ r 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 1 μ s μ r by using the same method γ s can be expressed as 18 γ s 1 β t arg 2 δ s 2 μ r μ s 1 1 k s δ s where k s has the same meaning as that of k r and the expression for s k is 19 s k μ s 1 k s δ s as the critical design value for r and s in this study actually equals to each other the design safety factor can be calculated as 20 k γ r γ s r k s k μ r 1 k r δ r μ s 1 k s δ s by substituting μ r into the above equation k can be expressed in a more straigthforward format 21 k 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 1 β t arg 2 δ s 2 1 1 1 k r δ r 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 1 k s δ s the relationships between the safety factors and the target reliability index are shown in fig 11 compared with the results obtained for the n ln distributions in part 3 3 they almost exhibit the same trend this implies that the slight distribution difference between the load variables might not make a big difference to the calibrated safety factors when their resistance variables are both normally distributed as the expressions for γ r and γ s are not as intuitive as that for k and in order to have a more visual display of the variation as a function of δ r and δ s the corresponding mesh plots are illustrated in fig 12 x a x b note that the target reliability index is still assumed to be 4 for γ r it seems that δ r does not make a big difference to its value while for γ s it first shows an increasing trend when δ s is small and then a negative trend when δ s reaches a certain value with the increase of δ s γ r increases while γ s decreases most of the time even if γ s is decreasing in a certain region the design safety factor k will still remain increase as shown in fig 12 x c 4 2 ln ln distributions according to manufacturing experience the distribution type of the pipe s initial ovality is also likely to be log normal by changing the statistical model of the model uncertainty while keeping the other basic variables unchanged the distribution type for the whole resistance can also be changed in this case r and s are both assumed to follow log normal distribution when using the function lognrnd mu sigma in matlab to generate the random values it should be paid attention to that mu and sigma are the mean and standard deviation of the associated transformed normal variable therefore with the mean value μ and coefficient of variation δ of a log normal distribution known they should first be transformed using the following equations 22 μ ln x i ln μ 1 δ 2 23 σ ln x i ln 1 δ 2 where the obtained μ ln x i and σ ln x i are the input parameters that correspond to mu and sigma as the calibration process for ln ln distributions is also quite straightforward some derivations can be obtained directly with the target reliablity β t arg known the logarithmic mean value of resistance μ ln r can be derived as 24 μ ln r μ ln s β t arg 2 σ ln s 2 σ ln r 2 where μ ln s σ ln s and σ ln r can be calculated from eqs 22 and 23 when their corresponding mean values and coefficients of variation are given the relationship between the design safety factor k and the target reliablity β t arg can be expressed as 25 k exp β t arg 2 σ ln s 2 σ ln r 2 k r σ ln r k s σ ln s it can be seen from eq 25 that the value increases with β t arg in an exponential way and this is verified by the results from the calculations which are shown in fig 13 as seen from eq 25 σ ln s and σ ln r which are directly related to δ s and δ r are the key factors that affect k in turn δ r is closely related to the cov of the inner radius and model uncertainty the relationship between the design safety factor k and δ mod as well as δ i i are shown in fig 14 where the target reliability index is still kept as 4 this mesh plot appears to be more like a portion from a concave surface as compared with the one in fig 10 the larger δ mod and δ i i are the larger the growth rate for the design safety factor becomes the combined effect of δ r and δ s are illustrated in fig 15 when there is no uncertainty associated with both the load effect and resistance variables the design safety factor equals 1 generally the design safety factor increases for increasing values of δ r and δ s however it is noted that the values at the left and right corner points are higher than the maximum point along the diagonal this may seem peculiar but it should be kept in mind that the reliability index is constant throughout the considered ranges of the coefficients of variation this artifact is accordingly due to the changing positions of the characteristic values for the resistance being different in different regions of the diagram 4 3 ln gumbel distributions the gumbel distribution is frequently used for load effects in particular when extreme values are considered for the gumbel distribution distinction should be made between minima and maxima extreme value distributions in our case the maxima should be modeled and the density function applied during the form calculation process is expressed as 26 f x max x u α α e α x u e α x u where the two distribution parameters can be obtained from the following expressions 27 α π 6 σ 28 u μ γ α where σ is the standard deviation of the random variable γ is the euler constant the version used in matlab is suitable for modeling minima however the mirror image of this distribution can be used see eqs 29 and 30 to obtain the inverse of the maxima cumulative distribution function in order to acquire its corresponding characteristic value s k when calculating the safety factors 29 f x max x u α f x min x u 1 α 30 f x max x u α 1 f x min x u 1 α the results in fig 16 show that the variations of γ r and γ s are different from the above three cases in this case the curve for γ r changes a little while the one for γ s increases significantly which is in contrast to the other cases this is due to the obvious increase for both r k and the design values when the target reliability index increases resulting in a small change of their ratio anyhow the design safety factor k is monotonously increasing as for the above three cases 4 4 comparison of results comparison between the results which are obtained by application of different distribution types are shown in figs 17 and 19 it can be observed from fig 17 that in the whole process the design safety factors which correspond to the n n distributions have the highest values while the ones for the ln gumbel distributions have the lowest values different distribution types bring about different tendencies of the calibrated results and this phenomenon can be explained as follows suppose the probability distribution functions for the resistance and load variables are f r r and f s s respectively and the failure probability of the pipe is expressed as 31 p f r s f r r f s s d r d s 0 1 f s r f r r d r where f s ˑ is the cumulative distribution function of the load effect based on a geometrical interpretation of eq 31 which is shown in fig 18 the failure probability of the pipe equals the enclosed area under the two curves of 1 f s r and f r r the different distribution types can result in different shapes and sizes of the overlapping area for those two curves the larger the area is the higher the failure probability will be accordingly this would be reflected in higher values of the design safety factors which are applied in order to reach the same target reliability level taking the n ln and ln ln cases as examples the density function for normally distributed resistance has far higher values than that of the log normal for low resistance values provided they have the same mean value and cov which results in a larger overlap area and accordingly higher values of the design safety factors it should also be noticed that for low values of the target reliability index the discrepancy between the design safety factors for the four different cases are not that significant with the increase of the reliability index the discrepancy gets more and more pronounced this demonstrates that when the reliability level is demanding the selection of the distribution types for both the resistance and load effect should be paid special attention to in order to obtain trustworthy and accurate results fig 19 shows the design safety factor k vs reliability i e 1 0 minus the failure probability for the four cases when the design safety factor reaches to a certain value it will not make a big difference on the reliability of the pipe as the failure probability of the structure reaches smaller and smaller values which could almost be negligible with respect to practical engineering this suggests that selecting too high values of the design safety factors lead to unnecessary conservatism 5 design safety factor for msfp relative to 1 5 design safety factor for metallic pipes even though the applied statistical models are selected based on engineering experience and design specifications the lack of statistical data for the msfp can still make a difference with respect to the safety factors in the present section the design safety factor for the msfp which implies the same reliability level as for metallic pipes with the widely used safety factor of 1 5 zhu 1993 is considered since the log normal distribution for the resistance and load effect are both highly recommended by the relevant specifications the combination of ln ln distributions is accordingly assumed at present the load effect ln δ s μ s applied for the metallic pipe and the msfp are assumed to be the same while their resistance pressures are assumed to follow different log normal distributions with ln δ r 0 μ r 0 for the metallic pipe and ln δ r 1 μ r 1 for the msfp with the distribution parameters given the reliability index for the metallic pipe in this specified working condition can be obtained from the following equation 32 β ln μ r 0 μ s 1 δ s 2 1 δ r 0 2 ln 1 δ r 0 2 1 δ s 2 the target reliability index for msfp can then be defined as the one acquired from eq 32 in order to reach the same reliability level substituting the corresponding statistical parameters and the calculated reliability index into eq 25 the design safety factor k 1 for the msfp can be obtained as the direct expression for k 1 is complicated the design safety factor for the metallic pipe k 0 can be introduced into the expression to simplify its format and also to illustrate their relationship as the target reliability index for metallic pipes in this specified condition is just assumed to be the corresponding calculated result from eq 32 the formula for k 0 can be written as 33 k 0 μ r 0 μ s 1 δ s 2 1 δ r 0 2 exp k f ln 1 δ r 0 2 ln 1 δ s 2 where k r and k s are both assumed to be equal to a common value k f for simplicity through formula transformation and simplification k 1 can be expressed as 34 k 1 k 0 exp ln k 0 k f a c 1 b c a c k f a b where a b c are the associated variances of the normal variables which represent the logarithm of the lognormal variables and are expressed as 34a a ln 1 δ r 0 2 34b b ln 1 δ r 1 2 34c c ln 1 δ s 2 the coefficient of variation for resistance of metallic pipes is typically selected to be 0 03 jones 1978 and for load effects the value is usually around 0 1 the relationship between the cov of the resistance of the msfp and the design safety factor is shown in fig 20 the abscissa in this graph starts at the value of the cov which equals to that of the corresponding steel material and it can be seen that the design safety factor for the msfp increases with δ r 1 in an exponential manner for the msfp δ r 1 as calculated according to the suggested statistical model is about 0 17 the corresponding design safety factor is then seen to be around 2 thus this value could be recommended as the one for msfp s design 6 conclusions in this paper safety factors for metallic strip flexible pipes subjected to external pressure are calibrated and the calibration process is illustrated in some detail the reliability based method which is presented serves as a useful tool in order to calibrate the safety factors for composite pipes this applies in particular to cases where there are a large number of random variables and where iterations in relation to the mathematical model are required the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the design safety factors are closely related to the target reliability index and the cov of basic variables generally the design safety factors increase with the target reliability index and the covs of the random variables for msfp the cov of the pipe s inner radius plays a particularly important role in affecting the calibrated results and its scatter should be controlled carefully during the manufacturing process 2 when the reliability level is not that demanding the distinction between the results calibrated by application of different distribution types are not that remarkable however when the msfp is required to reach a high target reliability level the distribution types of the random variables should be selected carefully in order to obtain a much more trustworthy result 3 a design safety factor 2 is recommended to be used for design of msfp in practical engineering this is found to provide the same reliability level as that for conventional metallic pipes for which a design safety factor of 1 5 is widely applied the random variables selected in this paper might not be the optimal choice and more data collection and statistical analysis relating to the uncertainty modeling should be conducted as the full statistical scatter associated with msfp s collapse pressure has not yet been sufficiently tested to the present day there is still a lack of verified statistical models to be applied for the purpose of calibration if the scatter of msfp s strength can be controlled or improved during manufacturing in the near future the magnitude of the design safety factor recommended above can be reduced more suitable values can then be applied in order to avoid unnecessary conservatism acknowledgement one of the authors t l expresses her gratitude to the joint doctoral training program of zhejiang

results obtained here can provide some guidance in connection with manufacturing procedures at the initial design stage of the msfp keywords metallic strip flexible pipe reliability analysis monte carlo simulation form partial safety factors 1 introduction metallic strip flexible pipes msfp represent a novel category of composite pipes similar to classic flexible pipes they are composed of an inner pe layer an outer pe sheath and helical metallic layers the difference from other flexible pipes is that the metallic layers in msfp are of a simple type they do not contain the complicated interlocked carcass layer the pressure armour layer and the tension armor layers which are the essential constituents in flexible pipelines api rp 17b 2008 instead the msfp only consist of helically wound steel strips this simplified configuration makes msfp much more cost effective due to the convenient manufacturing process its typical cross section and manufacturing process are shown in fig 1 compared with the widely applied reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtp msfp do not only possess the good properties of rtp but they can also contribute a lot to improve on bottom stability properties because of their relatively heavier weight therefore for shallow water applications where the operating requirements are not so demanding msfp may represent a first choice of pipe concept although msfp are designed primarily for shallow water applications its collapse capacity with respect to external overpressure is still a great challenge due to the lack of a carcass layer during operation msfp might face a number of uncertainties that also represent a challenge this implies that application of design safety factors which are adequate in order to ensure a sufficient reliability level is of key importance hence the reliability level of msfp when subjected to external pressure needs to be quantified and kept at a high enough level appropriate design safety factors should be prescribed in order to reach this target safety level but also in order to avoid unnecessary conservatism during the last decades comprehend amount of research has been performed within the area of pipeline reliability analysis babu and srivastava 2010 addressed the reliability associated with buried flexible pipe soil systems tee et al 2013 investigated the reliability level associated with underground flexible pipes extensive analyses relating to reliability of pipelines with corrosion defects can also be found in the existing literature ahammed and melchers 1996 teixeira et al 2008 leira et al 2016 larin et al 2016 as for reliability based safety factors to be applied for pipeline design boyer et al 1997 undertook the calibration of design safety factors for a composite pipe in order to illustrate the different steps of the procedure leira et al 2005a 2005b proposed a structural reliability based approach for fatigue analysis of flexible pipes and established the relationship between the fatigue safety factors and the inherent failure probability based on the above method dos santos loureiro filho et al 2012 performed a calibration of safety factors to be applied for fatigue analysis of flexible riser tension armours avrithi and ayyub 2010 described the development of design equations according to the load and resistance factor design lrfd method for loads that cause primary stress for different levels of piping operation and illustrated the partial safety factors for different values of the target reliability index in the same year machida et al 2010 illustrated the evaluation of partial safety factors for parameters related to flaw evaluation of pipes and proposed the important matter which should be paid attention to in the setup of the safety factors used in flaw evaluation fairchild et al 2016 described the use of the previous full scale tests data to develop a safety factor for strain based engineering critical assessment of pipelines likewise in combination with experimental data schillo et al 2017 suggested a reliability based calibration method of safety factors for the unstiffened composite cylinder shell relying on extensive measurements regarding the statistical characteristics of the geometrical and material properties of 11 previously tested composite cylinders as msfp is a relatively new type of pipe concept its mechanical behavior is still not fully understood not to mention the inherent reliability level during operation according to the best knowledge of the authors there are hardly any publications dealing with calibration of safety factors for msfp as the collapse pressure is of primary concern for the ultimate capacity of pipelines in operation the safety factors associated with design to withstand external pressure are calibrated in the present paper a simplified mathematical model for calculating the collapse pressure of msfp can be obtained from recent work performed by bai et al 2016a for the classic analytical model associated with elastic buckling of a ring or a cylinder the calculation is straightforward however the plastic behavior of the pe material has a significant impact on the collapse pressure the nonlinearity of the pe material which is taken into account in bai s 2016a capacity model improves the accuracy of the results but also introduces some challenges in relation to the reliability based safety factor analysis the purpose of this paper is to propose a calibration process for msfp by using a combination of monte carlo simulation and form the method was referenced and extended from the reliability analysis of rtp in ref bai et al 2017 sensitivity analyses are conducted with respect to the key parameters which influence the values of the safety factors the design safety factor for msfp is recommended at the end of the paper the factor is to be seen in light of the design safety factor of 1 5 zhu 1993 which is widely applied for conventional pure metallic structures pipes 2 calibration process for safety factors uncertainties are always involved when conducting strength evaluation and structural analysis before starting the calibration the basic variables corresponding to the design parameters should be determined and the uncertainties related to the prediction of resistance and load effect should be taken into account as the msfp is composed of many layers the basic variables are too many to calculate the associated probability exactly when using full integration or general reliability methods the accuracy and feasibility of the well known first and second order reliability method form sorm in estimating the results can be rather dubious in the present case in addition an iterative method is required in order to calculate the resistance of the msfp this makes it very demanding to apply form sorm techniques directly here the monte carlo method can be regarded as a good approach in order to estimate the statistical properties of the resistance term first groups of random sample values of the basic variables related to the resistance of the msfp can be generated according to their respectively stochastic models by introducing all those generated variables and uncertainty factors into the resistance model a corresponding array of the collapse pressure can be obtained through the statistical analysis the distribution type and the corresponding parameters of the resistance term can be obtained with the statistical models of the resistance and load random variables r and s being known it is easy to calculate the failure probability p f and the corresponding reliability index β 1 p f p r o b r s 2 β φ 1 p f where φ 1 is the inverse of the standard normal distribution function as the limit state function has a simple form with statistical models established through the above simulation steps the well known methods mentioned above can now be used to calculated the reliability such as form sorm importance sampling etc among these methods form is particularly popular as it is easy to understand and efficient to apply furthermore it can provide relatively accurate result the reliability index in form is obtained by calculating the shortest distance from the origin point to the limit state surface in the standard normal space and the corresponding point in the limit state surface is referred to as the design point this point is also crucial in order to calculate the partial safety factors the partial safety factors used in the load and resistance partial safety factor design lrfd equation are expressed as 3 r γ r γ s s where γ r and γ s are the partial safety factors for resistance and load respectively in order to reach the given target reliability index β t arg the mean value of the resistance force μ r can be adjusted while both r s coefficient of variation δ r and s s distribution parameters μ s δ s are kept unchanged after reaching the target reliability level the final coordinates of the design point are obtained i e r and s the partial safety factors can then be calculated through the following equations 4 γ r r k r 5 γ s s s k where r k and s k are the specified characteristic values of the resistance and load effect respectively the subscript k represents the given probability of exceedance that is aimed at the characteristic value can be obtained from the particular fractiles of the relevant density functions usually upper and lower fractiles are applied in this paper a lower fractile for the resistance where k equals 0 025 is employed while for the load effect an upper fractile that k equals 0 975 is selected in order to ensure a safe design it should also be mentioned that the characteristic value r k changes with the adjustment of μ r during the calibration process by multiplying the two partial safety factors the design safety factor k can then be obtained as follows 6 k γ r γ s a flow chart which represents the calculation process for the safety factors is illustrated in fig 2 3 calibration for msfp under external pressure 3 1 mechanical model the collapse pressure of msfp when subjected to external pressure can be obtained from the formula given by bai et al 2016a as 7 p c r i 1 n i p c r s t e e l i j 1 n j p c r p e j where i and j are the layer number for steel reinforcement layers and pe tubes n i and n j are their respective number of layers as it is reasonable to regard the steel strips as pure elastic in the buckling analysis bai et al 2016a the contribution from the steel strip layers can be expressed as 8 p c r s t e e l i φ n e s t e i b h 3 4 l p r i 3 where n is the number of strips in the layer l p is the pitch e ste i is the elastic modulus of the steel material b and h are the width and thickness of the steel strip φ is a factor that depends on the lay angle and the moment of inertia for the section r i is the mean radius of the ith layer for the pe layers the tangent modulus method can be applied in order to calculate their contributions 9 p c r p e j 3 e j t f i j f r j f 3 where the script f refers to the fth increment step e j t is the tangent modulus of the jth layer i j is the equivalent moment of inertia and r j is the updated mean radius of the tube the method for calculation of the pe tube s capacity is illustrated in detail in ref bai et al 2015 the general idea can be summarized as follows the assumed radial deformation is applied to the outside surface of the tube step by step when the deformation is given at each step the radial strain of the tube can be calculated and the radial stress can then be obtained from the given stress strain relationship of the pe material the tangent modulus the current layer thickness and its mean radius can then be updated the compressive pressure i e the assumed external pressure is obtained by accumulating the stress in the radial direction by substituting the updated tangent modulus and physical dimensions at each step into eq 9 the plastic buckling pressure under the assumed deformation is calculated if the calculated plastic buckling pressure corresponding to the assumed deformation is equal to the compressive pressure this pressure is registered as the ultimate strength for the tube a diagram which illustrates the calculation process is shown in fig 3 by summing the contributions from all the separate layers the collapse pressure of the msfp is obtained the pipe s performance function g on bearing the collapse pressure can be written as 10 g r s where r represents the resistance capacity of the pipe p cr and s refers to the external pressure that the pipe is subjected to 3 2 stochastic model the stochastic models for basic random variables associated with the resistance term are shown in table 1 the structure and geometry of the msfp studied in the present paper are the same as those in ref bai et al 2016a the distribution types of the geometrical and material properties of the pipe are determined according to the recommendations of dnv 1992 the subscript i and o of r in table 1 represents inner and outer radius values respectively the first subscript represents the pe layer s location while the second one represents the reference diameter for instance r ii indicates the inner radius of the inner pe tube while r io is the outer radius of the inner pe tube α is the winding angle of the steel strips and μ p e is the poisson s ratio of the pe material in order to take the pe material s plasticity and parameter uncertainty into account its properties can be modeled with nonlinear material parameters the stress strain relationship can be expressed as follows gibson et al 2000 11 σ e 0 κ 1 e κ ε where σ and ε are the stress and strain κ is a constant which can be determined from a given experimental curve the tangent modulus derived from eq 11 can be expressed as 12 e t e 0 e κ ε the stress strain curve of the pe material is in accordance with the one given in ref bai et al 2016a the experimental data and the fitted curve are shown in fig 4 the parameter κ in eq 11 determines the trend of the curve for simplicity the pe material s uncertainty can be modeled by regarding κ as a normally distributed variable the mean value of κ is set to be 46 from the fitted curve and its coefficient of variation cov is selected as 0 05 which can give a reasonable variation range for the resulting material curves the collapse pressure calculated based on eq 7 is usually used as a lower limit value for the msfp the initial ovality of the pipe is not taken into account in this mechanical model but contributes significantly to the model uncertainty the distribution parameters of the model uncertainty can hence be selected according to the effect of the uncertainty associated with the initial ovality of the pipe based on the limited amount of measured data for the initial ovality of the msfp in ref bai et al 2016b its schematic density function can be drawn with a mean value which is found to be around 0 5 through comparison between variation of fem calculation results experiments and the ovality model the mean value for the model uncertainty variable is selected as 1 05 and its corresponding cov is chosen as 0 1 its distribution function is still represented by a normal model by using monte carlo simulation and substituting all the sample values of the basic variables into the mechanical model of the resistance a series of random sample values for collapse pressure is obtained the probability distribution function pdf of the resistance pressure can be acquired by using curve fitting as shown in fig 5 the statistical properties of the resistance variable obtained from the above stochastic models are listed in table 2 according to ref dnv 1992 a log normal distribution can be used for the load variable the mean value can be determined based on the relevant water depth which is about 100 m in the present study the distribution parameters for the load effect are shown in table 3 3 3 analysis and discussion of the results the safety factors are closely related to the target reliablity index β t arg and their relationships are shown in fig 6 from this graph it can be seen that γ r increases with the increase of β t arg while the value of γ s is almost unchanged this is due to the fact that when increasing the target reliability the mean value of the random variable r has to increase as well as its corresponding characteristic value however the design point value calculated in this process does not change that much resulting in an obvious increase of γ r it can also be noticed that the increasing trend of k and γ r in this case exhibit a parabolic appearance and the growth rate is particularly high when β t arg is large generally speaking the larger β t arg is the greater the design safety factor k see fig 6 will be which implies a smaller value of the failure probability for the pipe the relationship between the design safety factor k and the reliability of the pipe which is defined as 1 0 minus the failure probability is shown in fig 7 as the innermost pe layer gives the highest contribution to the collapse pressure in present pipe the effect of the variation of its inner radius on the design safety factor is investigated further although the initial ovality of the msfp does not play that a significant role with respect to the ultimate strength as it does for pure metallic pipes it still has a relatively dominating effect as compared to other factors thus the effect of changing the cov of the two above mentioned basic variables are investigated when a target reliability index is given the design safety factor k would most likely increase with the covs of the basic variables related to the resistance term in this part β t arg is selected as 4 0 to study the effect the actual coefficient of variation for the ultimate strength of the msfp would need to be controlled during the manufacturing process itself therefore the analysis is mainly focused on the cov of the resistance i e δ r where values below 0 25 are considered as the occurrence of a δ r higher than 0 25 is hardly possible in reality the relationship between δ r and the covs for the model uncertainty i e δ mod and for the inner radius i e δ i i are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it is seen that the inner radius uncertainty has the highest influence on δ r variation of the inner radius does not only have an effect on the mean radius of the inner tube but also on its thickness which are the two key aspects that determine the collapse capacity of the tube the relationship between the design safety factor k and the cov for both the model uncertainty and the inner radius are shown in fig 9 a and b not unexpectedly the design safety factor k increases with the increase of δ mod and δ i i and the curve shows an exponential format if k is kept as constant while the cov of the related uncertainty increases the changing trend of the reliability index β can also be helpful in estimating the effect it can be seen from fig 9 a and b that with a constant k value β decreases with the increase of δ mod δ i i it is of interest to study the combined effect of those two factors δ mod and δ i i so the variation of k with different joint covs for both the two variables is illustrated in fig 10 as shown in the mesh plot the design safety factor k increases with δ mod and δ i i taking a close look on the graph it is observed that an interesting phenomenon occurs the design safety factor k almost pops up abruptly for the highest values of the coefficients of variation this further shows that when δ mod and δ i i are both relatively large the increasing speed of the design safety factor k grows dramatically every subsequent small increment for either δ mod or δ i i will result in several times enlargement of k meanwhile the design safety factor k is closely related to the production cost of the pipe in order to lower costs the coefficient of variation for the uncertainties especially for the inner radius uncertainty of the pipe should be controlled strictly during the manufacturing process 4 effects of different distribution types as the distribution types of the resistance and load effect might also have some impact on the calculated results the three mostly applied distribution types are selected in order to study this sensitivity the subtitles of the distribution types in this part are abbreviated where n represents the normal distribution while ln represents the log normal model the first abbreviation in the subtitles refers to the resistance distribution while the second one refers to the load effect distribution 4 1 n n distributions when the normally distributed parameters for resistance and load effect are known it is easy to calculate the reliablity index 13 β μ r μ s μ r δ r 2 μ s δ s 2 with the target reliablity index β t arg given which can be regarded as a known quantity in eq 13 μ r can be solved out from this quadratic equation however there are two roots of this equation and the selection of the value should be paid special attention to generally μ r should be larger than that of μ s in our case the mean value for the resistance is selected as 14 μ r μ s 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 1 β t arg 2 δ s 2 1 1 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 the design point of the resistance can be calculated as 15 r μ r β t arg 2 μ r 2 δ r 2 μ r μ s and the characteristic value for the normally distributed resistance is expressed as 16 r k μ r 1 k r δ r where k r is the parameter that determines the particular fractiles of the random variable in the present case 1 96 is selected in order to guarantee that at least 97 5 of the population is expected to fall above or below this fractile by substituting eqs 15 and 16 into eq 4 the partial safety factor for the resistance can be obtained as 17 γ r 1 k r δ r 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 1 μ s μ r by using the same method γ s can be expressed as 18 γ s 1 β t arg 2 δ s 2 μ r μ s 1 1 k s δ s where k s has the same meaning as that of k r and the expression for s k is 19 s k μ s 1 k s δ s as the critical design value for r and s in this study actually equals to each other the design safety factor can be calculated as 20 k γ r γ s r k s k μ r 1 k r δ r μ s 1 k s δ s by substituting μ r into the above equation k can be expressed in a more straigthforward format 21 k 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 1 β t arg 2 δ s 2 1 1 1 k r δ r 1 β t arg 2 δ r 2 1 k s δ s the relationships between the safety factors and the target reliability index are shown in fig 11 compared with the results obtained for the n ln distributions in part 3 3 they almost exhibit the same trend this implies that the slight distribution difference between the load variables might not make a big difference to the calibrated safety factors when their resistance variables are both normally distributed as the expressions for γ r and γ s are not as intuitive as that for k and in order to have a more visual display of the variation as a function of δ r and δ s the corresponding mesh plots are illustrated in fig 12 x a x b note that the target reliability index is still assumed to be 4 for γ r it seems that δ r does not make a big difference to its value while for γ s it first shows an increasing trend when δ s is small and then a negative trend when δ s reaches a certain value with the increase of δ s γ r increases while γ s decreases most of the time even if γ s is decreasing in a certain region the design safety factor k will still remain increase as shown in fig 12 x c 4 2 ln ln distributions according to manufacturing experience the distribution type of the pipe s initial ovality is also likely to be log normal by changing the statistical model of the model uncertainty while keeping the other basic variables unchanged the distribution type for the whole resistance can also be changed in this case r and s are both assumed to follow log normal distribution when using the function lognrnd mu sigma in matlab to generate the random values it should be paid attention to that mu and sigma are the mean and standard deviation of the associated transformed normal variable therefore with the mean value μ and coefficient of variation δ of a log normal distribution known they should first be transformed using the following equations 22 μ ln x i ln μ 1 δ 2 23 σ ln x i ln 1 δ 2 where the obtained μ ln x i and σ ln x i are the input parameters that correspond to mu and sigma as the calibration process for ln ln distributions is also quite straightforward some derivations can be obtained directly with the target reliablity β t arg known the logarithmic mean value of resistance μ ln r can be derived as 24 μ ln r μ ln s β t arg 2 σ ln s 2 σ ln r 2 where μ ln s σ ln s and σ ln r can be calculated from eqs 22 and 23 when their corresponding mean values and coefficients of variation are given the relationship between the design safety factor k and the target reliablity β t arg can be expressed as 25 k exp β t arg 2 σ ln s 2 σ ln r 2 k r σ ln r k s σ ln s it can be seen from eq 25 that the value increases with β t arg in an exponential way and this is verified by the results from the calculations which are shown in fig 13 as seen from eq 25 σ ln s and σ ln r which are directly related to δ s and δ r are the key factors that affect k in turn δ r is closely related to the cov of the inner radius and model uncertainty the relationship between the design safety factor k and δ mod as well as δ i i are shown in fig 14 where the target reliability index is still kept as 4 this mesh plot appears to be more like a portion from a concave surface as compared with the one in fig 10 the larger δ mod and δ i i are the larger the growth rate for the design safety factor becomes the combined effect of δ r and δ s are illustrated in fig 15 when there is no uncertainty associated with both the load effect and resistance variables the design safety factor equals 1 generally the design safety factor increases for increasing values of δ r and δ s however it is noted that the values at the left and right corner points are higher than the maximum point along the diagonal this may seem peculiar but it should be kept in mind that the reliability index is constant throughout the considered ranges of the coefficients of variation this artifact is accordingly due to the changing positions of the characteristic values for the resistance being different in different regions of the diagram 4 3 ln gumbel distributions the gumbel distribution is frequently used for load effects in particular when extreme values are considered for the gumbel distribution distinction should be made between minima and maxima extreme value distributions in our case the maxima should be modeled and the density function applied during the form calculation process is expressed as 26 f x max x u α α e α x u e α x u where the two distribution parameters can be obtained from the following expressions 27 α π 6 σ 28 u μ γ α where σ is the standard deviation of the random variable γ is the euler constant the version used in matlab is suitable for modeling minima however the mirror image of this distribution can be used see eqs 29 and 30 to obtain the inverse of the maxima cumulative distribution function in order to acquire its corresponding characteristic value s k when calculating the safety factors 29 f x max x u α f x min x u 1 α 30 f x max x u α 1 f x min x u 1 α the results in fig 16 show that the variations of γ r and γ s are different from the above three cases in this case the curve for γ r changes a little while the one for γ s increases significantly which is in contrast to the other cases this is due to the obvious increase for both r k and the design values when the target reliability index increases resulting in a small change of their ratio anyhow the design safety factor k is monotonously increasing as for the above three cases 4 4 comparison of results comparison between the results which are obtained by application of different distribution types are shown in figs 17 and 19 it can be observed from fig 17 that in the whole process the design safety factors which correspond to the n n distributions have the highest values while the ones for the ln gumbel distributions have the lowest values different distribution types bring about different tendencies of the calibrated results and this phenomenon can be explained as follows suppose the probability distribution functions for the resistance and load variables are f r r and f s s respectively and the failure probability of the pipe is expressed as 31 p f r s f r r f s s d r d s 0 1 f s r f r r d r where f s ˑ is the cumulative distribution function of the load effect based on a geometrical interpretation of eq 31 which is shown in fig 18 the failure probability of the pipe equals the enclosed area under the two curves of 1 f s r and f r r the different distribution types can result in different shapes and sizes of the overlapping area for those two curves the larger the area is the higher the failure probability will be accordingly this would be reflected in higher values of the design safety factors which are applied in order to reach the same target reliability level taking the n ln and ln ln cases as examples the density function for normally distributed resistance has far higher values than that of the log normal for low resistance values provided they have the same mean value and cov which results in a larger overlap area and accordingly higher values of the design safety factors it should also be noticed that for low values of the target reliability index the discrepancy between the design safety factors for the four different cases are not that significant with the increase of the reliability index the discrepancy gets more and more pronounced this demonstrates that when the reliability level is demanding the selection of the distribution types for both the resistance and load effect should be paid special attention to in order to obtain trustworthy and accurate results fig 19 shows the design safety factor k vs reliability i e 1 0 minus the failure probability for the four cases when the design safety factor reaches to a certain value it will not make a big difference on the reliability of the pipe as the failure probability of the structure reaches smaller and smaller values which could almost be negligible with respect to practical engineering this suggests that selecting too high values of the design safety factors lead to unnecessary conservatism 5 design safety factor for msfp relative to 1 5 design safety factor for metallic pipes even though the applied statistical models are selected based on engineering experience and design specifications the lack of statistical data for the msfp can still make a difference with respect to the safety factors in the present section the design safety factor for the msfp which implies the same reliability level as for metallic pipes with the widely used safety factor of 1 5 zhu 1993 is considered since the log normal distribution for the resistance and load effect are both highly recommended by the relevant specifications the combination of ln ln distributions is accordingly assumed at present the load effect ln δ s μ s applied for the metallic pipe and the msfp are assumed to be the same while their resistance pressures are assumed to follow different log normal distributions with ln δ r 0 μ r 0 for the metallic pipe and ln δ r 1 μ r 1 for the msfp with the distribution parameters given the reliability index for the metallic pipe in this specified working condition can be obtained from the following equation 32 β ln μ r 0 μ s 1 δ s 2 1 δ r 0 2 ln 1 δ r 0 2 1 δ s 2 the target reliability index for msfp can then be defined as the one acquired from eq 32 in order to reach the same reliability level substituting the corresponding statistical parameters and the calculated reliability index into eq 25 the design safety factor k 1 for the msfp can be obtained as the direct expression for k 1 is complicated the design safety factor for the metallic pipe k 0 can be introduced into the expression to simplify its format and also to illustrate their relationship as the target reliability index for metallic pipes in this specified condition is just assumed to be the corresponding calculated result from eq 32 the formula for k 0 can be written as 33 k 0 μ r 0 μ s 1 δ s 2 1 δ r 0 2 exp k f ln 1 δ r 0 2 ln 1 δ s 2 where k r and k s are both assumed to be equal to a common value k f for simplicity through formula transformation and simplification k 1 can be expressed as 34 k 1 k 0 exp ln k 0 k f a c 1 b c a c k f a b where a b c are the associated variances of the normal variables which represent the logarithm of the lognormal variables and are expressed as 34a a ln 1 δ r 0 2 34b b ln 1 δ r 1 2 34c c ln 1 δ s 2 the coefficient of variation for resistance of metallic pipes is typically selected to be 0 03 jones 1978 and for load effects the value is usually around 0 1 the relationship between the cov of the resistance of the msfp and the design safety factor is shown in fig 20 the abscissa in this graph starts at the value of the cov which equals to that of the corresponding steel material and it can be seen that the design safety factor for the msfp increases with δ r 1 in an exponential manner for the msfp δ r 1 as calculated according to the suggested statistical model is about 0 17 the corresponding design safety factor is then seen to be around 2 thus this value could be recommended as the one for msfp s design 6 conclusions in this paper safety factors for metallic strip flexible pipes subjected to external pressure are calibrated and the calibration process is illustrated in some detail the reliability based method which is presented serves as a useful tool in order to calibrate the safety factors for composite pipes this applies in particular to cases where there are a large number of random variables and where iterations in relation to the mathematical model are required the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the design safety factors are closely related to the target reliability index and the cov of basic variables generally the design safety factors increase with the target reliability index and the covs of the random variables for msfp the cov of the pipe s inner radius plays a particularly important role in affecting the calibrated results and its scatter should be controlled carefully during the manufacturing process 2 when the reliability level is not that demanding the distinction between the results calibrated by application of different distribution types are not that remarkable however when the msfp is required to reach a high target reliability level the distribution types of the random variables should be selected carefully in order to obtain a much more trustworthy result 3 a design safety factor 2 is recommended to be used for design of msfp in practical engineering this is found to provide the same reliability level as that for conventional metallic pipes for which a design safety factor of 1 5 is widely applied the random variables selected in this paper might not be the optimal choice and more data collection and statistical analysis relating to the uncertainty modeling should be conducted as the full statistical scatter associated with msfp s collapse pressure has not yet been sufficiently tested to the present day there is still a lack of verified statistical models to be applied for the purpose of calibration if the scatter of msfp s strength can be controlled or improved during manufacturing in the near future the magnitude of the design safety factor recommended above can be reduced more suitable values can then be applied in order to avoid unnecessary conservatism acknowledgement one of the authors t l expresses her gratitude to the joint doctoral training program of zhejiang

materials have received great attention as structural constituents exposed to intense temperature conditions such as aerospace nuclear plants and other engineering applications thus vibration responses structural members with fgms is of considerable importance in both research and industrial fields in stiffened plate use of stiffeners makes it possible to sustain highly directional loads

laminated composite plates and stiffened panels under axial compression recently thang and nguyen thoi 2016 presented a new approach for nonlinear dynamic analysis of sigmoid fg toroidal shell segments with axial and circumferential stiffeners consequently to accurately achieve the response of thin fg plates the free vibration analysis becomes essential hence this paper presents an exact solution to investigate free vibration characteristic of sigmoid fg plates by using the classical plate theory the plate is reinforced by stiffeners in both longitudinal and transversal directions the properties of fg plate are assumed to be graded inthe thickness direction according to a simple sigmoid law distribution and to be temperature dependent through the navier procedure the natural frequencies of simply supported sigmoid fg rectangular plates were obtained after validating the formulation and method of solution the influences of the stiffeners plate length to thickness ratio

are microscopically inhomogeneous and assumed to be a kind of composite material the mechanical properties vary smoothly and continuously from one surface to the other this is achieved by gradually varying the volume fraction of the constituent materials a mixture of ceramic and metal with a continuously varying volume fraction can be easily manufactured there are several types of fgms as power fgm exponential fgm and sigmoid fgm consider a fg plate with length a width b and thickness h as shown in fig 1 assume that the material is isotropic and the grading is assumed to be only through the thickness in fact the top z h 2 and bottom z h 2 surfaces of plate are metal rich whereas the middle surface z 0 is ceramic rich see fig 2 the variation of the volume fraction of the ceramic constituent through the thickness is shown in fig 3 young s modulus e z poisson s ratio e z and mass density ρ z are assumed to vary continuously through the thickness with the power law 1 e z e c e m

results in this subsection to verify the accuracy of the present method a comparison study of the results is performed with those available in the literate the material properties are given in table 1 in this comparison the volume fraction of ceramic v c z is assumed as 37 v c z 2 z h 2 h n firstly the natural frequencies of simply supported tial4v aluminum oxide fg plate without stiffeners are compared with those presented by some references hasani baferani et al 2011 he et al 2001 zhao et al 2009 in table 2 secondly the obtained results are compared with the results reported by hasani baferani et al 2011 in table 3 for the fundamental frequency parameters for simply supported a l a l 2 o 3 fg plate without stiffeners from these tables the present results have a good agreement with the previous study and the small differences are due to the variation of poisson ratio 4 2 results for natural vibration response in this subsection the numerical results have been presented for sigmoid fg plate with longitudinal and transversal stiffeners in x and y directions the material properties have been listed in table 4 the geometrical parameters of stiffeners are given by s x s y 2 h h x h y 2 h d x a n x d y b n y n x n y are the number of the longitudinal and transversal stiffeners respectively table 5 illustrates the fundamental frequency parameter ω ω π 2 a 2 h ρ m e m for a simply supported sigmoid fg plate consisting of s i 3 n 4 s u s 304 materials with various the number of stiffeners n x n y temperature change t k the thickness length ratio a h 150 and aspect ratio a b 1 are considered the volume fraction index n is taken to be 1 in this table the first two dimensionless frequencies of plate are shown it can be seen that the fundamental frequency increases significantly as n x n y in creases from 0 to 15 this implies that the plate becomes a stiffer behavior when the number of the stiffener is increased fig 4 also shows the effect of number of stiffeners on first non dimensional frequency parameter ω a 2 π 2 ρ m e m h of sigmoid fg plate versus the length thickness ratio as expected these curves become higher when the number of stiffeners n x n y increases n x n y 0 5 10 15 the prime reason is that with increasing of n x n y the presence of stiffeners makes plates to become stiffer also the variation of natural frequency versus the variation of length thickness ratio is also shown in fig 4 in figure it is clear that as the thickness of the plate decreases the effect of non homogeneity in the material properties of the plate on the natural frequency becomes more considerable it can be concluded that the variation of the ratio a h and the stiffeners of the sigmoid fg plate have significant effects on the frequency parameter fig 5 shows the effect of temperature change on the frequency parameter of sigmoid fg plates under different sets of environment condition t 300 k 400 k and 500 k the material properties of plate are assumed to be temperature dependent the number of stiffeners are taken to be 10 it can be seen that an initial extension occurs as the temperature increases and the first frequency parameter is reduced with increasing in temperature further numerical illustrations for free vibration behavior of s fg plate are also derived and plotted in figs 6 and 7 the variation of dimensionless fundamental frequency versus length thickness ratio of s fg plate with different volume fraction indexes n 0 0 5 1 2 and is depicted in fig 6 according to the figure and as expected the fundamental frequency in s fg plate with fully ceramic plate is greater and for the case of fully metal plate it is smaller than that for the other volume fraction indexes this is understandable because the ceramic plate is the ones with the higher stiffness than the metal plate in addition regardless of case of volume fraction index by increasing the length thickness ratio fundamental frequency converges to a constant value this convergence in n is faster whereas in the n 0 it is slower than that for the other power indexes fig 7 demonstrates the effect of mode number on the variation of the dimensionless fundamental frequency of simply supported s fg plate versus length to thickness ratios regardless of length to thickness ratios of plate dimensionless fundamental frequency increases when m n increases moreover as depicted the increase the length to thickness ratio of plate causes to increase the fundamental frequency which converges to a constant value 5 conclusions in this work an exact solution was developed to investigate the free vibration of s fg plate reinforced by the longitudinal and transversal stiffeners based the classical plate theory material properties of plate are assumed to be temperature dependent and graded in the thickness direction according to a sigmoid power law distribution the governing equation of motion are solved by navier solution for simply supported boundary condition from the numerical illustration the variations of the natural frequencies of the s fg plates against the length to thickness ratio material graded index mode buckling and temperature rise were analyzed the influences of the temperature dependence of the material properties on the dimensionless fundamental frequency were also studied based on the presented results it can be concluded that by increasing the power index of s fgm fundamental frequency converges to a constant value the dimensionless fundamental frequencies decrease by increasing the length to thickness ratio a h the obtained frequency parameters based on the power index n 0 are the greatest ones and those of the n are the smallest ones by increasing the temperature rise fundamental frequency parameters increase monotonically for the thin plate fundamental frequency parameters are more affected by number of stiffeners acknowledgments this research was supported by a grant nrf 2017r1a4a1015660 from nrf

functionally graded materials fgms was proposed in 1984 by materials scientists in the sendai institute area as a means of preparing thermal barrier materials koizumi 1993 obata and noda 1993 these materials have received great attention as structural constituents exposed to intense temperature conditions such as aerospace nuclear plants and other engineering applications thus vibration responses structural members with fgms is of considerable importance in both research and industrial fields in stiffened plate use of stiffeners makes it possible to sustain highly directional loads it can provide protection against damage and crack growth under compressive loads up to now stiffened plates designed with different techniques bring many benefits like reduction in material usage cost better performance etc plates reinforced by stiffeners represent a class of structural components that are widely used in many engineering applications such as ship decks bridges aircraft buildings railway wagons highway bridges elevated roadways etc some valuable studies have been carried out in vibration and buckling analysis of fg plates shells and beams yang and shen 2002 analyzed

laminated composite plates and stiffened panels under axial compression recently thang and nguyen thoi 2016 presented a new approach for nonlinear dynamic analysis of sigmoid fg toroidal shell segments with axial and circumferential stiffeners consequently to accurately achieve the response of thin fg plates the free vibration analysis becomes essential hence this paper presents an exact solution to investigate free vibration characteristic of sigmoid fg plates by using the classical plate theory the plate is reinforced by stiffeners in both longitudinal and transversal directions the properties of fg plate are assumed to be graded inthe thickness direction according to a simple sigmoid law distribution and to be temperature dependent through the navier procedure the natural frequencies of simply supported sigmoid fg rectangular plates were obtained after validating the formulation and method of solution the influences of the stiffeners plate length to thickness ratio plate aspect ratio as well as volume fraction index on the vibration responses of the sigmoid fg plates are studied in detail 2 problem formulation 2 1 sigmoid functionally graded plates in fgms which are microscopically inhomogeneous and assumed to be a kind of composite material the mechanical properties vary smoothly and continuously from one surface to the other this is achieved by gradually varying the volume fraction of the constituent materials a mixture of ceramic and metal with a continuously varying volume fraction can be easily manufactured there are several types of fgms as power fgm exponential fgm and sigmoid fgm consider a fg plate with length a width b and thickness h as shown in fig 1 assume that the material is isotropic and the grading is assumed to be only through the

results in this subsection to verify the accuracy of the present method a comparison study of the results is performed with those available in the literate the material properties are given in table 1 in this comparison the volume fraction of ceramic v c z is assumed as 37 v c z 2 z h 2 h n firstly the natural frequencies of simply supported tial4v aluminum oxide fg plate without stiffeners are compared with those presented by some references hasani baferani et al 2011 he et al 2001 zhao et al 2009 in table 2 secondly the obtained results are compared with the results reported by hasani baferani et al 2011 in table 3 for the fundamental frequency parameters for simply supported a l a l 2 o 3 fg plate without stiffeners from these tables the present results have a good agreement with the previous study and the small differences are due to the variation of poisson ratio 4 2 results for natural vibration response in this subsection the numerical results have been presented for sigmoid fg plate with longitudinal and transversal stiffeners in x and y directions the material properties have been listed in table 4 the geometrical parameters of stiffeners are given by s x s y 2 h h x h y 2 h d x a n x d y b n y n x n y are the number of the longitudinal and transversal stiffeners respectively table 5 illustrates the fundamental frequency parameter ω ω π 2 a 2 h ρ m e m for a simply supported sigmoid fg plate consisting of s i 3 n 4 s u s 304 materials with various the number of stiffeners n x n y temperature change t k the thickness length ratio a h 150 and aspect ratio a b 1 are considered the volume fraction index n is taken to be 1 in this table the first two dimensionless frequencies of plate are shown it can be seen that the fundamental frequency increases significantly as n x n y in creases from 0 to 15 this implies that the plate becomes a stiffer behavior when the number of the stiffener is increased fig 4 also shows the effect of number of stiffeners on first non dimensional frequency parameter ω a 2 π 2 ρ m e m h of sigmoid fg plate versus the length thickness ratio as expected these curves become higher when the number of stiffeners n x n y increases n x n y 0 5 10 15 the prime reason is that with increasing of n x n y the presence of stiffeners makes plates to become stiffer also the variation of natural frequency versus the variation of length thickness ratio is also shown in fig 4 in figure it is clear that as the thickness of the plate decreases the effect of non homogeneity in the material properties of the plate on the natural frequency becomes more considerable it can be concluded that the variation of the ratio a h and the stiffeners of the sigmoid fg plate have significant effects on the frequency parameter fig 5 shows the effect of temperature change on the frequency parameter of sigmoid fg plates under different sets of environment condition t 300 k 400 k and 500 k the material properties of plate are assumed to be temperature dependent the number of stiffeners are taken to be 10 it can be seen that an initial extension occurs as the temperature increases and the first frequency parameter is reduced with increasing in temperature further numerical illustrations for free vibration behavior of s fg plate are also derived and plotted in figs 6 and 7 the variation of dimensionless fundamental frequency versus length thickness ratio of s fg plate with different volume fraction indexes n 0 0 5 1 2 and is depicted in fig 6 according to the figure and as expected the fundamental frequency in s fg plate with fully ceramic plate is greater and for the case of fully metal plate it is smaller than that for the other volume fraction indexes this is understandable because the ceramic plate is the ones with the higher stiffness than the metal plate in addition regardless of case of volume fraction index by increasing the length thickness ratio fundamental frequency converges to a constant value this convergence in n is faster whereas in the n 0 it is slower than that for the other power indexes fig 7 demonstrates the effect of mode number on the variation of the dimensionless fundamental frequency of simply supported s fg plate versus length to thickness ratios regardless of length to thickness ratios of plate dimensionless fundamental frequency increases when m n increases moreover as depicted the increase the length to thickness ratio of plate causes to increase the fundamental frequency which converges to a constant value 5 conclusions in this work an exact solution was developed to investigate the free vibration of s fg plate reinforced by the longitudinal and transversal stiffeners based the classical plate theory material properties of plate are assumed to be temperature dependent and graded in the thickness direction according to a sigmoid power law distribution the governing equation of motion are solved by navier solution for simply supported boundary condition from the numerical illustration the variations of the natural frequencies of the s fg plates against the length to thickness ratio material graded index mode buckling and temperature rise were analyzed the influences of the temperature dependence of the material properties on the dimensionless fundamental frequency were also studied based on the presented results it can be concluded that by increasing the power index of s fgm fundamental frequency converges to a constant value the dimensionless fundamental frequencies decrease by increasing the length to thickness ratio a h the obtained frequency parameters based on the power index n 0 are the greatest ones and those of the n are the smallest ones by increasing the temperature rise fundamental frequency parameters increase monotonically for the thin plate fundamental frequency parameters are more affected by number of stiffeners acknowledgments this research was supported by a grant nrf 2017r1a4a1015660 from nrf

stiffness degradation with the average shear strain the quasi static p y hysteresis loop is modeling to develop the bnwf approach for analysis of the soil pile interaction under low cycle number and irregular cyclic loads the hysteresis loop simulates various important features such as the soil pile nonlinearity the soil degradation and the soil pile gap formation the developed hysteresis loop is consisted of the elastoplastic and drag gap components which the elastoplastic component simulates the nonlinear characteristics of soil pile system and the gap drag component considers the repeated separation and closure effects of the soil pile interface as the quasi static p y hysteresis loop subjects to the constant variable and mixed amplitude displacement loadings loop patterns can reflect

simplicity and practical accuracy considering cycle numbers by reducing the soil ultimate resistance around the pile the general static p y curves for cyclic loading has been an important tool for the computation of the soil pile nonlinear static properties however most traditional curves were derived from limited full sale tests with specific pile stiffness cross section configurations or boundary conditions matlock 1970 reese et al 1974 murchison and o neill 1984 little and briaud 1988 long and vanneste 1994 and these conventional p y curves are only suitable for pseudo static analysis of pile

andersen 2017 on the quasi static p y curves formed by the mobilizable strength design concept absolutely promote a more accurate understanding of the soil pile interaction mechanism however it is difficult to apply these aforementioned quasi static p y curves to catch the feature of laterally loaded piles in cases of the low cycle number and irregular cyclic loadings these features include the soil nonlinear behavior the soil pile gap formation the soil stiffness and strength degradation leblanc et al 2010 diyaljee and raymond 1982 several reasonable quasi static p y hysteresis loops derived from a specified p y curve have been incorporated into the dynamic bnwf approach to describe different soil pile interaction characterizations matlock et al 1978 incorporated the static p y

simulate the soil pile separation however their model neglected the influence of the soil degradation apparently gerolymos and gazetas 2005 modified the bouc wen model through experiment tests to analyze the soil pile gap the soil degradation and the soil radiation damping characteristics in clay heidari et al 2014a b developed the nonlinear cyclic p y curve generated by the strain wedge method to consider the soil stiffness and strength degradation but their procedure cannot analyze the soil pile interaction in deep position of the soil a newly developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop is formed by specific hyperbolic p y backbone curve considering the soil degradation with the average shear strain around the pile the present hysteresis loop is capable of accounting for elasticity degradation and separation of soil pile system under low cycle number and irregular cyclic loadings in order to figure out whether the developed hysteresis loop is able to simulate the reasonable soil pile interaction mechanism under irregular loads the research analyzes the styles of the hysteresis loop through constant variable and mixed amplitude displacement loading patterns this hysteresis loop is incorporated in the generalized bnwf method to simulate the soil pile interaction under the monotonic or the cyclic loads 2 hyperbolic p y backbone curve 2 1 backbone curve

stiffness and the formula is as follows 3 k i n η k x 5 a t a n h 0 2 where η 3 x is the calculation depth k k 50 σ v brandenberg et al 2005 σ v is the soil effective vertical stress and k is obtained by the function of the soil friction angle ϕ reese and impe 2011 the parameters p ult and y 50 in clay are obtained via the following equation matlock 1970 4 p u l t n p c u d 5 n p 3 γ x d j x d x x

results indicate that the hyperbolic p y backbone curves are generally in accord with both of the matlock and the api p y curves the matlock p y curve for the soft clay was developed from the field test and had a turning point at y y 50 8 while the hyperbolic p y backbone curve was transmitted more smoothly the api p y backbone curve for the sand had a relatively larger initial stiffness as y y 50 2 and the stiffness of hyperbolic p y backbone curve decreased smoothly when y y 50 2 2 2 layered soil effect the pile ultimate resistance obtained by eqs 4 and 7 can used in homogeneous soil however in the layered soil the pile ultimate resistance should consider the influence of the layer effect georgiadis 1983 treated all soil layers from the surface to the calculation depth as homogeneous soil and the equivalent depth was obtained in the method of the equivalent ultimate resistance in homogeneous soil to compute the equivalent depth h 2 to the top of the bottom layer one can sum the ultimate resistances of the upper layer and equate that value to the summation as if the upper layer was composed of the same material as in the bottom layer 11 0 h 1 p u 1 x d x 0 h 2 p u 2 x d x where p u1 x is the ultimate resistance of upper layer p u2 x is the ultimate resistance of upper layer which was composed of the same material as in the bottom layer and h 1 is actual thickness of the upper layer the aforementioned solution procedure was implemented into a computer program written by ourselves to verify the applicability of the present scheme fig 2 is taken as an example of three soil layers the equivalent thickness of the first soft clay layer is 1 91 m corresponding to the second sand layer and 0 47 m corresponding to the third stiff clay layer the equivalent thickness of the second sand layer is 0 66 m corresponding to the third hard clay layer as shown in table 1 the equivalent depths obtained by the program are similar to results of reese and van impe reese and impe 2011 3 quasi static p y hysteresis loop 3 1 component of the hysteresis loop to establish the quasi static p y hysteresis loop the extended masing rule is followed by the repeated loading and unloading as shown in fig 3 the model consists of two series components connected in parallel in which one component consisted of an elastic spring and a plastic spring simulates the soil pile nonlinear behavior and the other component consisted of a drag cell and a gap cell descripts the reciprocal separate closure effect on the soil pile interface moreover the soil degradation produces only in the p y plastic response appearance the radiation damping and the hysteretic damping which are parallel to the elastic spring and the plastic spring respectively in the developed model are the main carrier for consuming vibration energy under high frequency cyclic loads elnaggar and novak 1996 wang et al 1998 however under few cycle number and irregular cycle loads of low frequency the soil nonlinearity the degeneration and the pile soil separation effect are more prominent badoni and makris 1996 in this paper the damping effect is not considered in the developed hysteresis loop fig 4 is a framework of the quasi static p y hysteresis loop during the repeated loading unloading procedure when the pile deformation become larger in the stage oa the soil in the positive direction of the pile contacts with the pile leading to the initial elastoplastic deformation after the pile deformation reversing at point a pile deformation may not completely recover to the initial status when the soil resistance reduced to zero after the unloading stage ab meanwhile the pile and the soil still contact with each other at point b due to the unrecoverable plastic deformation of soil and the soil has a drag effect on the pile pile deformation recovers and subjects to drag force during stage bc the pile is separate from the soil in stage cd till pile deformation recovers to the initial status at the point d similarly in the negative direction of the stage defg pile deformation is repeated and recovers to the initial shape at the point g when the pile is reloaded in the positive direction the pile and the soil contact with each other again only if pile deformation is returned to the soil pile separation line ch and then the elastoplastic deformation develops during the reloading stage the judgment whether the pile soil separation is expanded can be made upon by the unloading stage ji again and the larger separation point i will be set as the starting point for reloading of the next stage the elastoplastic component shows the stiffness vibration of soil from the initial loading unloading to the repeated loading unloading while the drag gap component guarantees that the soil pile separate and closure are smoothly transmitted during the repeated loading unloading deformation the soil resistance and the pile deformation form the hysteresis loop in which the soil resistance p and the pile deformation y are included in each circle 12 p p e p p g p d 0 p e p p d p g 0 13 y y e p y g y d where p e and p d are the elastoplastic

2008 the soil pile gap parameter α is used to modify the position of pile deformation at the reloading starting point y o wherein 0 α 1 p r and y r are the soil resistance and the pile displacement when the current loading phase is reversed c d is the soil pile drag parameter representing the ratio p d p ult between the maximum drag force and the ultimate resistance and k o corresponding tangent

and stiffness degradation under few cycle numbers like earthquake because the strength and stiffness degradation is related to soil internal strain pore water pressure or both factors heidari et al 2014a matasovic 1993 el naggar and bentley 2000 allotey and el naggar 2008 the modifications of the soil strength or stiffness in loading unloading curves are generally adopted for the previous researches these methods can only be applied for the situation that cycle number is known under regular cyclic loads matlock et al 1978 diyaljee and raymond 1982 allotey and el naggar 2008 grashuis et al 1990 rajashree and sundaravadivelu 1996 poulos 1982 however it is difficult to determine cycle number under irregular cyclic shear loads so the model of soil degradation based on cycle numbers needs to be improved during the irregular and repeated loading unloading the soil strain around the pile accumulates thus the lateral stiffness corresponding to the soil strain should be used the quasi static p y hysteresis loop should provide the appropriate shape reflecting the effect of the soil degradation the soil pile stiffness parameter k o is related to the soil degradation in the loading and reloading stage and it is solved via the relationship of the stiffness degradation index δ k and the initial stiffness k in 22 k o δ k k i n where δ k is related to the soil strain around the pile the hyperbolic equation describes the degradation relationship between the degradation index δ k and the average shear strain ε avg the relation equation is expressed below 23 δ k 1 1 ε a v g ε r where ε r is the reference shear strain poulos 1982 replaced by y 50 for practical convenience the average shear strain ε avg is considered in an approximate proportion with the pile displacement karadeniz 2013 klar 2008 knappett and madabhushi 2009 24 ε a v g ζ y o where y o is the pile displacement at the starting stage of current loading and ζ is the degradation correction coefficient at the beginning of elastic loading y o 0 and the soil has no degradation soil starts to degenerate only in the reloading stage when y o 0 at the point h in fig 4 and the soil resistance around the pile reached the plastic phase the initially displacement y o increases and the soil degradation is strengthening with the gap increasing as shown in fig 5 for pile radius r 10y 50 the degradation index δ k decreases when the ratio of y o r increases and the curve decreases obviously as the degradation correction coefficient ζ increases 3 3 calculation process of algorithm the modified tangent stiffness method is used to solve the calculation procedure of the quasi static p y hysteresis loop according to fig 6 for a single step δy y t 1 y t n substeps are divided equally δy ndy in which dy is small incremental substep the modified tangent stiffness method makes resistances p 1 p 2 p n little by little closer to the actual values p 0 p 1 p n in hysteresis loop step 1 at the starting displacement point y t is obtained by soil resistance p 0 p 0 and tangent stiffness k 1 the displacement y 1 is y t dy 1 and the load p 1 p 0 k 1dy 1 is when the substep length is dy 1 step 2 under the repeated loading unloading first determine whether dy reverses or not then obtain the resistance f 1 and the stiffness g 1 of the elastoplastic component or the drag gap component at the displacement point y 1 via eq 14 to eq 21 finally calculate the unbalanced load δr 1 p 1 f 2 step 3 determine whether δr 1 can satisfy the accuracy tol if so the soil resistance is p 1 p 1 and the tangent stiffness is k 2 g 2 if not obtain the residual displacement δ δr 1 g 1 in the negative direction by regarding δ 0 and recalculate p 1 p 0 k 1dy 1 k 2 δ till the calculation accuracy tol is satisfied step 4 the starting displacement point is changed to y 1 repeat step 1 to step 3 and obtain the soil resistance p 2 p 2 and the tangent stiffness k 3 g 3 repeating step 4 to obtain p 0 p 1 p n corresponding to y 0 y 1 y n the precision of the modified tangent stiffness method is related to the number of incremental substep in the case of enough incremental substep n the results of the modified tangent stiffness are approximate to the true value 3 4 parameters calibration to figure out the influence of α c d and ζ on the shape of the quasi static p y hysteresis loop a sine displacement with 9 periods is adopted for calibrating the parameters dimensionless ratio of peak displacement is 3 5 in clay or sand the loading frequency is 1 5 hz the time step is 0 01s and duration is 6s the soil pile gap parameter α reflects the pile position changing at the starting reloading point y o which is used to describe the soil pile separation behavior if α 0 05 0 25 and 0 50 respectively and ζ 0 3 and c d 0 1 the influence of α on p y hysteresis loops is shown in fig 7 under the same displacement loading the initial hysteresis loop is full fusiform the loop patterns in the reloading unloading stage are under the influence of α as α 0 05 the loop pattern turns to z shape while α 0 50 the pinch phenomenon is strengthened and the loop shape turns to reversed s shape the aforementioned patterns indicate that the soil degradation is obviously influenced by α the soil degradation is weaker with larger α the degradation makes the hysteresis loop changes from the lateral z shape to the s shape in the reloading stage during the repeated deformation the soil pile drag parameter c d reflects the ratio of the maximum drag force to the soil ultimate resistance describing the soil pile gap effect fig 8 shows the influence of c d on the hysteresis loops under the same peak displacement loading the overall hysteresis pattern changes from the full fusiform at the initial stage to z shape in the reloading stage with the increase of c d but the pinch phenomenon in the middle part weakens it indicates that the middle part of hysteresis patterns is influenced by c d and the soil pile drag force obviously affects the soil pile gap effect the soil pile degradation factor ζ reflecting the influence of soil pile degradation effect is the ratio between the average shear strain of soil and the initial pile displacement when the loop reaches the plastic stage fig 9 shows the influence of ζ on p y hysteresis patterns under the same displacement load the initial hysteresis curve is fully spindle shape and in the middle part is the pinch phenomenon the greater the ζ is the larger influence of the soil degradation on the hysteresis patterns will be the loops rapidly change to z shape from the full fusiform in the initial loading stage the phenomena indicates that the greater the ζ the more significant the soil degradation 4 style of the hysteresis loop under the test to analyze the influences of irregular loading unloading on the quasi static p y hysteresis loop the hysteresis loop in clay or sand derived from the constant the variable and the mixed amplitude displacement loading patterns are analyzed 4 1 one way cyclic loading the displacement action is shown in fig 10 after monotonic loading the sine displacement with the frequency of 1 5 hz is applied to the model the dimensionless ratio of peak displacement and y 50 is 0 8 2 8 and 4 8 respectively the p y hysteresis loop is showed in fig 11 it can be seen that the soil deforms nonlinearly during the monotonic loading and p y backbone curve is in hyperbolic type at the repeated cyclic loading unloading stage the one way p y hysteresis loop displays in a full spindle shaped due to the small cyclic displacement action and becomes stable after the soil degradation with the increase of the cyclic displacement action the p y hysteresis loops display in a spindle shape with a tail when there is a reversed loading the hysteresis loops change to be a s shape the aforementioned phenomena indicate that the drag gap component is worked for describing the soil pile separation effect the hysteresis curve can reflect the separation and degradation characteristics of soil pile system under one way cycle loading 4 2 constant amplitude loading as shown in fig 12 the sine wave with 3 periods and 4 displacements is introduced for constant amplitude displacement loading dimensionless ratio of peak displacement load and y 50 is 1 4 7 and 10 respectively the loading frequency is 1 5 hz as shown in fig 13 the hysteresis loop follows the p y backbone curve and rapidly response to soil pile gap and soil degradation under irregular loadings with less cycle number in the first displacement cyclic loading the soil plastic deformation is small and the soil degeneration is not significant the hysteresis loop is in a long and thin shuttle shape in the subsequent second displacement loading the soil plastic deformation continues to increase along with the p y backbone curve and the pattern of hysteresis loop changes from the initial full shuttle shape to the reversed s shape the strength and stiffness of soil are degenerating obviously as the displacement loading keeps increasing the hysteresis loop changes to a z shape and the soil degeneration is more significant under the influence of soil pile separation effect 4 3 variable amplitude loading fig 14 shows the variable amplitude displacement loading with frequency of 1 5 hz the continuous cycle displacement with different amplitudes decreases to zero gradually after increasing to the maximum displacement amplitudes accumulatively dimensionless ratio of peak displacement load and y 50 is 10 as shown in fig 15 the hysteresis curve pattern influenced by soil pile separation is the main function of the elastoplastic component and gradually changes to the single function of the drag gap component as can be seen from the figure with the continuous increase of displacement amplitude from the elastic stage to the yield stage the hysteresis loop changes from a straight line to a shuttle shape and then to a s shape after the pinch phenomenon when the amplitude reaches the maximum value the hysteresis loop changes into a z shape as the displacement gradually decreases afterwards a full and stable hysteresis loop gradually appears at the central position 4 4 mixed amplitude loading fig 16 shows the irregular displacement loading unloading after increasing to the yield stage u y 50 8 the displacement amplitude decreased u y 50 1 and then functioned by a large constant amplitude displacement loading u y 50 3 5 and 8 after that it is loaded by the constant amplitude displacement u y 50 3 to the up side with frequency of 1 5 hz as shown in fig 17 the p y hysteresis curve shape is consistent with the irregular loading trend and is significantly influenced by the soil pile gap in the initial stage with the continuous increase of displacement amplitude from the elastic stage to the yield stage the hysteresis loops change from a straight line to a shuttle shape and then a pinch phenomenon appears while the displacement amplitude suddenly decreases the hysteresis loops become shuttle shape and off center to the right in the internal part which is functioned by the drag gap component only after the increase of displacement amplitude the hysteresis curve returns to the normal shape and then in the case of displacement loading off center to the upper the hysteresis curve is shuttle shape with a tail towards the right 5 validation of the hysteresis loop 5 1 comparison with the hysteresis loop of theoretical approachs the developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop is compared with the pysimple1 material and the strain wedge method heidari et al 2014b under one way or two way cyclic loads the pysimple1 material is one of opensees materials mckenna 2011 five cycle numbers of the constant amplitude displacement loading are taken separately among which the one way displacement amplitude is 0 15d and the two way displacement amplitude is 0 25d d is the pile diameter the damping effects of soil are all excluded during the comparison the relevant parameters of strain wedge method are determined from reference heidari et al 2014b the pysimple1 material parameters are c 10 n p 5 c r 0 35 and c d 0 1 the present loop parameters are α 0 25 ζ 0 5 and c d 0 1 as shown in fig 18 the comparison shows that all of the three models produce the p y hysteresis loops with full shape the p y hysteresis loop patterns of the present loop and the strain wedge model are more similar but in the plastic repeated loading phase the present model can simulate the gap increment caused by the soil degradation and the soil pile gap besides the pysimple1 material cannot take the soil degradation into consideration its p y hysteresis loop tends to be single shape in the reloading stage 5 2 comparison with the measured hysteresis loop fig 19 shows the quasi static p y hysteresis loop under cyclic displacement actions on the pile head in the clay reported by matlock 1970 through a laboratory model experiment four groups of different displacement amplitudes were used in the test each amplitude was applied at the control point for 10 cycles the cyclic loading of the first group shows the soil strength degradation slightly as the p y hysteresis loop was a straight line as for the cyclic displacement of the second and the third groups the initial hysteresis loop was spindle shape with the pinch shape at the middle part owning to the obvious degradation of soil strength and stiffness the quasi static p y hysteresis loop was rapidly transmitted into a z shape in the following cyclic displacement and tended to become stable as for the fourth group soil pile separation occurred when the cyclic displacement amplitude was about 20 percent of the pile diameter the soil strength and stiffness gradually decreased in order to verify the reasonability of the developed p y hysteresis loop as shown in fig 20 four groups of different displacement amplitudes are used by 10 cycle numbers for each to compare the present developed loop with the pysimple1 material and the matlock laboratory experiment matlock 1970 individually the state parameters c np c r and c d of the pysimple1 material should be taken by referring to the material definition in opensees fig 21 a shows the p y hysteresis loop of the pysimple1 material and fig 21b is the present developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop both kinds of hysteresis loop can reflect nonlinear deformation characteristic and the soil pile gap behavior however the pysimple1 material cannot take the soil strength and stiffness degradation into consideration besides the present hysteresis loop tends to be stable at the later cyclic stage compared with the p y hysteresis loop in fig 19 the present loop can reflect the actual soil pile deformation mechanism under cyclic loadings more accurately than the pysimple1 material 6 application analysis the model is incorporated into the generalized bnwf method to analyze the soil pile interaction under the monotonic or cyclic loads partial differential equation of pile lateral movement is shown as below 25 e i 4 u z 4 k h u p where ei is the pile flexural stiffness the stiffness matrix for pile element can be obtained according to the gauss legendre integration rule u is the pile lateral deformation z is the depth k h is the lateral tangent stiffness of soil which is obtained from the tangent stiffness of the p y hysteresis curve and p is the cyclic loads on the top of pile eq 25 can be solved by nonlinear finite element method with the framework of the open source software opensees mckenna 2011 pile element uses the dispbeamcolumn type and model element uses the zerolength type only lateral behavior is modeled so there are some additional fixities the developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop is modeled by zerolength element the soil end of the zerolength elements are fixed completely the pile end of the zerolength elements are only free in the direction of loading and the pile nodes are fixed against translation in the orthogonal direction of loading and rotation out of the plane of loading the base of the pile is also fixed against vertical translation the pile end of the zerolength element is linked as slave nodes to their corresponding pile nodes in the direction of loading using the equal dof command the pile head node where the load is applied is separated to allow the user to specify a free head no rotational fixity or fixed head full rotational fixity condition at the loading point 6 1 comparison with numerical simulation yang and jeremic 2002 conducted a finite element study on the behavior of a single pile in elastoplastic layered soils as shown in fig 22 the pile length is 13 3 m the square pile width is 0 429 m the pile material is aluminum having elasticity modulus of 68 9 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 the total load on the pile top is 400 kn the friction angle of medium dense sand is 37 1 with a dilation angle of 0 the shear modulus is 8 96 mpa at a depth 13 7 m the poisson s ratio is 0 35 and unit weight is 14 5 kn m3 undrained shear strength of clay is 21 7 kpa the young modulus is 11 0 mpa and the poisson s ratio is 0 45 the unit weight is 13 7 kn m3 under the monotonic loading the p y backbone curve is connected with the initial stiffness and the soil resistance and is not influenced by the soil pile parameters of gap drag or degradation to verify the practicability of the bnwf model derived from the development p y hysteresis loop the number of pile sections is consistent with the finite element model during nonlinear analysis of a laterally loaded pile the bending moment and displacement of pile in the clay with a sand layer case 2 is shown in fig 23 the result shows that the bending moments of the two methods are consistent but the pile displacement obtained from the bnwf model is greater than that from the finite element method and the difference increase with the increase of loads the bending moment and displacement of pile in the sand with a clay layer case 4 is shown in fig 24 the bending moments and displacements obtained by the two methods are more consistent but the depth of the maximum bending moment obtained from the bnwf model is greater than the finite element method fig 25 shows the pile head loads and the maximum bending moments in case 2 and case 4 it can be seen that in the sand with a clay layer case 4 the results with the bnwf method and the finite element method are nearly the same but in a clay layer case 2 the nonlinearity of p y backbone curve in this present method is stronger than the finite element method when the pile lateral head displacement is greater in the case of large displacement deformations the soil pile contacted element of the finite element method is continuous which cannot be used to simulate the soil pile separation 6 2 comparison with field test tuladhar et al 2008 conducted the lateral cyclic behavior of the prestressed concrete pile using full scale lateral loading tests indicating that the soil pile gap and the soil degradation need be taking into consideration for the cyclic behavior of lateral loaded pile as shown in fig 26 outer diameter of prestressed pile is 300 mm the wall thickness is 60 mm having a length of 26 m the compressive strength of the concrete is f c 69 mpa and the yield stress of longitudinal prestressing steel is f y 1325 mpa the effective prestress of concrete is 5 mpa the yield bending moment of pile section is m y 42 kn m and the ultimate bending moment is m u 51 2 kn m the strain hardening ratio ratio between post yield tangent and initial elastic tangent is 0 26 the elastic modulus of pile can be obtained from the measured curvature relationship between the short term stiffness dividing inertia moment of cross section tuladhar et al 2008 the embedded depth is 24 8 and the test loads adopt displacement control to act at the loading point 1 2 m below the pile top the displacement loading with 7 periods of increasing triangular displacement is shown in fig 27 the model calculation depth is valued up to 12 6 m heidari et al 2014b tuladhar et al 2008 the clay soil depth is 0 6 m with gravity of 15 7 kn m3 and shear strength of 33 kpa the sand soil depth is 6 12 5 m with the gravity of 18 6 kn m3 the shear strength is 140 kpa and the internal friction angle is 39 the obvious gap on the contact surface at both sides of the pile can be observed under the lateral cyclic loading indicating that the soil pile separation effect occurs and soil degrades obviously heidari et al 2014b kondner 1963 tuladhar et al 2008 the model parameters are α 0 4 ζ 2 5 c d 0 05 fig 28 is the load displacement curve of the test point fig 29 shows the theoretical and measured pile curvature distribution the calculated results are similar to the test results which indicates that the developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop can reflect the soil degradation and soil pile gap reasonably 7 conclusion the quasi static p y hysteresis loop is established based on the hyperbolic p y backbone curve and the soil stiffness degradation with the average shear strain the developed p y hysteresis loop takes the soil pile gap and the soil degradation on the soil pile interaction into consideration the change of soil pile gap parameter α the soil pile drag parameter c d and the degradation correcting coefficient ζ may change the pattern of the hysteresis loop for common engineering problems the soil pile gap parameter α is about 0 05 0 5 and the soil pile drag parameter c d is about 0 05 0 2 the degradation correcting coefficient ζ can be determined by the actual soil degradation the larger ζ leads to the more obvious soil degradation the quasi static p y hysteresis loop is analyzed with constant variable and mixed amplitude displacement loadings the loop patterns can reflect the reasonable soil pile deformation mechanism including the soil pile separation and the soil degradation in the irregular displacement loading unloading the pattern of the p y hysteresis loop is consistent with the irregular loading trend acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 41672266 and the fundamental research funds for the central universities

23683,pile foundations of the coastal and offshore structures always have strong nonlinear response due to marine environmental loads derived from the specific hyperbolic p y curve and the soil stiffness degradation with the average shear strain the quasi static p y hysteresis loop is modeling to develop the bnwf approach for analysis of the soil pile interaction under low cycle number and irregular cyclic loads the hysteresis loop simulates various important features such as the soil pile nonlinearity the soil degradation and the soil pile gap formation the developed hysteresis loop is consisted of the elastoplastic and drag gap components which the elastoplastic component simulates the nonlinear characteristics of soil pile system and the gap drag component considers the repeated separation and closure effects of the soil pile interface as the quasi static p y hysteresis loop subjects to the constant variable and mixed amplitude displacement loadings loop patterns can reflect the reasonable soil pile interaction mechanism correctly including the soil pile separation and the soil degradation the p y hysteresis loop shape reflects the trend of irregular loads and the soil pile gap affects the pattern of the hysteresis loop the developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop incorporated in the generalized bnwf method to analyze the soil pile interaction under the cyclic

would be affected by current wave wind or artificial cyclic loads in the past thirty years the dynamic beam on a nonlinear winkler foundation bnwf method for laterally loaded piles analysis has drawn more and more attention matlock et al 1978 kagawa 1980 nogami et al 1992 badoni and makris 1996 elnaggar and novak 1996 wang et al 1998 boulanger et al 1999 taciroglu et al 2006 due to its high simplicity and practical accuracy considering cycle numbers by reducing the soil ultimate resistance around the pile the general static p y curves for cyclic loading has been an important tool for the computation of the soil pile nonlinear static properties however most traditional curves were derived from limited full sale tests with specific pile stiffness cross section configurations or boundary conditions matlock 1970 reese et al 1974 murchison and o neill 1984 little and briaud 1988 long and vanneste 1994 and these conventional p y curves are only suitable for pseudo static analysis of pile foundations when the pile top or the structure is under low frequency cyclic loadings the frequency of cyclic load induced by wave is generally less than 0 1 hz karadeniz 2013 han et al 2017 the inertial effect is not significant under such low frequency excitations badoni and makris 1996 zhong and huang 2014 recently some creative and enlightening research results yu et al 2017 zhang and andersen 2017 on the quasi static p y curves formed by the mobilizable strength design concept absolutely promote a more accurate understanding of the soil pile interaction mechanism however it is difficult to apply these aforementioned quasi static p y curves to catch the feature of laterally loaded piles in cases of the low cycle number and irregular cyclic loadings these features include the soil nonlinear behavior the soil pile gap formation the soil stiffness and strength degradation leblanc et al 2010 diyaljee and raymond 1982 several reasonable quasi static p y hysteresis loops derived from a specified p y curve have been incorporated into the dynamic bnwf approach to describe different soil pile interaction characterizations matlock et al 1978 incorporated the static p y backbone curve into the bnwf method to consider the soil strength degradation by setting the critical depth of the gap empirically wang et al 1998 and boulanger et al 1999 adopted specified series components to form the dynamic p y procedure among which the nonlinear spring component to simulate the static conventional p y curve matlock 1970 api 2000 and developed the drag gap component to simulate the soil pile separation however their model neglected the influence of the soil degradation apparently gerolymos and gazetas 2005 modified the bouc wen model through experiment tests to analyze the soil pile gap the soil degradation and the soil radiation damping characteristics in clay heidari et al 2014a b developed the nonlinear cyclic p y curve generated by the strain wedge method to consider the soil stiffness and strength degradation but their procedure cannot analyze the soil pile interaction in deep position of the soil a newly developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop is formed by specific hyperbolic p y backbone curve considering the soil degradation with the average shear strain around the pile the present hysteresis loop is capable of accounting for elasticity degradation and separation of soil pile system under low cycle number and irregular cyclic loadings in order to figure out whether the developed hysteresis loop is able to simulate the reasonable soil pile interaction mechanism under irregular loads the research analyzes the styles of the hysteresis loop through constant variable and mixed amplitude displacement loading patterns this hysteresis loop is incorporated in the generalized bnwf method to simulate the soil pile interaction under the monotonic or the cyclic loads 2 hyperbolic p y backbone curve 2 1 backbone curve description the backbone curve is constituted by hyperbolic equation that is related to both the initial stiffness and the soil resistance the hyperbolic p y backbone curve is widely used in research owing to its distinct shape and uncomplicated parameters kondner 1963 castelli and maugeri 2009 georgiadis and georgiadis 2010 comodromos and papadopoulou 2013 the expression is as follows 1 p y 1 k i n y p u l t the initial stiffness k in and the soil resistance p ult in eq 1 are determined according to soil type numerous researches yu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 have been done to improve the accuracy of these two parameters engineering practice requires a convenient way to get the parameters of theoretical model although it may be in the lack of precision as a note utilizing the matlock and api p y backbone curves to determine the parameters can provide a good description and these p y backbone curves give the acceptable method in engineering practice in clay k in can be derived from the matlock s p y curve equation matlock 1970 related to the ratio c r that is a state parameter of p p ult ratio as the initial plastic yielding first appears 2 k i n p u l t 8 c r 2 y 50 where y 50 is the lateral deformation of the pile as the soil resistance is 1 2p ult and wang et al 1998 suggested that c r 0 35 in sand the api s p y curve equation reese and impe 2011 is quite linear initially and has less impact on the initial stiffness when c r 0 35 to make the hyperbolic p y backbone curve closer to the shape of the api p y curve the correction factor η is used to modify the initial stiffness and the formula is as follows 3 k i n η k x 5 a t a n h 0 2 where η 3 x is the calculation depth k k 50 σ v brandenberg et al 2005 σ v is the soil effective vertical stress and k is obtained by the function of the soil friction angle ϕ reese and impe 2011 the parameters p ult and y 50 in clay are obtained via the following equation matlock 1970 4 p u l t n p c u d 5 n p 3 γ x d j x d x x r 9 x x r 6 y 50 2 5 ε 50 d where c u is the undrained shear strength n p is the non dimensional ultimate resistance coefficient d is the pile diameter and γ is the average buoyant unit weight of soil from the surface to the calculation depth x x r 6d γ d c u j j is taken as 0 5 for soft clay and 0 25 for slightly stiff clay according to matlock s recommendation ε 50 is strain at half the maximum stress of a laboratory stress strain curve for soil the parameter p ult in sand is obtained by the stress wedge balance of the soil around the pile and y 50 is the pile lateral deformation when the soil resistance is 1 2p ult according to the api s p y curve equation reese and impe 2011 7 p u l t a s min p u s p u d 8 p u s γ x k o x t g ϕ t g β t g β ϕ cos α t g β t g β ϕ d x t g β t g α k o x

friction angle and a s is the particular non dimensional depth for the static case reese and impe 2011 fig 1 is the comparison between the matlock or api p y curve and the hyperbolic p y curve the results indicate that the hyperbolic p y backbone curves are generally in accord with both of the matlock and the api p y curves the matlock p y curve for the soft clay was developed from the field test and had a turning point at y y 50 8 while the hyperbolic p y backbone curve was transmitted more smoothly the api p y backbone curve for the sand had a relatively larger initial stiffness as y y 50 2 and the stiffness of hyperbolic p y backbone curve decreased smoothly when y y 50 2 2 2 layered soil effect the pile ultimate resistance obtained by eqs 4 and 7 can used in homogeneous soil however in the layered soil the pile ultimate resistance should consider the influence of the layer effect georgiadis 1983 treated all soil layers from the surface to the calculation depth as homogeneous soil and the equivalent depth was obtained in the method of the equivalent ultimate resistance in homogeneous soil to compute the equivalent depth h 2 to the top of the bottom layer one can sum the ultimate resistances of the upper layer and equate that value to the summation as if the upper layer was composed of the same material as in the bottom layer 11 0 h 1 p u 1 x d x 0 h 2 p u 2 x d x where p u1 x is the ultimate resistance of upper layer p u2 x is the ultimate resistance of upper layer which was composed of the same material as in the bottom layer and h 1 is actual thickness of the upper layer the aforementioned solution procedure was implemented into a computer program written by ourselves to verify the applicability of the present scheme fig 2 is taken as an example of three soil layers the equivalent thickness of the first soft clay layer is 1 91 m corresponding to the second sand layer and 0 47 m corresponding to the third stiff clay layer the equivalent thickness of the second sand layer is 0 66 m corresponding to the third hard clay layer as shown in table 1 the equivalent depths obtained by the program are similar to results of reese and van impe reese and impe 2011 3 quasi static p y hysteresis loop 3 1 component of the hysteresis loop to establish the quasi static p y hysteresis loop the extended masing rule is followed by the repeated loading and unloading as shown in fig 3 the model consists of two series components connected in parallel in which one component consisted of an elastic spring and a plastic spring simulates the soil pile nonlinear behavior and the other component consisted of a drag cell and a gap cell descripts the reciprocal separate closure effect on the soil pile interface moreover the soil degradation produces only in the p y plastic response appearance the radiation damping and the hysteretic damping which are parallel to the elastic spring and the plastic spring respectively in the developed model are the main carrier for consuming vibration energy under high frequency cyclic loads elnaggar and novak 1996 wang et al 1998 however under few cycle number and irregular cycle loads of low frequency the soil nonlinearity the degeneration and the pile soil separation effect are more prominent badoni and makris 1996 in this paper the damping effect is not considered in the developed hysteresis loop fig 4 is a framework of the quasi static p y hysteresis loop during the repeated loading unloading procedure when the pile deformation become larger in the stage oa the soil in the positive direction of the pile contacts with the pile leading to the initial elastoplastic deformation after the pile deformation reversing at point a pile deformation may not completely recover to the initial status when the soil resistance reduced to zero after the unloading stage ab meanwhile the pile and the soil still contact with each other at point b due to the unrecoverable plastic deformation of soil and the soil has a drag effect on the pile pile deformation recovers and subjects to drag force during stage bc the pile is separate from the soil in stage cd till pile deformation recovers to the initial status at the point d similarly in the negative direction of the stage defg pile deformation is repeated and recovers to the initial shape at the point g when the pile is reloaded in the positive direction the pile and the soil contact with each other again only if pile deformation is returned to the soil pile separation line ch and then the elastoplastic deformation develops during the reloading stage the judgment whether the pile soil separation is expanded can be made upon by the unloading stage ji again and the larger separation point i will be set as the starting point for reloading of the next stage the elastoplastic component shows the stiffness vibration of soil from the initial loading unloading to the repeated loading unloading while the drag gap component guarantees that the soil pile separate and closure are smoothly transmitted during the repeated loading unloading deformation the soil resistance and the pile deformation form the hysteresis loop in which the soil resistance p and the pile deformation y are included in each circle 12 p p e p p g p d 0 p e p p d p g 0 13 y y e p y g y d where p e and p d are the elastoplastic

o are the initial soil resistance and the pile displacement of current cyclic loading to make the p y hysteresis loop more consistency to test results matlock 1970 mayoral et al 2005 tuladhar et al 2008 the soil pile gap parameter α is used to modify the position of pile deformation at the reloading starting point y o wherein 0 α 1 p r and y r are the soil resistance and the pile displacement when the current loading phase is reversed c d is the soil pile drag parameter representing the ratio p d p ult between the maximum drag force and the ultimate resistance and k o corresponding tangent stiffness is related to soil degradation the p d y g response of the drag stage is as follows 16 p l o a d d p o d y d y o d 1 2 c d k i n y d y o d 2 c d p u l t 17 p u n l o a d d p r d y d y r d 1

gap displacement when the current loading phase is reversed in the case of finite element iterative procedure for the model the tangent stiffness is used for the computation along with the vibration of the hysteresis loop the tangent stiffness k l o a d e p and k u n l o a d e p of elastoplastic component and the tangent stiffness k l o a d d and k u n l o a d d of drag component are separately

and stiffness degradation under few cycle numbers like earthquake because the strength and stiffness degradation is related to soil internal strain pore water pressure or both factors heidari et al 2014a matasovic 1993 el naggar and bentley 2000 allotey and el naggar 2008 the modifications of the soil strength or stiffness in loading unloading curves are generally adopted for the previous researches these methods can only be applied for the situation that cycle number is known under regular cyclic loads matlock et al 1978 diyaljee and raymond 1982 allotey and el naggar 2008 grashuis et al 1990 rajashree and sundaravadivelu 1996 poulos 1982 however it is difficult to determine cycle number under irregular cyclic shear loads so the model of soil degradation based on cycle numbers needs to be improved during the irregular and repeated loading unloading the soil strain around the pile accumulates thus the lateral stiffness corresponding to the soil strain should be used the quasi static p y hysteresis loop should provide the appropriate shape reflecting the effect of the soil degradation the soil pile stiffness parameter k o is related to the soil degradation in the loading and reloading stage and it is solved via the relationship of the stiffness degradation index δ k and the initial stiffness k in 22 k o δ k k i n where δ k is related to the soil strain around the pile the hyperbolic equation describes the degradation relationship between the degradation index δ k and the average shear strain ε avg the relation equation is expressed below 23 δ k 1 1 ε a v g ε r where ε r is the reference shear strain poulos 1982 replaced by y 50 for practical convenience the average shear strain ε avg is considered in an approximate proportion with the pile displacement karadeniz 2013 klar 2008 knappett and madabhushi 2009 24 ε a v g ζ y o where y o is the pile displacement at the starting stage of current loading and ζ is the degradation correction coefficient at the beginning of elastic loading y o 0 and the soil has no degradation soil starts to degenerate only in the reloading stage when y o 0 at the point h in fig 4 and the soil resistance around the pile reached the plastic phase the initially displacement y o increases and the soil degradation is strengthening with the gap increasing as shown in fig 5 for pile radius r 10y 50 the degradation index δ k decreases when the ratio of y o r increases and the curve decreases obviously as the degradation correction coefficient ζ increases 3 3 calculation process of algorithm the modified tangent stiffness method is used to solve the calculation procedure of the quasi static p y hysteresis loop according to fig 6 for a single step δy y t 1 y t n substeps are divided equally δy ndy in which dy is small incremental substep the modified tangent stiffness method makes resistances p 1 p 2 p n little by little closer to the actual values p 0 p 1 p n in hysteresis loop step 1 at the starting displacement point y t is obtained by soil resistance p 0 p 0 and tangent stiffness k 1 the displacement y 1 is y t dy 1 and the load p 1 p 0 k 1dy 1 is when the substep length is dy 1 step 2 under the repeated loading unloading first determine whether dy reverses or not then obtain the resistance f 1 and the stiffness g 1 of the elastoplastic component or the drag gap component at the displacement point y 1 via eq 14 to eq 21 finally calculate the unbalanced load δr 1 p 1 f 2 step 3 determine whether δr 1 can satisfy the accuracy tol if so the soil resistance is p 1 p 1 and the tangent stiffness is k 2 g 2 if not obtain the residual displacement δ δr 1 g 1 in the negative direction by regarding δ 0 and recalculate p 1 p 0 k 1dy 1 k 2 δ till the calculation accuracy tol is satisfied step 4 the starting displacement point is changed to y 1 repeat step 1 to step 3 and obtain the soil resistance p 2 p 2 and the tangent stiffness k 3 g 3 repeating step 4 to obtain p 0 p 1 p n corresponding to y 0 y 1 y n the precision of the modified tangent stiffness method is related to the number of incremental substep in the case of enough incremental substep n the results of the modified tangent stiffness are approximate to the true value 3 4 parameters calibration to figure out the influence of α c d and ζ on the shape of the quasi static p y hysteresis loop a sine displacement with 9 periods is adopted for calibrating the parameters dimensionless ratio of peak displacement is 3 5 in clay or sand the loading frequency is 1 5 hz the time step is 0 01s and duration is 6s the soil pile gap parameter α reflects the pile position changing at the starting reloading point y o which is used to describe the soil pile separation behavior if α 0 05 0 25 and 0 50 respectively and ζ 0 3 and c d 0 1 the influence of α on p y hysteresis loops is shown in fig 7 under the same displacement loading the initial hysteresis loop is full fusiform the loop patterns in the reloading unloading stage are under the influence of α as α 0 05 the loop pattern turns to z shape while α 0 50 the pinch phenomenon is strengthened and the loop shape turns to reversed s shape the aforementioned patterns indicate that the soil degradation is obviously influenced by α the soil degradation is weaker with larger α the degradation makes the hysteresis loop changes from the lateral z shape to the s shape in the reloading stage during the repeated deformation the soil pile drag parameter c d reflects the ratio of the maximum drag force to the soil ultimate resistance describing the soil pile gap effect fig 8 shows the influence of c d on the hysteresis loops under the same peak displacement loading the overall hysteresis pattern changes from the full fusiform at the initial stage to z shape in the reloading stage with the increase of c d but the pinch phenomenon in the middle part weakens it indicates that the middle part of hysteresis patterns is influenced by c d and the soil pile drag force obviously affects the soil pile gap effect the soil pile degradation factor ζ reflecting the influence of soil pile degradation effect is the ratio between the average shear strain of soil and the initial pile displacement when the loop reaches the plastic stage fig 9 shows the influence of ζ on p y hysteresis patterns under the same displacement load the initial hysteresis curve is fully spindle shape and in the middle part is the pinch phenomenon the greater the ζ is the larger influence of the soil degradation on the hysteresis patterns will be the loops rapidly change to z shape from the full fusiform in the initial loading stage the phenomena indicates that the greater the ζ the more significant the soil degradation 4 style of the hysteresis loop under the test to analyze the influences of irregular loading unloading on the quasi static p y hysteresis loop the hysteresis loop in clay or sand derived from the constant the variable and the mixed amplitude displacement loading patterns are analyzed 4 1 one way cyclic loading the displacement action is shown in fig 10 after monotonic loading the sine displacement with the frequency of 1 5 hz is applied to the model the dimensionless ratio of peak displacement and y 50 is 0 8 2 8 and 4 8 respectively the p y hysteresis loop is showed in fig 11 it can be seen that the soil deforms nonlinearly during the monotonic loading and p y backbone curve is in hyperbolic type at the repeated cyclic loading unloading stage the one way p y hysteresis loop displays in a full spindle shaped due to the small cyclic displacement action and becomes stable after the soil degradation with the increase of the cyclic displacement action the p y hysteresis loops display in a spindle shape with a tail when there is a reversed loading the hysteresis loops change to be a s shape the aforementioned phenomena indicate that the drag gap component is worked for describing the soil pile separation effect the hysteresis curve can reflect the separation and degradation characteristics of soil pile system under one way cycle loading 4 2 constant amplitude loading as shown in fig 12 the sine wave with 3 periods and 4 displacements is introduced for constant amplitude displacement loading dimensionless ratio of peak displacement load and y 50 is 1 4 7 and 10 respectively the loading frequency is 1 5 hz as shown in fig 13 the hysteresis loop follows the p y backbone curve and rapidly response to soil pile gap and soil degradation under irregular loadings with less cycle number in the first displacement cyclic loading the soil plastic deformation is small and the soil degeneration is not significant the hysteresis loop is in a long and thin shuttle shape in the subsequent second displacement loading the soil plastic deformation continues to increase along with the p y backbone curve and the pattern of hysteresis loop changes from the initial full shuttle shape to the reversed s shape the strength and stiffness of soil are degenerating obviously as the displacement loading keeps increasing the hysteresis loop changes to a z shape and the soil degeneration is more significant under the influence of soil pile separation effect 4 3 variable amplitude loading fig 14 shows the variable amplitude displacement loading with frequency of 1 5 hz the continuous cycle displacement with different amplitudes decreases to zero gradually after increasing to the maximum displacement amplitudes accumulatively dimensionless ratio of peak displacement load and y 50 is 10 as shown in fig 15 the hysteresis curve pattern influenced by soil pile separation is the main function of the elastoplastic component and gradually changes to the single function of the drag gap component as can be seen from the figure with the continuous increase of displacement amplitude from the elastic stage to the yield stage the hysteresis loop changes from a straight line to a shuttle shape and then to a s shape after the pinch phenomenon when the amplitude reaches the maximum value the hysteresis loop changes into a z shape as the displacement gradually decreases afterwards a full and stable hysteresis loop gradually appears at the central position 4 4 mixed amplitude loading fig 16 shows the irregular displacement loading unloading after increasing to the yield stage u y 50 8 the displacement amplitude decreased u y 50 1 and then functioned by a large constant amplitude displacement loading u y 50 3 5 and 8 after that it is loaded by the constant amplitude displacement u y 50 3 to the up side with frequency of 1 5 hz as shown in fig 17 the p y hysteresis curve shape is consistent with the irregular loading trend and is significantly influenced by the soil pile gap in the initial stage with the continuous increase of displacement amplitude from the elastic stage to the yield stage the hysteresis loops change from a straight line to a shuttle shape and then a pinch phenomenon appears while the displacement amplitude suddenly decreases the hysteresis loops become shuttle shape and off center to the right in the internal part which is functioned by the drag gap component only after the increase of displacement amplitude the hysteresis curve returns to the normal shape and then in the case of displacement loading off center to the upper the hysteresis curve is shuttle shape with a tail towards the right 5 validation of the hysteresis loop 5 1 comparison with the hysteresis loop of theoretical approachs the developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop is compared with the pysimple1 material and the strain wedge method heidari et al 2014b under one way or two way cyclic loads the pysimple1 material is one of opensees materials mckenna 2011 five cycle numbers of the constant amplitude displacement loading are taken separately among which the one way displacement amplitude is 0 15d and the two way displacement amplitude is 0 25d d is the pile diameter the damping effects of soil are all excluded during the comparison the relevant parameters of strain wedge method are determined from reference heidari et al 2014b the pysimple1 material parameters are c 10 n p 5 c r 0 35 and c d 0 1 the present loop parameters are α 0 25 ζ 0 5 and c d 0 1 as shown in fig 18 the comparison shows that all of the three models produce the p y hysteresis loops with full shape the p y hysteresis loop patterns of the present loop and the strain wedge model are more similar but in the plastic repeated loading phase the present model can simulate the gap increment caused by the soil degradation and the soil pile gap besides the pysimple1 material cannot take the soil degradation into consideration its p y hysteresis loop tends to be single shape in the reloading stage 5 2 comparison with the measured hysteresis loop fig 19 shows the quasi static p y hysteresis loop under cyclic displacement actions on the pile head in the clay reported by matlock 1970 through a laboratory model experiment four groups of different displacement amplitudes were used in the test each amplitude was applied at the control point for 10 cycles the cyclic loading of the first group shows the soil strength degradation slightly as the p y hysteresis loop was a straight line as for the cyclic displacement of the second and the third groups the initial hysteresis loop was spindle shape with the pinch shape at the middle part owning to the obvious degradation of soil strength and stiffness the quasi static p y hysteresis loop was rapidly transmitted into a z shape in the following cyclic displacement and tended to become stable as for the fourth group soil pile separation occurred when the cyclic displacement amplitude was about 20 percent of the pile diameter the soil strength and stiffness gradually decreased in order to verify the reasonability of the developed p y hysteresis loop as shown in fig 20 four groups of different displacement amplitudes are used by 10 cycle numbers for each to compare the present developed loop with the pysimple1 material and the matlock laboratory experiment matlock 1970 individually the state parameters c np c r and c d of the pysimple1 material should be taken by referring to the material definition in opensees fig 21 a shows the p y hysteresis loop of the pysimple1 material and fig 21b is the present developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop both kinds of hysteresis loop can reflect nonlinear deformation characteristic and the soil pile gap behavior however the pysimple1 material cannot take the soil strength and stiffness degradation into consideration besides the present hysteresis loop tends to be stable at the later cyclic stage compared with the p y hysteresis loop in fig 19 the present loop can reflect the actual soil pile deformation mechanism under cyclic loadings more accurately than the pysimple1 material 6 application analysis the model is incorporated into the generalized bnwf method to analyze the soil pile interaction under the monotonic or cyclic loads partial differential equation of pile lateral movement is shown as below 25 e i 4 u z 4 k h u p where ei is the pile flexural stiffness the stiffness matrix for pile element can be obtained according to the gauss legendre integration rule u is the pile lateral deformation z is the depth k h is the lateral tangent stiffness of soil which is obtained from the tangent stiffness of the p y hysteresis curve and p is the cyclic loads on the top of pile eq 25 can be solved by nonlinear finite element method with the framework of the open source software opensees mckenna 2011 pile element uses the dispbeamcolumn type and model element uses the zerolength type only lateral behavior is modeled so there are some additional fixities the developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop is modeled by zerolength element the soil end of the zerolength elements are fixed completely the pile end of the zerolength elements are only free in the direction of loading and the pile nodes are fixed against translation in the orthogonal direction of loading and rotation out of the plane of loading the base of the pile is also fixed against vertical translation the pile end of the zerolength element is linked as slave nodes to their corresponding pile nodes in the direction of loading using the equal dof command the pile head node where the load is applied is separated to allow the user to specify a free head no rotational fixity or fixed head full rotational fixity condition at the loading point 6 1 comparison with numerical simulation yang and jeremic 2002 conducted a finite element study on the behavior of a single pile in elastoplastic layered soils as shown in fig 22 the pile length is 13 3 m the square pile width is 0 429 m the pile material is aluminum having elasticity modulus of 68 9 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 the total load on the pile top is 400 kn the friction angle of medium dense sand is 37 1 with a dilation angle of 0 the shear modulus is 8 96 mpa at a depth 13 7 m the poisson s ratio is 0 35 and unit weight is 14 5 kn m3 undrained shear strength of clay is 21 7 kpa the young modulus is 11 0 mpa and the poisson s ratio is 0 45 the unit weight is 13 7 kn m3 under the monotonic loading the p y backbone curve is connected with the initial stiffness and the soil resistance and is not influenced by the soil pile parameters of gap drag or degradation to verify the practicability of the bnwf model derived from the development p y hysteresis loop the number of pile sections is consistent with the finite element model during nonlinear analysis of a laterally loaded pile the bending moment and displacement of pile in the clay with a sand layer case 2 is shown in fig 23 the result shows that the bending moments of the two methods are consistent but the pile displacement obtained from the bnwf model is greater than that from the finite element method and the difference increase with the increase of loads the bending moment and displacement of pile in the sand with a clay layer case 4 is shown in fig 24 the bending moments and displacements obtained by the two methods are more consistent but the depth of the maximum bending moment obtained from the bnwf model is greater than the finite element method fig 25 shows the pile head loads and the maximum bending moments in case 2 and case 4 it can be seen that in the sand with a clay layer case 4 the results with the bnwf method and the finite element method are nearly the same but in a clay layer case 2 the nonlinearity of p y backbone curve in this present method is stronger than the finite element method when the pile lateral head displacement is greater in the case of large displacement deformations the soil pile contacted element of the finite element method is continuous which cannot be used to simulate the soil pile separation 6 2 comparison with field test tuladhar et al 2008 conducted the lateral cyclic behavior of the prestressed concrete pile using full scale lateral loading tests indicating that the soil pile gap and the soil degradation need be taking into consideration for the cyclic behavior of lateral loaded pile as shown in fig 26 outer diameter of prestressed pile is 300 mm the wall thickness is 60 mm having a length of 26 m the compressive strength of the concrete is f c 69 mpa and the yield stress of longitudinal prestressing steel is f y 1325 mpa the effective prestress of concrete is 5 mpa the yield bending moment of pile section is m y 42 kn m and the ultimate bending moment is m u 51 2 kn m the strain hardening ratio ratio between post yield tangent and initial elastic tangent is 0 26 the elastic modulus of pile can be obtained from the measured curvature relationship between the short term stiffness dividing inertia moment of cross section tuladhar et al 2008 the embedded depth is 24 8 and the test loads adopt displacement control to act at the loading point 1 2 m below the pile top the displacement loading with 7 periods of increasing triangular displacement is shown in fig 27 the model calculation depth is valued up to 12 6 m heidari et al 2014b tuladhar et al 2008 the clay soil depth is 0 6 m with gravity of 15 7 kn m3 and shear strength of 33 kpa the sand soil depth is 6 12 5 m with the gravity of 18 6 kn m3 the shear strength is 140 kpa and the internal friction angle is 39 the obvious gap on the contact surface at both sides of the pile can be observed under the lateral cyclic loading indicating that the soil pile separation effect occurs and soil degrades obviously heidari et al 2014b kondner 1963 tuladhar et al 2008 the model parameters are α 0 4 ζ 2 5 c d 0 05 fig 28 is the load displacement curve of the test point fig 29 shows the theoretical and measured pile curvature distribution the calculated results are similar to the test results which indicates that the developed quasi static p y hysteresis loop can reflect the soil degradation and soil pile gap reasonably 7 conclusion the quasi static p y hysteresis loop is established based on the hyperbolic p y backbone curve and the soil stiffness degradation with the average shear strain the developed p y hysteresis loop takes the soil pile gap and the soil degradation on the soil pile interaction into consideration the change of soil pile gap parameter α the soil pile drag parameter c d and the degradation correcting coefficient ζ may change the pattern of the hysteresis loop for common engineering problems the soil pile gap parameter α is about 0 05 0 5 and the soil pile drag parameter c d is about 0 05 0 2 the degradation correcting coefficient ζ can be determined by the actual soil degradation the larger ζ leads to the more obvious soil degradation the quasi static p y hysteresis loop is analyzed with constant variable and mixed amplitude displacement loadings the loop patterns can reflect the reasonable soil pile deformation mechanism including the soil pile separation and the soil degradation in the irregular displacement loading unloading the pattern of the p y hysteresis loop is consistent with the

carried out to check the accuracy of the generated mesh models the in plane and out of plane plastic collapse moments of uncracked chs t y joints are calculated and compared with results obtained from three codes and experimental data the comparison shows that the plastic collapse moments of uncracked chs t y joints obtained in this study are accurate and reliable subsequently an extensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending it is found that the in plane and out of plane plastic collapse moments may decrease by up to 35 1 and 33 6 respectively when the crack area a nc reaches 25 of the intersectional area t 0 l w finally two lower bound strength reduction factor f ar

ratio 1 introduction fatigue cracks are frequently detected at the hot spot stress location of many circular hollow section chs joints in aging offshore platforms these fatigue cracks are mainly due to cyclic loads caused by sea wave wind and sea current the current bs7910 2013 standard recommends failure assessment diagram fad method to assess the safety and integrity of cracked chs joints fad is derived based on two different failure modes which are the plastic collapse and the brittle fracture fig 1 shows the option 1 fad curve for a cracked chs joint subjected to axial tensile load in bs7910 2013 l r and k r represent the ratio of the applied load to the plastic collapse load and the ratio of the stress intensity factor to the material fracture toughness respectively the cracked chs joint is deemed to be safe if the assessment point falls inside the fad curve otherwise it is deemed to be potentially unsafe and thus a higher level analysis is required in reality all chs joints are subjected to combined load which is a combination of axial load in plane and out of plane bending for cracked chs joints under combined load l r is expressed as 1 l r σ f σ y p a p c m ai m ci 2 m ao m co where σf is flow stress σy is yield stress p a is applied axial load m ai is applied in plane bending m ao is applied out of plane bending p c is axial plastic collapse load m ci is in plane plastic collapse moment and m co is out of plane plastic collapse moment this study focus only on the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending and thus k r will not be discussed in bs7910 2013 a strength reduction factor f ar is recommended to calculate the plastic collapse load of cracked chs joints the characteristic static strength of the corresponding uncracked joint multiplied by the strength reduction factor f ar gives the plastic collapse load of the cracked joint for a cracked chs t y joint containing a surface crack f ar is given by 2 f ar 1 a c t 0 l w where a c is crack area t 0 is chord thickness and l w is circumferential length of the weld toe on the chord the crack area a c for a semi elliptical surface crack is given as follows 3 a c 0 5 π a c it is important to recognize that eq 2 is only applicable for specific cracked chs joints under axial tensile load only for cracked chs t y joints containing a surface crack under in plane and out of plane bending there are no such strength reduction factors available at the moment skallerud et al 1994 carried out both experimental tests and fe analyses on uncracked and cracked chs t joints subjected to axial tensile load and out of plane bending all the tested specimens fail in a ductile mode with stable crack growth at the last loading stage it is difficult to evaluate the results obtained by skallerud et al 1994 because there is not enough information available on the crack size therefore it is necessary to investigate the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending plastic collapse load moments of a cracked chs joint are important parameters used in the fad analysis basically they are the static strength of the cracked joint without allowing for crack propagation and fracture plastic collapse load moments of a cracked chs joint can be estimated by using finite element fe analysis stacey et al 1996a 1996b qian 2013 reported the fad curves of cracked chs x and k joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack under axial loading firstly mesh model of the local crack front is generated using a commercialized fracture mechanics mesh builder and then tied with the other region of the cracked joint which is generated from an automatic mesh generator in patran one of the main findings is that the plastic collapse load has significant effect on the shape of the fad curve in a separate study qian et al 2013 reported the fad curve of cracked chs x joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack under in plane bending it is also found that the plastic collapse moment has significant effect on the shape of the fad curve lie et al 2013 investigated the plastic collapse load of cracked chs t y joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack under axial loading an in house 3d mesh generator was developed to generate the mesh models used in the fe analyses fe results are verified against experimental data it is found that the strength reduction factor in bs7910 2013 is conservative for cracked chs t y joints being investigated it is worthwhile to note that plastic collapse load moments are applicable only for the crack size being analyzed or tested for fully plastic response therefore the crack propagation is ignored in the fe analysis when determining the load displacement curve of a cracked chs joint stacey et al 1996a 1996b lie et al 2013 if the failure mode of the cracked joint behaves in a brittle manner then the plastic collapse load moments of the cracked joint can only be estimated using fe analysis gibstein and moe 1986 this study concerns the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack at the chord weld toe under in plane and out of plane bending the strength reduction factor of a cracked chs t y joint under in plane and out of plane bending is defined as 4 f ar plastic collapse moment of cracked chs t y joint plastic collapse moment of uncracked chs t y joint in order to achieve the main objective of the present study an in house 3d mesh generator is used to generate all the mesh models automatically details of the in house 3d mesh generator can be found in another paper lie et al 2013 published by the authors extensive mesh convergence tests are carried out to obtain the most optimum and efficient mesh density subsequently parameter study is carried out to investigate the plastic collapse moments of uncracked and cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending finally two strength reduction factor f ar equations are proposed based on the fe results 2 geometric scope of this study fig 2 shows the geometry and notations of a typical chs t y joint under in plane and out of plane bending three geometrical parameters β γ and θ and one crack parameter i e the crack area may have significant influence on the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending in the parametric study the following geometrical parameter ranges are considered 0 2 β 0 8 10 γ 25 30 θ 90 for β a range of 0 2 β 1 is specified in many prevalent codes such as api rp 2a wsd 2005 eurocode 3 2005 and cidect wardenier et al 2008 for chs t y joints with larger β values approaching 1 a special mesh design at the chord brace intersection zone has to be employed due to the unique weld profile and such a special mesh design is not attempted in this study therefore the maximum β adopted in this study is 0 8 for γ a maximum value of 25 is generally specified in the three codes mentioned above when γ ratio is less than 10 a chs tube should be treated as a thick member wang et al 2011 for thick chord member failure is more likely to occur at the brace of chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending therefore a minimum γ ratio of 10 is used in this study chs t y joints failing at the brace due to bending are not covered in this study this is because fatigue cracks are frequently detected at the chord in the parametric study the chord thickness is fixed as 10 mm and the brace length is intentionally kept as 400 mm other geometrical parameters such as the brace diameter and thickness and the chord diameter can be derived using equations indicated in fig 2 chs t y joints with β and γ equal to 0 2 and 10 are omitted in this study as the brace diameter is too small to be realistic in practice it is commonly accepted that the chord length should be at least four times the chord diameter to eliminate end effects on joint strength which means that α should be greater than 8 in this study three chord members are used including ϕ200 10 ϕ360 10 and ϕ500 10 the corresponding α values are 22 18 and 18 respectively according to laham and burdekin laham and burdekin 1997 burdekin 2002 the crack area is the major parameter affecting the strength reduction factor f ar of a cracked chs t y joint containing a through thickness crack under axial tensile load in this study the surface crack area is expressed as 5 a nc 100 a c t 0 l w the ranges of a nc and a t 0 are specified as 0 a nc 25 0 2 a t 0 0 8 three values of a nc 5 15 and 25 are chosen in this study when the crack area a nc reaches 5 15 and 25 the corresponding crack depth ratio a t 0 is 0 2 0 6 and 0 8 respectively following the rule that crack area increases as the crack propagates lie et al 2016 3 finite element mesh generation fatigue cracks always tend to initiate from the hot spot stress location of chs joints and then propagate along the weld toe and through the chord thickness when chs t y joints are subjected under in plane and out of plane bending the crack locations are located at the crown and at the saddle respectively in order to obtain accurate plastic collapse moments the mesh model must be designed with care lie et al 2013 in the in house 3d mesh generator the surface crack can be located anywhere of the chord weld toe 20 node solid element is used throughout to model the uncracked and cracked chs t y joints to ensure convergence of the fe analyses a finite radius key hole is designed at the crack front the radius of the key hole is at least five times smaller than the deformed crack tip radius which is approximately half of the crack tip opening displacement ctod api 579 1 asme ffs 1 2007 in this study the radius of the key hole is set equal to 0 005 mm fig 3 a and b show typical mesh models of the uncracked and cracked chs t y joints for the mesh models of cracked chs t y joints two types of mesh refinement schemes are provided in the mesh generator the first type is used to refine the local mesh of the crack front as shown in fig 4 a and b element contours enclosing the crack front and the number of divisions number of cutting cross sections along the entire crack front are set as two variables so that it is easy to refine the mesh along the crack front the second type is used to refine the global mesh of the entire chord member as shown in fig 5 a and b number of elements along the chord brace intersecting curve is also set as a variable in the mesh generator in practice the crack depth and length of the surface crack can vary widely in cracked chs t y joints for a very shallow surface crack the mesh transition between the crack front and the remaining ligament ahead of the crack front must be smooth because it can affect the accuracy of the stress distribution through the chord thickness in order to smooth out the mesh grading at this transition region a third mesh refinement scheme is designed to increase the element layers at the remaining ligament ahead of the crack front fig 6 a and b show the details of such mesh refinement scheme 4 mesh convergence test mesh convergence tests are carried out so that a comparison can be made between the results obtained from coarse and fine mesh models the boundary conditions of chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are shown in fig 7 nodes at the two ends of the chord are fixed and pure bending moment is applied to the brace end by using displacement control mode firstly a reference point is created at the centre of the brace end cross section then the reference point is tied with all the nodes at the brace end finally a radian displacement in pure bending moment direction is applied to the reference point the pure bending moment is the reaction force of the reference point in the pure moment loading direction the stress strain data of grade s355 structural steel reported by van der vegate van der vegte 1995 is used in the convergence test and it is shown in fig 8 the yield and the ultimate strength are 355 mpa and 630 mpa respectively poisson s ratio and young s modulus are 0 3 and 205 gpa respectively in the fe analyses it is found that for chs t y joints with γ equal to 10 young s modulus and the yield strength of the brace have to be increased by 10 and 2 times of their original values to prevent bending failure of the brace this strategy has been reported by van der vegte van der vegte 1995 the mesh models are firstly generated by the 3d mesh generator and then they are input into abaqus 2013 software for analyses in the fe analyses the crack propagation is not considered as mentioned before for uncracked chs t y joints the mesh criteria are well known shao 2007 ahmadi et al 2011 2015 ahmadi 2016 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 at the chord brace intersection zone 40 elements along the chord brace intersection curve and 1 brick element or even shell element at the chord thickness are generally sufficient to get an accurate prediction of the ultimate static strength of uncracked chs t y joints for regions far away from the chord brace intersection zone a relatively coarse mesh can be used to reduce elements and thus save the computational cost for cracked chs t y joints such mesh criteria are not available in the mesh convergence tests coarse mesh refers to a 48 elements along the chord brace intersection curve b 1 element layer at the remaining ligament ahead of the crack tube c 2 element contours enclosing the crack front and fine mesh refers to a 96 elements along the chord brace intersection curve b 3 element layers at the remaining ligament ahead of the crack tube c 4 element contours enclosing the crack front fig 9 a and b show the mesh convergence test results and it can be seen that even the coarse mesh used in this study can produce very accurate results in this study fe models of uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are verified against experimental data detailed verification can be found in subsequent sub section 5 3 as fe models of uncracked and cracked chs t y joints share the same boundary conditions and material properties it is only necessary to carry out mesh convergence tests on cracked chs t y joints to guarantee the mesh density requirement then it can be concluded that fe models of cracked chs t y joints used in this study are accurate and reliable 5 uncracked chs t y joints in this section in plane and out of plane plastic collapse moments of 22 uncracked chs t y joints are calculated using fe analyses firstly the deformation character at the chord brace intersection region of uncracked chs t y joints is investigated then moment rotation curves of two uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are discussed consequently in plane and out of plane plastic collapse moments of all the analyzed chs t y joints are determined finally fe results are verified against values obtained from existing codes of practice and experimental data and fe results reported by other researchers 5 1 deformation character and stress distribution it is observed that failure typically occurs due to fracture through the chord wall on the tensile side of the brace and plastic bending and buckling of the chord on the compression side for uncracked chs t y joints under in plane bending according to the uk department of energy 1990 fig 10 shows the typical deformation of a chs t y joint under in plane bending it can be seen that local bulging and indentation occurs at the chord on the tensile and compression sides of the brace respectively meanwhile slight external ovalization at the two chord side walls is observed the amplitude of the external ovalization varies for different chs t y joints but it is small compared to the local bulging and indentation for uncracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending failure typically occurs due to fracture and local buckling of the chord walls on the tensile and the compression side of the brace according to the uk department of energy 1990 fig 11 shows the typical deformation of a chs t y joint under out of plane bending it can be seen that local bulging and indentation occurs at the chord on the tensile and compression sides of the brace the maximum deformation always occurs at the saddle position on the compression side of the brace and it involves both local indentation and overall rotation of the chord 5 2 moment rotation curves by examining all the chs t y joints investigated it is observed that the trend of all moment rotation curves are quite similar and they behave as continuously increasing without showing a peak value the slope of all the curves is moderate after excessive gross yielding occurs and they can be observed from fig 12 a and b for this type of moment rotation curves it is widely accepted that a deformation limit should be used to determine the plastic collapse moments lu et al 1994 zhao 2000 in this study lu s deformation limit lu et al 1994 is adopted for lu s deformation limit when the local deformation of the chord reaches 3 d 0 the applied load is taken as the ultimate static strength which is identical to the plastic collapse load of the uncracked chs t y joints considered in this study in this study local deformation e g local bulging or indentation of 3 d 0 is taken as lu s deformation limit fig 13 illustrates the usage of lu s deformation limit to determine the plastic collapse moment of a chs t y joint under in plane bending displacements of nodes on the top and bottom of the chord red dots shown in fig 10 are extracted for every load increment step the deformation is calculated by calculating the difference between displacements of nodes on the top and bottom of the chord for the case shown in fig 13 the value of lu s deformation limit is 15 mm the maximum deformation values at load increment 28 and 29 are 14 12 mm and 16 83 mm respectively the linear interpolation method is used to determine the in plane plastic collapse moment of the joint for uncracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending it is more difficult to determine the out of plane plastic collapse moment by using lu s deformation limit as the chord rotation is involved fig 14 a and b illustrate the usage of lu s deformation limit to determine the out of plane plastic collapse moment considered in this study it can be seen that the local indentation not only involves displacement u x but also u y at a load increment due to the chord rotation the linear interpolation method is used again to determine the out of plane plastic collapse moment of the uncracked chs joints for all the analyzed uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending the indentation at the chord on the compression side of the brace always reach lu s deformation limit first in addition to lu s deformation limit twice elastic compliance tec shown in fig 15 is also adopted in this study this is because tec was frequently used to determine the plastic collapse load of different chs and rhs joints under axial tensile load by many researchers before laham and burdekin 1997 burdekin 2002 lie et al 2009 2015 in fig 15 the relationship between φ and θ is expressed as 6 tan φ 2 tan θ fig 12 a and b show the applications of twice elastic compliance and lu s deformation limit to determine the plastic collapse moments of two uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending 5 3 plastic collapse moments of uncracked chs t y joints figs 16 and 17 show the comparison of dimensionless plastic collapse moments between the fe prediction in this study and the results obtained from three codes mentioned before it is found that fe prediction using lu s deformation limit concept is consistently higher for both in plane and out of plane bending cases in fig 18 a and b fe prediction is further compared to the experimental data and numerical results reported by other researchers lee and dexter 1994 van der vegte et al 2009 it can be seen that data points of the non dimensional plastic collapse moments obtained in this study mix with the data band reported by other researchers data scatter is reasonable and acceptable from the comparisons shown in figs 16 18 a b it can be concluded that m ci and m co of uncracked chs t y joints determined in this study are accurate and reliable 6 cracked chs t y joints in this section plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are studied firstly plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are determined respectively then the strength reduction factor f ar defined by eq 4 is calculated consequently the effect of various parameters including the crack area β γ and θ and different types of material are investigated finally lower bound f ar equations for cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are proposed based on the parametric study results 6 1 deformation and stress distribution fig 19 a and b shows the typical deformation and stress distribution at the chord brace intersection zone of the cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending it is found that bulging at the chord on the brace tensile side decreases due to the surface crack crack mouth opening displacement cmod increases as the applied load increases when the applied load is approaching m ci or m co cmod increases rapidly in a nonlinear manner 6 2 plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints fig 20 a and b show typical moment rotation curves of two chs t y joints containing cracks of various sizes under in plane and out of plane bending it is observed that for cracked joints containing a small crack such as a nc 5 the trend of the moment rotation curves are similar to the uncracked joint behaving as continuously increasing however when the crack area is very large such as a nc 25 a peak value may be observed in the moment rotation curve before lu s limit is reached after the peak value is reached the applied loading starts to decrease gradually 6 3 effect of geometrical parameters on far fig 21 a shows the effect of β on f ar for cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending in this study values of f ar plotted using dash line indicate that plastic collapse moments are determined using twice elastic compliance whereas values of f ar plotted in solid line indicate that they are determined using lu s deformation limit it can be seen that the distributions of f ar determined from twice elastic compliance are more regular this is because plastic collapse moments determined using twice elastic compliance are conservative as yielding is confined within a certain region of the chord brace intersection zone when twice elastic compliance limit is reached in contrast distributions of f ar determined using lu s deformation limit are slightly irregular this is mainly because yielding might spread across the entire chord brace intersection zone for cracked joints containing large size crack when lu s deformation limit is reached as mentioned previously for joints containing large size crack such as a nc 25 the moment rotations curves may decrease after excessive gross yielding and thus peak values of moment rotation curves are observed before lu s deformation limit is reached therefore for chs t y joints containing a large crack values of f ar determined from lu s limit are conservative fig 21 b shows the effect of β on f ar for cracked chs t y joint under out of plane bending it can be seen that f ar determined from twice elastic compliance and lu s limit are quite similar when β is less than 0 6 f ar increases linearly as β increases after β exceeds 0 6 f ar turns to decrease fig 22 a shows the effect of γ on f ar for cracked chs t y joint under in plane bending it can be seen that the distribution of f ar determined from twice elastic compliance is more regular due to the same reasons explained previously values of f ar determined from twice elastic compliance may not be safe for cracked joints containing a larger size crack fig 22 b shows the effect of γ on f ar for cracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending it can be seen that the distributions of f ar determined from twice elastic compliance and lu s limit are similar it appears that γ has a small effect on f ar if the crack area is less than 15 after the crack area exceeds 15 f ar increases as γ increases fig 23 a shows the effect of θ on f ar for cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending it can be seen that f ar values of chs y joints θ 60 are consistently higher than chs t joints θ 90 it indicates that for cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending a surface crack has the most severe influence on chs t joints fig 23 b shows the effect of θ on f ar of cracked chs t y joint under out of plane bending it can be seen that θ has a slight effect for this case 6 4 effect of the crack area on far fig 24 a and b show the effect of crack area on the f ar of cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending it can be seen that the crack area has a significant effect on f ar the relationship between the crack area and f ar is almost linear for comparison purpose f ar determined from bs7910 2013 is also plotted in fig 24 a and b it should be bear in mind that this f ar is only valid for chs joints under axial tensile load it can be seen that all f ar data points determined from twice elastic compliance are above the bs7910 2013 standard curve whereas most of f ar data points determined from lu s deformation limit are below it fig 25 a and b show the effect of crack area on the f ar of cracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending the relationship between the crack area and f ar is approximately linear after the crack area exceeds 15 the decrease of f ar becomes slightly slower with the exception of one model β 0 8 γ 10 θ 90 this is unexpected as compared to the in plane bending case it can be seen that the f ar curve in bs7910 2013 crosses the middle of the two data bands of f ar for cracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending 6 5 effect of different material properties in order to investigate the effect of the material properties on the strength reduction factor f ar another two types of steel are used in the fe analyses one is a high strength tmcp steel reported by zerbst et al 2002 named tmcp grade s450 its yield strength is not less than 450 mpa poisson s ratio and young s modulus are 0 3 and 210 gpa respectively the other is api 5l grade b steel its yield strength is not less than 240 mpa poisson s ratio and young s modulus are 0 3 and 205 gpa respectively the stress strain curves used in the fe analyses are shown in fig 26 it can be seen that for the api 5l grade b steel an ideal stress strain curve with no strain hardening effect is used in the fe analyses for each loading case e g in plane and out of plane bending three models with different crack areas e g 5 15 and 25 are investigated these 6 models refer to the lowest data points when a nc is 5 15 and 25 shown in figs 24 and 25 from fig 27 a and b it can be seen that the effect of the material property is not significant by grouping all the data points predicted using three different materials for each loading case a representative lower bound can be proposed 6 6 proposed far equations two linear lines are proposed to represent the lower bound of f ar data points for cracked chs t y joins under in plane and out of plane bending respectively for the in plane bending the lower bound is given as 7 f ar 1 1 35 a c t 0 l w for the out of plane bending the lower bound is given as 8 f ar 1 1 30 a c t 0 l w in figs 28 and 29 all the fe results are plotted together with the corresponding lower bound curve proposed in this study it can be seen that there are some data points fall below the proposed curves when the crack area a nc is 5 these data points are from cracked chs t y joints with γ 10 this is because lu s deformation limit of 3 d 0 can produce a very conservative f ar for chs t y joints with thick chord this is expected because local indentation is difficult to occur for thick chord as certain amount of conservatism already exists in the equations for calculating the plastic collapse moments of uncracked t y joints figs 16 and 17 it is not necessary to propose an over conservative lower bound for the f ar therefore it can be concluded that eqs 7 and 8 can safely be used to predict the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending within the specified ranges considered in this study 7 conclusion based on the parametric study results the following conclusions can be made 1 both twice elastic compliance and lu s deformation limit can be used to determine the plastic collapsed moments of uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending plastic collapse moments determined from twice elastic compliance is consistently lower than that determined from lu s deformation limit if the brace is vulnerable to bending failure twice elastic compliance is no longer suitable 2 for cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending the surface crack area a nc has the most significant effect on m ci and consequently on f ar when a nc reaches 25 m ci can decrease up to 35 1 other parameters β γ and θ have only a slight influence on the f ar of cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending 3 the crack area also has the most significant influence on m co of cracked chs t y joints when a nc reaches 25 m co can decrease up to 33 6 other parameters β γ and θ have negligible influence on the f ar 4 material properties namely the stress strain data used in this study has no significant effect on the strength reduction factor f ar of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending 5 based on all the fe results two strength reduction factor f ar equations are proposed for cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending respectively these equations are towards the lower bound therefore they can be safely used to predict the m ci and m co of cracked chs t y joints in conjunction with the corresponding characteristic strength of the uncracked chs t y joints within the specified ranges considered in this study 
23684,the plastic collapse loads of cracked circular hollow section chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are investigated using finite element fe analyses an in house 3d fe mesh generator is specifically developed to create the mesh models of the cracked joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack located at the weld toe of the chord mesh convergence tests are then carried out to check the accuracy of the generated mesh models the in plane and out of plane plastic collapse moments of uncracked chs t y joints are calculated and compared with results obtained from three codes and experimental data the comparison shows that the plastic collapse moments of uncracked chs t y joints obtained in this study are accurate and reliable subsequently an extensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending it is found that the in plane and out of plane plastic collapse moments may decrease by up to 35 1 and 33 6 respectively when the crack area a nc reaches 25 of the intersectional area t 0 l w finally two lower bound strength reduction factor f ar

ratio 1 introduction fatigue cracks are frequently detected at the hot spot stress location of many circular hollow section chs joints in aging offshore platforms these fatigue cracks are mainly due to cyclic loads caused by sea wave wind and sea current the current bs7910 2013 standard recommends failure assessment diagram fad method to assess the safety and integrity of cracked chs joints fad is derived based on two different failure modes which are the plastic collapse and the brittle fracture fig 1 shows the option 1 fad curve for a cracked chs joint subjected to axial tensile load in bs7910 2013 l r and k r represent the ratio of the applied load to the plastic collapse load and the ratio of the stress intensity factor to the material fracture toughness respectively the cracked chs joint is deemed to be safe if the assessment point falls inside the fad curve otherwise it is deemed to be potentially unsafe and thus a higher level analysis is required in reality all chs joints are subjected to combined load which is a combination of axial load in plane and out of plane bending for cracked chs joints under combined load l r is expressed as 1 l r σ f σ y p a p c m ai m ci 2 m

plastic collapse moment and m co is out of plane plastic collapse moment this study focus only on the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending and thus k r will not be discussed in bs7910 2013 a strength reduction factor f ar is recommended to calculate the plastic collapse load of cracked chs joints the characteristic static strength of the corresponding uncracked joint multiplied by the strength reduction factor f ar gives the plastic collapse load of the cracked joint for a cracked chs t y joint containing a surface crack f ar is given by 2 f ar 1 a c t 0 l w where a c is crack area t 0 is chord thickness and l w is circumferential length of the weld toe on the chord the crack area a c for a semi elliptical surface crack is given as follows 3 a c 0 5 π a c it is important to recognize that eq 2 is only applicable for specific cracked chs joints under axial tensile load only for cracked chs t y joints containing a surface crack under in plane and out of plane bending there are no such strength reduction factors available at the moment skallerud et al 1994 carried out both experimental tests and fe analyses on uncracked and cracked chs t joints subjected to axial tensile load and out of plane bending all the tested specimens fail in a ductile mode with stable crack growth at the last loading stage it is difficult to evaluate the results obtained by skallerud et al 1994 because there is not enough information available on the crack size therefore it is necessary to investigate the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending plastic collapse load moments of a cracked chs joint are important parameters used in the fad analysis basically they are the static strength of the cracked joint without allowing for crack propagation and fracture plastic collapse load moments of a cracked chs joint can be estimated by using finite element fe analysis stacey et al 1996a 1996b qian 2013 reported the fad curves of cracked chs x and k joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack under axial loading firstly mesh model of the local crack front is generated using a commercialized fracture mechanics mesh builder and then tied with the other region of the cracked joint which is generated from an automatic mesh generator in patran one of the main findings is that the plastic collapse load has significant effect on the shape of the fad curve in a separate study qian et al 2013 reported the fad curve of cracked chs x joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack under in plane bending it is also found that the plastic collapse moment has significant effect on the shape of the fad curve lie et al 2013 investigated the plastic collapse load of cracked chs t y joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack under axial loading an in house 3d mesh generator was developed to generate the mesh models used in the fe analyses fe results are verified against experimental data it is found that the strength reduction factor in bs7910 2013 is conservative for cracked chs t y joints being investigated it is worthwhile to note that plastic collapse load moments are applicable only for the crack size being analyzed or tested for fully plastic response therefore the crack propagation is ignored in the fe analysis when determining the load displacement curve of a cracked chs joint stacey et al 1996a 1996b lie et al 2013 if the failure mode of the cracked joint behaves in a brittle manner then the plastic collapse load moments of the cracked joint can only be estimated using fe analysis gibstein and moe 1986 this study concerns the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints containing a semi elliptical surface crack at the chord weld toe under in plane and out of plane bending the strength reduction factor of a cracked chs t y joint under in plane and out of plane bending is defined as 4 f ar plastic collapse moment of cracked chs t y joint plastic collapse moment of uncracked chs t y joint in order to achieve the main objective of the present study an in house 3d mesh generator is used to generate all the mesh models automatically details of the in house 3d mesh generator can be found in another paper lie et al 2013 published by the authors extensive mesh convergence tests are carried out to obtain the most optimum and efficient mesh density subsequently parameter study is carried out to investigate the plastic collapse moments of uncracked and cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending finally two strength reduction factor f ar equations are proposed based on the fe results 2 geometric scope of this study fig 2 shows the geometry and notations of a typical chs t y joint under in plane and out of plane bending three geometrical parameters β γ and θ and one crack parameter i e the crack area may have significant influence on the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending in the parametric study the following geometrical parameter ranges are considered 0 2 β 0 8 10 γ 25 30 θ 90 for β a range of 0 2 β 1 is specified in many prevalent codes such as api rp 2a wsd 2005 eurocode 3 2005 and cidect wardenier et al 2008 for chs t y joints with larger β values approaching 1 a special mesh design at the chord brace intersection zone has to be employed due to the unique weld profile and such a special mesh design is not attempted in this study therefore the maximum β adopted in this study is 0 8 for γ a maximum value of 25 is generally specified in the three codes mentioned above when γ ratio is less than 10 a chs tube should be treated as a thick member wang et al 2011 for thick chord member failure is more likely to occur at the brace of chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending therefore a minimum γ ratio of 10 is used in this study chs t y joints failing at the brace due to bending are not covered in this study this is because fatigue cracks are frequently detected at the chord in the parametric study the chord thickness is fixed as 10 mm and the brace length is intentionally kept as 400 mm other geometrical parameters such as the brace diameter and thickness and the chord diameter can be derived using equations indicated in fig 2 chs t y joints with β and γ equal to 0 2 and 10 are omitted in this study as the brace diameter is too small to be realistic in practice it is commonly accepted that the chord length should be at least four times the chord diameter to eliminate end effects on joint strength which means that α should be greater than 8 in this study three chord members are used including ϕ200 10 ϕ360 10 and ϕ500 10 the corresponding α values are 22 18 and 18 respectively according to laham and burdekin laham and burdekin 1997 burdekin 2002 the crack area is the major parameter affecting the strength reduction factor f ar of a cracked chs t y joint containing a through thickness crack under axial tensile load in this study the surface crack area is expressed as 5 a nc 100 a c t 0 l w the ranges of a nc and a t 0 are specified as 0 a nc 25 0 2 a t 0 0 8 three values of a nc 5 15 and 25 are chosen in this study when the crack area a nc reaches 5 15 and 25 the corresponding crack depth ratio a t 0 is 0 2 0 6 and 0 8 respectively following the rule that crack area increases as the crack propagates lie et al 2016 3 finite element mesh generation fatigue cracks always tend to initiate from the hot spot stress location of chs joints and then propagate along the weld toe and through the chord thickness when chs t y joints are subjected under in plane and out of plane bending the crack locations are located at the crown and at the saddle respectively in order to obtain accurate plastic collapse moments the mesh model must be designed with care lie et al 2013 in the in house 3d mesh generator the surface crack can be located anywhere of the chord weld toe 20 node solid element is used throughout to model the uncracked and cracked chs t y joints to ensure convergence of the fe analyses a finite radius key hole is designed at the crack front the radius of the key hole is at least five times smaller than the deformed crack tip radius which is approximately half of the crack tip opening displacement ctod api 579 1 asme ffs 1 2007 in this study the radius of the key hole is set equal to 0 005 mm fig 3 a and b show typical mesh models of the uncracked and cracked chs t y joints for the mesh models of cracked chs t y joints two types of mesh refinement schemes are provided in the mesh generator the first type is used to refine the local mesh of the crack front as shown in fig 4 a and b element contours enclosing the crack front and the number of divisions number of cutting cross sections along the entire crack front are set as two variables so that it is easy to refine the mesh along the crack front the second type is used to refine the global mesh of the entire chord member as shown in fig 5 a and b number of elements along the chord brace intersecting curve is also set as a variable in the mesh generator in practice the crack depth and length of the surface crack can vary widely in cracked chs t y joints for a very shallow surface crack the mesh transition between the crack front and the remaining ligament ahead of the crack front must be smooth because it can affect the accuracy of the stress distribution through the chord thickness in order to smooth out the mesh grading at this transition region a third mesh refinement scheme is designed to increase the element layers at the remaining ligament ahead of the crack front fig 6 a and b show the details of such mesh refinement scheme 4 mesh convergence test mesh convergence tests are carried out so that a comparison can be made between the results obtained from coarse and fine mesh models the boundary conditions of chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are shown in fig 7 nodes at the two ends of the chord are fixed and pure bending moment is applied to the brace end by using displacement control mode firstly a reference point is created at the centre of the brace end cross section then the reference point is tied with all the nodes at the brace end finally a radian displacement in pure bending moment direction is applied to the reference point the pure bending moment is the reaction force of the reference point in the pure moment loading direction the stress strain data of grade s355 structural steel reported by van der vegate van der vegte 1995 is used in the convergence test and it is shown in fig 8 the yield and the ultimate strength are 355 mpa and 630 mpa respectively poisson s ratio and young s modulus are 0 3 and 205 gpa respectively in the fe analyses it is found that for chs t y joints with γ equal to 10 young s modulus and the yield strength of the brace have to be increased by 10 and 2 times of their original values to prevent bending failure of the brace this strategy has been reported by van der vegte van der vegte 1995 the mesh models are firstly generated by the 3d mesh generator and then they are input into abaqus 2013 software for analyses in the fe analyses the crack propagation is not considered as mentioned before for uncracked chs t y joints the mesh criteria are well known shao 2007 ahmadi et al 2011 2015 ahmadi 2016 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 at the chord brace intersection zone 40 elements along the chord brace intersection curve and 1 brick element or even shell element at the chord thickness are generally sufficient to get an accurate prediction of the ultimate static strength of uncracked chs t y joints for regions far away from the chord brace intersection zone a relatively coarse mesh can be used to reduce elements and thus save the computational cost for cracked chs t y joints such mesh criteria are not available in the mesh convergence tests coarse mesh refers to a 48 elements along the chord brace intersection curve b 1 element layer at the remaining ligament ahead of the crack tube c 2 element contours enclosing the crack front and fine mesh refers to a 96 elements along the chord brace intersection curve b 3 element layers at the remaining ligament ahead of the crack tube c 4 element contours enclosing the crack front fig 9 a and b show the mesh convergence test results and it can be seen that even the coarse mesh used in this study can produce very accurate results in this study fe models of uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are verified against experimental data detailed verification can be found in subsequent sub section 5 3 as fe models of uncracked and cracked chs t y joints share the same boundary conditions and material properties it is only necessary to carry out mesh convergence tests on cracked chs t y joints to guarantee the mesh density requirement then it can be concluded that fe models of cracked chs t y joints used in this study are accurate and reliable 5 uncracked chs t y joints in this section in plane and out of plane plastic collapse moments of 22 uncracked chs t y joints are calculated using fe analyses firstly the deformation character at the chord brace intersection region of uncracked chs t y joints is investigated then moment rotation curves of two uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are discussed consequently in plane and out of plane plastic collapse moments of all the analyzed chs t y joints are determined finally fe results are verified against values obtained from existing codes of practice and experimental data and fe results reported by other researchers 5 1 deformation character and stress distribution it is observed that failure typically occurs due to fracture through the chord wall on the tensile side of the brace and plastic bending and buckling of the chord on the compression side for uncracked chs t y joints under in plane bending according to the uk department of energy 1990 fig 10 shows the typical deformation of a chs t y joint under in plane bending it can be seen that local bulging and indentation occurs at the chord on the tensile and compression sides of the brace respectively meanwhile slight external ovalization at the two chord side walls is observed the amplitude of the external ovalization varies for different chs t y joints but it is small compared to the local bulging and indentation for uncracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending failure typically occurs due to fracture and local buckling of the chord walls on the tensile and the compression side of the brace according to the uk department of energy 1990 fig 11 shows the typical deformation of a chs t y joint under out of plane bending it can be seen that local bulging and indentation occurs at the chord on the tensile and compression sides of the brace the maximum deformation always occurs at the saddle position on the compression side of the brace and it involves both local indentation and overall rotation of the chord 5 2 moment rotation curves by examining all the chs t y joints investigated it is observed that the trend of all moment rotation curves are quite similar and they behave as continuously increasing without showing a peak value the slope of all the curves is moderate after excessive gross yielding occurs and they can be observed from fig 12 a and b for this type of moment rotation curves it is widely accepted that a deformation limit should be used to determine the plastic collapse moments lu et al 1994 zhao 2000 in this study lu s deformation limit lu et al 1994 is adopted for lu s deformation limit when the local deformation of the chord reaches 3 d 0 the applied load is taken as the ultimate static strength which is identical to the plastic collapse load of the uncracked chs t y joints considered in this study in this study local deformation e g local bulging or indentation of 3 d 0 is taken as lu s deformation limit fig 13 illustrates the usage of lu s deformation limit to determine the plastic collapse moment of a chs t y joint under in plane bending displacements of nodes on the top and bottom of the chord red dots shown in fig 10 are extracted for every load increment step the deformation is calculated by calculating the difference between displacements of nodes on the top and bottom of the chord for the case shown in fig 13 the value of lu s deformation limit is 15 mm the maximum deformation values at load increment 28 and 29 are 14 12 mm and 16 83 mm respectively the linear interpolation method is used to determine the in plane plastic collapse moment of the joint for uncracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending it is more difficult to determine the out of plane plastic collapse moment by using lu s deformation limit as the chord rotation is involved fig 14 a and b illustrate the usage of lu s deformation limit to determine the out of plane plastic collapse moment considered in this study it can be seen that the local indentation not only involves displacement u x but also u y at a load increment due to the chord rotation the linear interpolation method is used again to determine the out of plane plastic collapse moment of the uncracked chs joints for all the analyzed uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending the indentation at the chord on the compression side of the brace always reach lu s deformation limit first in addition to lu s deformation limit twice elastic compliance tec shown in fig 15 is also adopted in this study this is because tec was frequently used to determine the plastic collapse load of different chs and rhs joints under axial tensile load by many researchers before laham and burdekin 1997 burdekin 2002 lie et al 2009 2015 in fig 15 the relationship between φ and θ is expressed as 6 tan φ 2 tan θ fig 12 a and b show the applications of twice elastic compliance and lu s deformation limit to determine the plastic collapse moments of two uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending 5 3 plastic collapse moments of uncracked chs t y joints figs 16 and 17 show the comparison of dimensionless plastic collapse moments between the fe prediction in this study and the results obtained from three codes mentioned before it is found that fe prediction using lu s deformation limit concept is consistently higher for both in plane and out of plane bending cases in fig 18 a and b fe prediction is further compared to the experimental data and numerical results reported by other researchers lee and dexter 1994 van der vegte et al 2009 it can be seen that data points of the non dimensional plastic collapse moments obtained in this study mix with the data band reported by other researchers data scatter is reasonable and acceptable from the comparisons shown in figs 16 18 a b it can be concluded that m ci and m co of uncracked chs t y joints determined in this study are accurate and reliable 6 cracked chs t y joints in this section plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are studied firstly plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are determined respectively then the strength reduction factor f ar defined by eq 4 is calculated consequently the effect of various parameters including the crack area β γ and θ and different types of material are investigated finally lower bound f ar equations for cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending are proposed based on the parametric study results 6 1 deformation and stress distribution fig 19 a and b shows the typical deformation and stress distribution at the chord brace intersection zone of the cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending it is found that bulging at the chord on the brace tensile side decreases due to the surface crack crack mouth opening displacement cmod increases as the applied load increases when the applied load is approaching m ci or m co cmod increases rapidly in a nonlinear manner 6 2 plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints fig 20 a and b show typical moment rotation curves of two chs t y joints containing cracks of various sizes under in plane and out of plane bending it is observed that for cracked joints containing a small crack such as a nc 5 the trend of the moment rotation curves are similar to the uncracked joint behaving as continuously increasing however when the crack area is very large such as a nc 25 a peak value may be observed in the moment rotation curve before lu s limit is reached after the peak value is reached the applied loading starts to decrease gradually 6 3 effect of geometrical parameters on far fig 21 a shows the effect of β on f ar for cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending in this study values of f ar plotted using dash line indicate that plastic collapse moments are determined using twice elastic compliance whereas values of f ar plotted in solid line indicate that they are determined using lu s deformation limit it can be seen that the distributions of f ar determined from twice elastic compliance are more regular this is because plastic collapse moments determined using twice elastic compliance are conservative as yielding is confined within a certain region of the chord brace intersection zone when twice elastic compliance limit is reached in contrast distributions of f ar determined using lu s deformation limit are slightly irregular this is mainly because yielding might spread across the entire chord brace intersection zone for cracked joints containing large size crack when lu s deformation limit is reached as mentioned previously for joints containing large size crack such as a nc 25 the moment rotations curves may decrease after excessive gross yielding and thus peak values of moment rotation curves are observed before lu s deformation limit is reached therefore for chs t y joints containing a large crack values of f ar determined from lu s limit are conservative fig 21 b shows the effect of β on f ar for cracked chs t y joint under out of plane bending it can be seen that f ar determined from twice elastic compliance and lu s limit are quite similar when β is less than 0 6 f ar increases linearly as β increases after β exceeds 0 6 f ar turns to decrease fig 22 a shows the effect of γ on f ar for cracked chs t y joint under in plane bending it can be seen that the distribution of f ar determined from twice elastic compliance is more regular due to the same reasons explained previously values of f ar determined from twice elastic compliance may not be safe for cracked joints containing a larger size crack fig 22 b shows the effect of γ on f ar for cracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending it can be seen that the distributions of f ar determined from twice elastic compliance and lu s limit are similar it appears that γ has a small effect on f ar if the crack area is less than 15 after the crack area exceeds 15 f ar increases as γ increases fig 23 a shows the effect of θ on f ar for cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending it can be seen that f ar values of chs y joints θ 60 are consistently higher than chs t joints θ 90 it indicates that for cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending a surface crack has the most severe influence on chs t joints fig 23 b shows the effect of θ on f ar of cracked chs t y joint under out of plane bending it can be seen that θ has a slight effect for this case 6 4 effect of the crack area on far fig 24 a and b show the effect of crack area on the f ar of cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending it can be seen that the crack area has a significant effect on f ar the relationship between the crack area and f ar is almost linear for comparison purpose f ar determined from bs7910 2013 is also plotted in fig 24 a and b it should be bear in mind that this f ar is only valid for chs joints under axial tensile load it can be seen that all f ar data points determined from twice elastic compliance are above the bs7910 2013 standard curve whereas most of f ar data points determined from lu s deformation limit are below it fig 25 a and b show the effect of crack area on the f ar of cracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending the relationship between the crack area and f ar is approximately linear after the crack area exceeds 15 the decrease of f ar becomes slightly slower with the exception of one model β 0 8 γ 10 θ 90 this is unexpected as compared to the in plane bending case it can be seen that the f ar curve in bs7910 2013 crosses the middle of the two data bands of f ar for cracked chs t y joints under out of plane bending 6 5 effect of different material properties in order to investigate the effect of the material properties on the strength reduction factor f ar another two types of steel are used in the fe analyses one is a high strength tmcp steel reported by zerbst et al 2002 named tmcp grade s450 its yield strength is not less than 450 mpa poisson s ratio and young s modulus are 0 3 and 210 gpa respectively the other is api 5l grade b steel its yield strength is not less than 240 mpa poisson s ratio and young s modulus are 0 3 and 205 gpa respectively the stress strain curves used in the fe analyses are shown in fig 26 it can be seen that for the api 5l grade b steel an ideal stress strain curve with no strain hardening effect is used in the fe analyses for each loading case e g in plane and out of plane bending three models with different crack areas e g 5 15 and 25 are investigated these 6 models refer to the lowest data points when a nc is 5 15 and 25 shown in figs 24 and 25 from fig 27 a and b it can be seen that the effect of the material property is not significant by grouping all the data points predicted using three different materials for each loading case a representative lower bound can be proposed 6 6 proposed far equations two linear lines are proposed to represent the lower bound of f ar data points for cracked chs t y joins under in plane and out of plane bending respectively for the in plane bending the lower bound is given as 7 f ar 1 1 35 a c t 0 l w for the out of plane bending the lower bound is given as 8 f ar 1 1 30 a c t 0 l w in figs 28 and 29 all the fe results are plotted together with the corresponding lower bound curve proposed in this study it can be seen that there are some data points fall below the proposed curves when the crack area a nc is 5 these data points are from cracked chs t y joints with γ 10 this is because lu s deformation limit of 3 d 0 can produce a very conservative f ar for chs t y joints with thick chord this is expected because local indentation is difficult to occur for thick chord as certain amount of conservatism already exists in the equations for calculating the plastic collapse moments of uncracked t y joints figs 16 and 17 it is not necessary to propose an over conservative lower bound for the f ar therefore it can be concluded that eqs 7 and 8 can safely be used to predict the plastic collapse moments of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending within the specified ranges considered in this study 7 conclusion based on the parametric study results the following conclusions can be made 1 both twice elastic compliance and lu s deformation limit can be used to determine the plastic collapsed moments of uncracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending plastic collapse moments determined from twice elastic compliance is consistently lower than that determined from lu s deformation limit if the brace is vulnerable to bending failure twice elastic compliance is no longer suitable 2 for cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending the surface crack area a nc has the most significant effect on m ci and consequently on f ar when a nc reaches 25 m ci can decrease up to 35 1 other parameters β γ and θ have only a slight influence on the f ar of cracked chs t y joints under in plane bending 3 the crack area also has the most significant influence on m co of cracked chs t y joints when a nc reaches 25 m co can decrease up to 33 6 other parameters β γ and θ have negligible influence on the f ar 4 material properties namely the stress strain data used in this study has no significant effect on the strength reduction factor f ar of cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending 5 based on all the fe results two strength reduction factor f ar equations are proposed for cracked chs t y joints under in plane and out of plane bending respectively these equations are towards the lower bound therefore they can be safely used to predict the m ci and m co of cracked chs t y joints in conjunction with the corresponding characteristic strength of the uncracked chs t y joints within the specified ranges considered in this study
